Tried every one of my six systems, tried different USB-A to USB-c (2.0 and 3.0) cables, tried different ports, updated my Pixel OS, am in Developer Mode, deleted Storage and Media caches and data - nothing changes.\nI've tried to download the latest Pixel 2 drivers but everything is Zipped and when I unZip the packet there's no executable or seemingly anything I can use to point the :Unknown USB Device\" in Device Manager to an updated driver.\nAnyone have any new ideas?\nThanks for looking and any advice you might have.\nTom",

Issue I have is with gestures.  \n\nPrior to gestures, tapping the Home button would minimize an open app and return you to the Home screen (whichever Home screen was last open, primary or one of the secondaries).  Tapping it again would take you to your Primary Home screen.  \n\nUsing gestures, swiping up from the bottom of the screen with an app open returns you to whichever Home screen was open, but I haven't found a way to return to my Primary Home screen without having to manually swipe through the pages to get there.  Swiping up from the bottom of the screen without an app open just opens the app drawer, or, if you do it right, gets you to the list of open/recent apps (and that gesture is a whole 'nother issue and topic!)\n\nAm I missing something or does anyone have a workaround?",

This new replacement they gave me, had no accidents and I have taken very good care of it. I am aware that if there are problems within the 90 days, there is no fee for any defects etc. But since it has been over the 90 days, my options are to pay again a service fee of $225 CAD, or go to ibreakufix store to have it diagnosed, the Assurant support person said. I even have preferred care, which was an additional $200 and if I get charged again for a service fee, then this phone has costed me $2k. At this point I could have gotten a better phone from a different carrier. I even found many threads on reddit about people reporting the swollen batteries, shouldn't these be recalled since many users are reporting this? Is there anyone that can help me? I already called customer support (Assurant), they literally just gave me generic responses, when this clearly is a manufacturer defect.

Anyway, back to topic, I carefully removed the SIM card (network provider card) from the Pixel 5, and inserted it on my Apple device. \n\nInstead of returning the Pixel 5, I decided to keep it to continue listening to the device stored music (MP3, WAV, Flacs, etc)  when I connect it to my Type-C AUX cable, the music and sounds continue to come out of the device speakers.This issue wasn't present at all 2 minutes ago when it had the network SIM card? could there be an issue with Google Assistant now that is doesn't have LTE network connection? Regardless, I've tried to play music while on home WiFi but no response. What could have happened in the OS that now it doesn't recognize it? Note: All my music is stored locally and it does plays only on the Pixel 5 speakers as mentioned earlier.\n\nI cleaned the port carefully, which wasn't required, the device is new & there was absolutely nothing in the port that wasn't already cleaned. \n\nI also bought a new Type-C Aux cable certified for the Pixel 5, tested it and no results what so ever, it's like it's invisible, but get this, it DOES recognize charging and also it DOES recognize any PC connected to it, I could even plug that same port to a Chromebook to transfer files successfully, so it's not like it isn't working. \n\nAnd it's not the first time that Google Assistance Microphone options interrupt or cause issues with music playback, I previously owned a Pixel 4 that was getting a lot of issues with the Google Assistance interfering with audio playback through the port. It's ridiculous. Please help :'(",

I tried to hold the power button down for 30 seconds. I also tried to hold the power+ volume button down for another 30 seconds.

Always used an Otterbox casing.\n\nI contacted the online seller i.e. Clevertronic and they said ask Google.\nI believe I must have some Warranty since this damage is within a year.\n\nCan someone please help me out?

Since I had tried a bunch of other stuff before adding the new folder, I was going to do some regression testing to confirm exactly where all the files needed to be, but got sidetracked.\n\nHope this is helpful.

Finally, after a few weeks, it got to the point where the camera failed to load at all.\n\n I contacted support and did all the normal tricks like try a different app, clear cache, uninstall updates, wipe phone none of these things worked. \n\nThe only workaround I found was to wave a small neodymium magnet near the camera while opening the app. This would allow the camera to open.  Once the app was open you need to move the magnet away from the phone or the focus would go all wobbly. \n\nAfter a few more weeks of this, I found it really annoying to have to remember to carry a magnet around in my pocket. I logged a new call with google and they instructed me to RMA the device. about a week and a bit later I received a refurbished phone from google (which was actually pretty nice since the phone was out of warranty by about a month.) \n\nNow this phone was way behind in patches. So as a test I would update and then test the camera and update again and test the camera (all previous apps were loaded) \n\nQP1A.191005.007a1 OK Tested 6 times\nQP1A.191105.004 OK Tested 6 times\nQQ1A.191205.008 OK Tested 6 times\nQQ2A.200305.002 OK Tested 6 times\n\nI actually don't think this is a software update issue. I believe the actuator arm of the camera wears out after about 2 years of heavy use.  I use my camera daily since it's the one I have on me. \n\nI did previously post the logcats where it said the actuator arm failed but the post has since been deleted by someone else. \n\nSo for anyone else out there with a similar pixel 2 camera issue. have you logged it with google?",

So I unlocked my phone that way, and went to settings to try to reset the pattern or something. Of course, I can only do that by using the pattern itself. It didn't work there either. There are no problems with my screen or anything at all, my phone just no longer recognizes the pattern. Is there anything I can do? I haven't tried rebooting it because I'm worried that I'll end up permanently locked out when I'm required to input the pattern. I did just make sure everything on it is backed up, so if I need to, I could completely reset it, but that's honestly such a pain, and really, this could happen again anyway, so I'd like to understand what in the world is going on here and know an easier way to fix this.

    "title": "Pixel 3a Bluetooth Audio Problem With Car",
    "content": "My Pixel 3a will stop playing audio in my two Mazda cars with Google Play Music if I leave the car and return in greater than 4 hours, possibly less. It has consistently failed to play audio under those circumstances even though everything works fine if I leave the car for shorter periods of time. The music will then pick up right where it left off from with audio. With longer periods of time the track will show but with no sound. I can change the track on the car system and the phone will reflect the change but again with no sound. I can pause the music and that will also be communicated to the phone as well or vice versa. In other words the phone and the car are connected via bluetooth for everything but audio. This didn't occur with my older Samsung S7 Edge over a five year period with one of my Mazda cars and a 3 year period with another one.\n\nIf I restart the phone the audio will come back. If I force stop the bluetooth system app and hit play again the audio will start but will have drop outs and be of lower quality until I stop and restart bluetooth again. Clearing the cache and data from the music app does not fix the audio.\n\nI have discussed this with Google support and am running the Pixel 3a in safe mode and will check tomorrow to see it the audio works when I restart my car. This might indicate a 3rd party app may be responsible for the problem. Beyond that, I would have to do a factory reset again and have diagnostic work done at an Ifixit store (hardware?).\n\nI am not confident that Mazda would be of much help and doubt the cars are a problem based on my past history with my Samsung phone. I have spent a lot of time isolating this problem and determining the \"fix\" (restart or force stop bluetooth). I have also rebooted the firmware in both cars and could possibly call Mazda and also check for firmware updates for my cars but this as well as using the older Samsung phone are unlikely or impractical solutions as I don't want to keep using an older phone. By the way, I have also unpaired and re paired both cars with the Pixel 3a.\n\nI know having a Pixel 3a and the Mazda cars narrows my chance of someone else having the same problem with the same equipment. I'm hoping someone else has also experienced this problem with either the same or another combination of equipment. So far, I have not found anyone else on this forum with the same problem.",

    "content": "I recently purchased a Pixel 3 XL and after a few months of good usage I began having a \"Bluetooth keeps stopping\" message. Thinking it was just something introduced by some app I had downloaded, or file that I had put on my phone I factory reset my phone. Then I factory flashed my phone to the most recent factory image. Then I flashed my phone to the very first factory image that was available for the the Pixel 3 XL, the September 2018 image. The error continues to come back. I can't believe this is a hardware problem, it can be temporarily solved by restarting the phone, and it is completely random, sometimes happening constantly every 5 seconds, and sometimes not happening for days at a time. I don't believe it's a loose connection in the phone, it wouldn't be fixed by restarts and it wouldn't be so frustratingly random. I've been reading forum post after forum post of people with this problem. I've only searched specifically for people with Pixel 3's but it seems to be happening with other Pixels and maybe even with with phones from other manufacturers as well. \n\nThis issue is causing people's otherwise perfectly functional phones to be useless. When the bluetooth keeps stopping it also takes the wifi and mobile network down with it. I've missed important text messages and phone calls.\n\nGoogle won't warranty my phone because it's past the warranty period, even though I called them previously seeking help about this error before my warranty had expired.\n\nSomeone please look into this and figure it out. It seems to me that it the error was introduced after an Android update, personally I think the Android 10 update caused it, as that seems to coincide with when it started happening to me and when many other people are saying it started happening. Some reports of the error do contradict this though, saying it happened before that. All of these links are about the error from a cursory 5 minute google search. I imagine searching for much longer you could find so many more.\n\nhttps://forum.xda-developers.com/pixel-3-xl/help/constant-bluetooth-stopping-t4035007\nhttps://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/21889103?hl=en\nhttps://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/1886970?hl=en\nhttps://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/2013979?hl=en\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/dbkn5r/bluetooth_keeps_stopping/\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/dh0fsm/wifi_bluetooth_keeps_stopping_on_pixel_3_xl/\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/bifu3h/google_pixel_3_xl_bluetooth_crash_disabled_wifi/\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/dj1cck/why_does_google_refuse_to_fix_bluetooth_keeps/\nhttps://forum.xda-developers.com/pixel-3-xl/help/bluetooth-stopping-t4003431\nhttps://forum.xda-developers.com/pixel/help/bluetooth-stopping-factory-reset-t3926052\nhttps://forum.xda-developers.com/pixel-3-xl/help/factory-reset-losing-internal-storage-t3937651\n\nSomeone at Google needs to step up and make sure this gets fixed. This is ridiculous. It's either a Pixel problem, or an Android problem (which Google basically controls as well), either way people's $1000 flagship phones are paperweights once this problem starts happening to them.",

Suddenly on 22 March 2020, when I turned on my Pixel, its screen kept on and no response at all whenever I tried to press it. Then, I took off the SIM card from the tray and restarting the phone.\n\nSince that time, although I have already inserted my XL SIM Card to the tray as usual, my phone display always says \"No SIM Card, Emergency Calls Only\". On the SIM Status, it is said Not Available. I tried to insert the other SIM Card from the other Indonesian networking provider called Telkomsel, but the result is still the same, the SIM Status is Not Available. I reported to my carrier (XL Center). They replaced the old SIM card to the new one. I tried again and the result is still same.\n\nI inserted both of the SIM Card (XL and Telkomsel) to another phones and they work well.

Please note that before I updated to Android 10, this worked just fine with the exact same custom tones.\nPixel 3, Android 10, latest security/Play patches, all apps up to date\n\nI already know how to make and add my own ringtones and notification tones, have been doing it on every Android phone I've ever owned going back to my Moto Droid. Adding custom ringtones works fine, but I cannot change a single notification tone (Messages, GMail, etc.) away from the default; even the builtin sounds don't work, only the single default one (which is Popcorn on my phone).\n\nI can create and add custom notification tones to the phone itself, and they even show up under \"My Sounds\" when going to change the tone, but when I tap on the new sound, nothing plays (should play a preview of the tone). Moreover, if select any of the builtin Google tones, same result: no sound. If I tap back to the default, it plays the preview sound. If I leave it set to my custom sound (or another builtin that isn't the default), I simply get nothing when that particular notification comes in. I tested this in Messages, GMail, Outlook, and Discord, so it is also not specific to only GApps.\n\nIt seems like the issue is with the new Notification system in Android 10.\n\nWhat I've already tried:\nFactory reset, whereby I immediately tested this before restoring anything, so none of my apps can possibly be causing this. This should have fixed if it was an issue I caused; this points me towards Android 10 itself as the culprit\nPrior to my factory reset, I tried the following:\nI've tried .mp3, .ogg, .flac, and .m4a formats for the custom tones, all the same result\nI cleared all cache/data of every app I could think of (Messages, GMail, Sounds, etc.)\n\nAny help is greatly appreciated....having custom notification sounds for the different apps has always been one of my favorite things about Android, and now that every app has the same notification sound...ugh.",

So the only thing that changes are software 'updates' on the Pixel.\n\nAnd the whole point of a Pixel, is that you get the updates faster, which end up killing Something each time.\n\nAnd then I restarted the Pixel, seemed like a good idea?  NOT\n\nMy Call Screening stopped working AGAIN after the restart.  No more call screening.  Worked fine while trying to debug the bluetooth issue (but, Call Screening REGULARLY just disappears).\n\nWith the Pixel, something it going to just stop working every day, it's the worst phone I've ever owned, and I have several iPhones, which can be problematic, but their BASIC FEATURES work.  I can use the iPhone as a Phone.\n\nI can't do that with the Pixel.\n\nTried forgetting and re-pairing,   Tried turning Bluetooth off and on.\n\nPixel is the perfect phone to buy if you DON'T HAVE A LIFE and want something to distract you from the C19-end-of-the-world crisis.\n\nBut, as a phone, the very worst money I've ever spent.",

Later on there happened an accident causing a cracked screen.  When I contacted Google help, the staff told me that the damage protection warranty is invalid because - the google account used to activate Project Fi phone service is different from the google account used to purchasing the phone.  \n\nFor some reason, I did use a different google account when activating the phone service.  However, I can prove that I'm the owner of both google accounts and the Pixel 3a belongs to me all the time.  \n\nI communicated with Google help staffs for quite a few rounds via online chat as well as email without convincing them that the damage protection warranty should be valid and should go with the device, not the google account.  I have two main points - 1. I don't know that the damage protection is linked to the purchase google account, not the device. 2. when the phone is activated using another account, I have no idea (and receive no warning or notification) that it will invalidate the damage protection.\n\nI'd like to hear from you with your comments/opinions about what happens here - should my Pixel 3a keep its damage protection warranty even if the activation account is different from the purchase account?\n\nThank you all!",

I connect to the device with my Pixel 1 in order to manage it via SSH. For maybe the past couple months, my Google Pixel running Android 9 shows the below behavior (phone gets a IP address via DHCP yet can't ping the connected hotspot's IP, 192.168.43.1). Another older Android phone (as well as my laptop), works fine as a client for the same hotspot.\n\nTemporary workaround, I have to:\n==========================================\n'Forget' the development device's access point\nRe-connect (re-typing password) to the access point\nWait several seconds until the ..Stay connected?` message appears and tap \"Yes\"\n\nSymptoms; Wi-Fi shows connected but:\n==========================================\nCan't SSH to the development device from the Pixel (using JuiceSSH)\nPhone has an IP yet can't ping the development device (192.168.43.1)\nPhone stays connected to the hotspot but status is:\n              Wi-Fi has no internet access\n      Tap for options\n\n           ..and the below status appears in the Android swipe-down menu:\n\n              This network has no internet access. Stay connected?\n\n           If you tap \"Yes\" and _also_ check the box:\n\n              Don't ask again for this network\n\n           ..it's not clear what this actually does, if anything. A short time later, the hotspot is back to the same broken state. Additionally, the Stay connected?` option is not persistent (disappears when it feels like it) in the Android drop-down drawer.\nSome time after using the temporary workaround, the hotspot is back to the same broken state\n\nI can't imagine this is not a bug. What use-case is there to stay connected to an access point AND deny IP connectivity because there's no public internet access? If there's a health check being performed that fails and causes this, what is the check? HTTP GET to a Google server; ping to a DNS IP etc?\n\nEdit: I ran a packet capture on the dev hotspot and saw DNS requests to connectivtycheck.gstatic.com which lead me to the below post. I tried the below steps and it is working currently (could be too soon to tell).\n  https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/1265464?msgid=1265906\n  Settings > Network & Internet > Wi-Fi > select the \"Settings\" gear icon next to the name of your home network > Advanced > Metered > Treat as Unmetered\n\nMy note about this being a bug is still relevant, to me. If it's going to behave this way, it should describe \"Metered connection\" and hint what that means in one of those pop-ups. I shouldn't have to run packet captures to solve a problem like this.",

I've experienced a bunch of network issues that I have not yet been able to rectify. This is my second attempt at asking for help. I'm speculating i may have some ignorance to the best way to utilize the Pixel on Tmobile. I have included a summery of the issue, as well as my T-Mobile debugging to date below:\n\nSummary of issue(s): \n1. I don't seem to have to have reliable data/cellular connectivity (even after adding a new APN configuration per TMObile's recommendation) in places i would expect it; Denver CO, Salida CO, etc. \n2. I do not have the option to configure Wifi calling. How can I get access to wifi calling on the Pixel 4a 5G. Both google and TMobile documentation references selections that are not available in my OS.\n\nTMobile service feedback: A call into TMobile support sent me to an APN configuration page, to build a custom network configuration. It is basically identical to the default Tmobile APN that came native. I still do not seem to pull 5g in the city. I often see an H+ next to the network icon top right. TMobile also mentioned that wifi calling is only supported if the Pixel is bought from Tmobile? Am i missing firmware? Do i need to buy the hardware from Tmobile? \n\nDeBug logic: My brother owns a 4a on Tmobile and does have access to Wifi calling. Both Google and TMobile say Wifi calling is obtainable on their websites, but i do not have any configuration options in my current Android OS.\n\nPossible remedies: Do i need a new SIM card? Do I need to buy the hardware direct from TMobile (this is what i was told to obtain the Wifi calling feature). Do I have a defective Pixel?\n\nMany thanks in advance! I really hope i can resolve these inconveniences on the most expensive phone i've ever bought. And quelle any ignorance I may have, or defects the device may have.",

The battery level does not seem to be a factor as it has happened minutes off the charger at 100% and when below 20%.

Until today, when the phone would power off, it would not turn on unless charging, but that is no longer the case.

My battery statistics are saying that it has been 65 days since being at 100% but that's not true as I charged to full last night. The battery also seems to be draining abnormally fast despite no apps reporting high usage.\n\nI intend to do a factory reset this weekend as I have run out of options.

We've had this phone for 2 weeks. \n\n-On 7/29/20 the phone stopped charging when plugged into the Pixel USB C charger that came with the original pixel 3a phone. \n\nHere is what I have done so far: \n1. Restart the phone. No help. The phone still does not recognize that it is plugged in. \n\n2. Boot to safe mode. No help. The phone still does not recognize that it is plugged in.\n 3. Tried my pixel charger for the pixel 4xl. No help. The phone still does not recognize that it is plugged in. \n\n4. Turned off the phone and plugged it in to the charger. The phone charges just fine until I turn the phone back on. Then the phone no longer recognizes that it is plugged in. \n\n5. I read many forum postings that show similar issues. Tried to charge with a USB C to USB A cable. The phone charges slowly. This is not an acceptable solution. \n\n6. Turned on developer mode and checked \"usb preferences settings\". It is already set to \"this device\" as is suggested in several forums. This has not fixed the issue. \n\n7. Today the phone is now recognizing that it is plugged in when I put the cable in to charge with the pixel charger. It will cycle between charging and not charging every 1.5 seconds for about 1 minute. Then sometimes it starts to charge and sometimes it stops recognizing that it is plugged in. \n\nFrom this basic troubleshooting, I do not believe the problem is hardware since it will charge slowly via a USB C to USB A cable. It is definitely not the charger since both the charger that came with the Pixel 3a and my Pixel 4xl work on my 4xl without any trouble. I do not believe it is an app since safe mode did not help. \n\nI would rather not do another warranty phone since that was a disaster the first time (FedEx delivered my package to the wrong address and it took 6 hours and 2 weeks to resolve). 1:1 support seems to be a waste of time based on my experience.

After about 48 hours on the charger, it turned on. Everything worked fine. \n\nA few weeks after the phone died and turned back on, the phone shut down again, but this time I was able to power it back on after a few minutes of charging, which brought it back up to about 75% (oddly swift). Shortly after powering up the phone and pulling it from the charger, I watched as the percentage dropped from 75% to 1% in only a few seconds. \n\nAfter some charging and use, I realized that the battery itself is actually fine. The phone remains functional through my regular use, and for about as long as it always did, before the percentage drop issue. \n\nI've done all of the troubleshooting steps, including an FDR. I've noticed that the percentage begins it's cascade any time I receive an in-bound notification. I tampered with notifications a bit, including turning off notifications entirely. I had my lady send me a few messages, and even when I've got notifications off, the percentage drops.  \n\nI'm happy the phone is still functional. However, it's frustrating that I never actually have an accurate reflection of the battery life. I've tried some battery apps, and even searched through apps and services to make sure nothing fishy is on the phone. \n\nAny advice or information would totally be helpful, and appreciated. \n\nThank you!",

The phone will periodically not charge, I called google about this when it was still under warranty and got the run around so I said F it, I'll just deal with it.  A subsequent update and all was well for several months, hell probably a year.  However, this latest version of Android has brought a host of issues to my phone, most of which have been fixable.  Most of my settings were lost for example, google assistant no longer recognizes my voice, my news feed and Gmail had to be setup again.  \n\nHowever, the larger problem is with charging.  If I charge the unit with the google included chargers it does not work.  The chargers aren't the problem, my wife's Pixel charges just fine.  Mine was charging until the update in June (and everything went wonky).  I can't charge when using USBC to USBC the phone just shuts off.  When using USBA to USBC it works some of the time but will periodically shut the phone down, I can't figure out the trigger on that one.  For example it shut down Monday overnight and again last night, but has worked well a half dozen times in between.  \n\nOn the car charger it will usually charge but I have to go through a restart before it will charge.  The restart happens within a minute or two of plugging the phone in.  \n\nThis appears to be a very common problem but the threads appear to be locked for discussion.  I'm running out of ideas and hoping someone here has a suggestion that I've overlooked?  \n\nSo far I've tried safe mode which still has the issue, I've put no new apps on my phone and as such don't believe this is a third party app issue.  This appears to be a google problem, especially given the high volume of issues and complaints I've found.  \n\nTips/Tricks would be nice if anyone has them.

In fact, I think the Verizon SIM in my phone has been there since both the SIM and phone were brand new in December 2017, and I haven't removed it.\n\nI have been having this issue for months, since I think middle of November 2019. Pixel 2 on Verizon. All suggested and patches up to date always. No recent updates have fixed the issue.\n\nSometimes I can use the phone for days without any issue, other times it will only last an hour or less before it stops recognizing the Sim card. Sometimes toggling airplane mode fixes the issue, sometimes it doesn't. \n\nI found another post where an engineer recommended entering *#*#794824746#*# into the dialer. This switches between physical SIM and eSIM. So I have to enter it once, wait for the pop-up that eSIM is enabled, then enter it again, wait for the pop-up that the physical SIM is enabled, then wait for my physical SIM to be recognized. This usually works, but occasionally will not work.\n\nIt seems that the issue happens more frequently after a restart, which is unfortunate because sometimes I need to restart to fix the issue.\n\nHow is such a core functionality broken, after 2 years of no issues prior? How has this not been fixed in 3 or 4 patches? I see some bug tracker for a similar issue, but where the user had Google Fi and Verizon at the same time, and people are reporting that the issue is no longer present. Unfortunately I'm still having my issue.\n\nI hope this post will get the right attention and this issue can actually be fixed.

I have tried all the usual troubleshooting; forced re-start, reset all WiFi/Network/Bluetooth setting, restarting modem/router, system/security updates, speed test (350 down, 48 up) etc. If I turn WiFi off, I have no problems at all. In fact, everything works perfectly on other WiFi's, just not my home WiFI. I have dual band, I have tried both 2.5 and 5 channels with no difference. The Wifi works fine on my other devices, such as home computer, tablets, and TVs. I can't seem to find any answer. Interestingly, I pulled out my original Google Pixel and it has the same issue with latency around 3rd party apps as our 3A's? Could it be the Pixel OS and compatibility issues with my modem/router?

This is very annoying as this switch will refresh any page i'm viewing while in chrome.   I was in the middle of typing something out on a web page and battery saver kicked on and it refreshed my page, completely erasing everything i typed.   I don't know how it effects other apps, but i don't want it to decide to turn on dark mode without my approval.  I have found nothing in the battery saver settings about disabling this.

    "content": "I couldn't figure out how to allow my Pixel 4a 5G to transfer files from my pc. Every time I tried it came up with an error. However, I solved this problem after much searching - the issue is that Google has file transfer via usb turned off by default. Why they do this is anyone's guess, but it was a pain in the ass to figure out so I'm posting this here to let others know how I fixed it. You have to go into Settings, type USB Preferences, and then plug your device in and click \"File Transfer / Android Auto.\" That will do it - if you need to see it, this site has a demonstration: https://deviceguides.vodafone.co.uk/google/pixel-4a-5g-android-11-0/connectivity/transfer-files-between-computer-and-phone/",

The case has been removed, a different SIM Card was purchased.\nEven when changing the connection to 3G, it changes from HSPA - to 3G every 10-15 seconds.

    "title": "How do I contact Google for technical support for my Pixel XL.Appreciate your help.",
    "content": "Recently, I purchased a used pixel XL, that was officially certified refurbished. When installing and personalizing my pixel XL via my carrier, there was a problem getting the MMS downloads in my messages. When I clicked the blue icon with a downward arrow  to access a download, it would act as though it was 'working on retrieving' it (actively circling w/I icon) and failed to retrieve the download. The active circling within the icon continued endlessly without any results. I literally had to close page to get it to stop. My carrier said that the SMS is working properly but whenever we try to download MMS it was unsuccessful. I must have called five different times to get help on how to correct the problem and no one could figure out how to make it work. My previous phone, Samsung Galaxy 7 edge, was stolen so I had no way of transferring my contacts, photos, etc from that phone on to my pixel XL. Fortunately I had backed up everything onto Google so I could restore all my info in case my Galaxy 7 edge was ever lost or stolen. When it came to retrieving all that info, some of it was not retrieved. I originally had 173 + contacts and only about 70 we're actually retrieved. Things just got more screwed up from there. For some reason they had me sync my partners contacts in with mine (that's a long story) but basically what happened is all of his contacts were deleted, I guess during the syncing, and that's when I lost over a hundred of my contacts as well. So here I sit after 5 calls for technical support from my carrier and I am left with a partial list of my contacts, my partner's contacts are nowhere to be found along with the rest of my contacts and it's still can't download MMS messages. My phone still processes SMS texting in message without any problems. Finally the last few people I spoke to told me I needed to contact Google to correct the problem. I don't know how to contact Google, technical support and I'm at the point that I'm overthinking everything and very little makes any sense right now. I think that's called burnout and I've only had this phone a week.\nI'm hoping to at least get a phone number for Google technical support. Ideally there might be a miracle worker out there who can guide me through the process of locating the problem correcting those things that need fixin and retrieving all of the lost contacts not to mention photos, etc plus a large amount of journaling & lots of otther notes. \nCan anyone out there help out...I'd be grateful for just a Google # & delighted if they could guide me in fixing anything. I was so excited to get a Pixel.\nI've got the time and patience to try this again with someone out there in 'answer land'.\nThanks for reading my hugely lengthy message. \u270c\ufe0f",

Drain is normal and pretty low for most of the apps, Instagram has normal drain while being in the app, but after exiting and closing, it persistently uses battery. I used Instagram for 40 minutes since yesterday, 8% in the app. I checked today, and I noticed that it used 34%, even though I didn't use it since yesterday. This was at 4:00 pm. At 8:00 PM, I hadn't open instagram and it jumped to 37% usage from the battery, showing that it was used for 2 hours and 50 minutes in the background. I force stop the app and background restrict it and still used the battery to 39% consumption of battery. I forgot to screenshot before deleting it, but those are roughly the stats since yesterday. Why is it using so much battery in the background and why does it use battery in the background even if I restrict and force stop it? How can i resolve it? I've deleted the data, clear cache, reinstall, same result. I could get 3 days on a charge, but this is screwing me over. I'm thinking of using the web version in the mean time..... Please help!

    "content": "I know there have been a number of reports of issues with Pixel wireless charging or maybe issues with Android 11, in general. But, I haven't seen a report of my specific symptoms so I thought I'd add them.\n\nA lot of the time wireless charging seems to work well on the multiple Qi chargers I have around the house. All support Qi EPP at up to 15W with a 25W QC adapter, or \"12-13W\" with the QC 2.0 adapter curiously supplied with the charger.\n\nOccasionally though, for seemingly no good reason charging will rapidly grind to a halt, for example saying that the phone is at x% (50, 60, 80, 90 - it doesn't seem specific to a particular battery level), with an estimated many, many hours to completion eg. 13 hours. Even rebooting the phone or moving it to another charger does not seem to fix it. The back of the phone in this situation is kinda warm, so maybe it has thermally throttled. But, there is no good reason why this would have happened - the phone is not being heavily used at the time, it is not in a hot location, really nothing is different to the other times when charging works perfectly.\n\nUsing a tool to look at the battery the charging power has dropped to 0.2-0.5W, which explains the long charging time! The battery temperature is shown at about 38C. I'm unaware of what temperature thermal throttling should occur.\n\nSo, it seems, at times the Pixel 5 (and other Android 11 phones?) seems to just about shut down wireless charging, even in circumstances of use and location, when this should not be necessary. It may possibly be caused by overheating. I guess this could be caused by one or more processors being stuck in a high power state.\n\nHopefully, this may help in identifying the issue.",

I am tax exempt was told I would have to order first then send in tax info and it would be applied to account. Well I'm still being charged taxes after sending tax info 5+times. All I've gotten for replies is that it's being looked into and being brought to a higher team. This is the 17th reply I got saying this \"I just wanted to let your know that as of this time we are still working on your case and waiting for an update from our higher team. We don't have any turnaround time yet but rest assure that I'll get back to you as soon as possible once I receive an update from them.\"\n\nNow onto another issue with no support help. When I purchased the phone I also went with the insurance, it is $7 a month. Well thankfully I did, a few days ago I dropped my phone out of my pocket, fell ~3ft with phone case and all broke the corner of the screen. So I do all the links from fi to find out how to get repaired, it's like a freaking puzzle\\maze of links to finally get to help. It states that screen repair is $49 the problem is they don't have a way to do it. The first person I talked to said I would be sent a refurbished then my next bill I would be charged $99?? Confused I said that it's says on the insurance page a screen repair is $49. I guess either because fi service sucks or I was hung up on contact ended after that.\nNow I have been trying to go through support using email all I get is this,  \"I completely understand your concern about the issue. Upon checking with your ZIP code, we could see that there are stores available nearby your location. In this case, I'd suggest you to please contact the manufacturer so that they can help you with the available repair options or else, if you wish to replace the device under device protection plan, please reply to this email so that we can proceed further.\" Over 10x now but that's not all I have gotten this reply 10+times also, \"I completely understand your concern about the issue.

According to the internet forums and my personal experience so far, this feature is broken in most of the warranty replacement phones shipped by Google. Nobody but Google can repair it. Because of its obscurity and technical nature, few support personnel are understanding or sympathetic. I think there may be some kind of bureaucratic disconnect that is preventing this issue from being addressed, or Google has decided the number of affected users is too small to be worth the resources needed to fix the flaw in their refurbishment process. The name of the feature is \"unlockable bootloader\".\n\nGoogle has shipped me 2 broken phones so far in their attempt to remedy an unrelated defect in my original Pixel 2. I just finished the phone call to have the second replacement exchanged for a third replacement. Both times the support technician has in the end told me that there's nothing they are allowed to do for me other than fill out an order form for another refurbished phone and leave a comment in the order for the fulfillment team to read. Requesting an unlockable bootloader in the comment didn't work the first time and, based on the forum posts I've seen, I have my doubts that it will ever change anything.\n\nI don't know what else to do, so I intend to keep sending them in for a replacement until I receive one that isn't broken.\n\nFor community reference, I can see on the RMA information that the refurbishment is being handled by an external company, \"Cynergy\". A quick web search shows that this is probably their website: http://www.cynergyus.com/. Anyone else interested in devices with unlockable bootloaders should probably be wary of manufacturers that partner with Cynergy.\n\nTechnical log:\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\nC:\\Program Files (x86)\\Android\\android-sdk\\platform-tools>fastboot flashing get_unlock_ability\n                                                   (bootloader) get_unlock_ability: 1\nOKAY [  0.001s]\nFinished. Total time: 0.003s\n\nC:\\Program Files (x86)\\Android\\android-sdk\\platform-tools>fastboot flashing unlock\n                                                   FAILED (remote: 'Flashing Unlock is not allowed\n')\nfastboot: error: Command failed\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1. Acquire a refurbished Google Pixel 2. (GA00126-US-RA)\n\n2. Power it on without inserting a SIM card and skip everything in the initial setup.\n\n3. Unlock the secret \"Developer options\" by tapping 7 times on \"Build number\" in the \"About phone\" settings page.\n\n4. Enter the \"System\" settings page, enter the \"Developer options\" sub-page, and find the \"OEM unlocking\" setting near the top.\n\n5. Because OEM unlocking is greyed out and says \"Connect to the internet or contact your carrier\", connect the phone to a Wi-Fi. (Set the connection to \"metered\" while adding the Wi-Fi to prevent it from wastefully downloading updates.)\n\n6. After some time, reopen developer options and enable OEM unlocking. (Note: I have found that the setting of this slider and the state of get_unlock_ability persists across factory resets. At this step after doing a factory reset, you will find the slider is already enabled from the last time. The setting being greyed out or not does not affect get_unlock_ability.)\n\n7. Completely shut down the device by holding the power button for a few seconds and selecting \"Power off\".\n\nhttps://source.android.com/setup/build/running#booting-into-fastboot-mode\n\n8. Enter fastboot mode: \"Press and hold Volume Down, then press and hold Power.\" Let go of the power button once the phone vibrates but keep holding the volume button. (If you continue holding the power button you will accidentally trigger the \"Start\" command from the fastboot menu.)\n\n9. Connect the device to a PC with \"Android SDK\" and \"Google USB Driver\" installed.\n\n10. Open Command Prompt on the PC.\n\n11. Run a command to navigate to the SDK platform tools folder: cd /d \"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Android\\android-sdk\\platform-tools\"\n\n12. Run the command to verify that you have enabled OEM unlocking: fastboot flashing get_unlock_ability\n\nCommand response should be: (bootloader) get_unlock_ability: 1\nIf it responds \"get_unlock_ability: 0\" then OEM unlocking was not enabled properly at step 6.\n\n13. Run the command to unlock the bootloader: fastboot flashing unlock\n\nInstead of initiating the bootloader unlock process on the phone screen, command response is: FAILED (remote: 'Flashing Unlock is not allowed')\n\nIf you boot back to the normal system at this point, you will find the \"OEM unlocking\" slider is greyed out again no matter what the internet state is. get_unlock_ability is still 1. It can only be un-greyed by doing a factory reset and starting over from step 1, but you will find at step 6 that it is already enabled. Disabling, rebooting, and enabling again does not help.\n\n\nFurther reading:\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRMA phone from Google is not unlocking the bootloader\nhttps://forum.xda-developers.com/pixel-2/help/rma-phone-google-unlocking-bootloader-t3937931\n\nOEM Unlocking Grayed out on non-VZW Pixel 2.\nhttps://forum.xda-developers.com/pixel-2/help/oem-unlocking-grayed-vzw-pixel-2-t3776763\n\nPSA: RMA refurbished Pixel 2's can NOT be bootloader unlocked.\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/9xcdle/psa_rma_refurbished_pixel_2s_can_not_be/\n\nCannot unlock Pixel 2 bootloader\nhttps://issuetracker.google.com/issues/73217322\n\nWeb Search: \"get_unlock_ability: 1\" \"Flashing Unlock is not allowed\"\nhttps://www.google.com/search?q=\"get_unlock_ability%3A+1\"+\"Flashing+Unlock+is+not+allowed\"\n\n(Unrelated bug: This message board does not support links ending in a quote mark, even if you manually set the link target in the editor.)",

I thought that by interacting with the notifications on the lock screen it would pause the timer. This does not seem to be the case, I would be swiping down on a banner to read more about the notification but while my finger is still in contact with the screen, it would go black within 10 seconds. \n\nSome have advised to just unlock the phone to read the notification, why would I do this, when my intent was just to read the notification, acknowledge what it is and lock the phone. \n\nOn the iphone, when a notification comes in, i can interact with it, look at it and as long as my finger is on the lock screen, it will not timeout whatsoever. Is there a setting I can turn on that lets me do this as well? Or is the pixel hardcoded to always turn off after a set amount of time on the lock screen?",

Without Internet service, I can't set up my Google Pixel Replacement, so this is feedback related to the product, for a broad portion of people in the USA, who have no WIFI & Internet service is to expensive!  I have consistently been using mobile computers for media content creation, using hot spots, home wifi, without a data plan, which they can be really expensive!  Can Google make a stand alone Pixel, where we don't need to be signed in to an account, yet we can still used the mobile computer! I've used Samsung before, & I would be able to turn on a Samsung Galaxy immediately, & use it without signing in to an account!  I started panicing a bit, thinking 5 G meant taking away our cable & all we would have is WIFI service, & then I would not be able to use my Google Pixel at all!!   If I had no Google Account, previous to receiving my Google Pixel, I can't use it anyway for pictures, video, journaling & note taking!  Can Google make a Google Single Pixel,  which means the computer can be used, without an account & you don't need to be signed in to someone else's account to use the Google Single Pixel!? You just turn it on & use it, then sign in to your Google Account if you have one!   \n\nIdeally, I still wish we had free internet so everyone can use the Internet due to the folks on fixed incomes as they age!   On a fixed income, how do retired seniors, & US Military Veterans get their pay, & social security benefits, without  Internet Service in rural parts of the country & the price of inflated internet service, with monetary growth in mind for wall street profits, yet retired folks, millennials, veterans pay are on a fixed income & won't be able to keep up with inflated Internet Service!  \n\nAnother concern I have is, without Internet service, I would not be able to detach the Google Pixel 3a I am returning to Google, from my Google Account!  Currently I won't add any banking for this reason due to the security risks of a 3rd party accessing my financial account by law enforcement taking mobile computers!   I keep revisiting in my mind, when I was arrested,  & the local law enforcement had full access to my Google Account including Google Adsense & my Banking & all my passwords to other accounts! While I was in jail, I had no way to shut off my mobile computer from my Google Account! My husband said that should teach what not to write, & it serves me right!  He said he don't care about the First Amendment when what I say brings the police around!  He approves of violating the first amendment using censorship, because he is using it as a control mechanism to gas light, to yell & scream in a man baby fit of rage!   He threw me under the bus, & has threatened divorce, several times since I was arrested, after I used my youtube revenue to help pay for the house, when times were really good! When the police got a search warrant & my husband would not stand up for me, & defend my first amendment, & he told the police to keep me, the police then had my banking information, & youtube pay information!  HE even broke a new computer 2 weeks later, because I had to buy a new computer, not having a computer, over a video I made about discrimination in advertising!  The last time he threatened to break my computer equipment was about 4-6 weeks ago, when he was raging! Maybe its the medications or his medical issues, I don't know but he is over medicated & I have no help for him!  I have no place to share feedback, where I feel safe, away from, \"SPOUSE RETALIATION\", over how I feel!   For 14+ months, they have had my computer equipment,  confiscated for an on going investigation!  Funny how that works, when I was being carefree, thought I has a real relationship, but I see things a lot different now!  Why would I help pay for a house, if I knew 16 years ago, all he thought of our relationship is me as a throwaway renter, serving some sick twisted agenda of his, which he kept hidden!  How can someone you thought cared about you, disassociate so swiftly, due to his own discomfort, using it as control in a relationship?  \n\nThank you to those who have shown me something different, & empowered my life education to my 2nd marriage because it was not at all what I thought!  If I would have know this, I would have put the $366,000+ I earned on youtube in to the bank, instead of buying the house in a fema flood zone & paying off vehicles! Hindsight is 20/20!  That way I could have quietly left, which is what he has told me to do on several occasions!  I am just at a point of indifference towards marriage & indentured servitude thru marriage, which violates the 13th amendment, & is slavery!",

Previously charging this phone was amazing and was usually fully charged within an hour or less no matter what it was plugged into.\nI had it run a battery test multiple times and it says it's fine. \nI tried installing a Kernel to help with battery power/tracking and it's saying that it's using about 13% of it's battery capacity. \nI uninstalled all newly installed apps from right before the battery issues began.\nI factory reset my phone as suggested when I googled the issue (ironically, the first time I tried to search my phone turned itself off).\nTo say this is frustrating is an understatement because I love my phone and it functioned amazingly for a being a year and a half old.  The screen protector has just barely started to crack and chip on the edges at almost 2 years and I've had a Speck case on it since day 1.

Wechat is very yellow. I never had this problem with any of my old phones.\nCan it be a software issue from android 11 ?\n\nThank you.",

Reverting Photos app to the factory version which is 4.17. (but this old app can't separate the months of photos correctly and continuously nags to update the app.)\n\nSo one of the latest software components below have bugs and Google should fix it.\n\n* Google Photos app v4.33.0.284040878\n* Google Play services v19.8.31\n* Pixel 3 XL Dec 5th security update\n* Pixel 3 XL Dec 1st Google Play system update (Project Mainline)\n\nI already asked Google Photos forum and sent feedback via Photos app but no solution. There is another user having the same problem with Pixel 4 XL. Google Play system update is highly suspicious because for a little time after factory reset it worked with the app 4.33. then shortly after that it became unable again. Because of Google Play system update?\n\nThe worst thing of this issue is that Google doesn't let me know whether their developers are aware of this issue(and working on it) or not.

    "title": "Restoring a backup which is not visible on \"Restore from the cloud\"",
    "content": "Hello everyone,\n\nAfter trying to solve my issue with Google Support (unsuccessfully) I'm coming here to see if you can help me.\nI was an extremely happy owner of Pixel 3. After using it for 11 months I started having problems with the charging. The phone wasn't charging and after many plug in and out it may start charging. Instead of going straight for a warranty repair I decided to restore the factory setting of the device (just to be sure that there isn't any faulty application). I created a backup of everything. After the sync, I checked the Google Drive and saw that the backup was there with the correct date and time.\nI did the factory reset and followed the Steps from the Help Centre (https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/7179901?hl=en) but on step 5 I'm not seeing my backup. As it was a test to see if the charging will work I decide to continue with clean Android installation (because the backup wasn't visible). After signing  to my account and opening the Google Drive my backup was visible (but can't restore it from Google Drive).\nI contacted Google Chat support for the first time and did few Factory resets with them (I was sharing my screen). Unfortunately the support was extremely bad and they weren't able to help me with the backup issue. As the charging wasn't working after a 90mins on the chat I decide to request a repair for my Phone. It came out that the charging issue is because of a hardware problem and they sent me a new Pixel 3. \nIn the meantime I bought a Pixel 4 and was really hoping to restore my backup from the Pixel 3 (to get my call history, messages and settings), however on step 5 my backup wasn't showing at all. After another chat with their support and many factory resets of the brand new Pixel 4 they weren't able to help me (again).\nIn few days time I decide to call them (6th March 2020). Unfortunately after another 2 hours they came to the assumptions that a senior consultant is needed for my case. For such a consultant they need to arrange a new appointment and someone will get in touch with me. After chasing them on 24th March 2020 I got an email from \"Subject Matter Expert\" with request to explain him what steps I have been taken to try to restore the backup. To be honest this email made me so mad and angry as I already have spent around 4-5h with 3 different consultants doing a factory resets of the device and trying to restore the backup. Every one of them was saying that he/she is putting notes in my case so the person who will pick the ticket later will know the status. However everyone of them required from me to start from scratch as they need to verify it's still happening to be able to redirect me to an \"Expert/Senior\". I replied very politely to the \"Subject Matter Expert\" with everything I have tried and probably as you are expecting no one came back to me. \n\nExcept the offical document from Help centre I tried those steps, but without luck\nFactory reset replacement phone\nSkip all setup, restore, login settings during setup\nConnect to Wifi network\nAllow any system apps to update, but don't login with any Google Account (Play Store will not allow login, but some default apps will update anyway)\nOpen Apps list in settings and choose to display System apps\nClear Storage for:\nGoogle App\nGoogle Play Services\nGoogle Services Framework\nPixel Launcher\nPixel Setup\nRestart Phone\nChoose option from notification shade to complete setting up Pixel\nLogin and restore from cloud back\nHome Screen restored\n\nWanted to check if someone have experienced similar issue with their Pixel backup and were you able to restore it?\n\n\nHere are some thoughts about their support if anyone have another few minutes to spend:\nThe support is just ridiculous. Reading through the script.\nThey don't put any value to the customer/user. To be honest I doubt I will get another Pixel or any Google Device as after buying the device I can't get any help from them. Not mentioning that because of their faulty software I lost important messages and phone history. My Pixel 3 backup expiry in 3 days",

I long press the middle button and nothing happens. If I take the phone out of my pocket swipe up so my phone is on then I can long press and the assistant appears.   I give up. If anyone knows of a phone and a wired headset that can just send a text while the phone is locked or the screen is off please let me know. I'm done with the pixels.  I ride a bicycle and this is pretty much the only thing I use a phone for.  I don't need to deal with pulling my bicycle off to the side every time someone sends me a text just so I can respond. \n\nMy assistant doesn't work on the lock screen. I am using the forums to walk through a solution but every \"community expert's\" advice is wrong.  The people who reply actually use the correct steps which is very helpful. This is so frustrating it reminds me of when I used to own an iphone and wanted to change one little thing and had to spend hours only to hit a dead end bc they lock everything down which was the reason I switched to android.  The ironic thing is when I used the iphone assistant to text it was amazing and worked 100% of the time with no lag.  Here I am with pixel 3 and a pixel 4a and can no longer use a simple feature like that.  All I want to do is click my middle WIRED headset button so the google assistant appears and I can say \"text so and so\".  \n Have you confirmed that the \"Allow responses while phone is locked\" option is enabled? You can find this at Settings > Apps & notifications > Assistant > See all Assistant settings > Assistant (tab) > Pixel USB-C earbuds > Allow responses while phone is locked.\n I found this in one of the forums but when I go to settings, apps, assistant, see all assistant settings then there is NO assistant (tab) there is a long list of every single option except assistant tab. I just need to find where I can click allow responses while phone is locked for Pixel USB C earbuds because I have followed the other 97 steps just so I can try to send a hands free voice text while my phone is locked. This is ridiculous.  I have already clicked turned on locked screen personal results and I have already turned on allow wired headset request with device locked and the button to call google assistant still doesnt work on lockscreen. It immediately works if I take the phone out of my pocket unlock the phone and then press it but by then what is the use of having a button to call google assistant if I have to go through all of the steps manually on the phone anyway.  \n \nHere is what I see when I follow the instructions above.\nHey google sensitivity\nAssignable reminders\nAssistant voice (I checked this it just lets me pick if I want a British Assistant)\nBasic Info\nCalendar\nContinued Conversation\nExplore\nFace Match\nFamily Bell\nFinances\nFood Preferences\nGeneral\nGetting Around\nHome Control\nLanguages\nMusic\nNews\nNotes and Lists\nNotifications\nPayments\nPersonalization\nPodcasts\nPurchases\nRadio\nReminders\nReservations\nRoutines\nShopping List\nShortcuts\nSnapshot\nVideos and Photos\nVoice and Video Calls\nVoice Match\nWeather\nYour data in the Assistant\nYour People\nYour places",

    "content": "Sometime in the late summer or early fall of 2020, right around when Android 11 dropped (although I'm not sure if it perfectly coincided with upgrading to Android 11), I started to notice a pretty heavy standby battery drain on my Pixel 3a (2-3% per hour). Instead of lasting two days with 6-8 hours SOT, as it had for the first year I owned it, my battery was discharging so quickly on standby that it would die in about two days with the screen off.\n\nI dealt with the battery drain for few months on stock Android 11. Eventually I was at my wits end trying and failing to find solutions, so I decided to downgrade to Android 10 and switch to CalyxOS (a private near-stock Android ROM) with the thought that removing Google's spyware might help. Unfortunately, the drain persisted. I have since upgraded to Android 11 on CalyxOS and the drain is still here. My battery stats constantly show high usage from Android System (usually more than the screen), Wi-Fi, Standby, and sometimes Android OS.\n\nLet me give you a rundown of some of my settings to make it clear how ridiculous this battery drain is:\nBluetooth and Wi-Fi scanning off.\nWi-Fi on, but with Mobile Data Always Active off.\nBluetooth off.\nNFC off.\nLocation services off.\nAmbient display off.\nHotspot/tethering off.\nVPN off.\n\"Ok Google\" off (the Google app is actually uninstalled).\nAll gestures off (e.g. Lift to check phone).\nCell signal is great. It's consistently three or four bars in my apartment.\nOnly 9 apps registered for push notifications (turning off push notifications doesn't solve the drain): Bitwarden, Duolingo, GroupMe, Nanoleaf, Photos, ProtonMail, Signal, YouTube, YouTube Music\nOnly 7 accounts syncing (turning off auto-sync doesn't solve the drain): Two DAVx5 accounts (for contact/calendar sync), Duolingo, Google, GroupMe, NextCloud, and Signal\n\nHere are some of the things I've tried that haven't stopped the drain:\nBattery saver mode\nSafe mode\nFactory reset\nReverting to Android 10 (I did this before moving to Calyx OS and then ran Calyx OS on Android 10 for a month or two before upgrading to Android 11 again)\nSwitching to microG for Google Play Services (bundled with Calyx OS)\nSwitching to 5GHz Wi-Fi (I usually connect to 2.4GHz)\n\nThe one thing I've done to successfully stop the drain has been the following:\nTurn off Wi-Fi.\nRestart the phone.\nLeave Wi-Fi off.\n\nHowever, I only have a 4GB data plan and I use probably 20-30GB of Wi-Fi data per month. This is at best an extremely short term workaround. I also don't think this has worked every time, but I know it's at least worked a couple of times for me.\n\n----\n\nThe following screenshots are battery stats from two days ago. To get these, I turned on safe mode, charged my phone to full, and then just sat it on my desk with the screen off all afternoon (aside from turning on the screen once in the middle to check the battery). I had 1 minute of SOT over the entire charge and I lost 17% battery. There are an insane amount of wakelocks going on, leading to almost two hours of screen-off uptime of the ~6.5 hours it was sitting on my table. Almost all of these seem to be coming from the Wi-Fi radio.\n\n\n\n---\n\nAny suggestions of things to try or solutions would be very welcome. I'd also be happy to share more stats from this charge (or a non-safe-mode charge) if that would be helpful.\n\nI'm just so tired and frustrated at this point. The longer this goes on, the more charge cycles get added to my battery, and the worse my battery life is going to be over time. This same exact thing massacred my old Nexus 5's battery and I really don't want to have that happen again :(",

The cable I am using works great with the OEM charger block so I know the cable is good. Both new charger and cable work with my old Pixel 3 with no problems. \n\nThanks.",

I have also told it \"ok Google, call Kurt on speakerphone\" and it doesn't work. Very frustrating.  IT DOESN'T WORK YET IT WOULD WORK FOR MY GOOGLE PIXEL 2016 EVERY TIME. Now it opens the call and doesn't turn on speaker and I see a message at the bottom that says \"assistant can't start when another app is using the microphone\". I click end call and on my home screen, I see that the assistant is open on the bottom but the microphone isn't listening. GOOGLE SUPPORT DIDN'T HELP AT ALL!! I'm completely at a loss at what to do now! Tried screen sharing my device with Google support, factory data resetting, clearing the cache for phone and Google app (as instructed) uninstalling app updates and retraining voice model as well. NOTHING. Please help!",

However, if someone wants more security, then the Smart Lock features can be disabled by using the Lockdown option from the power menu.\n\nThe Lockdown feature also applies to the fingerprint reader. But I don't want to be conscious all the time of when to disable the fingerprint reader with the Lockdown option everywhere and all the time. This can be done much smarter by combining it with the Smart Lock features.\n\nFor example, I think it would be great to combine trusted places with the fingerprint reader. Thus creating e.g. the policy that a pincode is always needed to unlock the device, except for when at home or other trusted places. Such as at home, at work or at university you can then conveniently use the fingerprint reader. But not when on the go. It would also be great (for some users I suppose) to even enforce the pincode + fingerprint (or any other combination possible on a device) for extra two factor authentication at e.g. a sensitive workplace or country.\n\nThis would greatly improve Android's security smarts.

However, when the device received the PQ2A.190405.003 update, the camera started working again.\n\nImagine my surprise.\n\nI was equally surprised, however, when I tried opening it this morning (4/14/19), and it's back to not working. I've again tried all the steps that are suggested, but nothing has worked.\n\nWhat's interesting is that this time the app doesn't crash. When I select the front camera, the app pauses for a second or two, then simply acts like nothing happened and I'm taking a picture with the back camera.\n\nI'm not sure if I'm dealing with a hardware or software issue at this point, to be honest.

After installing the December update (Build ID: RQ1A.200720.009), Google made an official policy that it would not allow users to connect using the DO NOT VALIDATE option in the wifi settings (link for this information: https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/2844832?hl=en scroll to the bottom to see this) because of security reasons mentioned in the aforementioned link. I want to know that will this change be brought to ALL android phones that have OS update support?\nThis request may sound absurd but there\u2019s a very valid reason for this. In my country, a lot of people on samsung\u2019s, and that applies to my university as well. The IT dept. at my uni was not ready to make such a big change to their enterprise wifi because only 2 people owned a pixel in the whole place, the rest own samsungs, which aren't running the latest pixel updates yet, and iphones which don't have this problem. Now before I change my phone, which I bought from my hard earned savings, I want to know whether if Samsung phones, and other android phones, have or will likely receive that particular update, because if that\u2019s the case, I can wait till this becomes a widespread update and my university is forced to change their wifi system. After all, this is the very reason why google released this update: to push organisations to push for higher security measures. I would be SO GRATEFUL of someone can help me with this.\nI want to know that such deeply embedded system changes in android APIs, do they always arrive on other android phones which receive the latest updates? Sooner or later?\nThanks in advance, bless you!",

Played with it all day and installed my apps.\nThen I went to sleep at night and it had about 13% battery percentage left and I put it on the charger.\nThis morning the device was turned off and when I pulled the charger out and plugged it back in it said it had 0% battery. But I could turn it back on again and then it said it was 100%. So I left it in the charger while it was turned on for a few minutes and when I came back to it, it was turned off again. If I removed the charger it wouldn't even start up. It would at first give me an icon that the battery was too low. And if I waited a few minutes it doesn't show anything on the screen. After that I put it on the charger again and when I booted the device it immediately shut down when it was on the lockscreen. I even had it shut down while booting. Also every time I wanted to boot the phone I needed to pull the charger out and put it back in. After this I tried booting it in safe mode, but the same story here. It turned off after a minute or so. So I went to work and left it off for about 45 minutes. I put it on the charger at work and turned it on while leaving it still on the table and it stayed on for a few minutes. A colleague suggested to shake the device to see if it would shut down suddenly and it did. He thinks it is a battery connector issue.\nSo I tried the last thing I could do, a factory reset. It shut down when the device wanted to start erasing all data. Then when starting it up again it erased all data and I was in the welcome screen. The battery was 100% and I pulled out the charger and it turned off again.\n\nTo sum up what I tried:\nBoot without charger (doesn't boot up at all)\nBoot with charger connected (shuts down after a minute or so)\nBoot in safe mode (shuts down after a minute or so)\nFactory reset (shuts down in start screen as well)\n\nI really don't know what to do right now. I just received it yesterday :(. Also I ordered it from the UK and I live in the Netherlands, so if there is anything I can do without sending it back that would be awesome.\nIf I do need to send it back, how will that work? Do I need to send it back to my friend in the UK which will send it back to Google? And how do I start the send back procedure?\n\nI hope someone can give me some more information about what's happening. Thanks in advance!",

I don't always want to use voice assistant or notification tray settings button to toggle flashlight.  Any apps or suggestions are greatly appreciated!\n\nP.S. - If you are reading this Google, a double/triple tap of the fingerprint sensor for flashlight (or anything else) or a double squeeze would be cool.

    "content": "I purchased a Google \"Cardboard\", put it all together and then tried to use it with my 3 XL.  Well, it did 'work', except for one thing:  I couldn't \"select\" anything, even during the setup/configuration for it.\n\nI posted a question on Amazon (where I purchased it) and everyone just kept saying \"You just need to press the button on the upper right of the 'Cardboard'.  That would be great, but I don't have a button there!  It DOES have some 'magnets' on the LEFT side (not top, but side) and you are supposed to be able to just 'slide the magnet' to select things.  It's supposed to use the 'magnetic field to 'click' things when they are highlighted (not sure if that's the way the 'button on the top right' worked either).\n\nHowever, it does nothing.  I have tried putting the phone in the other direction - still nothing.\n\nIn addition, the whole for the camera doesn't seem to line up properly either - seems like it would for my old Samsung Galaxy (I traded in), but not the Pixel 3 XL... \n\nSo, I am wondering, what OTHER VR type headsets ARE compatible with this phone?  Someone else told me the \"Daydream\" would, but then in reading reviews I find that 1) It's discontinued   and 2) It's not compatible with the 3XL after all!\n\nSo, anyone out there have a 3 XL and using it with VR headset, it would be great to know which one(s) line up properly and/or have a way to 'choose' something (button, remote, whatever) when the VR software is running.",

Where is it most appropriate to vent my disgust with the level of support (or complete lack thereof) I received today from google?",

I live in Mexico City and have been a huge fan of google products specially the pixels phones (this is my third one). Even though they don\u2019t sell them here, I always find a way to bring them to Mexico. \n\nThe reason I\u2019m reaching you is because I just realized that \u201cmotion sense\u201d is disabled in Mexico, and that is a huge bummer. There is no law here that bans or prohibits the use of that type of technology. So what I was wondering is if Google is planning soon to enable motion sense here in Mexico or other countires, or if there is a way I can have it enable. \n\nIt such an amazing technology and for simple apps that I don\u2019t see why it would be disable here in MX or other countries. If there is anything I can do I would love it because that is one of the thing I love about pixel phones, that it has technology that makes them different from the other phones and that makes them stand out, and in the case of pixel 4 it is one of the things that makes it stand out and one of the new futures this phone has.",

One of the things I would like to be able to do is use audio from a USB audio interface when recording video (I want to record myself playing guitar and have the sound coming from my PC's DAW as the sound source rather than ambient sound from the mic). To do this I need to be able to connect the USB interface directly to the Pixel 4. I cannot find out anywhere if this is possible. It seems that I need USB OTG functionality for this to work, but I cannot find out anywhere if the Pixel 4 supports this as all specs just mention USB C 3.1. Has anybody tried this successfully? I am looking at the iRig Stream interface to take the sound from my PC and convert it to USB C.\nThanks for any info\nColin",

Calls for some callers on the same carrier will always present the issue, and for other callers it is an inconsistent issue (yet to be seen if it is a consistent issue once it starts).\n\nWhat I have tried so far: I have already done a factory reset (but can do again if I must), I have cleared the phone app cache and storage, tried turning Bluetooth off (issue still present), removed all Bluetooth devices and then reconnected, and removed any app that I could live without.

    "content": "I recently got a new Pixel 2XL under warranty. This new phone triggers Google assistant whenever I take the phone out from my pocket. I have been experimenting and observing this for a week now. I'm talking hours of obsession - including factory resets to experiment with fresh settings. I can (95% or more often) reproduce the problem with no fingerprints (to ensure I'm not accidentally hitting that sensor - but the problem exists with or without fingerprints) and Squeeze sensitivity at the max - but doesn't matter what the sensitivity is.\n\nWith the phone on and screen unlocked*, I can turn the phone off, turn it upside down, rest the top edge on of the now upside down phone on a table, with the back of the phone resting on my index finger (far away from the fingerprint sensor) and wait some time for the ambient display to turn off - basically simulating the phone being in my pocket. When the ambient display turns off, I gently hold the phone so as not to trigger the Active Edge, lift the phone up and hold it flat like you would when taking it our of the pocket. When the display turns on the Google assistant pops up.\n\nAlso, I am pretty sure this issue has something to do with the Always on ambient display, because if you turn it off in settings, then the screen won't wake when you take the phone out of your pocket and the assistant won't appear. If you do have ambient display on, simply picking it up from the table when it is \"ambient\" on will not trigger the assistant. It has to come out of your pocket - or simulated pocket as per above.\n\nLastly, prior to breaking my old phone I know I turned off Ambient display and did not use it the past year because at the time i did not like it. When I got this new one I thought I'd give it a try. So that is why ran into this issue.\n\n*\"the phone on and screen unlocked\" --- during my \"testing\" I noticed that if I did not start from this state, I could not reliably reproduce the problem. For example if the phone was off and flat on the table with the ambient display on, sometimes when I rested the top edge on the table to simulate being in my pocket and then lifted it, i could not trigger the assistant . . . but sometimes I could . So, i don't really know what the exact initial states needs to be to get assistant to trigger - it happens to me 95% or more of the time and I know I'm not accidentally triggering active edge.\n\n-------------\n:-) And if you read this far you probably think I'm crazy. Oh well, I hope someone can reproduce this issue too. If not then I'd have to guess my new phone is broken and send it back.again.",

The person I am texting will get the text instantly even though it only says \"sent\" on my end and not \"delivered\" or \"read.\" After a couple of minutes my text will update to an SMS text that is light blue on my end, and the other person gets a duplicate. I have tried factory resetting my phone, taking sim out, all that stuff. Nothing fixes this issue.

I'm getting the data usage from my phone service provider and I know the data usage page says \"Operator data accounting may differ...\" but right now my phone thinks it has used ~600MB data but my phone operator says I have transferred +3GB that seems to be too big a difference to attribute different \"accounting\". \nObviously, I hope someone can help me figure out why the phone is repeatedly transferring 290MB of data (don't actually know if it is upload or download).\nThank you in advance",

I do have more luck when I disconnect and reconnect and then play YouTube videos (and no I'm not watching music videos while I drive lol, there are just some songs I can only find on YouTube).\n\nI don't think it's the Bluetooth in my car because I never had this issue with my previous phone (Galaxy Note 9).

    "content": "Just like many others I have encountered an issue after Android 11 update where my phone loses internet connection while still technically being connected to my WiFi. I have tried factory reset, network setting reset, use device MAC, changing WiFi channels, 5GHz and 2.4GHz, etc., basically any network changes I can think of. My wife's Pixel 4XL hasn't been updated and she has no problem staying on our WiFi.  If anybody has any idea what else I can try to fix this issue I would really appreciate it. In the meantime, Google needs to identify the root cause immediately and stop pretending this problem doesn't exist or this is the last Google device I will ever buy. And stop killing a downgrade path for your customers, if there is a critical OS update issue, give people an option to downgrade until you can release an update that resolves it.",

    "content": "I am surprised how many posts (Google Support forums, Reddit, tech sites) I found online with the same problem and it doesn't seem like Google got the issue resolved.\n\nI have a Pixel 2 XL that started having this issue maybe a year ago. The main issue is that the power button does not power the screen off most of the time. I have to click it 5-10 times before it accepts the click. And sometimes as I do that, the camera app launches with a single click. \n\nI looked this issue up back then and there weren't many complaints so I decided it to accept it. Now there are tons of others having the issue. \n\nAnother thing started happening a few months ago. I would be on a call with the phone near my ear and I need to look at something on the phone (usually email or a map). So I move the phone away from my ear and the screen remains pitch black. Clicking the power button doesn't turn the screen on. This issue persists until the other person hangs up. Sometimes if they don't hang up, I have to reboot with a long press.\n\nThe phone getting stuck in screen-off mode happens so often now, I usually end up rebooting the phone every other day. The reboots don't fix the inconsistent power button. These phone sometimes behaves normally and sometimes the power button feels like it's asleep. I also think the lack of responsiveness increases after watching a YouTube video. It's almost impossible to turn the phone off right after closing YouTube.\n\nThat and the launching of the camera app with a single click make me feel like I'm using a junk phone not a high end phone. I LOVE Android but these issues (I've had other hardware issues with previous Google phones... this is my 4th) make me strongly and I say this VERY sadly but strongly consider another maker for my next phone. I am one of few people in my company that use a Google phone. Everyone else uses an iPhone or a Samsung. I usually brag to them about the power of Android and how my Pixel gives me the vanilla experience. Google got too many chances and I feel this is it for my Google phone buying streak. UNLESS they make it right. Not sure if this is the right forum to request support directly from Google or not. The \"Contact Us\" option was for chat. I don't feel like typing back and forth for hours.\n\nHere are some links of others experiencing the issue... there are many more:\nhttps://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/41669909?hl=en\nhttps://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/17067447?hl=en\nhttps://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/17067447?hl=en\nhttps://forums.androidcentral.com/google-pixel-2-pixel-2-xl/950305-power-button-2-xl.html\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/987idi/pixel_2_xl_power_button_not_responding_most_of/",

When I sit on the train and move through areas with lots of other wifi networks/hotspots, which I will see, because the Pixel 3 will offer to connect to them, the Pixel 3 will change frequencies five six times a minute even between channels from the 5Ghz and 2.4Ghz band. \n\nMy laptop will still show the connection, but the ping to the phone's IP (gateway) will fail. My other device behaves different. It will detect that the connection has failed and cease to show the wifi connected logo in the upper right corner, but none the less lose connection to the internet and have to be manually reconnected. \n\nThis did not happen previously on the same train that I use to commute every day, when using my previous phone.\n\nThere might be other reasons for the loss of connection besides the Pixel quickly changing frequencies. This is only my suspicion, since the connection loss happens when I sit on the train and the train moves through the inner city. And because I see all the channel switches in my log files of my laptop.\n\nI tried changing the preferred frequency. I usually have it set to 5 Ghz preferred, but the Pixel phone will most often still choose 2.4 Ghz. \n\nI also disabled bluetooth and wifi on the phone as well as the Google assisted location service (uses wifi) and wifi and bluetooth location search for apps. All of that does not help. \n\nI would love to force the Pixel to stop changing frequencies or manually set the frequency for the hotspot, but have not found a way to do that.

I then unsuccessfully tried to charge my phone. It seems like the phone registers that the USB has been plugged in, however, it won't charge. The battery percentage always remains at 0%. Interestingly, if I plug my phone in, it would power up, then power down after a few seconds because the battery is too low and then reboot. If I do not plug it in, it would signalize me to be unable to power up because the battery is too low. Do you think the battery might be damaged? Is there anything I can do?\nPlease help ;) Would be happy to be able to get my phone running.",

(not even 1MB).\n\nWhat Settings are backed up in those just 7KB data?\n\nGoogle drive Backups also specify there are 40 apps  - but what data from them backed up - does NOT say.\n\nAre those backups multi device compatible? Are they........ ie. Android 11 but restored on Android 12 compatible?\n\nThank You for help",

The call's sound comes out through the upper speaker at a normal phone call level, obviously not loud enough for talking over video chat.\n\nThe problem is remedied by turning off bluetooth, even mid chat. Once bluetooth is off, the bottom speaker immediately turns on, usually with the volume set very low and needing to be turned up.\n\nI suspect there is an internal issue with identifying what speaker should be playing, because in regular phone calls the UI allows for a three-way selection of sound source: 1) Phone 2) Speakerphone 3) Bluetooth (watch); however in video calls there is only an off/on button for the speakerphone.\n\nI searched forums for anyone else experiencing this issue but did not identify it. Though I suspect this may just be because of the difficulty of describing the issue in a succinct enough manner to find the appropriate search keywords.\n\nIt is mostly just an annoyance as I can fix it as needed, but any solution would be appreciated, thanks.",

Thought nothing of it as I did my part. Lo and behold I get an email a few weeks later telling I was charged full price for the refurbished product they sent me because their warehouse has no record of receiving the defective item. \n\nWhat ???? How can that be when the tracking number clearly shows it being delivered and signed for. \n\nDid a bit of sleuthing on my end trying to figure out who screwed the pooch on this one. Come to find out Google created two shipping labels .. when you check on the status of the RMA it shows you the tracking for return label and for the label they used to send replacement device. \n\nThe return tracking number listed there and the number listed on the label support sent me are two different numbers. They do not match. The one listed on the website shows pending and the one I received via email shows delivered. \n\nSo now I'm asking to be refunded my money since clearly this was a mistake on their end not mine but they received the phone and as such a credit should be issued. However what I'm getting is the run around and being asked to wait for investigation to be completed because they cannot locate the phone.\n\nSo with all that being said .. has anyone else been through something like this and how did it work out for you.

When I received a mail about replacement phone it showed as refurbished phone. I was requesting to stop the order and even after speaking with google customer support for 4 or 5 times, they proceeded with the order.\n   When I received the replacement refurbished device, i setup everything (took backup etc., spend another 2 to 3 hours of time) and tried calling my friend. As soon as I call, display goes off and my friend couldn't hear what I am speaking and from myside i am barely hearing what he is speaking.\n   Now I had two problems to solve:\n  1) Whether I need to return replacement phone\n  2) Also I am supposed to send the original phone (for which they put $800 on hold). If i don't return on time they deduct the $800 (for the phone currently worth not even $400)\n  I have been dealing with GOOGLE CUSTOMER SUPPORT endlessly and it is going in loop. At one point i am thinking in future not go for PIXEL phones as their customer support SUCKS.\n   THOUGH PHONE IS UNDER 1 YEAR WARRANTY WHY THE HELL I AM SUPPOSED TO GET REFURBISHED PHONE!!!!

I got the phone recently and I took a trip and when I got back I was looking at photos and noticed they were all blurry.  The front camera is perfectly fine! It's just the selfie camera!

Because one is pushed further out, deeper and my dad's Pixel 4 XL is much closer to the glass. I think the assembly wasn't perfect and therefore causing this issue.  Have any of you experienced this?

    "content": "I decided to update to the newest android update before I went to bed. Phone restarted just fine and as I went to check my social media for the night,  when I go to put in my pin, which has not changed in the year and a half I have had my phone...its incorrect. I have now tried 10+ times putting in the same code to avail.\n\nThis is absolutely ridiculous that the only solution is a hard reset but I understand why something like that would exist if your phone got stolen. I'm angry that I'll get my contacts deleted since I need those.\n\nI have seen previous posts where people said it was preposterous that a pin would reset itself after an update, but they were 2+ years old so I couldn't jump in. I am not sure if I am the only one.\n\nHelp",

My battery literally loses one percent per minute after charging battery to 100%.  I didn't have this issue on Android 9. I would go a full day and a half with heavy usage (emails, calendar, pictures and video, live chat, etc) without having to charge the phone. Now I can see the battery dropping without doing anything.\n\nI've done all the usual troubleshooting (factory reset, safe mode, setting all apps to auto update, etc.) but nothing has worked.  And what's pissing me off even more is Google refuses to acknowledge the problem! Instead they rather put blame on the user saying \"Everyone uses their device differently and results may vary blah blah blah.....\" The typical corporate hogwash that big companies say when doing damage control. \n\nThis is unacceptable, I've been a long time Android fan since day one but I think it's time to switch to the other side!",

    "content": "This is (without exaggeration) the worst customer service experience I have ever had. I have  a connection/charging/notification issue with my Pixel 3a. Honestly, that issue is completely besides the point. My real issue is how Google treats their paying customers. What is the point of buying a nice phone if the manufacturer of the phone refuses to help you?\n\nI went through the \"contact us\" page and received a call from a representative. Initially, this first call went fine and we went through some troubleshooting steps. They needed to call me back to see if the troubleshooting fixed the problem (it didn't). We scheduled a callback for 12 pm the next day. Eventually, I received a callback, 4 hours late! This was a very inconvenient time, hence the reason I scheduled the callback earlier. Regardless of the inconvenience of the call, the representative asked me to factory reset my phone and not to sign in. Basically, setting up a brand new phone. He told me that he would call me back in about 15 minutes; he did not. In fact, he still hasn't called me back in 4 days! Not being signed into a smartphone basically makes the phone unusable, I couldn't access Gmail or even my contacts!\n\nI went back through the \"contact us\" page again and this time I chatted with a representative. I complained about not receiving a call back and they \"escalated\" the issue. They told me supervisor will contact me within 2 days. That was another 4 days with no contact. On top of that, they decided to give me a different ticket number than the one I already had. So now I have 2 ticket numbers open for me (although it's obvious that no one is working on either one).\n\nEventually I talked to another representative on the phone and he basically told me he couldn't do anything for me and to wait for a call back. That was 3 days ago and still no contact.\n\nSo what do I do? Honestly, what am I supposed to do to get my phone fixed? There is no phone number for me to call so I must rely on callbacks. But Google simply does not call anyone back!\n\nWhat am I supposed to do? Can anyone answer that for me?",

When I use Google Fi (T-mobile's network), I am able to get 5g just fine using an eSIM.  Does anyone know if the Unlocked version of the Pixel 4a 5g is supposed to get 5g with Verizon on sub-6 as of today?  Or is this a future update for this model?",

I've seen some \"T\" shaped USB-C adapters that throw out a 3.5mm port one end and a USB-C port the other and they look perfect but, so far, they don't seem to work with the phone failing to deal with whatever the adapter is doing ( https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/Baseus-L41-Charging-and-Audio-Adapter-Type-C-Male-to-Type-C-Female-3-5mm-Aux/401984111506?ssPageName=STRK%3AMEBIDX%3AIT&var=671843094030&_trksid=p2057872.m2749.l2649 )   !\n\nHas anybody got a proven solution for handling charging and external mic at the same time ?",

    "content": "I have a Pixel 3a that sometimes has an issue when using the flash on the camera that causes the phone to suddenly shut off/reboot. Usually, it's when I try to rapidly take multiple photos using the flash (within a couple seconds of each other), but it will sometimes have the problem even when just using the flash to take a single photo. To the best of my recollection, I have not changed any of the camera settings since I set the phone up, and the phone does not have any other issues. Everything else on the phone works properly and smoothly (other than the camera not focusing as quickly and accurately as it usually does; but this is not a big deal).\n\nI don't want to have to do a factory reset, but is it possible that a factory rest might help to resolve this issue? Also, I have cleared the cache on the Camera app multiple times, but the problem with using the flash causing the phone to restart still happens sometimes.\n\nI got the Pixel 3a as a gift and don't have the receipt and don't know that I could still get in contact with the person who originally bought it. Is it possible to try to get a Pixel phone fixed under warranty, if you don't have the original receipt to provide? Or, as I suspect, am I SOL when it comes to possibly being able to use the warranty (assuming that it's still active/valid)?\n\nSorry for the lengthy post. This isn't a major issue; but it it something that is really annoying when it happens, as I have to unexpectedly wait for my phone to reboot. If anyone has any helpful information, ideas or suggestions, a reply would certainly be appreciated.\n\nAlso, has anyone else had this camera flash issue with their Pixel 3a device??",
