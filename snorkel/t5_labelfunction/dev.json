When I open the phone app the mobile number is displayed as \"Other\" which is why the assistant isn't able to find it.  When I go into the contacts app there is no number listed as other for the contacts and the number that is showing up as \"other\" in the phone app is clearly labeled as the \"mobile\" in the contacts app.\n\nIs this a known issue?

Very convenient.\n\nRecently I paired the phone with a new pair of Google 3 earbuds (my original pair was broken), and after the setup I found that the earbud buttons can be used to control Google Assistant. For example when new notifications come in, I can press the top button to listen to the notification, without taking the phone out of my pocket, which is very cool.\n\nBut then I bump into another problem: nowadays when I listen to ebooks in the @Voice Aloud Reader app, and press the middle button to pause the ebook, next time I press the middle button the ebook doesn't resume, instead the audio news starts playing. This often forces me to stop whatever I'm doing, take the phone out of the pocket, and manually close the Google app, to resume the ebook.\n\nIs there an easy way to make the middle button only pause/resume the ebook in @Voice,  instead of always triggering the audio news? Or do I have to completely turn off the earbuds control with Google Assistant, to get back the convenience to pause/resume ebooks in @Voice with the middle button?",

Users with Pixels 2-5 are reporting this issue, so Google's claim that it's a hardware issue for my individual device is a lie. Has anybody found a fix? I've tried everything. I'm trying to hold out for now, but ultimately I'm going to need to purchase a new device, and it will definitely not be another Google product after this terrible, negligent experience.

Sometimes it gets to \"Download Pending\", sometimes to \"Downloading\", but never actually started a download. This means I can not install and update Apps now.\n\nI have tried cleaning the cache and data of both Play Store as Play Store Services. Have tried Safe Mode. Have uninstalled Play Store and Play Store Services updates. All to no avail. When looking at the process list, it appears that the underlying Play Store Service process suddenly dies. All permissions are enabled.\n\nAnything else that I can try. I am afraid of doing a factory reset. Besides the extra work re-instating something that I already have, what if that does not fix the Play Store issue. That would mean that I can no longer use my phone.\n\nAny pointers/ideas are appreciated.\n\nI am a massive Android and Pixel fan since the very beginning. Never had a problem. Sad to see so many Pixel upgrade issues. Must have been a very rushed release in the end. \n\nThank you.",

    "content": "Yesterday I tried taking a video and got a notification that I didn't have enough storage. I started deleting photos but made sure to only delete some that were already backed up (my back up is turned on automatically). After deleting 20-30, I tried deleting more and it said it could not delete them. I went to check my phone storage, and it said the total phone was only at 73%, so something happened to the 27% that was there when I was trying to take the video. I had guessed that I somehow accidentally selected to \"Free Up Space\", which from my understanding would only have removed photos that were already backed up, so I wasn't worried about it. Later that night I looked at my photos, and all of the photos I had taken that day said \"Not backed up. Too big or unknown type\" (which didn't make sense because one photo had that message, but the next photo that I had taken 5 minutes later didn't). I searched the internet and someone suggested to clear the cache, and confirmed this would do nothing to harm any photos. I did that and then went back to my \"camera\" album and only the first 32 photos appeared, and the rest were grey squares. If I went to \"photos\", it appears that all of the pictures that are saved to my device won't appear, but any photos that aren't, appeared correctly.  In \"camera\" when I clicked on a photo that isn't displaying, it just gave me a black screen. If I tried editing the photo it said \"unable to edit, check your connection\". I was connected to both wifi and data so that shouldn't be an issue. If I tried to share the photo, it just gave me a white screen. \n\nI decided to try restarting my phone because presumably that fixes everything, but then ALL of my photos, except for those first 32 were gone from my camera album. The ones that weren't backed up because they were \"too big or unknown type\" (even though my camera was the one that took them) were completely gone. \n\nI'm guessing there's nothing I can do and that those pictures are just gone forever? Any one have any ideas at all of what happened or anything I could do to get those pictures back?",

I desperation, I wiped all data from the phone and performed a new setup. Voila!  The webpage reading feature worked with the fresh install. Success was short-lived, however. This morning I noticed an outstanding update fo Pixel Stand. When Iet it update, the feature became disfunctional again. I immediately uninstalled Pixel Stand and now I'm back in business.

The 5 main icons on the home screen become unresponsive and do not respond accurately to touch at times. When I do the same thing but exit out swiping to the left part of the screen instead, the issue never happens. Also, this is one way of fixing the issue whenever it happens.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've recorded videos to help visualize the issue.  They're basically the same, but I made one while on safe mode and after a reset.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URGlfZlnCvw&feature=share](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URGlfZlnCvw&feature=share)  \\- safe mode\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1r9LNINohHA&feature=share](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1r9LNINohHA&feature=share)  \\- factory reset\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou don't have to press the buttons at the start to replicate the bug.

Despite completing multiple factory resets and all the other troubleshooting steps I have read, I still can\u2019t get it to keep connectivity with my Bluetooth devices. Fails in my car, me headphones, earbuds, everything. I\u2019ve even tried the Google ear buds and same issue. It will connect okay but will never stay connected for long. This is the only phone I\u2019ve had the issue with including earlier Pixel and iPhones.\nThis is a huge deal breaker for me and if it doesn\u2019t get fixed, this will be my last Pixel. As in, I will get rid of it and eat the cost of getting something else. I\u2019ve seen so many similar complaints that one would think Google would\u2019ve escalated a fix by now.\nI\u2019ve got a open ticket so we shall see if anything comes of it.\n\nIt is too bad that one issue will ruin my run with Pixels BUT it is a huge issue for me.",

It says I have no bars,  and when I try to make calls it says to turn off airplane mode, yet airplane mode is not on. \n\nThings I have tried : \n\nTaking the sim out and cleaned it. No fix.\n\nUsing a different sim from a boost phone. This worked, of course it wouldn't let me use the service because my IMEI wasn't on the boost account.  But it read the sim and tried to configure network. So I know it can read sim cards. I did try to put the IMEI on the boost account and it said \"this phone isn't eligable for swap\" or something like that. Hmmm.\n\nI have tired factory resetting. Wiped it clean. Still no luck . \n\nThe att worker said the IMEI and the apn were correct, but I suspect he may have made an error. Because this doesn't make any sense.\n\nI have done *#*#4636*#*# and checked mobile radio on. It didn't change anything. I have also looked at preferred network type and it says unknown.\n\nIf I go into sim status, it says :\n\nNetwork unknown\n\nPhone number on sim unknown\n\nMobile network state disconnected\n\nService state radio off (even though I've checked mobile radio on)\n\nSignal strength 0\n\nMobile voice network type unknown\n\nMobile data network type unknown\n\nRoaming not roaming\n\nEID unknown.\n\n\nThere is also no option in the phone for Wi-Fi calling. \n\nIf I do *#*#4636*#*# I get this info:\n\nSet preferred network type : it gives me dozens of options, but when I restart the phone to apply the change it just goes to unknown.\n\nIf I run a Ping test all 3 categories pass.\n\nSmsc refresh and update both bring up refresh error.\n\nThere is a button that says toggle DNS check and next to it it says 0.0.0.0\n\nCall info refresh rate just goes back to disabled no matter what I set it to.\n\nPlease help me.

    "content": "This seems to be a problem whenever auto rotate is enabled.  By default the home-screen is landscape-only, which is fine and how I prefer it.  The issue is that this 'default' does not apply to the recent app view/app switcher.  \n\nThe way this behavior manifests is that if my phone is on a desk or other flat surface, it will be in portrait view in the home screen, but if I swipe up to get to the recent app view, there seems to be a 50/50 chance it will switch that specific view to landscape, turning everything 90 degrees and changing the direction needed to swipe to close etc.  \n\nIf you are holding the phone vertically in-front of you, its not an issue as obviously the sensor will indicate everything should remain portrait, but if it is on the desk you can't tell if the sensors feel it is technically 'portrait' or 'landscape' since its just laying flat there to begin with and you might as well flip a coin as to what orientation that the app switch screen will come up.\n\nIn prior versions of android that screen seemed to be 'informed' not just from the sensor but also what the orientation of the last 'view' or app you were in when you launched it.  i.e. if playing a game locked to landscape mode and opening that screen, it would still open landscape, even if the device was flat on a table and/or the 'sensor' last read was a portrait one.\n\nIn android 9 it seems like it always favors the sensor readings which is causing kind of random/guesswork behavior if the phone is set down and it means I kind of cringe every time I go to open the screen because I never know whether its going to sit there and then rotate 90 degrees on me or not.  So instead of a quick flick like the gesture is supposed to be its always a flick, sit there, wait, see if it turns, if it turns re-adjust my internal perspective and change all my swipe options by 90 degrees, or just try and pick the phone up off the desk to have it turn back etc, then swipe to the other/recent app I want. \n\nEither way it takes what used to be a half-second near-thoughtless navigation gesture and makes it a 4-5 second series of steps I need to focus/concentrate on.  Having the 'last seen' screens all be in their original orientation doesn't help matters because even if it switches to landscape view and navigation the apps will still 'look' portrait and its just the main phone status bar etc that will be visually rotated and serve as an indicator that the UI is now turned 90 degrees from what it was a half-second ago.\n\nBasically instead of observing the orientation of the app (or home screen) that it is opening from, it is *always* subservient to the sensor data, which can disagree when the app is 'locking' the orientation (either portrait or landscape) and/or the sensor data is ambiguous (laying flat on a desk, so neither definitively portrait nor landscape) and that causes delays or directional ambiguity when they don't match and things start rotating in unexpected ways.",

There is a pop up that says 'chose sim for this call' with 2 options 'Emergency calls' and then another entry with my SIP call account details. Both options are greyed out.\n\nI have a Samsung s5 with LineageOS 16 and SIP calling works regardless of whether I have a SIM card installed.

    "content": "I just updated to Android 10 OTA yesterday on my Pixel 2XL 128gb. I noticed that my lock screen never shuts completely off/sleeps now. It used to turn completely off/go to sleep and then I could double tap this screen to show time/date/notifications. There used to be a setting to turn this off and on but I can't find it in the Android 10 settings (don't remember what it was called). I'm afraid that my battery will drain a lot faster with the screen always displaying this information without ever going to sleep. I did notice that if I hold my hand over the top of the phone where the sensors are, the screen will completely turn off/go to sleep but then when I remove my hand it pops right back on again. It seems to have something to do with it sensing light/darkness. Any others having this issue or know what the setting is called in Android 10 to change this? Thanks.",

This morning I looked at Settings->Battery and chose \"Battery usage\" from the \"...\" menu. I also selected \"Show full device usage\" in the \"...\" menu on the \"Battery usage\" screen. The top results are:\nScreen: 3 hr, 35 min; 23%\nGoogle: 14 min; 17%\nAndroid System: 4%\nAndroid OS: 2%\nGoogle Play services: 3 hr, 35 min: 2 %\nOkay, \"Screen\". No, I did not have my screen an and full bright for 3.5 hours. So I don't know how to interpret that.\nBut here's another thing: I've never seen this before, but back on the Settings->Battery screen I have the warning \"Phone used more than usual\". When I click on that message, a pop-up appears and says this:\nTop 3 apps you used since full charge:\nDIGI Clock Widget 3 hr, 29 min\nAudible 1 hr, 33 min\nPocket Casts 51 min\nSo two items in Settings->Battery give me two different takes on what is using my battery. I do suspect that the DIGI Clock Widget is my problem. Is that not reported on the other list because it is a widget and exists as part of \"Screen\"? Who knows? I can say that the DIGI Clock Widget does NOT appear anywhere on the regular \"Battery usage\" list. If that app is responsible, then it's only because of that (incidental) \"Phone used more than usual\" message that I learned that. And I have never seen that message until today.\nFWIW I use the DIGI Clock Widget because it shows seconds. I do wish the system's clock widget had that option.",

What is going on?\n\nFor reference, same procedure above using an Xperia XZ2 running Pie and latest Android Auto works perfectly fine - hears commands and plays on car speakers set to bluetooth media.\n\nI have tested Android Auto on the Pixel 3XL on other bluetooth headsets and voice commands work fine, though audio comes through in much poorer quality than the music - maybe that's the age of my bluetooth speakers? Or Pixel 3XL Android Auto is using some other profile?\n\nSo the Pixel 3 is doing something strange via bluetooth and android auto.  Another thread pointed to being able to turn off HD for certain connections in Oreo, but those options aren't in Pie anymore.\n\nJust using the Google Assistant normally via bluetooth outside Android Auto is a bit buggy - it takes two squeezes to get it to listen to me, but when it does hear me it responds via the car speakers.\n\nWhat is going on?\n\nI am not an expert in Bluetooth profiles, but it feels like once you say OK Google it is switching to handsfree profile but the car mic is not active.  These are older bluetooth head units that have separate phone and media profiles.\n\nHow come Sony has figured this out?\n\nIs there an app that lets me control individual bluetooth pairing audio quality?",

    "content": "Hi, everyone! So this isn't a question so much as an answer that I hope Google takes notice of, or at least will allow to stay up for others to reference, because I believe it's the source of a variety of audio issues users are experiencing.\n\nSo after a couple of years of apparently annoying all my friends and family with my painfully loud and unfiltered phone calls on my Pixel 2, I finally figured out why: those tiny holes on the top and bottom of the phone are ambient mics that WORK TOGETHER to cancel out background noise.* My phone case has openings for the mics, but apparently the HOLES IN MY PHONE CASE WERE TOO SMALL for the mics to work properly. \n\nSo basically I've been calling people with no noise cancelling functionality, and the tiniest of sounds were apparently getting picked up and amplified by the Pixel 2's impressively sensitive front-facing mics (they could literally hear me swipe on the phone, no matter how softly I touched it).\n\nSo tonight during a phone call with my long-suffering BFF, I took my phone out of its case. She immediately noticed a difference. She could no longer hear my shoes on the pavement, nor the boxes I was moving, nor the tap-tap-tapping on my phone. And for reasons unbeknownst to me, it even improved the audio when I used the mic on my Bluetooth headphones. I suspect the Pixel continues to do noise-cancelling through its ambient mics even when using an external mic.\n\nSo if you're having a problem with your end of the phone conversation being garbled, try removing your phone from its case and see if it helps.\n\nI'm gonna need to try and drill bigger openings in this case...\n\n*So this is just a hunch, but I think the way it works is since there's two front-facing mics next to the top and bottom speakers, those tiny holes filter out ambient noise for the adjacent main mics. Which is why you need to make sure both are clear of obstructions.",

The phone is in pristine condition, just for the sake of not talking in mind hardware related uses.\n\nIs the gcam bugged because of any update of the camera or Android 11 itself? Everything worked flawlessly till yesterday night when I tried to take a photo of nightsky and the rear camera displayed a black screen. As of today the rear camera doesn't even display in the gcam nor any other app, including QR ones. How do I may proceed?

With a different USB A To C cable it works, though very slow.\n\nWhen I plug in the original charger one of the following happens:\n- Nothing. I have to flip the cable like in the old USB days (wtf)\n- It charges in a one second Interval. Meaning I hear the sound/vibration when it starts charging, but then it immediately stops charging, starts chargings, stops charging... and so on.\n\nI already factory reset my phone, which didn't help. I tried a different charger from a galaxy phone. Same happens there. Only with a USB A to C cable which is plugged in a PC I am able to charge...\nI don't think that there is dirt in there...\n\nWhat could that be?",

    "content": "I have had a Pixel 5 since December 2020. It\u2019s worked very well and I\u2019ve had no issues with it. However, wireless charging has suddenly become extremely slow. I use a Pixel Stand at my computer desk and a 3rd party wireless charger bedside and charging at both locations has slowed down significantly. However, direct USB-C charging is as fast as ever.\n\nI\u2019m not sure what has caused this slow wireless charging all of a sudden. I\u2019ve done everything to troubleshoot. I have removed the thin phone case to try again (previous, there was no issues with leaving the case on) and have also rebooted the phone twice. I\u2019ve called Google support and they are less than helpful. They just give me very generic steps to try.\n\nI believe this change in wireless charging behaviour came about after the May 2021 security update. However, I admit that this problem might date back a couple of months. Since a couple of months ago, I sometimes wake up in the morning and take my phone off the bedside wireless charger and noticed it was not at 100%. This was intermittent behaviour and I had attributed to possibly not having my Pixel 5 aligned properly overnight. But since the May update, it seems like it is a constant behaviour.\n\nAnyone with any ideas or has observed similar issues with their charging?",

    "content": "I believe there is a bug in Android 11 with the Pixel 4a (and possibly other Pixel phones). It's to do with the feature found in your mobile network settings called \"Send/receive MMS when mobile data is off\".\nSee photo:\n\n\nWhat happens is this:\nWhen the feature is enabled, and you send or receive MMS, the phone enables your mobile data for EVERYTHING, but does not tell you it will do this, nor does it enable the switch for mobile data on the same settings screen seen in the photo above.  Your apps that use data will immediately begin to use data and notify you as if you had manually turned your mobile data on.  It remains in this state for many hours, and possibly until you turn it off.\n\nThis is how you test it (assuming your phone plan has data):\n1. disable mobile data\n2. disable wifi\n3. verify and ensure that data is in fact off by testing internet access\n4. verify the \"send & receive MMS messages when data is off\"  function is turned on\n4.5 verify that RCS chat features are turned off in google messenges and has been off for at least a few minutes.  restart messenges app possibly as well ( i don't use that feature at all and this step might be redundant)\n5.  send an MMS message to a contact using google messages\n6.  verify that data has been turned back on by trying an app or browser (but settings menu shows data off)\n\nBefore you jump to conclusions and say \"but data needs to be on to send MMS\" this is not true, you can plainly see the function is there, and other phones from other brands have had this function for years despite not having the toggle switch in the settings menu. (Realme X2 was the most recent phone I've seen that can send/receive MMS without data on).\n\nLastly, please read the steps above carefully and perform them EXACTLY how I have outlined to test this \"bug\". Most people I've asked either miss a step or don't do them at all. In fact, there's a few threads started here about this issue but none have tested it in this way and all threads are locked for some reason since the issue never gets resolved.\n\nAnd yes I've reported this scenario through the feedback function 3 times, once a month since I've had the phone after each monthly security patch since October, on Android 11.",

I wasn't using the front-facing camera much then (pre-coronavirus), so I didn't make a big deal of it.\n\nI've tried other solutions written about on other threads and Reddit, including clearing my camera's cache (in storage), deleting my phone's voice match for Google Assistant (which I now have off), removed Google Home entirely, etc.\n\nAny other troubleshooting tips for this?

Without Internet service, I can't set up my Google Pixel Replacement, so this is feedback related to the product, for a broad portion of people in the USA, who have no WIFI & Internet service is to expensive!  I have consistently been using mobile computers for media content creation, using hot spots, home wifi, without a data plan, which they can be really expensive!  Can Google make a stand alone Pixel, where we don't need to be signed in to an account, yet we can still used the mobile computer! I've used Samsung before, & I would be able to turn on a Samsung Galaxy immediately, & use it without signing in to an account!  I started panicing a bit, thinking 5 G meant taking away our cable & all we would have is WIFI service, & then I would not be able to use my Google Pixel at all!!   If I had no Google Account, previous to receiving my Google Pixel, I can't use it anyway for pictures, video, journaling & note taking!  Can Google make a Google Single Pixel,  which means the computer can be used, without an account & you don't need to be signed in to someone else's account to use the Google Single Pixel!? You just turn it on & use it, then sign in to your Google Account if you have one!   \n\nIdeally, I still wish we had free internet so everyone can use the Internet due to the folks on fixed incomes as they age!   On a fixed income, how do retired seniors, & US Military Veterans get their pay, & social security benefits, without  Internet Service in rural parts of the country & the price of inflated internet service, with monetary growth in mind for wall street profits, yet retired folks, millennials, veterans pay are on a fixed income & won't be able to keep up with inflated Internet Service!  \n\nAnother concern I have is, without Internet service, I would not be able to detach the Google Pixel 3a I am returning to Google, from my Google Account!  Currently I won't add any banking for this reason due to the security risks of a 3rd party accessing my financial account by law enforcement taking mobile computers!   I keep revisiting in my mind, when I was arrested,  & the local law enforcement had full access to my Google Account including Google Adsense & my Banking & all my passwords to other accounts! While I was in jail, I had no way to shut off my mobile computer from my Google Account! My husband said that should teach what not to write, & it serves me right!  He said he don't care about the First Amendment when what I say brings the police around!  He approves of violating the first amendment using censorship, because he is using it as a control mechanism to gas light, to yell & scream in a man baby fit of rage!   He threw me under the bus, & has threatened divorce, several times since I was arrested, after I used my youtube revenue to help pay for the house, when times were really good! When the police got a search warrant & my husband would not stand up for me, & defend my first amendment, & he told the police to keep me, the police then had my banking information, & youtube pay information!  HE even broke a new computer 2 weeks later, because I had to buy a new computer, not having a computer, over a video I made about discrimination in advertising!  The last time he threatened to break my computer equipment was about 4-6 weeks ago, when he was raging! Maybe its the medications or his medical issues, I don't know but he is over medicated & I have no help for him!  I have no place to share feedback, where I feel safe, away from, \"SPOUSE RETALIATION\", over how I feel!   For 14+ months, they have had my computer equipment,  confiscated for an on going investigation!  Funny how that works, when I was being carefree, thought I has a real relationship, but I see things a lot different now!  Why would I help pay for a house, if I knew 16 years ago, all he thought of our relationship is me as a throwaway renter, serving some sick twisted agenda of his, which he kept hidden!  How can someone you thought cared about you, disassociate so swiftly, due to his own discomfort, using it as control in a relationship?  \n\nThank you to those who have shown me something different, & empowered my life education to my 2nd marriage because it was not at all what I thought!  If I would have know this, I would have put the $366,000+ I earned on youtube in to the bank, instead of buying the house in a fema flood zone & paying off vehicles! Hindsight is 20/20!  That way I could have quietly left, which is what he has told me to do on several occasions!  I am just at a point of indifference towards marriage & indentured servitude thru marriage, which violates the 13th amendment, & is slavery!",

I've noticed my battery doesn't charge to 100% often, but if it does, it immediately drops to 98% right after taking it off the charger. I use the original charger as often as possible and only charge it when I need to. I've tried every solution Google says and other people's solutions. I've talked to Google Support a while ago and she recommended format my device. I did, but that didn't help. I got the same amount. A normal day for me is waking at 6:30, unplug phone at 7 and leave for school, then get home at 3:00. A normal day is 1.5-3 hours of use. I'm usually at 35% even after only those hours. I'm not sure what's causing all of this. Should I talk to Google about a replacement phone, replacement battery, or go through uBreakiFix? I can spend any amount of money, reasonably. I'm just mostly worried about time. Google could take 7-10 days and idk about uBreakiFix. Any suggestions?",

I contacted Xfinity to try to resolve.  Xfinity stated there is nothing they can do as the phone is not compatible with their network.  I contacted Google and I worked through all of the troubleshooting steps to no avail (lots of back and forth between google and xfinity support).  Google then directed me to resolve the issue with Verizon.  Google said the phone was a Verizon variant and Verizon should be able to fix the issue.  I don't even have a Verizon account.  I was several hours into trying to resolve, so I tried Verizon.  I explained that I don't have an account, but they tried to help me anyway.  Within minutes I was speaking with a level 2 representative (on the phone) as we tried to work through the issue.  I was impressed by the level of effort considering I do not even have an account with them.  After looking up the IMEI number and serial number, it was determined that they have no record of that phone in their database.  Verizon confirmed the phone was not locked by them or any other carrier.  They too stated that the phone is not compatible with their network.  Back to Google...  The google rep finally offered to send a new phone, but I would have to wait an additional 5-10 business days to receive the replacement phone and no way to guarantee the second replacement would be compatible.  At this point I asked to escalate the issue.  The rep agreed and that ended the chat.  About 6 hours later I received a quick email from the supervisor.  I promptly responded and haven't heard back since.  That was yesterday.  I am now on day 11 without phone service and seemingly no closer to a resolution.  I can't get a response from the supervisor and no idea how long I am supposed to wait around.  I tried to contact by phone, but when they call back came through I was disconnected before speaking to a human.  The policy of sending in the phone before they will send the replacement is ridiculous.  I am now two days into this and have spent more hours than I care to admit.  Not sure where to go from here other than giving up and purchasing a new phone from somewhere else...",

    "content": "I've had my Pixel 2 since release and far it has been a great experience! Over the past month or so I've noticed the battery draining fast and charging slow. To the point where it will only charge with the rapid charger. Charging via USB from my PC or car does not charge my phone anymore (they used to charge it fine, just slower of course) because my phone is using more power than those ports can provide! \"Carrier Services\" and \"Google Play Services\" usages are high for some reason.  My understanding is that other apps piggyback off them so there could be some app that is draining my battery in the background. Problem is I have no idea which app it mignt be.  Is there any way to find which apps are piggybacking off Carrier/Google Play Services?\n\nWhat I've tried:\n-Rebooting phone (no effect)\n-Safe mode (used for about a day with no unusual battery drain so appears to be a third party app)\n\nMy battery usage: https://imgur.com/a/j2c3RmO",

    "content": "I have, like many many other people it seems, been having multiple issues with my Pixel 4xl since ever since android 11 launched and am completely regretting the idea that I should get the update. I'm looking for advice on how to fix these issues. List as follows\n\nFirst update to android 11:\nspotify wouldnt close\nsirius xm wouldnt open or close\nchrome wouldnt close or would crash randomly\nwouldnt receive texts randomly from people. not all the time just a random text here or there. i use the built in messages app for texting\nphone wouldnt connect to wifi sometimes. it would say its connected but i actually had to signal\ni couldnt make wifi change to a different network\nphone wouldnt connect to data when i turned off wifi\nbluetooth on my hands free headset wouldnt work sometimes but other times it did. bluetooth in my car worked fine though all the time? (like pausing or skipping songs)\nAll the issues above could be temporarily fixed by rebooting the phone. usually needed to do so about 3-4 times per day. So I was running out of patience waiting for updates to fix this and decided to factory reset.\nAfter factory reset some issues are solved for now. These still remain:\nfirst and foremost I GET HALF TEXTS NOW FOR NO REASON!?!?!?! I will literally get the end of a text but not the first part of it so it makes it a BIT confusing????\nSpotify still doesnt work properly, wont close sometimes, displays wrong song thats playing\nbluetooth headset still fails to pause and skip songs correctly\nchrome now refuses to reload a webpage when it has downloaded it for offline use (this is a new feature since factory reset)\nThis is all the new issues since the factory reset (I did this about 2 days from time of writing) and I am completely fed up with this update. Like really? I get that the 3rd party app issues are probably not Google's domain to fix but MESSAGES??? The main function of a cellphone is to contact people through voice or text and the one that is used most is now VERY unreliable!!!!\n\nI'm sick of this update and I've only had it for about 2 weeks now. I'm at a loss for what to do next because as far as I can tell I've done everything short of getting a new phone. Which is what... 1 year old? Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!",

This is so I can both charge and send data to the DAC/AMPs.\n\nI have three DAC/AMPs\n1)      Moshi - USB-C Digital Audio Adapter with Charging\n2)      Focusrite - SCARLETT SOLO\n3)      JDS Labs \u2013 The Element\n\nBoth1 and 2 are both USB powered devices, while the 3 has an external power supply.\n\nBoth 1 and 2 work with my phone, while 3 kind of works.\n\nWhen I connect my phone to 3 I believe the phone recognizes the DAC/AMP. This is because when I try to play music the phone speakers do no turn on. Also, if I disconnect 3 from my phone the music player on my phone pauses the music.\n\nThe problem that I have is that when I plug in my headphones into 3 while playing music on my phone there is no sound. I have ruled out the hub as a problem because it works fine with 2 and when using it to connect 3 to my computer.\n\nFrom what I have seen it seems to be a problem with Android and how it handles externals DAC/AMPs.\n\nBoth 1 and 2 are USB powered, thus the phone is sending both audio information and power. At the software level, Android knows this and thus does not turn on the phone speakers when playing music, but rather send the signal to the DAC/AMP.\n\n3 uses an external power supply, so it does not need power for the USB connection. Thus, the phone only needs to send audio information. At a software level, the phone seems the understand that a DAC/AMP is connected and thus does not turn on the phone speakers when playing music. However, the phone also does not seem to be sending any audio information to the DAC/AMP.\n\nFor this simple analysis, it seems that Android will only send audio information to a DAC/AMP if the DAC/AMP also is powered by the same connection.",

    "content": "Now that the Pixel 2 is no longer receiving updates, I'm about to purchase a Pixel 5 and would like to minimize the inconvenience of migrating from the Pixel 2 to the Pixel 5. To be clear, I have read the canned Google instructions on transferring data from and Android Phone to a Pixel, but have more specific questions.\n\nThere has been some chatter in the blogs about glitches occurring when migrating using a wired connection between old phone and a Pixel 5. Is it safer to migrate using the Pixel Cloud backup (even if slower), and if so, how is this done? Is it safer still to start fresh on the new phone and manually reinstall Account and Apps? (If it matters: the Accounts, Apps, and the organization of the Apps in groups is all I want to transfer; there are no other data on my phone as everything is in the cloud). \nAssuming that I will use the wire, am I correct that the Quick Switch Adapter talked about in the canned Google procedures is nothing more than a USB-A to USB-C adapter and so I can use instead a USB-C to USB-C cable?\n\nThanks in advance.",

(all were locked or I would have posted on one of those)\nI just suffered from this issue for the last 12 hours. I could not even get it in safe mode and did not try Factory Reset since so many had reported it NOT fixing the issue. Basically my phone was a brick restarting over and over and nothing worked. Fully charging it, etc.\n\nFirst, what used to work was fully powering off from the screen where you get to factory reset, then wait 30 seconds, then full on until I hear the vibrate in the power button (only with no charging cable applied - if cable was connected it would not work). Well, this did not even work today.\n\nWhat finally DID work for me today was the same dropping of my phone flat on it's back from 12\" to 18\" on a carpeted floor... just as I write in my posts in this thread (GatorAndroid):\nhttps://productforums.google.com/forum/#!topic/phone-by-google/usWaieQt_7I\n(be careful, I'm not responsible if something goes wrong)\nI did it this time while powered off, and on my next power up, it FINALLY allowed my 12-hour bricked phone to come out of the repeated reboots.\n\nI'm on my way out of this Pixel. I have it for 2.25 years and just too many problems to list and self-debugging like this. Easily 80-120 hours of my time over the 2 years. Unfortunately could not even consider a Pixel 3 because of the issues I've had over the past 2 years. Good luck.",

Bad?\n\nThe battery is documented as 3700 mAh.\nI assume that number is for 3.7V.\n\nI hope I'm not publicly embarrassing myself with a simple error in my arithmetic...\n\nI did a naive calculation based on above and arrive at,\nif the 18W charging was 100% efficient,\ncharging would increase 1% per 27.4 seconds.\n\n\nComparing with my 36-38 seconds instead,\nI'm getting only 13W effective results.\n\nOr said in terms of efficiency, I'm getting only approx 72% efficiency.\n\nPardon my geeky question.

The battery has gotten worse exponentially in the previous one week.

Usually when the video is playing somewhat as usual the audio is behind by several seconds, in some cases as much as 10 seconds. \n\nHere is what I have done:\n\nI have turned it off and on again\nCleared both the cache and storage of the Youtube app\nUninstalled and reinstalled the Youtube app \nUpdated the Youtube app (I tried to play a couple of videos before updating and the problem still persisted)\nRebooted into safe mode and tried the same process again\n\nI have also contacted Google support and they told me that the best they could do was send me the link to the troubleshooting page where it basically told me to do everything that I have already done, again. \n\nI'm trying to figure out if this is a hardware issue or if there are more things I can try before giving up and looking for different phone options.\n\nEdit: I may have figured out the issue.

Drain is normal and pretty low for most of the apps, Instagram has normal drain while being in the app, but after exiting and closing, it persistently uses battery. I used Instagram for 40 minutes since yesterday, 8% in the app. I checked today, and I noticed that it used 34%, even though I didn't use it since yesterday. This was at 4:00 pm. At 8:00 PM, I hadn't open instagram and it jumped to 37% usage from the battery, showing that it was used for 2 hours and 50 minutes in the background. I force stop the app and background restrict it and still used the battery to 39% consumption of battery. I forgot to screenshot before deleting it, but those are roughly the stats since yesterday. Why is it using so much battery in the background and why does it use battery in the background even if I restrict and force stop it? How can i resolve it?

    "content": "I have a Pixel (128 gb) My wife just got a Pixel 2 (128 gb) and will be abandoning the iPhobe world.\n\nI added Verizon Cloud 500 gb service & had to talk to them twice due to strange functionality & non-functionality. 1st person was knowledgeable but couldn't find answers. 2nd person was worse than no help. Today I am feeling sorry for her vs. frustrated last night.\n\nBasically, I learned they do not support Pixel very well for automated media backup.\n\nThat's no surprise. Most automated backup/sync doesn't work how I expect/want, so finding a way to do it manually is my goal.\n\nTheir drag/drop or select from device are impractical (Pixel plugged into W7 laptop to access Pixel folders for Verizon Cloud doesn't respond to drag/drop. Selecting from menu only supports one file at a time & forgets what directory you were using every time).\n\nSo I tried to use Verizon Cloud Sync folder on the laptop. I was able to copy content to the VC Sync folder but their user interface is not very responsive or meaningful. It's very quick to tell you all Sync, Backup & Restore processes are completed. It says that by default. One time I saw it say it had completed file uploads, then how many files were awaiting processing. That number did not change overnight. I can understand it taking time, but either it wasn't working at all, or won't change status until the entire process is completed. (Really, not the default 'completed' display).\n\nHas anyone determined if there is a way to use Verizon Cloud manually, automatically, effectively, or at all?\n\nI am leaning strongly toward calling it, at worst, unusable or at best, having a woefully inadequate UI.\n\nThank you\n\nMurray",

I opened the photo from the camera album in photos and shared the photo to gmail and sent it to her, which she said she didn't have an attachment. I tried again as watched as I did it. When gmail opened it said, \"file could not be attached\". I then opened the photo from the album again and swiped up to see the details. The file size was 0 bytes, which seemed very strange. I then did a normal restart on my phone and went back to the same photo. This time when I swiped up to see the file size my phone starting quickly flashing through photos, about one each 1/4 of a second. When I finally got my phone to go to the home screen I went back in to my camera album and every photo from the last year was gone.\n\nTo answer, no, my backup was not turned on so please move beyond that. Google support by phone last night had no answer other than to have me search for a video on YouTube that ended up being an ad for some software, which I thought was pretty unprofessional. They honestly act like this had never happened and have no idea what occurred. \n\nThere must be a way to run a legitimate data recovery on my phone, right? My storage dropped by about 15Gb when this happened. The data has to still be there. I tried a basic recovery app from the play store and as it ran I could see thumbnails of the missing photos but the app was so garbage it either didn't complete or is a basic version to have you buy the upgrade one. \n\nHas anyone else seen this situation or know if there an actual way to run a recovery on the data?",

We recently moved into a new house and we're using the exact same modem/router setup from the old house (Cox). Now, we are not able to open certain 3rd party apps on our phones, which appear frozen but if you wait 1+ minutes, it will load. I have tried all the usual troubleshooting; forced re-start, reset all WiFi/Network/Bluetooth setting, restarting modem/router, system/security updates, speed test (350 down, 48 up) etc. If I turn WiFi off, I have no problems at all. In fact, everything works perfectly on other WiFi's, just not my home WiFI. I have dual band, I have tried both 2.5 and 5 channels with no difference. The Wifi works fine on my other devices, such as home computer, tablets, and TVs. I can't seem to find any answer. Interestingly, I pulled out my original Google Pixel and it has the same issue with latency around 3rd party apps as our 3A's? Could it be the Pixel OS and compatibility issues with my modem/router? And why all of a sudden? Any ideas or support would be awesome, thanks! \n\nModem: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0781VN7W5/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1\n\nRouter: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06X9CPC45/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1",

When the issue happened yesterday, the charging symbol would show for a second and then vanish, indicating the phone was detecting the charger\nIt's not an app causing the issue:  I restarted the phone in safe mode and tried charging and it made no difference.\nI've also tried it with another identical google pixel charger from a friend's phone, and with the fast charger that came with my Pixelbook (which works on the Pixelbook) - no charging. Tried connecting the cable to the Pixelbook to draw charge from the computer, that didn't help either. My phone's cable will work on my Pixelbook, so it's definitely an issue with my phone.\nHowever I it will take charge from a generic cheap USB-C to USB-A cable stuck into a socket - but only extremely slowly (much slower than this cable used to work). \nI really think that all of the above means the issue is with some software. It's running Android 9. I could update it to 10 (once it has enough battery, which will take hours at this rate!) if anyone thinks that will help!\nThanks",

It's a rather odd issue. However, sometimes also the phone crashes (when using gmaps, home button or just switching apps and going to settings) on the stated battery level. If battery is below 60% the phone often remains in a restart loop which only plugging to an external power source stops. All these issues happend before and after I reset my phone.

Within 29 days of having the phone and service, I still cannot hold onto one single call.  Either the person can't hear me or the call drops altogether.  EVERY SINGLE CALL!  This includes the calls to Google support!!!  I finally gave up yesterday on Fi and switched to Sprint.  And although a tad better, still every call has issues!!!  And, Google made me purchase the phone outright just to be able to switch carriers!  So, I will just continue to ship the phone back to Google every 2 weeks to get a replacement until the 1 year warranty is up.  Everyone online is saying the same thing about this shitty phone!  I hope Google likes me costing them more in warranty returns then the profit they made from my purchase!  I WILL NEVER PURCHASE ANOTHER GOOGLE PRODUCT!!! EVER!!!!

Nevertheless, if we persist at turning the phone off and on then eventually wi-fi can be turned on. But the problem will occur again before too long, and without warning, so that my wife uses a lot of mobile data before she realises the problem has occurred. \n\nAnother thing that happens when we are working with the wi-fi function (as we try to troubleshoot this problem) is the phone sometimes displays an error message 'UI System isn't responding', and we have to click 'close app' to return back to the previous screen and continue using the phone. \n\nMy Pixel 3a is fine, and we have no connectivity problems. The issue is definitely with the phone, hardware or software.

    "content": "I am a Samsung Galaxy user who has gotten increasingly mad at Samsung over years about the phone doing more and more its own thing without me as the owner having any control.\n\n[TINY RANT START] The last drop was when I was getting daily notifications to migrate from Samsung Cloud to One Drive, even though I had nothing in Samsung Cloud, nor I wanted to have to do anything with either of them. The notifications were saying they would end from March 31. Nopes, in April that got an extension to April 30. Disabling those things from pinging me daily was a disabled option in the settings. So that's it, I decided that I needed to move off somewhere where I get more control. [TINY RANT END].\n\nHere, I would like to ask and get answers about a few basics about Google Pixel, as I consider getting the Google Pixel 6 later this year. Please, go sensitive about the below things, as they had been quite some pain points for me in the last few years:\n\nSometime in 2017/18, Samsung Galaxies started randomly requiring pin check to unlock instead of biometrics, for security purposes they say. One would argue that this wasn't random, but that's how it feels to me. Does Google Pixel enforce things like that, or can the user set up to always unlock the phone with biometrics, and only need a pin verification when the biometric check fails enough times? That's a selling point for me.\nSometime in 2019, some parts of Samsung Health didn't want to work anymore without having access to my contact list. That was when I emptied my contact list in order to use all of the Samsung Health. Does Google Fit exercise similar behavior?\nAlso, Galaxy Store started requiring access to my contact list in order to update the apps. That is just bonkers, but luckily I had already wiped my contact list and the phone remained 'functional' in the sense that Samsung apps could get an update. Does Google Pixel exercise any similar behavior of asking for unreasonable things (e.g., my contact list) in order to provide basic functionality, such as updating the apps?\nSometime in 2021, Samsung Health didn't want to work anymore without 2FA. That is how I lost access to my Samsung Health. Does Google Fit do the same? In general, how is enforcing 2FA bad at Google Pixel? A phone that lets me choose 2FA or not is a selling point.\n\nHope this wasn't too painful to read. Thanks in advance for telling me how those points work out on Google Pixel!",

I'm very fond of their Pixel lineup of phones even though it would be great if they had a stylus.  If they did Samsung could go peel potatoes with its Notes.\n\nI have to really bow in respect for what Google is doing now and I now have a very favorable opinion of them.  I thought their location tracking was an invasion of privacy and you know what? ... it worked to my advantage when some creep doctor denied that I was at his office on a certain day at a certain time and I shoved the phone in his face.\n\nBut what's killing me is that these new safety services are not available to me and my question is why and if there is a hack, a hack that Google will not object to.\n\nOther questions\n\nWho changed Voice 2 of the Google Assistant?\nWe have manual call screening in Canada and suddenly Voice 2 changes to one that is less pleasant.  Put the original back per favor.\n\nWhy is Wi-Fi necessary to activate Google Call Screen after a power off situation resulting from Battery to 0?\n\nThis cannot be a regulatory issue with automatic not available in this frozen Arctic tundra because we had a very similar feature called Who's Calling on wireline TWENTY YEARS AGO.\n\nIt was developed by Nortel on their Digital Multiplex System 100.\n\nIt intercepted all calls from unknown and private callers and asked them to state their names.\n\nDMS would proxy the call to the end subscriber and offer him disposition options.\n\nIt later changed.  If you were calling private you had to press a key on a Digitone telephone to release the number ... the number is always transmitted regardless of whether the call is private or not ... there is simply a privacy indicator that is turned on or off.\n\nOn the unknown you would have to actually key in your number using a touch-tone set and then DMS would relay that number to the subscriber telephone with a greater than sign  on the name line to indicate that the call might be spoofed.\n\nSo then we called that person back at that number to verify that that was accurately entered as the true number.\n\nThere are databases out there that know which telephone numbers are wireless and which ones are wireline even after they've been ported and it would be nice if we got a call and we knew.  I don't want to send a text message to a wireline device if you know what I mean.\n\nAnd one last suggestion ... why not include an integrated barcode scanner in the Google keyboard ... that would be so nice.",

But now...\n\n--- Mysteriously, the phone would no longer take a charge from a USB-C to USB-C cable, though a USB-A to USB-C cable still works.\n--- The battery lifespan evaporated: I previously needed to charge the phone every 36 hours or so, but now a full charge with little/no activity only lasts about eight hours if I'm lucky. \n--- The phone will not stay powered off. About 10 seconds after shutting down, the phone turns itself back on unless it is plugged into a USB-A to USB-C charger. Normally this wouldn't be a problem, but given that the phone can't hold a charge, it's a big deal.\n\nI went through the forums and tried every fix I could find. I restarted the phone in recovery mode, saw the little green robot with the red triangle and the \"no command\" text at the bottom of the screen, rebooted into recovery mode...and nothing changed. I did a factory reset, restarting the phone \"as new\" as seen elsewhere on these forums...and nothing changed. If anything, the functionality of the phone slowed down a bit. Basically I went through this thread (https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/12851151?hl=en) and got nowhere.\n\nI'm at a loss at this point. These issues came out of nowhere on a night where the phone was resting on my nightstand. The phone has worn a protective case from the day I got it, It has never been dropped in water, and it has never fallen from more than a foot or so above the ground. I'm blindsided.\n\nAny help would be very much appreciated!",

I can't set it as any built in track, nor a custom.\n\nReinstalling that ringtone maker allows me to use it to set my ringtones. It appears to be the only way I can set a ringtone now.\n\nI am not sure how to remove that app so that I can go back to using the built in Sounds settings app.",

My audiologists told me that ReSound had a 6month exclusive agreement with Google and I can see that there are now more supported HAs.  I was hoping in that time period Android support would improve but does not appear so.\n\nI am having two really annoying issues.\n1-when connected I do not get alerts.  sometimes I will get the last nanosecond of an alert in my hearings aids OR the hearing aids will go momentarily quiet.  I'm guessing that the alert is getting issued before the connection can be completed.  When I disconnect the HAs the alerts come thru loud and clear.  Most of the time I will not get ring tone for an incoming call and for an outgoing call will not hear anything until the connection is made with the person or their VM.\n2-When my car is connected (via BT) the sound is inconsistent.  Sometimes it will come thru the HAs and sometimes it will go thru the car spkr.  Calls as well.  The result is that I have to manually disconnect the HAs for the sound/calls to come thru the car.  You would think there would be a setting to automatically do this, ie, why would I want sound to come thru the HAs in the car especially when an incoming call does NOT turn off an media sound to the car.  When I use Android Auto (via USB/BT) the issue is the same.\n\nI just tried google support - totally worthless.  Had me forget all BT devices and dropped off the chat before I could reply.  \n\nI think these issues just reflect very limited support for HAs.  So disappointing.  I am not an Apple person but can tell from my wife's phone there are much more support options.\n\nIs there a forum where we can lobby Goggle for better support?",

It will also turn off when I go to send a text or open an app when the battery says it's at 40-70%.  In the past, I used to be able to get 8+ hours of consistent use and still have about 15-20% of battery and if I wasn't using it I could get almost 18-24+ hours.  \nI've also noticed it has started to have charging issues when it turns itself off and won't come back up; it will say it's charging and when it actually allows me to restart it after an unnecessarily long wait time there is only 12-15% of battery even if it's been connected for over an hour.  Previously charging this phone was amazing and was usually fully charged within an hour or less no matter what it was plugged into.\nI had it run a battery test multiple times and it says it's fine. \nI tried installing a Kernel to help with battery power/tracking and it's saying that it's using about 13% of it's battery capacity. \nI uninstalled all newly installed apps from right before the battery issues began.\nI factory reset my phone as suggested when I googled the issue (ironically, the first time I tried to search my phone turned itself off).\nTo say this is frustrating is an understatement because I love my phone and it functioned amazingly for a being a year and a half old.  The screen protector has just barely started to crack and chip on the edges at almost 2 years and I've had a Speck case on it since day 1.

I\u2019ve also placed the new SIM card into an extra Pixel 2XL (both phones have previously been active on Verizon and have run LTE just fine). A return trip to Verizon and another new SIM card has them saying the phone is somehow corrupting the SIM card, which is their explanation for why neither phone will connect correctly. \n\nI\u2019ve googled trying to find similar problems, but all I\u2019m finding is broken or damaged SIM cards throwing errors, nothing about the phone (any phone, not even Pixel specific) corrupting the SIM card. \n\nIs this something that happens and how do I fix it?",

    "content": "Hello, \n\nAbout 3 to 4 weeks ago my Pixel 2 XL stopped working with the OEM chargers. I have 3 OEM chargers, and they all stopped working at the same time. When they are plugged in the phone does not recognize them, however they work perfectly with any other USB C device. \n\nThe phone also no longer connects regularly to my laptop via USB C when Power Delivery is enabled on the port. This was another symptom that points to a software issue specific to Power Delivery. It also makes updating the phone via the laptop and adb very difficult. My Phone constantly crashes when plugged into my laptop or 3rd party USB C chargers if Power Delivery in enabled from that source. I have tried cables numerous different brand and quality of cables and the behavior remains the same. If a USB C charger does not use Power Delivery the phone charges, however not rapidly.\n\nAnother strange aspect, but I cannot pin down if it is random or there is a pattern is how Power Delivery chargers work. When I use a charger type for the first time all seems well, power delivery or not. However subsequent attempts with that charger will fail. AN example of this was using the USB C port on the back of my LG monitor. It worked yesterday while I was testing, however when I attempted to use it today it did not work and my phone shutdowns immediately when it's plugged in. The same behavior has been seen with my mac book pro charger and my ZEROLEMON or AUKEY desktop chargers. \n\nI can get my phone to work with a USB C charger/port with Power Delivery randomly, however the majority of times it crashes. When it does crash it goes to the block screen, flashing the charging icon (with the bolt) repeatedly until unplugged, it cannot be started while it remains connected. Once unplugged it shows the battery symbol with the current charge and turns off, at this point the phone can be restarted as normal. \n\nUSB A to USB C is fine for the most part. USB C to USB C without Power Delivery is fine however, even with these chargers the phone does crash randomly. That means alarms are now useless because on a few occasions I have woken up to the phone in a powered-off state, because it crashed overnight while plugged in (USB A to USB C). I have tested this numerous times, with numerous chargers. All theses changers still work fine with any other devices that support USB C and Power Delivery. \n\nThis behavior began after the May update and it would seem this is a software issue and I am trying to figure out how to get it properly escalated so it can be fixed.",

I just tried to hook up the mic and the app/the phone is not recognizing it. I thought maybe it was an internal app setting that I couldn't find, so I reset everything to their default settings in Cinema FV-5, selected the \"external mic\" as audio setting, still nothing. I tried a couple other camera apps, Open Camera and 4k Camera, but neither of them will recognize the external mic. They just default to recording from the phone mic. I tried another microphone- the Rode Videomic, which has it's own power source - but that isn't recognized either. I honestly don't know what happened. This mic worked with the phone for a year. Is there some phone setting I'm not seeing? Is it something post system update (I'm on Android 10). HELP!",

My phone is connected to my headphones for calls (but I don't necessarily know that for certain).\n\n2. I begin dialing, but dialpad tones sound through the phone speaker, which makes me think I may not be BT connected. \n\n3. The icon that shows upon completion of the dialing shows the Speaker icon for a second before switching to the BT icon. \n\n4. So every time I dial, I have a heart-stopping moment of Uh oh, I'm not on bluetooth, I better rip these headphones off before someone answers!\n\nSounds trivial, but my headphones (Bose 700) are multi-device and switch from one sound source to another, so it's possible it's not a BT call. I'd like the dial tones to sound though BT (so I'm reassured my phone is actually using my headphones), and I'd like to see some visual confirmation *before* the call actually connects. I know I can check \"Connected devices\" before initiating each call, and that's what I end up doing because I'm paranoid. Often I start dialing, hear the tones issuing from the phone speaker, and see the Speaker icon, and hang up, check that I'm connected to my headphones (I usually am), and initiate the call again.",

    "content": "OK so I've seen lots of posts about the Pixel 2 Camera failing after a recent update. \n\nI was one of the people affected by this issue. my camera on my Pixel 2 XL didn't suddenly stop working, it started to fail to load a few times and then it started to fail to load a lot of the time. Finally, after a few weeks, it got to the point where the camera failed to load at all.\n\n I contacted support and did all the normal tricks like try a different app, clear cache, uninstall updates, wipe phone none of these things worked. \n\nThe only workaround I found was to wave a small neodymium magnet near the camera while opening the app. This would allow the camera to open.  Once the app was open you need to move the magnet away from the phone or the focus would go all wobbly. \n\nAfter a few more weeks of this, I found it really annoying to have to remember to carry a magnet around in my pocket. I logged a new call with google and they instructed me to RMA the device. about a week and a bit later I received a refurbished phone from google (which was actually pretty nice since the phone was out of warranty by about a month.) \n\nNow this phone was way behind in patches. So as a test I would update and then test the camera and update again and test the camera (all previous apps were loaded) \n\nQP1A.191005.007a1 OK Tested 6 times\nQP1A.191105.004 OK Tested 6 times\nQQ1A.191205.008 OK Tested 6 times\nQQ2A.200305.002 OK Tested 6 times\n\nI actually don't think this is a software update issue. I believe the actuator arm of the camera wears out after about 2 years of heavy use.  I use my camera daily since it's the one I have on me. \n\nI did previously post the logcats where it said the actuator arm failed but the post has since been deleted by someone else. \n\nSo for anyone else out there with a similar pixel 2 camera issue. have you logged it with google?",

The battery will charge while \"frozen\" - the screen is just unresponsive for about a minute before it reboots on it's own requiring my PIN to unlock.  IF it doesn't reboot on its own, I have to do the hard restart (Hold down power and volume down button).  \n\nI have called Google and had a 1:1 chat with them.  They say they have not heard of this problem altho I can find it in these forums and elsewhere.  Every day I send in a report with system logs (Settings>About Phone>Send Feedback). I work for a financial institution with lots of highly configured work apps so doing a factory reset is not an option I want to try and I see it doesn't help others.

    "content": "One day my phone suddenly started showing remaining battery capacity stuck at 6%. The phone did get charge and was working fine but the battery indicator was completely broken. After a week or so, the indicator slowly went down to 1% and the phone started to reboot randomly. After talking to Pixel support, they recommended that I take the phone to a Google certified repair shop.\n\nThe repair shop diagnosed the issue and determined that the phone battery had been melted and damaged the motherboard! There is no way to repair the phone and it needs to be replaced. \n\nThis seems like a major manufacturing flaw and a safety risk to me. The day that the issue started, I wasn't even using my phone. I was just carrying it in my pocket. I think Google should investigate and fix potential software or hardware problems causing this. \n\nGoogle support has been very unhelpful. The phone is outside warranty and they didn't even offer covering replacement cost. \n\nHas anyone else had the same severe issue with the battery damaging the phone under normal usage?",

Another older Android phone (as well as my laptop), works fine as a client for the same hotspot.\n\nTemporary workaround, I have to:\n==========================================\n'Forget' the development device's access point\nRe-connect (re-typing password) to the access point\nWait several seconds until the ..Stay connected?` message appears and tap \"Yes\"\n\nSymptoms; Wi-Fi shows connected but:\n==========================================\nCan't SSH to the development device from the Pixel (using JuiceSSH)\nPhone has an IP yet can't ping the development device (192.168.43.1)\nPhone stays connected to the hotspot but status is:\n              Wi-Fi has no internet access\n      Tap for options\n\n           ..and the below status appears in the Android swipe-down menu:\n\n              This network has no internet access. Stay connected?\n\n           If you tap \"Yes\" and _also_ check the box:\n\n              Don't ask again for this network\n\n           ..it's not clear what this actually does, if anything. A short time later, the hotspot is back to the same broken state. Additionally, the Stay connected?` option is not persistent (disappears when it feels like it) in the Android drop-down drawer.\nSome time after using the temporary workaround, the hotspot is back to the same broken state\n\nI can't imagine this is not a bug. What use-case is there to stay connected to an access point AND deny IP connectivity because there's no public internet access? If there's a health check being performed that fails and causes this, what is the check? HTTP GET to a Google server; ping to a DNS IP etc?\n\nEdit: I ran a packet capture on the dev hotspot and saw DNS requests to connectivtycheck.gstatic.com which lead me to the below post. I tried the below steps and it is working currently (could be too soon to tell).\n  https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/1265464?msgid=1265906\n  Settings > Network & Internet > Wi-Fi > select the \"Settings\" gear icon next to the name of your home network > Advanced > Metered > Treat as Unmetered\n\nMy note about this being a bug is still relevant, to me. If it's going to behave this way, it should describe \"Metered connection\" and hint what that means in one of those pop-ups. I shouldn't have to run packet captures to solve a problem like this.",

Weeks after, every time I watch videos online (e.g. on Facebook/Youtube), it also shuts down.

However, now, the problem came back - it doesn't want to charge again. I even tried on a convenience store but didn't work this time.

    "content": "Hello! I got my Pixel in October and I absolutely love it. There's only one flaw though. I've been a lifetime user of Nova Launcher, which has always been consistently up to date with gestures and the latest aesthetics to come to Android. However, I noticed that in Android 10 (and Android Pie as well) transitions and animations between the Overview menu and the home screen are very choppy. \n\nI've done some research and discovered that this issue is caused by Google integrating the Overview menu with the launcher, which is a fantastic idea. However, it cripples third-party launchers because the app has to have system permissions in order to modify the Overview menu. So, this makes the Pixel Launcher the only launcher that supports Android 10 animations and gestures properly. The only way to solve this is by rooting your device, which I don't want to do. \n\nI know that Google had a similar issue introducing the Android 10 gesture nav system and making it compatible with 3rd party launchers. My question: is Google going to eventually fix this, and allow third-party launchers to modify the Overview menu? I would really hate to see Android turn into iOS, with no options available.\n\nThanks!",

It works but the problem is that it turns mobile data on for all apps (not just mms).  And to make matters worse it leaves mobile data on and doesn't automatically turn it back off.  This resulted in me getting a huge data overage bill with MOBILE DATA OFF!  So is this going to be fixed in Android 11?  Either mobile data can only be used for MMS (like the option implies)? Or can it at least turn mobile data back off after allowing the MMS to come through?  Thank you.",

I spent a lot of time emailing back and forth with Google and they said I have to wipe the phone and redo everything from scratch for them to know if it's a hardware or software issue before they can help. I may have to do that and spend hours resetting many apps to the way I want them because this phone is actually good in other ways with a good battery. I prefer the phone to phone transfer if I have to get another replacement phone. I'm wondering if that method would transfer the same bad camera app or if the app would already be loaded on a new phone and should be safe to transfer the rest by cable from phone to phone.",

I was astonished when I realized that I was not even capable of setting up the device. I feel the need to mention that I am not able to use cellular data on this device as it does not have a SIM card in it (I primarily use WI-FI as a substitute for cellular data). I was able to skip the activation portion of the phone's set-up sequence, however, as I was configuring the phone, a message popped up saying that bluetooth was not functioning properly. I ignore it, and moved on to the next step. It asked me for a WI-FI network because I could not use cellular data, but none of them were appearing. It's telling me that there are no WI-FI hotspots in my location, and that both my IP address as well as my MAC address are unavailable. I hope you see my predicament here. I can't use cellular data because I have no service or SIM card & I can't use WI-FI because no networks are appearing. I was told that this was due to my router being misconfigured, but that's literally impossible considering I have 12 other devices that are running perfectly & are connected to it as we speak. It also doesn't make sense that it wouldn't show any of my neighbors' networks if it was truly just mine that was affected. I have spent hours on the community forums & help guides written by Google to no avail. I have tried going into \"safe mode,\" I have tried wiping all data from the device & factory resetting it, and nothing works. I even had an actual Google customer service employee try to tell me that I needed to update my device's operating system... Let me ask you this, genius, how can you expect me to update my device using WI-FI when the whole reason I contacted you was because I couldn't connect to it on said device in the first place? It seems to me that the combination of narcissistic deception & a general lack of common sense has plagued customer support. To make matters worse, I have found dozens of people complaining about issues very similar to mine, yet they have not received any assistance in over a year. PLEASE HELP ME RESOLVE THIS ISSUE!",

    "content": "I know there have been a number of reports of issues with Pixel wireless charging or maybe issues with Android 11, in general. But, I haven't seen a report of my specific symptoms so I thought I'd add them.\n\nA lot of the time wireless charging seems to work well on the multiple Qi chargers I have around the house. All support Qi EPP at up to 15W with a 25W QC adapter, or \"12-13W\" with the QC 2.0 adapter curiously supplied with the charger.\n\nOccasionally though, for seemingly no good reason charging will rapidly grind to a halt, for example saying that the phone is at x% (50, 60, 80, 90 - it doesn't seem specific to a particular battery level), with an estimated many, many hours to completion eg. 13 hours. Even rebooting the phone or moving it to another charger does not seem to fix it. The back of the phone in this situation is kinda warm, so maybe it has thermally throttled. But, there is no good reason why this would have happened - the phone is not being heavily used at the time, it is not in a hot location, really nothing is different to the other times when charging works perfectly.\n\nUsing a tool to look at the battery the charging power has dropped to 0.2-0.5W, which explains the long charging time! The battery temperature is shown at about 38C. I'm unaware of what temperature thermal throttling should occur.\n\nSo, it seems, at times the Pixel 5 (and other Android 11 phones?) seems to just about shut down wireless charging, even in circumstances of use and location, when this should not be necessary. It may possibly be caused by overheating. I guess this could be caused by one or more processors being stuck in a high power state.\n\nHopefully, this may help in identifying the issue.",

Yesterday it was in my pocket all day, I barely touched it and it died. It gets to about 10-13% battery and then it shuts down. \n\nAs of today I spent hours following the Google battery drain tips.

The only thing I didn't do besides paying here was to put it in safe mode. So I did that tonight to see the power drain is caused by an app (and yes I already deleted junk files, opened up storage, deleted unused apps, deleted widgets, and battery check says everything is normal...)

I have a feeling that the CA setting only appears if LTE is connected.  Since turning LTE on is so unstable that I can not get it to show LTE for more than a few seconds.\nTherefore, how can I turn off the Carrier Aggregation mode if I cannot keep LTE on long enough?\nI could be wrong, but I believe that would solve the issue and still give me better performance than my current 3G setting.",

    "content": "I have an original Pixel XL, since 2017.  Use daily for work.  After the Android 10, the battery life was cut in half.  At the most I am getting approximately 2 hours of active use.  The battery under Android 9 would run approximately 4 to 5 hours of heavy use.\n\nRecently, the phone started shutting down with between 20% and 30% of power still shown on the indicator.  After reading through the troubleshooting notes, I performed a hard reboot after I had charged the phone to 100%.  After the phone rebooted, the battery indicator showed 73% battery life.  I placed the phone on the charger and it charged another 25 min approx and reached 100 percent again.  Another hard reboot, and the phone still showed 100%.  If I use the phone under heavy use after the hard reboot, my battery life is closer to 4 hours again.  However, it seems there is an App or a setting under Android 10 that is affecting both the battery life and the accuracy of the battery indicator, because after some use, the phone will return to it's previous behavior and require another hard reboot.\n\nI have two Pixel XL phones and these issues only started after the upgrade to Android 10.  I also own a Nexus 6, still going strong and recently purchased a Pixel 4 XL.\n\nI am hoping that Google is paying attention to these posts and provides a fix for their original Pixel customers instead of leaving them hanging with a final update to Android 10 with inherent battery issues.  Their loyal Pixel / Nexus customers don't deserve this issue to be ignored.",

I can still swipe back and forth to get to other apps and swiping from the edge to go back still works. The other navigation options work fine tho.

Like for example when I go to the Play store search for app and then tap on the app on the big horizontal green install button I cannot tap it I have to scroll to get that button out of the area and then press install.\n\nI have tried factory resetting however that almost locked me out of the phone because the lower section when you're just starting up that says \"start\" I couldn't touch it. I had to use the magnification option to get it a little bigger and then repeatedly tap it.",
