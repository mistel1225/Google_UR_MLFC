After the phone is turned off and back on, any wi-fi the phone previously recognized has \"limited connectivity\" (which basically means that there is none), and if I try to use my LTE network, it claims to be connected, but will not run any internet based services. The only solution I have found to this problem is factory resetting my phone. I have had to factory reset my phone three times in the past five days, and the problem is becoming a nuisance.

I used to be able to do it on Android 10 and the 11 beta, but my ability to use the hotspot feature hasn't worked at all since getting to Android 11. Things I've tried.\n1) Full phone reset. This does nothing. You turn it on as soon as everything settles and no internet sharing.\n2) Turn bluetooth off and restart phone. Worked for a hot second, but can't repeat success.\n3) Go to APN settings and change from IP4 to IP4/IP6 connection and turn on hotspot. Works once, then never again.\nI've owned a Nexus 4 (Dead digitizer even if phone looks like new) and OG Pixel (Replaced due bad antennae reception. Otherwise works and also looks like new). This phone hasn't had a hardware issue, but it's frustrating that such a crucial feature this year is broken on a high end phone more likely than not because of bad software.",

Lo and Behold,  SAME problem.   Does not connect to my car Bluetooth,  doesn't connect to my Sous Vide, Soundbar, nVidia Shield.    \n\nWhat's interesting, is my car doesn't see the device, but then displays the Bluetooth MAC of the phone,  then fails when connecting.   My phone DOES NOT see the Bluetooth name of my car.   However,  my phone does see Bluetooth names of other devices listed above, it simply fails to connect to any of them.\n\nWhip out the old Pixel 2... boom, connects to all devices listed above without issue.\n\nPlease advise.

    "content": "Selfies taken using the front camera on my Pixel 5 are being noticeably retouched during image processing, despite face retouching being disabled on my device. It's unclear if this is a bug or intended camera behavior.\n\nI've done some testing on my own and observed that selfies taken with the front facing camera undergo the following changes even with retouching disabled:\ngeneral loss of sharpness (smoothing of skin)\nremoval or reduction of visible blemishes\nconsiderable lightening of skin tone\n\nThe result, after processing, is a photo that often looks unnatural, waxy, and overcorrected.\n\nIn my own testing, enabling retouching caused the same changes listed above, but moreso. I've also determined that this is not due to the portrait lighting feature, since turning this feature off in google photos produces the original retouched photo.\n\nIn addition to feeling like unintended behavior, since the change is highly noticeable and fairly drastic,  it also flies in the face of Google's recent, highly-publicized decision to disable retouching by default on its devices. Unwanted facial retouching can be highly damaging to users' self-image, and it's also causing a general lack of image fidelity\u2014my face looks less detailed, as if the image quality has been downgraded by the device.\n\nI'm including some samples of my testing here:\n\nThe first photo is a side-by-side comparison of the before and after images. The top photo is the original image, pre-processing (Screenshot taken from the gallery). The bottom image is the retouched selfie.\n\nThis is the processed and visibly retouched image, by itself:\n\n\nNote the general lack of fidelity when comparing the final image to the original.\n\nFinally, I have attached a recording of my camera app, documenting the process of taking a photo, viewing it in the gallery app, and the image dramatically changing when processing is complete. Note that my face is a completely different tone.\n\nI've discussed this with other pixel users, who have described similar results with their own photos: a loss of image quality, unnatural looking photos, feeling like a mask is being applied to their photos taken with the front-facing camera. This is a worrying trend for me, and for these other users, because it suggests google has incorporated facial retouching directly into its HDR+ image processing where it cannot be disabled by the end user.\n\nIs this behavior intentional? It seems antithetical to google's own public positions on facial retouching. I'd appreciate feedback from other users about this.",

    "content": "I was refreshing the Google store, waiting for the Pixel 4 XL launch.  When it popped up, I immediately used my Pixel 3 XL to add an Orange 128 GB Pixel 4 XL to my order and proceeded to check out.  At the trade-in option screen, however, Pixel 3 XL (or Pixel 3) was not listed as an option (I have a time-stamped photo of this).  I backed out and tried multiple times - nothing.  I tried on a computer (Pixelbook) to see if it was a mobile glitch, nothing.  Then - briefly, it showed 3 XL as a trade-in, so I selected it -- but received a message saying it was not eligible.  I backed out to try again, and 3 XL was gone as an option to even select again.  So, I placed my order, to preserve my place in line.\n\nAbout ten minutes later, I checked again, and Pixel 3 XL was now a trade-in option, and it was allowing it to be added to the order.  The problem now was that the orange 128 GB Pixel 4 XL was waitlisted.  I spoke with Google chat, and during that session the orange 4 Pixel XL 128 GB became available again - but, with a 4-5 week wait time when my current wait time is estimated in under a week.  I was told this was my only option (to replace the order) to tie the trade-in to the order.  \n\nI found the resolution unacceptable given the circumstances and chose to maintain my original order.  I find it odd that they can't modify an order with such a simple option, or create a trade-in separately, or any sort of resolution.  \n\nAnyone else experience this or similar?",

It is fixed focused 10 feet behind the subject, even at the recommended distance of 18\" or more - the subject remains out of focus and blurry while the background is crisply in focus.\n\nHere's a test my professional video engineer dad ran on the 4a front-facing camera:\n\n\"The problem is a design or manufacturing fault.  Here are photos of the Pixel front facing camera as delivered and with a +2 or +3 close-up filter.  There are focus star charts at the subject distance of 14\" and also in the background at 9 feet.  As set at the factory the background is more or less in focus, but the subject is not.  It's better with a +2 close-up filter taped over the camera lens, and perfect with a +3 close-up filter.  Clearly the camera is not focused properly, either because the wrong focal length was spec'd or delivered for the camera, or because the lens is too close to the sensor.  The simplest fix for existing phones, under the circumstances, would be for Google to admit the camera has a fault, and send a small stick-on +3 close-up filter to place over the camera lens to anyone who requests one.\"\n\nStep up Google, and make good on your defective camera.",

I'm looking for advice on how to fix these issues. List as follows\n\nFirst update to android 11:\nspotify wouldnt close\nsirius xm wouldnt open or close\nchrome wouldnt close or would crash randomly\nwouldnt receive texts randomly from people. not all the time just a random text here or there. i use the built in messages app for texting\nphone wouldnt connect to wifi sometimes. it would say its connected but i actually had to signal\ni couldnt make wifi change to a different network\nphone wouldnt connect to data when i turned off wifi\nbluetooth on my hands free headset wouldnt work sometimes but other times it did. bluetooth in my car worked fine though all the time? (like pausing or skipping songs)\nAll the issues above could be temporarily fixed by rebooting the phone. usually needed to do so about 3-4 times per day. So I was running out of patience waiting for updates to fix this and decided to factory reset.\nAfter factory reset some issues are solved for now. These still remain:\nfirst and foremost I GET HALF TEXTS NOW FOR NO REASON!?!?!?! I will literally get the end of a text but not the first part of it so it makes it a BIT confusing????\nSpotify still doesnt work properly, wont close sometimes, displays wrong song thats playing\nbluetooth headset still fails to pause and skip songs correctly\nchrome now refuses to reload a webpage when it has downloaded it for offline use (this is a new feature since factory reset)\nThis is all the new issues since the factory reset (I did this about 2 days from time of writing) and I am completely fed up with this update. Like really? I get that the 3rd party app issues are probably not Google's domain to fix but MESSAGES??? The main function of a cellphone is to contact people through voice or text and the one that is used most is now VERY unreliable!!!!\n\nI'm sick of this update and I've only had it for about 2 weeks now. I'm at a loss for what to do next because as far as I can tell I've done everything short of getting a new phone. Which is what... 1 year old? Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!",

It's my first day with it. What can I do?",

Is there a way to ensure that WiFi stays connected when the phone is idle?\n\nMy guess is there's an option in the Battery Optimization setting, but none of the 100+ apps in there are obvious to me because they don't specifically say WiFi.\n\nMy other guess is some problem related with Android's Doze feature. Apparently in earlier versions of Android you could easily make an adjustment to keep WiFi on but I haven't found a way for Android 10, so here I am...\n\nAnd for those curious, the larger issue here is that  when I receive a phone call, in certain circumstances, the phone only rings for one second on my end. Then the ringing stops and the call notification disappears. But for the person calling, the phone continues to ring and they eventually get sent to voicemail. My cell service is Republic Wireless which primarily operates over WiFi. I have run a number of tests and the only condition where the one-second ring occurs is when the phone has been connected to WiFi, then it's idle for a while and I receive a phone call. The phone is disconnected from WiFi when the call comes in. Then it reconnects, but at that point it's too late, the option to answer the call is already gone. If I'm off WiFi completely, calls come in just fine. And if I'm on WiFi and the phone has been interacted with within the past few minutes, the call comes through, likely because the WiFi hasn't disconnected yet.",

    "content": "Hello, \n\nAbout 3 to 4 weeks ago my Pixel 2 XL stopped working with the OEM chargers. I have 3 OEM chargers, and they all stopped working at the same time. When they are plugged in the phone does not recognize them, however they work perfectly with any other USB C device. \n\nThe phone also no longer connects regularly to my laptop via USB C when Power Delivery is enabled on the port. This was another symptom that points to a software issue specific to Power Delivery. It also makes updating the phone via the laptop and adb very difficult. My Phone constantly crashes when plugged into my laptop or 3rd party USB C chargers if Power Delivery in enabled from that source. I have tried cables numerous different brand and quality of cables and the behavior remains the same. If a USB C charger does not use Power Delivery the phone charges, however not rapidly.\n\nAnother strange aspect, but I cannot pin down if it is random or there is a pattern is how Power Delivery chargers work. When I use a charger type for the first time all seems well, power delivery or not. However subsequent attempts with that charger will fail. AN example of this was using the USB C port on the back of my LG monitor. It worked yesterday while I was testing, however when I attempted to use it today it did not work and my phone shutdowns immediately when it's plugged in. The same behavior has been seen with my mac book pro charger and my ZEROLEMON or AUKEY desktop chargers. \n\nI can get my phone to work with a USB C charger/port with Power Delivery randomly, however the majority of times it crashes. When it does crash it goes to the block screen, flashing the charging icon (with the bolt) repeatedly until unplugged, it cannot be started while it remains connected. Once unplugged it shows the battery symbol with the current charge and turns off, at this point the phone can be restarted as normal. \n\nUSB A to USB C is fine for the most part. USB C to USB C without Power Delivery is fine however, even with these chargers the phone does crash randomly. That means alarms are now useless because on a few occasions I have woken up to the phone in a powered-off state, because it crashed overnight while plugged in (USB A to USB C). I have tested this numerous times, with numerous chargers. All theses changers still work fine with any other devices that support USB C and Power Delivery. \n\nThis behavior began after the May update and it would seem this is a software issue and I am trying to figure out how to get it properly escalated so it can be fixed.",

Often, my phone will see the headphones, attempts to pair, and then fails.  Note that I also posted an issue today with the Bluetooth to my 2011 BMW 3 Series.  I am starting to feel like the common problem is the phone.",

Even after 2hrs of inactivity letting it run in the background - which I'm pretty confident it's not running at all, given there's absolutely no way to see progress of any sort.\n\nThe only way is either to flash manually or via pixel tool, either way, both requires me to be at home and I'm mostly working.

I can send texts normally, but the problems arise when they respond.\n1)  Weird thing is their SMS and MMS normally shows up in the same text thread (almost like there's 3 ppl in the group) and sometimes shows up as a separate thread, but either way the SMS shows up as them (ie their contact pic, correct contact info), but the MMS texts just show up as the 044 # as if it's a stranger.\n2) When I create a group text (2+ people) it goes out normally, but when anyone on the thread responds, it creates a new thread with the 044 # instead of the contacts real #.\n\nI called Verizon and had a nice guy help with trying to research but he was just google searching like me.  I've tried the below to no avail:\n1) Erasing the contact completely from my phone & from contacts.google.com\n2) IT 101 stuff: making sure OS is up to date, restarting device (I really don't want to \"factory reset\" without good logic behind that, grr)\n3) checked the \"region\" settings.

But since the Feb update I have been experiencing touch problems on my 4a 5G, but these seem different than others that have been mentioned.\n\nIts a little hard to characterize. The problems seem to occur just after awakening the phone by finger touch. The first touch action on the screen then often is wrong. I click on an icon and instead of launching that app it does something else. Sometimes it brings up the apps screen. Other times it does *something* (uncertain what) and then repaints the home screen.\n\nAfter that it seems to return to normal operation. This is not crippling, but it is annoying.\n\nHas anyone else seen this? Is there a fix?",

When I open the phone app the mobile number is displayed as \"Other\" which is why the assistant isn't able to find it.

I've had a look online and have found that I can say \"OK Google, take a photo\" and this does technically work, but that takes about 10 seconds in total which isn't ideal. \n\nMy old Samsung phone let me just say \"shoot\" with the camera app open and it would instantly take a photo.

I was told a supervisor would get back to me. The supervisor got back to me after 1 FULL day and parroted the exact same line - just saying that they absolutely needed me to do a factory reset. If that did not fix it, they would look into what else could be done. \n\nBeing an engineer, I asked as to what other troubleshooting were they looking for. 12 hours later, he responds saying that they are trying to understand if it is a HW or SW issue. If the issue persisted, he vaguely said he would look into talking about warranty options.\n\nI have now done a factory reset and the issue still exists. I reached out via chat and was told that support cannot help as it is with a specialist. The specialist will get back to me within 24-48 hours! \n\nThere is absolutely no way to get a faster response.\n\nI am stunned that a company the size of google has such limited staff that they take 24-48 hours to respond, and they have such a poor support structure that no one deviates from a very set script - repeating and parroting the same lines again and again.\n\nAt this point, I am just frustrated with the Pixel support experience and wanted to share these experiences with the broader audience so people know what to expect!",

After logging in with my SIMcard i get offered to either connect the pixel to one of my previous phones via USB connection, or update it via my google account. \n\nSince i dont have my old device i usually update via my google account. But i cant get there. The phone asks me to put in my phones old lock code, and then gets me back to the \"connect your old phone\" menue. \n\nI am not experienced enough to flash the phone with an older version of android, as the browser tool can't connect to my phone and i am not 100% sure if i activated USB debbuging when it worked last time.",

My husband and I started with the original Pixel phone and are now into the 4th and 5th generations.  We have been very happy with Google.  Until now. Google used to stand behind their products.  I've only had my Pixel 4a for a month and a half.  The screen on my phone shattered from a minor drop ONTO CARPET, even though it landed flat.  Of course, Google will tell you this is not covered under warranty or anything, that you need to shell out the money to fix it.  While generally this is understandable if you have had the phone for a long time, it does not bode well when one has only had the phone for a short period of time.  We had something similar happen to the original Pixel and Google stood behind their product.  They believed that the glass was defected, should not have done that, and immediately replaced it.  THAT is good customer service.  Unfortunately, this is no longer the case.  Now, of course, they'll tell you that the 4a has Gorilla Glass 3, which is supposed to be super tough and durable.  Apparently, this is a lie.  Read above.  I am very disappointed with the manufacturing of this product, the poor customer service from Google, the lack of standing behind their product, their care of their customers.  While some may think I'm just being a \"Karen\" in this circumstance, I assure you I am not.  I have been given the run around by Google on this and I felt I needed to let others know.  I've been a Google supporter for many years because they used to treat people right.  Now my faith has been shaken, especially in the quality of their products.",

Today I am feeling sorry for her vs. frustrated last night.\n\nBasically, I learned they do not support Pixel very well for automated media backup.\n\nThat's no surprise. Most automated backup/sync doesn't work how I expect/want, so finding a way to do it manually is my goal.\n\nTheir drag/drop or select from device are impractical (Pixel plugged into W7 laptop to access Pixel folders for Verizon Cloud doesn't respond to drag/drop. Selecting from menu only supports one file at a time & forgets what directory you were using every time).\n\nSo I tried to use Verizon Cloud Sync folder on the laptop. I was able to copy content to the VC Sync folder but their user interface is not very responsive or meaningful. It's very quick to tell you all Sync, Backup & Restore processes are completed. It says that by default. One time I saw it say it had completed file uploads, then how many files were awaiting processing. That number did not change overnight. I can understand it taking time, but either it wasn't working at all, or won't change status until the entire process is completed. (Really, not the default 'completed' display).\n\nHas anyone determined if there is a way to use Verizon Cloud manually, automatically, effectively, or at all?\n\nI am leaning strongly toward calling it, at worst, unusable or at best, having a woefully inadequate UI.\n\nThank you\n\nMurray",

The account is still saying it's tied up in my dead phone. I need help. I've tried the support ticket multiple times where it says they'll get back to me after 3-5 agonizing days to return with a big fat \"can't verify it's you.\" I filled out another one today after waiting a few weeks to see if that helped. What kind of information do I need to put out there to verify it's me? Previous posts have included specific Amazon account purchases, which I'm still logged into from my current computer. I even specified a purchase of a new vehicle which should still be getting emails from the dealership. I'm really at a loss, and seeing as though one of my Minecraft account tied to the email is going to migrate over to a Microsoft-specific new service, looks like I'm going to have to purchase Minecraft again because of it.\n\nBelow are some of the walls I keep hitting, by design of course, but frustrating nonetheless.

    "content": "There is an obscure feature that few phone makers other than Google include in their phones. According to the internet forums and my personal experience so far, this feature is broken in most of the warranty replacement phones shipped by Google. Nobody but Google can repair it. Because of its obscurity and technical nature, few support personnel are understanding or sympathetic. I think there may be some kind of bureaucratic disconnect that is preventing this issue from being addressed, or Google has decided the number of affected users is too small to be worth the resources needed to fix the flaw in their refurbishment process. The name of the feature is \"unlockable bootloader\".\n\nGoogle has shipped me 2 broken phones so far in their attempt to remedy an unrelated defect in my original Pixel 2. I just finished the phone call to have the second replacement exchanged for a third replacement. Both times the support technician has in the end told me that there's nothing they are allowed to do for me other than fill out an order form for another refurbished phone and leave a comment in the order for the fulfillment team to read. Requesting an unlockable bootloader in the comment didn't work the first time and, based on the forum posts I've seen, I have my doubts that it will ever change anything.\n\nI don't know what else to do, so I intend to keep sending them in for a replacement until I receive one that isn't broken.\n\nFor community reference, I can see on the RMA information that the refurbishment is being handled by an external company, \"Cynergy\". A quick web search shows that this is probably their website: http://www.cynergyus.com/. Anyone else interested in devices with unlockable bootloaders should probably be wary of manufacturers that partner with Cynergy.\n\nTechnical log:\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\nC:\\Program Files (x86)\\Android\\android-sdk\\platform-tools>fastboot flashing get_unlock_ability\n                                                   (bootloader) get_unlock_ability: 1\nOKAY [  0.001s]\nFinished.

Acquire a refurbished Google Pixel 2. (GA00126-US-RA)\n\n2. Power it on without inserting a SIM card and skip everything in the initial setup.\n\n3. Unlock the secret \"Developer options\" by tapping 7 times on \"Build number\" in the \"About phone\" settings page.\n\n4. Enter the \"System\" settings page, enter the \"Developer options\" sub-page, and find the \"OEM unlocking\" setting near the top.\n\n5. Because OEM unlocking is greyed out and says \"Connect to the internet or contact your carrier\", connect the phone to a Wi-Fi. (Set the connection to \"metered\" while adding the Wi-Fi to prevent it from wastefully downloading updates.)\n\n6. After some time, reopen developer options and enable OEM unlocking. (Note: I have found that the setting of this slider and the state of get_unlock_ability persists across factory resets. At this step after doing a factory reset, you will find the slider is already enabled from the last time. The setting being greyed out or not does not affect get_unlock_ability.)\n\n7. Completely shut down the device by holding the power button for a few seconds and selecting \"Power off\".\n\nhttps://source.android.com/setup/build/running#booting-into-fastboot-mode\n\n8. Enter fastboot mode: \"Press and hold Volume Down, then press and hold Power.\" Let go of the power button once the phone vibrates but keep holding the volume button. (If you continue holding the power button you will accidentally trigger the \"Start\" command from the fastboot menu.)\n\n9. Connect the device to a PC with \"Android SDK\" and \"Google USB Driver\" installed.\n\n10. Open Command Prompt on the PC.\n\n11. Run a command to navigate to the SDK platform tools folder: cd /d \"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Android\\android-sdk\\platform-tools\"\n\n12. Run the command to verify that you have enabled OEM unlocking: fastboot flashing get_unlock_ability\n\nCommand response should be: (bootloader) get_unlock_ability: 1\nIf it responds \"get_unlock_ability: 0\" then OEM unlocking was not enabled properly at step 6.\n\n13. Run the command to unlock the bootloader: fastboot flashing unlock\n\nInstead of initiating the bootloader unlock process on the phone screen, command response is: FAILED (remote: 'Flashing Unlock is not allowed')\n\nIf you boot back to the normal system at this point, you will find the \"OEM unlocking\" slider is greyed out again no matter what the internet state is. get_unlock_ability is still 1. It can only be un-greyed by doing a factory reset and starting over from step 1, but you will find at step 6 that it is already enabled. Disabling, rebooting, and enabling again does not help.\n\n\nFurther reading:\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRMA phone from Google is not unlocking the bootloader\nhttps://forum.xda-developers.com/pixel-2/help/rma-phone-google-unlocking-bootloader-t3937931\n\nOEM Unlocking Grayed out on non-VZW Pixel 2.\nhttps://forum.xda-developers.com/pixel-2/help/oem-unlocking-grayed-vzw-pixel-2-t3776763\n\nPSA: RMA refurbished Pixel 2's can NOT be bootloader unlocked.\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/9xcdle/psa_rma_refurbished_pixel_2s_can_not_be/\n\nCannot unlock Pixel 2 bootloader\nhttps://issuetracker.google.com/issues/73217322\n\nWeb Search: \"get_unlock_ability: 1\" \"Flashing Unlock is not allowed\"\nhttps://www.google.com/search?q=\"get_unlock_ability%3A+1\"+\"Flashing+Unlock+is+not+allowed\"\n\n(Unrelated bug: This message board does not support links ending in a quote mark, even if you manually set the link target in the editor.)",

I would like it if someone could work with me to find a proper solution for my problem.\n\nMy work is still living in the past and due to the nature of our work it makes sense. Security is very high on our networks. We don't have WiFi in any of the buildings, our firewall blocks everything that is entertaining (Netflix, YouTube, Twitter), and we are unable to connect any other device to the network without the security guys coming down and screaming at us. Just one TV in the break room with a DVD player, no cable. We also work 12 hour shifts and I can't look at the news sites any longer to pass the time.\n\nI would like to download movies or shows to my phone or use the download for offline feature that many apps offer like Netflix and YouTube. Or even use my data when I can. I want to connect my phone to a TV or projector over HDMI so I can enjoy them on the big screen.\n\nI know Google dosn't add the OTG feature to their lineup anymore in favour of the wireless cast feature. BUT COMMON!!! There has to be a way that I can use the USB-C port with some sort of hub to get HDMI. I am sure Google can implement this with a software update.\n\nCan someone help me on this. Is it possible to cast to a chromecast with absolutly no internet/data over WiFi direct? (is that still here, thought I heard it was going to be removed soon)\n\nThanks,\nBen",

    "content": "I stumbled across an issue today, where our Internet service was interrupted,  when my new Pixel came to the house!  Without Internet service, I can't set up my Google Pixel Replacement, so this is feedback related to the product, for a broad portion of people in the USA, who have no WIFI & Internet service is to expensive!  I have consistently been using mobile computers for media content creation, using hot spots, home wifi, without a data plan, which they can be really expensive!  Can Google make a stand alone Pixel, where we don't need to be signed in to an account, yet we can still used the mobile computer! I've used Samsung before, & I would be able to turn on a Samsung Galaxy immediately, & use it without signing in to an account!  I started panicing a bit, thinking 5 G meant taking away our cable & all we would have is WIFI service, & then I would not be able to use my Google Pixel at all!!   If I had no Google Account, previous to receiving my Google Pixel, I can't use it anyway for pictures, video, journaling & note taking!  Can Google make a Google Single Pixel,  which means the computer can be used, without an account & you don't need to be signed in to someone else's account to use the Google Single Pixel!? You just turn it on & use it, then sign in to your Google Account if you have one!   \n\nIdeally, I still wish we had free internet so everyone can use the Internet due to the folks on fixed incomes as they age!   On a fixed income, how do retired seniors, & US Military Veterans get their pay, & social security benefits, without  Internet Service in rural parts of the country & the price of inflated internet service, with monetary growth in mind for wall street profits, yet retired folks, millennials, veterans pay are on a fixed income & won't be able to keep up with inflated Internet Service!  \n\nAnother concern I have is, without Internet service, I would not be able to detach the Google Pixel 3a I am returning to Google, from my Google Account!  Currently I won't add any banking for this reason due to the security risks of a 3rd party accessing my financial account by law enforcement taking mobile computers!   I keep revisiting in my mind, when I was arrested,  & the local law enforcement had full access to my Google Account including Google Adsense & my Banking & all my passwords to other accounts! While I was in jail, I had no way to shut off my mobile computer from my Google Account! My husband said that should teach what not to write, & it serves me right!  He said he don't care about the First Amendment when what I say brings the police around!  He approves of violating the first amendment using censorship, because he is using it as a control mechanism to gas light, to yell & scream in a man baby fit of rage!   He threw me under the bus, & has threatened divorce, several times since I was arrested, after I used my youtube revenue to help pay for the house, when times were really good! When the police got a search warrant & my husband would not stand up for me, & defend my first amendment, & he told the police to keep me, the police then had my banking information, & youtube pay information!  HE even broke a new computer 2 weeks later, because I had to buy a new computer, not having a computer, over a video I made about discrimination in advertising!  The last time he threatened to break my computer equipment was about 4-6 weeks ago, when he was raging! Maybe its the medications or his medical issues, I don't know but he is over medicated & I have no help for him!  I have no place to share feedback, where I feel safe, away from, \"SPOUSE RETALIATION\", over how I feel!   For 14+ months, they have had my computer equipment,  confiscated for an on going investigation!  Funny how that works, when I was being carefree, thought I has a real relationship, but I see things a lot different now!  Why would I help pay for a house, if I knew 16 years ago, all he thought of our relationship is me as a throwaway renter, serving some sick twisted agenda of his, which he kept hidden!  How can someone you thought cared about you, disassociate so swiftly, due to his own discomfort, using it as control in a relationship?  \n\nThank you to those who have shown me something different, & empowered my life education to my 2nd marriage because it was not at all what I thought!  If I would have know this, I would have put the $366,000+ I earned on youtube in to the bank, instead of buying the house in a fema flood zone & paying off vehicles! Hindsight is 20/20!  That way I could have quietly left, which is what he has told me to do on several occasions!  I am just at a point of indifference towards marriage & indentured servitude thru marriage, which violates the 13th amendment, & is slavery!",

They complain that i'm either too quiet or in a tunnel, so i have to find a decent spot, don't move and shout to be heard.\n\nBut's it's not the network.  Am also having to use an old Samsung Galaxy S5 and it's as clear as anything, no issues.\n\nI had a situation yesterday when a customer couldn't hear me on a normal voice call and we had to switch to a WhatsApp call, which was totally clear.\n\nAnd it's not a one off Pixel 3 phone either.  Been in touch with support, who are all very friendly and help out but all i end up is going through various steps like updating the phone, go into safe mode and then reset the phone.  Still with no solution in site.\n\nAnd so i've followed the next step of sending it back to them and getting a replacement.  Three times!  So i've had four Pixel 3s with exactly the same problem.\n\nAnd today's offer by the support team, who promised to \"look at all the options available once we've gone through the process\", is to yet again offer another replacement.\n\nI'm not sure when this will get resolved, if ever.  10 phones?  15 phones?  Or perhaps wait until it goes out of warranty and then it's not a Google problem any more.\n\nBeen told that as i bought it through a retailer, nothing else can be done.  Of course something else can be done (they make a few billion profits don't they?!?!) but that's the standard line i'm being fed.\n\nI'm really not sure anyone can help but here goes a post anyway!\n\nCheers\n\nNigel",

The volume decreases and sounds terrible.\n\nSo I go to the 'user' setting and increase the graphics higher to increase sound levels.  It does the total opposite and makes the volume even quieter as if there's a major limiter on the EQ's\n\nNow in my experience when adjusting EQ's, like the Bass, Mid & Trebles, they get louder, just like on DJ Decks. \n\nWhy does the EQ on the phone decrease sound quality and make it sound appalling?\n\nI even downloaded another App and used the EQ settings on that App (had the option to use the app EQ or the phones EQ) and still had the same issue when using both.\n\nAnd I've turned off Absolute Volume which has done sweet F.A. so that's re-enabled. \n\nAny reason why I cannot enjoy music how I want it.

This has got me stumped as I think what could be causing this to only impact some websites/apps but not all.\n\nToday I was streaming music via Amazon whilst driving, initially still buffered from the house wifi, but it soon cut out and could not be restarted. I pulled into a garage and found that I could stream a movie via Amazon Prime app, but not play music or use the amazon shopping app either. I could send and receive messages in Whatsapp and go to most websites, but again not outlook.\nI tried restarting the device. Clearing the cache of the apps and the google app itself, no change. Tried turning mobile data on/off and going into aeroplane mode and back again, no difference. I gave up, but found I could play streaming music through Google Play app, so did that instead. Later I checked again and all seemed fine (amazon music played ok and outlook loaded instantly) so I left things as they were, but once again the problem re-occurred when I was heading home.\n\nI've been driving around quite a lot listening to music and podcasts and it has only recently become very noticeable, but I've not really thought too much of it as it was very sporadic, but that was likely down to the stay at home measures and now it is becoming much more problematic.\n\nAny ideas? Is there something really obvious I've missed? All apps are set to stream on mobile data (and as I mentioned, they will work at some times, not others, regardless of the displayed phone signal and ability to visit other website/stream other apps). \n\nI tried loading in safe mode, but I get no signal at all there (should I?) so could not test. I've performed a factory reset and the problem persists. I've put the sim back in my old phone and all worked fine on mobile data. As soon as I put the sim back in my 3a the problem returned, so it is definitely to do with the phone and not the network provider.",

Why would call screen have a separate option on how to handle first time callers if first time callers are caught by the \"Possibly Faked Numbers\" category?

My guess it's the adapter not properly transmitting the current to my charger and onto my phone, thus the burnt electrodes.\n\nThey worked perfectly fine the first few days of having it, and I believe, continued to do so until this very morning. It's either the charger or the adapter, my guess is the latter.

    "content": "I just upgraded my Pixel XL 3 to Pixel 5. Yesterday I tried to pair it with my Honda Accord 2018 HandsFreeLink but the connection couldn't get established. Out of 20 times retry 1 is successful. I never had any problem with Pixel 3 XL and I was satisfied with it.\nI tried to clear my car from old connections and also did the same from my phone. Actually I reset all network connections on my phone. I tried to change AVRCP to 1.3 and 1.4 in developers mode but nothing has changed.\nI have LG Velvet and LG G7 both are able to connect to the car. LG Velvet is lagging sometimes and erroring out but eventually can connect. But Pixel 5 cannot.\nsometimes I receive this message on car screen: \"Paring code could not be verified. Pairing has been canceled for this device\". I receive this message while I never received any code on my phone or car screen!\nSometimes I receive this message: \"Connection cannot be established\". Most of the time when I manually connect from the phone nothing just happen. Phones greys out the link and then back to normal.\nBoth car and phone can see each others in their own bluetooth settings but there is problem somewhere in pairing process.\nI tried all the fixes recommended for the problem and also I contacted Google for this problem. I am sure it is a phone problem not the car as all other phones can connect successfully even the brand new LG Velvet with Android 10.\nGoogle sent me the general troubleshooting email which it is not helpful. I need to know if the device is faulty or the Android 11 has some bluetooth problem. I need this to get fixed as I use connection all the time in the car.",

I've read that some Pixel's can have driving mode automatically engage without bluetooth (motion/speed detection?).

The phone will periodically not charge, I called google about this when it was still under warranty and got the run around so I said F it, I'll just deal with it.  A subsequent update and all was well for several months, hell probably a year.  However, this latest version of Android has brought a host of issues to my phone, most of which have been fixable.  Most of my settings were lost for example, google assistant no longer recognizes my voice, my news feed and Gmail had to be setup again.  \n\nHowever, the larger problem is with charging.  If I charge the unit with the google included chargers it does not work.  The chargers aren't the problem, my wife's Pixel charges just fine.  Mine was charging until the update in June (and everything went wonky).  I can't charge when using USBC to USBC the phone just shuts off.  When using USBA to USBC it works some of the time but will periodically shut the phone down, I can't figure out the trigger on that one.  For example it shut down Monday overnight and again last night, but has worked well a half dozen times in between.  \n\nOn the car charger it will usually charge but I have to go through a restart before it will charge.  The restart happens within a minute or two of plugging the phone in.  \n\nThis appears to be a very common problem but the threads appear to be locked for discussion.  I'm running out of ideas and hoping someone here has a suggestion that I've overlooked?  \n\nSo far I've tried safe mode which still has the issue, I've put no new apps on my phone and as such don't believe this is a third party app issue.  This appears to be a google problem, especially given the high volume of issues and complaints I've found.  \n\nTips/Tricks would be nice if anyone has them.

Is there anyway to check that setting from the phone?  It wasn't a problem with the PH-1, so I don't think it's a network setting, unless it's a restriction that the PH-1 somehow avoided.

My phone actually loses power when placed on my wireless charger at work, where before it would obviously charge. I have attached screenshots of battery performance below.",

    "content": "I have an original Pixel XL, since 2017.  Use daily for work.  After the Android 10, the battery life was cut in half.  At the most I am getting approximately 2 hours of active use.  The battery under Android 9 would run approximately 4 to 5 hours of heavy use.\n\nRecently, the phone started shutting down with between 20% and 30% of power still shown on the indicator.  After reading through the troubleshooting notes, I performed a hard reboot after I had charged the phone to 100%.  After the phone rebooted, the battery indicator showed 73% battery life.  I placed the phone on the charger and it charged another 25 min approx and reached 100 percent again.  Another hard reboot, and the phone still showed 100%.  If I use the phone under heavy use after the hard reboot, my battery life is closer to 4 hours again.  However, it seems there is an App or a setting under Android 10 that is affecting both the battery life and the accuracy of the battery indicator, because after some use, the phone will return to it's previous behavior and require another hard reboot.\n\nI have two Pixel XL phones and these issues only started after the upgrade to Android 10.  I also own a Nexus 6, still going strong and recently purchased a Pixel 4 XL.\n\nI am hoping that Google is paying attention to these posts and provides a fix for their original Pixel customers instead of leaving them hanging with a final update to Android 10 with inherent battery issues.  Their loyal Pixel / Nexus customers don't deserve this issue to be ignored.",

    "content": "Recently purchased a Pixel 4xl last month along with a pixel stand. Over the past two days I've noticed the pixel will charge to 100% while on the stand and then stops charging and starts discharging while still on the stand. I do not have a case on it. The pixel will show it's charging wirelessly until it reaches 100% and then shows \"not charging\" and then appears to discharge as if not on the stand at all. Pixel stand features such as the photo show continue to work which drains the battery even faster. I'm not sure if it has anything to do with the update released recently or if that's just a coincidence, because it did start around the same time i updated the Pixel to June's update. I'm waking up now to a phone at 60% battery. Does anyone have any ideas or is anyone experiencing this as well? I love my pixel 4xl even with a few issues I've noticed so far, but this one affects functionally more so than any other issue I've experienced and is frustrating when my phone isn't fully charged in the morning.

It is not me accidentally pressing the screen, as it happens also when I use speakerphone. It happens when I am the caller or call receiver and I cannot hear the beeps. Has anyone else come across this before? I have had this phone almost a year but has just started. Thanks\" \nSo my problem is same and It seems no one is actually replying with anything useful. Hoping to grab someones attention and maybe find a solution for this. Tried making calls with iPhone device, Android Device and Landline same problem random loud beeping sounds. Have no idea whats going on and they are definitely not caused by my or theirs apps or notifications.... On the edge to switch to iPhone and as Android only user that says something... I do like Pixels and Google Eco system in general but I will not think twice this time. Enough of this already. Every new phone, software update, Android version update is full of bugs and hidden and later discovered problems. Sometimes we see them before we give you money but sometimes its just so stupid that makes me question my own decisions with Android.... BTW i saw some people are recommending turning off BT or NFC or Safe Mode and then playing inspectors and searching for \"ROUGE\" apps. Are you serious I want to use features that I have bought and I do think that \"Rouge\" apps are not end users problem, IT IS YOUR APP STORE not ours and if there are \"ROUGE\" apps then it is definitely reason to leave this OS behind even with iPhones stupid Notch...",

I checked the Settings->Advanced->Backups before the reset and it showed that my phone backed up device settings, sms, call logs, and the app settings. \n\nWhen I try to restore, the only backup the 4XL sees is an old Chromebook I have. It does not see the 4XL that I backed up. That said, I have backed up and restored this phone successfully in January.\n\nI had the exact same problem with my 2XL back last fall. That 2XL had been on a beta (I did unenroll the device), but I figured that restore might have been still affected by the beta. I am concerned now as my 4XL which was set up as a fresh new device when I purchased it, is now having the same issue. I am paying for Google One additional support and space.\n\nI contacted Google 1:1 support 2 days ago and all they would do is tell me that if my device was backed up I could restore. At the time the tech told me that I could no longer see Pixel backups in Drive because that functionality was removed. I learned since that this is not true, and I can clearly see the backup in my Google Drive that the 4XL could not see. \n\nI asked for this to be escalated and I am waiting still. I also asked for my case to be escalated last fall and I got no response at that time either.\n\nIs there anything else I can check for these backups? I was smart this time and backed up my texts via 3rd party, but I still had to manually reinstall the 120 apps I have, as well as set up device settings. The Google support tech also suggested that I use a 3rd party backup solution.\n\nAlso, what do folks do when Google support does not get back to you? I have not had much luck getting accurate information or promised followups. Thanks!",

Until today, when the phone would power off, it would not turn on unless charging, but that is no longer the case.

Logged onto the device using my google account. I then add her google account as well (because we're using google fi and can only have one line per google account, so I need her account on my admin user so the line works).\n2. I go to Settings -> System -> Advanced -> Multiple Users and create a new user for my daughter, turning on phone calls & SMS as well.\n3. I setup her user by signing into her google account. She has her own PIN, different from the admin account.\n\nSwitching between users, phone calls and text messages all work fine. The problem is when the phone is restarted. The phone demands I enter the \"admin\" user account PIN before I can do anything else. I try swiping down on the top menu, selecting the \"person\" icon, and I can see her user account as an option, but it's grayed out and tapping it does nothing. The only thing I can do is select the admin user and enter that PIN. After this is done, I can then switch to her user without issue.\n\nNeedless to say, my concern is if she's out and happens to restart the phone (runs out of battery, perhaps a software glitch crashes the device, whatever), that I would have to provide her the admin pin in order for her to use the phone again. This defeats the purpose of creating an account for her to begin with.\n\nIs there any way to allow her to sign onto the device post-restart without having the admin enter a PIN first?",

    "title": "Many posts about Pixel phone power button issues - not working consistently or 1-click camera launch",
    "content": "I am surprised how many posts (Google Support forums, Reddit, tech sites) I found online with the same problem and it doesn't seem like Google got the issue resolved.\n\nI have a Pixel 2 XL that started having this issue maybe a year ago. The main issue is that the power button does not power the screen off most of the time. I have to click it 5-10 times before it accepts the click. And sometimes as I do that, the camera app launches with a single click. \n\nI looked this issue up back then and there weren't many complaints so I decided it to accept it. Now there are tons of others having the issue. \n\nAnother thing started happening a few months ago. I would be on a call with the phone near my ear and I need to look at something on the phone (usually email or a map). So I move the phone away from my ear and the screen remains pitch black. Clicking the power button doesn't turn the screen on. This issue persists until the other person hangs up. Sometimes if they don't hang up, I have to reboot with a long press.\n\nThe phone getting stuck in screen-off mode happens so often now, I usually end up rebooting the phone every other day. The reboots don't fix the inconsistent power button. These phone sometimes behaves normally and sometimes the power button feels like it's asleep. I also think the lack of responsiveness increases after watching a YouTube video. It's almost impossible to turn the phone off right after closing YouTube.\n\nThat and the launching of the camera app with a single click make me feel like I'm using a junk phone not a high end phone. I LOVE Android but these issues (I've had other hardware issues with previous Google phones... this is my 4th) make me strongly and I say this VERY sadly but strongly consider another maker for my next phone. I am one of few people in my company that use a Google phone. Everyone else uses an iPhone or a Samsung. I usually brag to them about the power of Android and how my Pixel gives me the vanilla experience. Google got too many chances and I feel this is it for my Google phone buying streak. UNLESS they make it right. Not sure if this is the right forum to request support directly from Google or not. The \"Contact Us\" option was for chat. I don't feel like typing back and forth for hours.\n\nHere are some links of others experiencing the issue... there are many more:\nhttps://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/41669909?hl=en\nhttps://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/17067447?hl=en\nhttps://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/17067447?hl=en\nhttps://forums.androidcentral.com/google-pixel-2-pixel-2-xl/950305-power-button-2-xl.html\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/987idi/pixel_2_xl_power_button_not_responding_most_of/",

    "title": "How do I contact Google for technical support for my Pixel XL.Appreciate your help.",
    "content": "Recently, I purchased a used pixel XL, that was officially certified refurbished. When installing and personalizing my pixel XL via my carrier, there was a problem getting the MMS downloads in my messages. When I clicked the blue icon with a downward arrow  to access a download, it would act as though it was 'working on retrieving' it (actively circling w/I icon) and failed to retrieve the download. The active circling within the icon continued endlessly without any results. I literally had to close page to get it to stop. My carrier said that the SMS is working properly but whenever we try to download MMS it was unsuccessful. I must have called five different times to get help on how to correct the problem and no one could figure out how to make it work. My previous phone, Samsung Galaxy 7 edge, was stolen so I had no way of transferring my contacts, photos, etc from that phone on to my pixel XL. Fortunately I had backed up everything onto Google so I could restore all my info in case my Galaxy 7 edge was ever lost or stolen. When it came to retrieving all that info, some of it was not retrieved. I originally had 173 + contacts and only about 70 we're actually retrieved. Things just got more screwed up from there. For some reason they had me sync my partners contacts in with mine (that's a long story) but basically what happened is all of his contacts were deleted, I guess during the syncing, and that's when I lost over a hundred of my contacts as well. So here I sit after 5 calls for technical support from my carrier and I am left with a partial list of my contacts, my partner's contacts are nowhere to be found along with the rest of my contacts and it's still can't download MMS messages. My phone still processes SMS texting in message without any problems. Finally the last few people I spoke to told me I needed to contact Google to correct the problem. I don't know how to contact Google, technical support and I'm at the point that I'm overthinking everything and very little makes any sense right now. I think that's called burnout and I've only had this phone a week.\nI'm hoping to at least get a phone number for Google technical support. Ideally there might be a miracle worker out there who can guide me through the process of locating the problem correcting those things that need fixin and retrieving all of the lost contacts not to mention photos, etc plus a large amount of journaling & lots of otther notes. \nCan anyone out there help out...I'd be grateful for just a Google # & delighted if they could guide me in fixing anything. I was so excited to get a Pixel.\nI've got the time and patience to try this again with someone out there in 'answer land'.\nThanks for reading my hugely lengthy message. \u270c\ufe0f",

Therefore I tried to reinstall it through the play store. Then something super weird happened: all my photos and data seemed to have gone. They are still on my phone, somewhere, but my (Google?) applications can't detect them, so all the photos I've taken (camera as screenshots) just don't show up, I can't play music in the stock music player, nor take any new screenshots/photos.\n\nWhen I try to take a photo (with the stock camera app) or screenshot (by holding the power and volume key) it just says the memory is full, but it's clearly lying, since I can go in through the file browser and see there's space left. Also, all my personal ring tones, sounds, etc, have been replaced by some super weird stock ones (I presume; maybe even hard-coded midi files, by the sound of it...). The weird thing is that all other apps seem to work normally and I can, for example, take and receive photos with other apps.\n\nSince all the data is clearly all there, I wanted to connect to retrieve it, but I can't do that either. I went to the store to get professional help, but they said they couldn't connect to the device, although their computer did sense \"something\" was connected, but they didn't want to install new drivers and instead directed me to you.\n\nSo here I am: can you please help me connect my phone to a computer and then fix the problem with my stock apps? I was told by the store where I bought the phone it has been reported to happen because all the Google apps are connected with one another.\n\nI really to get help with this asap, because it's really embarrassing. I'm a staunch supporter of Google over for example Huawei, because I trust Google more, so I really hope someone can help me with this.\n\nThank you very much in advance!\n\n\nBest regards,\nFredrik",

To resolve the problem I would like Google to guarantee to provide OTA patch to allow VOLTE and 5G usage in other countries or at least have estimated timeline.\nI look forward to hearing from you as soon as possible to resolve the problem",

I've tried to select one of the networks they have partnered with but my phone says it can't connect to it. I've tried to connect to Claro Argentina as that is the only one I've seen so far. The other two I can connect to are Telefonica Argentina and Telecom Personal. I've tried turning my phone on and off, selecting the network, letting the phone automatically select the network, I don't know what to do and it would be a bummer if I couldn't use my phone down here. Any help is appreciated! I'm running Android 10 if that helps.",

He wanted to test his sons\u2019 abilities. \n\n\nHe called both of them and gave a room to each of them. He said, \u201cYou must fill this room completely with anything you wish. It can be anything! But there should be no space left behind and you should not seek the advice from anyone!\" \n\n\nThe next day the king visited the elder\u2019s son room. The room was completely filled with hay. The king sighed on the foolishness of the elder son. \n\n\nThe he went to the younger son\u2019s room. But it was kept closed. The King knocked at the door of the room. The second sonasked his father to get in and closed the door again. There were darkness everywhere and The King shouted at his second son angrily. \n\n\nBut the second son lighted a candle and said, I have filled this room with light!\" \n\n\nNow the King felt very happy and hugged his son proudly.

I begin dialing, but dialpad tones sound through the phone speaker, which makes me think I may not be BT connected. \n\n3. The icon that shows upon completion of the dialing shows the Speaker icon for a second before switching to the BT icon. \n\n4. So every time I dial, I have a heart-stopping moment of Uh oh, I'm not on bluetooth, I better rip these headphones off before someone answers!\n\nSounds trivial, but my headphones (Bose 700) are multi-device and switch from one sound source to another, so it's possible it's not a BT call. I'd like the dial tones to sound though BT (so I'm reassured my phone is actually using my headphones), and I'd like to see some visual confirmation *before* the call actually connects. I know I can check \"Connected devices\" before initiating each call, and that's what I end up doing because I'm paranoid. Often I start dialing, hear the tones issuing from the phone speaker, and see the Speaker icon, and hang up, check that I'm connected to my headphones (I usually am), and initiate the call again.",

    "content": "Is the feature available on the Pixel 4?  Nice job on Visual Voicemail also.  It should respond with the party you are trying to reach and not the word THEY when I press the \"I'll call you back later\" button.  It also seems to be missing the canned response 'take me off your calling list' and 'is this urgent?'. Is it possible for users to respond with a dynamic custom response?  That would be a nice future enhancement.  Can call screen automatically take the call if inbound caller identification is absent and ask the calling party to identify themselves verbally?  This could apply in the absence of calling name delivery if the calling party's nyx-nnx-xxxx (now npa-nxx-xxxx) is not in the contact list of the recipient or the name was not transmitted by the telco, or was not retrievable through a tcap dip.  I have received spoofed calls using illegal numbers and this can be baked into the logic ... for example ... no area code can have a 9 as a middle digit; no area code can start with a 1 or 0; if an area code has a 1 in the middle digit (n1x) the third digit (x) cannot be a 1; no central office code (the 4th 5th and 6th digit) can be 1xx or x11 or 0xx.  And you will not see telephone numbers such as 416-416-xxxx (were the area code and central office code are identical), or in NYC for example you would never see 212-718-xxxx because 212 is the area code for Manhattan and 718 is the area code for Brooklyn.  n=2-9 x=0-9.  Hope this info helps.  I don't know if ANI delivery still exists but it can be a way of determining if the call is spoofed, but the logic there is kind of fuzzy.  Automatic Nmber Identification and Caller Identification are two different things. ANI is the billing caller ID ... for example a company's ANI and main switchboard number could be (416) UNiversity 2 - 2000 (416-862-2000) but for direct inward dial the PBX would be programmed to transmit 416-862-2134 so that dialable directory number delivery and reverse translation would work.  Note that the first six digits in most cases will be identical.  The cellular industry, and regulatory authorities CRTC and FCC have certainly done a fine job messing up everything that was previously sophisticated ... from a telecommunications standpoint.  There's no way for Google to send a call to the bit bucket unless its servers act as a proxy.  It would also be interesting if the Google phone app could be enhanced to recognize alphabetic mnemonics as they previously existed eons ago.\n\nie  1 800 GOF EDEX\n1 800 FLO WERS\n1 415 PIX EL3A (749-3532)",

    "content": "I sometimes (but not always) want my camera's photo files to record the GPS location where I took the photo.\n\nUnfortunately, I am never seemingly able to get this to work.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nDetails:\n\nMy camera app has the setting for \"Save location\" enabled.  (I think that this is the default setting; I never changed it; I have confirmed that my camera is set to enable this.)\n\nI generally do not use the Google Photos app, but I can confirm that its setting for \"Remove geo location\" is disabled.\n\nIf I then turn on my phone's GPS location (I generally have it off), take a photo, email the photo file (is in default JPEG format) to myself, and then view the file's metadata on my PC, I see nothing there about the GPS location.\n\nConcerning how I view the photo file's metadata, I have tried 3 different approaches:\n\n1)  my PC is a Win 10 box, and you can do this from File Explorer: right click on the file --> Properties --> Details\n\n2) open the file in XnView MP, view its properties\n\n3) open the file in Exif Data Viewer\n\nWith all 3 approaches, I do see plenty of other EXIF metadata in the photo files, so it is not the case that none is written.\n\nIts just that I never see anything that looks like GPS location data.\n\nBy the way, does anyone know the exact EXIF tag name used for the GPS location data?  Maybe I am overlooking it.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nMisc:\n\nI am aware of this discussion on this website, where Alex Sokolov seems to report a similar issue, with no apparent solution.\n\nAbout a year ago, a beta version Android at one point mysteriously dropped EXIF support.\n\nI always have my phone's \"Google Location History\" and \"Google Location Sharing\" turned off for privacy reasons.",

I have also changed it within the Nova app as well and anywhere else I could think of. \n\nAdditionally, even if I select the pixel launcher as my default I still get the pop-up. The only workaround  I have currently is to remove all other launchers and therefore it will default to the pixel one. \n\nI've tried factory resetting my phone as well.

I called T-Mobile who decided it may be a sim card issue; I went to the T-mobile store today. They replaced the sim card and are showing no issues on their end, but the phone still has no service. I've tried resetting \"wifi, mobile, & bluetooth,\" but that did not help. I've already uninstalled all downloaded apps. I'm unable to do a factory reset on the phone because I'd have to approve it through our family link account; however, apparently this will not work because the phone will not connect to wifi.

    "content": "I've got both 'Caller id and Spam,' and 'Filter Spam calls' boxes checked in my phone setting and they appear to work. But they only appear to work on numbers that are \"known\" as incoming spam numbers. Makes sense. But seeing as how spammers change their numbers all day every day, I keep getting about 5-7 calls per day that are not known by Google's filters as spam. Meaning, I have to check my phone, and block these numbers every single day. Get's pretty old, pretty fast. And there's no end to how many phone numbers the \"social security scam\" business possesses, in case you haven't noticed. lol. My question is, why isn't there a simple feature within this wonderful built in spam filter to only accept calls from my contact list? Meaning, \"block ALL BUT my contacts.\" This way, if it's someone I don't know, they can simply leave a message and I'll click \"add to contacts\" and all is well. It'd keep me from having to listen to my phone ring several times a day with numbers I already know are spam. And yes, I know I can use a call blocking app to do this, and I did just that with my Samsung Galaxy phone, but in my experience, using a third party call blocking app that lays over your phone just slows everything down and often interferes with other apps, I found. The spam features are a big reason for me switching to Pixel 3XL. And I don't mind being a part of the community that \"fights spam\" but I'd rather not have to report every single call that comes in on my phone. Especially when \"white listing\" your entire contact list seems like such an obviously easy feature to add to this already good built in spam filter. Anyone have any ideas??",

    "content": "Well here goes , long story cut short. Since the day i setup up my pixel 3a it has had soft and hardware issues.  Could be multiple issues but i have identified a few and realise a new one that is causing problems. Google play music since day one seems to notify me it trying to update.  I don't use it and have not for years. Had one song one it.  But seeing as they are phasing it out and starting YouTube music.  Why have they bothered to preinstalled it on my device. Issues got worse when i opted to enjoy a free 6 month trial with apple music offered by my network provider.  Honestly i don't think the apple music app does well on a pixel anyway. But it has affected hardware mainly volume of music and various other software issue. issues. But last night i decided to access Google dashboard to try and wipe permanently the play list it claim i have in play music account that are not.  It offered to transfer them to yt music so i though go for it.  What is did was transfer playlists i had set up in apple music. So clearly a clash between and Google play music and yt music app issues. And now all those playlist are on yt music . With the one song i had in Google account. But yt music app setting are now clashing in the triangle of google play music, apple music and yt music app.   I am finding the yt music web page has amazing play back volume through chrome of all browsers, but absolute shockingly low and the equaliser settings seem to be like a petulant toddler that change themselves or do not change at all in the app. This has had a profound affect on my device and has definitely caused it to  suffer before its time .  So how do i get them to accept this and get a replacement that has not suffered the strain due to Google not thinking this through.   40gb data plan a month and i ain't using more than 12% because i just have given up with my phone.     It really has not helped with all the ways Google back up you data in various ways as you can not getting it clear enough. Device personalisation services just another spanner in the works that pushes the issue even after factory reset.   Feel so let down as i have been an android user since htc first released smart phones . Now Google the creator of android have come so far and messed up spectacularly.  And honestly i really hope i am right about this because if not then not only have they left use with a worse os than year gone by but clearly are producing poor quality hardware.  I am one of thousands having similar issues. This is not a user issue, but a google problem \ud83d\ude25\n\n\nP.s. they also have the nerve to call this a community but yet i can not comment on others questions that are having the similar issues. Why, because they do not want users communicating and figuring out between us that they are at fault.",

And I can't figure out how to disable dual SIM mode completely. \n\nWe did the reverse in my wife's phone (RCS working on the eSIM in the SIM 1 \"slot\"), but as soon as we put her work SIM in it shifted the eSIM to be SIM 2 and she lost RCS capability.",

Typically dark cats are typically harder to photograph, though I have one that is mostly black that I regularly get great pictures of. I've watched a variety of videos on how to improve the pictures (direct sunlight, simple background, no flash, adjust exposure, focus on eyes). Still, it's not helping. \n\nI've tried portrait and the regular camera mode, as well as adjusting the exposure and shooting with direct sunlight on the cat and behind me. I'm tapping the screen to focus. Is it simply too dark or that I need additional direct light on him?

Any thoughts on how to get my little guy some great pictures so he can find a good family to adopt him?

    "content": "So my brand new Pixel 4a seems to have developed a serious problem with its battery.\n\nThis is a new device purchased for Christmas about 4 weeks ago.\n\nA few days ago I noticed that with 40-50% charge, I would wake up to a dead phone after 8 hours of sleep.\n\nLast night I tested this problem by doing the following:\n\nUninstalled Facebook and about 10 other unnecessary apps which might be draining battery.\nEnabled extreme battery saver, adaptive charging, checked battery optimization is on for all possible apps, and enabled all possible adaptive battery settings.\nCharged to 100% before bed then unplugged it.\nClosed all open apps, activated do not disturb and airplane mode, turned off location services and WiFi and Bluetooth.\nThe battery then drained, on phone idle, from 100 down to 34 percent in less than 9 hours. That's a loss of nearly SEVENTY percent battery overnight on idle.\n\nWhat the heck is going on? Is this just a faulty battery?\n\nEvidence from my Battery Usage statistics - the phone detects zero apps used overnight other than Idle, and claims that Idle only used 1% battery while it was draining the entire time:\n\n\n\nA couple of potential causes I can think of:\nI have been playing a mobile game Legends of Runeterra for several hours per day, maybe this is too demanding for a Pixel 4a and has messed something up internally?\nI bought the phone in the UK but am now living in New Zealand. The charger is being used through a cheap plug adapter (and obviously different voltage etc) which has fried the internal battery components?\n\n\nAny advice would be massively appreciated...\n\nCould this be a software/hardware problem?\n\nI will try the 'Safe Mode' troubleshooting approach when I go to sleep tonight, and then consider a Factory Reset tomorrow.",

I first noticed it with my car when the music that was being streamed off of Spotify would pause or mute in the middle of a song and then randomly continue with the song. I then tried to see if it was an issue with my car or my phone, so I decided to try and use my bluetooth speaker for reference. I started watching a YouTube video and the same issue was happening. I tried resetting connections, clearing cache and some other stuff I saw on the internet. I've done pretty much everything except for factory resetting the phone. I really don't want to do that because it is too tedious for me to reinstall everything onto my phone. Can someone please help me?",

No resolution and/or fix.\n\nLet me help others so you don't waste your time.  This is a \"baked in\" issue that is in ALL Pixel phones.  It's like a time bomb.  When you research this issue nothing works as a fix...short or long term and Google has said it will send out a fix at some point for the 5.  Well...for those of us with earlier models that tells you all you need to know. Again...this is a persistent, fundamental flaw.\n\nOf course...Google will lean on the warranty but, if this is a baked in issue, it was there across builds from the start.  They'll then say...\"buy an upgraded model\".  Well...when researched...the issue will still be in any upgrade as well.\n\nI can't say this enough...avoid the Pixel.  What's frustrating is this is a well documented issue across the years.  Its a 50/50 shot it will probably hit your phone post warranty...so.. you're spending a LOT of money for an already flawed phone that will at some point have this issue.   There will be no recourse on the back end unless you're in warranty AND your replacement will still be flawed.\n\nI'm just sayin'!",

    "title": "Motion Sense - A new way for your Pixel to understand you",
    "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nI want to share a little more about Motion Sense\u2122, the Soli radar technology powering several of our helpful new features this year. \n\nMotion Sense creates a new way to interact with your device, accelerating your control of the phone, helping you stay in the moment, and letting you interact when touch isn't convenient.  It automatically turns on your display when you approach and keeps it off when no one is around. It triggers face unlock when you reach for it. It lets you skip songs with a swipe and snooze alarms with a wave. You can silence incoming calls instantly. You can even wave hello to your favorite Pokemon!\n\nOur Quick Gesture features in particular are about accelerating your control of your phone:\nTouchless multitasking\nControl your music with a swipe no matter what else you\u2019re doing: driving, eating, while your display is off, or even when you\u2019re in another app.\nStay in the moment\nAvoid getting distracted by your morning notifications when you go to snooze your alarm on your phone. Just wave to snooze alarms and dismiss timers. \nStop interruptions\nWhen your phone starts ringing at a bad time, you can silence it instantly with a wave. \n\n\nYou can turn on Motion Sense features in Setup and in Settings under System > Motion Sense. You can separately toggle each of the Motion Sense features. \n\nMotion Sense is based on Google\u2019s Soli radar technology. In principle, this is similar to the radar technology used to track large objects like planes. We\u2019ve created a miniature version in a chip located at the top of your Pixel 4. When Motion Sense is turned on, it emits a radio frequency signal from this chip. The signal goes out into the world and gets reflected back by the things around your phone. These continuous reflections are sensed by the antennas in the chip and processed on-device to sense your motions. If the right motion is detected, it will trigger the corresponding Motion Sense feature. This motion processing happens only on your phone, and radar sensor data is never saved or shared with other Google services. \n\n\nTo minimize false triggers, Motion Sense ignores motions when it\u2019s in your pocket or bag, or when your phone is moving around a lot. Still, it\u2019s important to keep in mind that this is new technology. In some instances, your phone may detect gestures when you don't intend it to, like when there are motions over your phone that look very similar to swipes. We are very interested to hear about these instances so that we can learn from them to make our algorithms better in the future. \n\nAnother aspect of Motion Sense being a new technology is that it is not available in all countries due to differences in radio frequency regulations. We hope to make it available in more places soon. If you travel from a country where Motion Sense is available to one where it is not, you will receive a notification letting you know that Motion Sense is temporarily disabled. Motion Sense is also disabled while in airplane mode and in battery saver mode. \n\nMotion Sense is one of our most helpful and exciting innovations in Pixel 4. I look forward to hearing your feedback on this thread, both about the features you find most helpful and the features you find yourself not using as much, so that we can make Motion Sense better in the future. We plan to release more features over time.\n\nBrandon \nProduct Manager",

    "content": "I have a Pixel 4 XL that's running Android 10 with the latest updates and security patches.\n\nI have a problem with the Google One app that I've been unable to resolve. I have a subscription for additional storage on Google Drive and manage it via Google One. The problem is that the Google One app is ALWAYS saying \"backing up now\", when I know that it isn't. I've uninstalled and reinstalled Google One, cleared the app storage and cache, rebooted, removed my Google account from the phone, etc, but nothing makes any difference.\n\nAs is the case with many other users of Android 10, Google backup doesn't work at all unless security (in my case PIN and face recognition) are disabled. Under normal circumstances accessing Backup via Settings / Google Services and Preferences / Backup brings up the backup screen on which the 'Backup Now\" button is greyed-out and the status is \"waiting to backup...\" Temporarily disabling security allows the backup to immediately proceed. However, irrespective of whether security is in place or not, Google One always says that it's backing-up. The \"device data\" category states the correct elapsed time since the last successful backup, \"multimedia messages\" says \"on\", and \"photos and videos\" says \"just now\".\n\nI love the Pixel 4, but I find the ever-growing number of Google apps utterly confusing. Backups can be managed via Settings / Google Services and Preferences / Backup, so why is there any need to show a slightly different backup interface via Google One. Why, also, is there a need to make Google One a separate application when it's there purely to manage subscriptions for additional Google Drive storage? Why not have that functionality within Google Drive itself? Given that the decision was made to build  the Google One features into a separate app, why at least not share the \"Backups\" user interface with the one available in Settings. As it is, the two purport to do the same thing, but there are differences in the user interface that just serve to confuse.\n\nIs Google One broken?",

I purchased a pixel 5 a few months back and right away I noticed two main issues with the Pixel 5's images. \n1) The HDR bracketing is really bad and not even very noticeable when compared to the Pixel 3 \n2) When editing photos (raw or jpeg) and you adjust contrast, darkness or exposure you can start to see a grid pattern in the image. This is really evident when increasing the HDR in a third party app like Snapseed. \n\nNote: this issue is present using both the wide angle and regular lens\n\nIs this a hardware issue? I have updated my build to the latest release as of the date this is posted. This problem has kept me using the Pixel three. Supper bummed...",

To my surprise, I could see the drainage very fast within minutes. \nI tried to charge, ofcourse with original charger, but the device is not charging. \nAs mentioned in these forums, I tried to charge the device for an hour and pressed Power button & volume down button to restart. But it didn't switched On at all.\n\nI had charged for 4 hours and tried the above approach. It vibrated once and the red light was constant. It blinked for 3 times and it was constant most of the times. After 4 hours of charging, I don't see the red light at all. \n\nLater I tried to change the charger to see if the issue is with charger and charged for 5 hours. The issue is still the same.\n\nOne thing happened good to me is that the device is still under warranty, bought in Dec-2017 and Google gave 2 years of Warranty. When discussed with tech support, they raised a pick up request, and it's 3 days there is no update on the device. The device is still with courier and is in transit. Hoping the best that Google would repair or replace the device so that I can continue to use the device for some more month.\n\nLast time it happened the same with Nexus, Pixel devices that the MotherBoard crashed on the next day of the warranty expiration., and I ended up spending thousands of rupees for Motherboard replacement. \nWish Google would help me in this aspect and not let me to spend thousands again and again.",

After updating to Android 10 on release day, I tried to add esim to my phone to use 2 SIMs. \n\nOK, I tried using an esim from a carrier that specifically stated that they did not guarantee their eSIM will work with Pixel phones as they only supported the fruit phones. So with that in mind, I went ahead nevertheless and obtained the eSIM QR code from the carrier (\"Carrier 1\"). Followed the usual process to add eSIM: -\nSettings -> Network & Internet -> \"+\" Mobile Network -> \"Don't have SIM card\" -> \"Checking network info...\" -> camera automatically fired-up to scan the given QR code;\nscanned the QR code of Carrier 1; and\nreceived error message \"Networks not activated\".\n\nOK, fine.... Carrier 1 already said they did not guarantee their eSIM will work on Pixel.\n\nAnd after some forum discussions with fellow users in the same country who succesfully added esim to their Pixel 3 (not 3a) using other carriers who also specifically stated that they only supported the fruit phones, I decided to instead try another carrier's eSIM (\"Carrier 2\").\n\nPrior to trying to Carrier 2, these were the intervening matters: -\nnetwork settings (only) were reset, including checking the box to reset \"downloaded sims\"; and\nupdated apps - including \"SIM Manager\" by Google [current version D.1.5.73-google (5793666)].\n\nSo went to Carrier 2's store and requested their eSIM. Again, followed the usual process to add eSIM: - \nSettings -> Network & Internet -> \"+\" Mobile Network -> \"Don't have SIM card\" -> \"Checking network info...\" -> \ncamera DIDN'T fire-up at all to scan the given QR; and\nreceived error message \"Networks not activated\".\n After, the above, I reset the phone back to factory settings and tried again. Same result as per trying to add Carrier 2's eSIM above. NOT EVEN a chance to scan the QR code and was again and again informed \"Networks not activated\"...\n\nWhat seems to be the problem? Could it be the \"SIM Manager\" app's latest update?\n\nThanks in advance.",

    "content": "I recently got a new Pixel 2XL under warranty. This new phone triggers Google assistant whenever I take the phone out from my pocket. I have been experimenting and observing this for a week now. I'm talking hours of obsession - including factory resets to experiment with fresh settings. I can (95% or more often) reproduce the problem with no fingerprints (to ensure I'm not accidentally hitting that sensor - but the problem exists with or without fingerprints) and Squeeze sensitivity at the max - but doesn't matter what the sensitivity is.\n\nWith the phone on and screen unlocked*, I can turn the phone off, turn it upside down, rest the top edge on of the now upside down phone on a table, with the back of the phone resting on my index finger (far away from the fingerprint sensor) and wait some time for the ambient display to turn off - basically simulating the phone being in my pocket. When the ambient display turns off, I gently hold the phone so as not to trigger the Active Edge, lift the phone up and hold it flat like you would when taking it our of the pocket. When the display turns on the Google assistant pops up.\n\nAlso, I am pretty sure this issue has something to do with the Always on ambient display, because if you turn it off in settings, then the screen won't wake when you take the phone out of your pocket and the assistant won't appear. If you do have ambient display on, simply picking it up from the table when it is \"ambient\" on will not trigger the assistant. It has to come out of your pocket - or simulated pocket as per above.\n\nLastly, prior to breaking my old phone I know I turned off Ambient display and did not use it the past year because at the time i did not like it. When I got this new one I thought I'd give it a try. So that is why ran into this issue.\n\n*\"the phone on and screen unlocked\" --- during my \"testing\" I noticed that if I did not start from this state, I could not reliably reproduce the problem. For example if the phone was off and flat on the table with the ambient display on, sometimes when I rested the top edge on the table to simulate being in my pocket and then lifted it, i could not trigger the assistant . . . but sometimes I could . So, i don't really know what the exact initial states needs to be to get assistant to trigger - it happens to me 95% or more of the time and I know I'm not accidentally triggering active edge.\n\n-------------\n:-) And if you read this far you probably think I'm crazy. Oh well, I hope someone can reproduce this issue too. If not then I'd have to guess my new phone is broken and send it back.again.",

That is until I needed to connect the phone to my PC and realized I couldn't do it. My PC only has USB 3.0 ports, and honestly, I didn't even know there was a new USB format out until this happened. The phone comes with a USB C to USB A female adapter but no male adapter. Why? Then I look at the Google store and the cable is $20!?! Don't get me wrong, it's a good phone but the experience has killed my blossoming support I had for the Pixel and any future models. I hate Samsung, Apple too, but my next phone definitely will not be a Pixel, or any other Google phone. At least if I had gotten an iPhone or Galaxy I know I could've connected the phone to my freaking PC without having to drop an additional $20 on an $800 phone...",

Another older Android phone (as well as my laptop), works fine as a client for the same hotspot.\n\nTemporary workaround, I have to:\n==========================================\n'Forget' the development device's access point\nRe-connect (re-typing password) to the access point\nWait several seconds until the ..Stay connected?` message appears and tap \"Yes\"\n\nSymptoms; Wi-Fi shows connected but:\n==========================================\nCan't SSH to the development device from the Pixel (using JuiceSSH)\nPhone has an IP yet can't ping the development device (192.168.43.1)\nPhone stays connected to the hotspot but status is:\n              Wi-Fi has no internet access\n      Tap for options\n\n           ..and the below status appears in the Android swipe-down menu:\n\n              This network has no internet access.

Additionally, the Stay connected?` option is not persistent (disappears when it feels like it) in the Android drop-down drawer.\nSome time after using the temporary workaround, the hotspot is back to the same broken state\n\nI can't imagine this is not a bug. What use-case is there to stay connected to an access point AND deny IP connectivity because there's no public internet access? If there's a health check being performed that fails and causes this, what is the check? HTTP GET to a Google server; ping to a DNS IP etc?\n\nEdit: I ran a packet capture on the dev hotspot and saw DNS requests to connectivtycheck.gstatic.com which lead me to the below post.

If it's going to behave this way, it should describe \"Metered connection\" and hint what that means in one of those pop-ups. I shouldn't have to run packet captures to solve a problem like this.",

I am just now writing to you here because I am getting NOWHERE with Google help desk.    Here is my problems for both phones.  There have been several times they wouldn't connect to any WiFi router and then I noticed that some of the apps were running very slow.  It seems that after a factory update (at least every other one it seems) I need to reset our phones totally and use the backup to reinstall everything back on the phones.    The phones will automatically restart with NO action asking for it.   Now my biggest issue with my phone is that it is now taking over 10 hours to charge from 57% battery.   I have a screen shot of it telling me that it is going to take 15 hours to charge from 10%.   I have already tried cleaning out the charging port, and going through the Google automated line.  Lets just say that after going through all the steps to try and fix the problem, it left my phone in safe mode.  I had to yet again reset my phone.   I called and finally spoke to a human being that could not speak English very well, but he manged to tell me that I needed to give Google my phone and they would see why it was acting the way it is.  Oh, did I mention that that process was going to take 7 to 10 days?    We use our phones for work purposes and cannot be without them that long.   Again, I have contacted Google about my phone and not my wife's phone directly because of the issues we are having.  I figured if I could get the fix on my phone, than I could use the same fix on hers.   By this time, we just want to get away from these Pixel phones. In short, THESE THE WORST PHONES I HAVE EVER OWNED. I have been on a cell phone of one kind or another for over 20 years. \n       We were talked into them and have not liked them the entire time we have had them.   The customer service for Google is good, but they are more worried about making sure their product is seen in a good light instead of helping the actual customer out.     I am posting this exact message on every message board I can find.  All I am asking is to get out of these phones.   I will spread this negative message everyday until I get the results I am looking for.",

    "content": "My Pixel 2 abruptly got stuck on the boot loop screen after a restart. I forced several hard restarts with the same result. After running through the solutions provided in Google's support documentation, I was forced to perform a factory reset.\n\nWhen setting up my device, I went through the entire set-up process (using the same owner account as before and passing the 2-Factor Authentication.) This went mostly smoothly, and I was prompted to recover old device data and Google Pay information, which was correct. On the final step of set-up, \"adding finishing touches,\" I received a dialog that reads:\n\n\"Not Signed In.\nTo use this phone, you first have to sign in to the owner's Google Account in use on this phone when it was last reset.\nBecause you haven't done so, you have to set up the phone again.\"\n\nI've repeated this several times with the same results. I've had the same primary Google Account for a decade (this one) and it's also in use on my Google Home devices which are still functioning correctly. I'm completely at a loss as to what the issue is and what I can do to solve it. I even tried setting up an additional Google Account during the set-up process with the same results.\n\nHas anyone else had this experience? Given the weird restart issues I'm concerned it's a hardware problem and the phone may need to be replaced, which is a shame considering it's less than 2 years old.\n\nEDIT: For some additional context, my phone is on Google Fi.",

I then charged it again and the flashing red light is gone, but still will not display anything, no vibrations, and no sound. \n\nI watched a YouTube video and as suggested, put the phone in the freezer for an hour, pressed hard all over the screen and back-plate, tapped all the buttons quickly, held them down in various combinations for minutes on end. Nothing seems to be bringing this phone back to life.\n\nSeems like a hardware issue, is my phone broken? Have had it just under two years, and warranty is only for one year I believe. This sucks.",

    "content": "I have a Google Pixel 3 and sometimes listen to news by saying \"OK Google, tell me the latest news.\"  After I'm done with the news I usually just close the Google app (that was playing news), and continue to do other things while listening to ebooks in the @Voice Aloud Reader app. The earbuds' middle button can be used to pause and resume the ebook when I need to. Very convenient.\n\nRecently I paired the phone with a new pair of Google 3 earbuds (my original pair was broken), and after the setup I found that the earbud buttons can be used to control Google Assistant. For example when new notifications come in, I can press the top button to listen to the notification, without taking the phone out of my pocket, which is very cool.\n\nBut then I bump into another problem: nowadays when I listen to ebooks in the @Voice Aloud Reader app, and press the middle button to pause the ebook, next time I press the middle button the ebook doesn't resume, instead the audio news starts playing. This often forces me to stop whatever I'm doing, take the phone out of the pocket, and manually close the Google app, to resume the ebook.\n\nIs there an easy way to make the middle button only pause/resume the ebook in @Voice,  instead of always triggering the audio news? Or do I have to completely turn off the earbuds control with Google Assistant, to get back the convenience to pause/resume ebooks in @Voice with the middle button?",

I also tried the suggested advice found in this community to use the dialer (*#*#4636#*#*) to get to the Network Settings, but my choices on the Phone Information drop down menu differed from those cited by original poster Brandon Dendinger. I spent two hours chatting with a tech the first night of the problem, and we additionally ran through all the app permissions. I was then told my ticket would be escalated, and I should hear from a \"specialist\" in 72 hours. I'm now at 120 hours and no further along in resolving this problem. I have checked back in twice,  and each time I was told a specialist would get back to me \"at the earliest.\" (Such a polite phrase from the playbook that says absolutely nothing.) I get the impression that after you have been \"escalated,\" no one else can touch the issue or offer other solutions.

Yesterday it was in my pocket all day, I barely touched it and it died. It gets to about 10-13% battery and then it shuts down. \n\nAs of today I spent hours following the Google battery drain tips. I backed it up and reset it to factory settings after doing all the other steps. Now of it gets to 20% I can watch the per tick down 1% per second and crash...\n\nI posted to @madebygoogle twitter and they gave me a generic list of things to try. The only thing I didn't do besides paying here was to put it in safe mode. So I did that tonight to see the power drain is caused by an app (and yes I already deleted junk files, opened up storage, deleted unused apps, deleted widgets, and battery check says everything is normal...) Yet I still lost power fairly quickly (less quickly since nearly no apps are running, but had 4 hours on this charge) and as soon as it got to 20% it began to crash. I showed my boyfriend as it just dropped 20, 19, 18, 17....3, 2, 1...\n\nSo if Anyone has Any suggestions besides the battery just plain being dead I'm listening. My phone does not get hot when it's charging. Although it has done that before, though I don't recall that happening before this started. The phone is only 18 months old!

Then the top of the screen would fill with multicolored white (ranging from green to pink) pixels, and the symbol would turn to a grayed out solid battery (no lightning bolt), approximately 3 seconds. Then the screen would turn completely black, and it would begin again.\nBacked up data, performed a factory reset, but the problem remained.\nWhen I swapped back to the OEM cable (two months ago, phone had refused this cable (full charge in 6 hours), and swapping cables returned it to normal charging habits) The phone recognized the charger, gave haptic feedback, and began charging. 30 seconds later, it powered off and reverted to the strange symbol behavior.\nI have cleaned the port, and, at the advice of some forums, raised the phone's temperature above 20\u00b0.

I'll be in the middle of a call and all of a sudden, the audio is directed to the Pixel Buds.  The case never moves, it's not charging, just randomly makes the connection to the headphones...which are still stored in the case.  \n\n2. On the flip side of this, now I can't get them to disconnect from my phone without turning off Bluetooth entirely. I want to listen to music via the speaker on the phone, but because they're connected to the Pixel Buds, it's sending audio there. I've made sure the headphones are seated properly in the case (the magnet clicks), I've cleaned the charging contacts on both the buds and the case, I even cleaned the entire buds to make sure there wasn't anything preventing them from making contact...and nothing. Eventually, not making the connection in the case is going to be an issue for charging as well. \n\nThis is my second set of Pixel Buds (first one had wires protruding from the bend in the cable) and they've never worked quite right. Anyone have any tips on how to prevent random connections when most inconvenient and then to kill the connection when trying to return to audio via the device?",

So There are several issues too with some apps and networking; besides that all around is just fine. My only rant is the downgraded battery life that I want a fix ASAP.\n\nBest regards.",

I packaged my phone and sent it, and it was confirmed as received.\n\nWe are 16 business days down the line, and I had to get in touch myself twice before I was told that there were supply problems with replacement devices and nobody could tell me when a replacement device would even be available, let alone shipped. I was disappointed with the customer service and wished to complain, but I was once again told that \"someone would get in touch via email within 24-48 hours\", which is what I was told previously before nobody got in touch at all.\n\nIncredibly frustrating customer service for what was a minor issue with the phone. I use the phone for work, and if I'd known there were supply problems I wouldn't have sent the phone in at that time, especially having planned for 10 business days without it at worst seeing as that was what I was told. I have been using Google-branded phones since the Galaxy Nexus, but unfortunately I'll now have to avoid them in future and warn others off them if this is typical customer service.\n\nAt this point I'd actually just accept having my faulty phone sent back to me, but nobody in customer service seems to be taking my concerns seriously or seems to be erecting barriers to me complaining about the replacement process.

I thought this was fixed in the April 2018 update last year but have seen various posts across here, Reddit and XDA of this issue being prevalent.What I\u2019ve found that works was disabling \u201cEnhanced 4G LTE Mode\u201d in the mobile network settings.Ive never had to disable that until now,before  Friday I was receiving mms with that enabled no problem.

I switched to another charging outlet, but the phone still would not start up. I decided to attempt a factory reset, so I held down POWER + VOLUME DOWN for a few seconds, after which I got the \"no command\" screen. I pressed POWER + VOLUME UP to get the menu options. At this point the phone started acting erratically. It would only show the menu options for a very short amount of time before rebooting and kicking me back to the \"no command\" screen. Finally I got it to actually begin the factory reboot. It displayed a black screen with small white text at the bottom saying something like \"wiping /data...\" It seemed to be stuck in this state, but I was afraid to interrupt the process, so I left it overnight (plugged into a working charger).\n\nThis morning I woke up to find nothing had changed, so I used POWER + VOLUME DOWN to restart the device again. Once again I ended up at the \"no command\" screen, so I used POWER + VOLUME UP to get to the menu. The phone seemed to be acting less erratically now, and I was able to select Factory Reset again easily. This time I got the \"wiping /data...\" message again, and it only lasted a few seconds before prompting me to restart. After restarting, I was able to begin the account setup process normally, so I thought I was in the clear.\n\nOne thing worth mentioning is that this is a company phone, and I had previously been using my company-managed gmail address for it, but during the reset process I had trouble with the 2-Auth on that account, so I switched to my personal gmail address instead. Nevertheless, everything seemed to be going smoothly, I was able to connect to wifi and set up my fingerprint again, and then the phone started downloading some recommended apps. I could see that the battery was fully charged, so I left it to finish the app downloads.\n\nWithin less than half an hour, the phone shut itself down again. This time I was unable to restart it no matter what I tried: holding POWER for over 30 seconds, holding POWER + VOLUME DOWN for over 30 seconds, holding POWER + VOLUME UP for over 30 seconds, holding POWER + VOLUME DOWN + VOLUME UP for over 30 seconds, plugging it into the power charger again, etc.\n\nAs far as I can tell the phone is completely unresponsive, and to make it more frustrating, any attempt at searching the web for solutions to this problem just leads me to instructions on how to do a factory reset, which I already did twice, and which is now impossible to attempt again because I can't even get into that boot menu anymore.\n\nIF YOU ARE READING THIS AND PLANNING TO TELL ME TO DO A FACTORY RESET, PLEASE READ AGAIN THOROUGHLY FROM THE TOP. I HAVE ALREADY DONE A FACTORY RESET, IT SEEMED TO WORK, AND NOW I CANNOT EVEN ACCESS THE MENU TO ATTEMPT ANOTHER FACTORY RESET. THANK YOU.",

This doesn't appear to be the case and my question is whether this functionality is linked to a full G-Suite account?\n\nCurrently I use my Hotmail ID which is registered to Google in order to sign in, that's the primary account on my device - does this make a difference? If yes, what is the solution? I could add a secondary Google ID but I don't want to use it as a primary account as my personal email etc. goes to Hotmail - unless you can provide a specific Gmail address to match my name !\n\nLooking for some advice really as I don't think I am getting the best from the device, and I've read posts that seem to suggest it really only works with a full G-Suite account.",

I contacted support and they told me to take it to UBreakIFix to repair it at my own cost.  This isn't right.  Obviously there's a manufacturing defect with the battery because it's swelling.  I should not have to incur the cost because the battery is defective.  Remember the Samsung exploding Note phones?  Am I going to have to wait until the phone explodes?
