      "title": "Where is my phone?",
      "content": "I'm only posting here because I have no idea what I'm supposed to do next.\n\nEarly in October, I discovered my battery was swelling to the point where the case was starting to crack. So, naturally, I got in touch with support. They told me my phone was out of warranty, so I would have to send it in for repair/replacement without first receiving a replacement phone. It would take about five to ten business days.\n\nI had to think about this, because this is my only phone. As in, I have no landline, and a phone is kind of a necessity for modern life. But I figured I could go a week or two without a phone. Better than having it explode or leak in my pocket at some point, right?\n\nIt arrived, according to Fed Ex, at the Google facility on October 5th. And then I waited.\n\nAnd waited. \n\nAnd waited some more.\n\nI heard not a word about my phone after I sent it in. No acknowledgement, no message of progress, no estimation of time, so I contacted Google via chat on the 19th. I talked to a very helpful person who looked into it for me and even went to a higher tier to find out what happened to my phone.\n\nAs it turns out, there are inventory problems, but no one contacted me to tell me so. The woman in the chat told me she'd see what she could do and promise to keep me updated. And she has.\n\nAbout every 12 to 24 hours, I get a message that they are looking into my problem and will update me when any progress has been made. It's been almost two weeks of this.\n\nI still don't have a phone. I don't know when I'm going to get my phone back. The person I chatted with, though helpful, is not high enough of a tier to expedite things.\n\nSo I'm sending it out here in the hope that someone in the Google hierarchy will notice this and maybe see what the deal is. Seriously, if I'd known I'd not have a phone for a month or more, I would have just chanced it exploding on me and tried to save for a new phone (not a Pixel, since it's so much trouble to get it repaired/replaced even when the problem isn't my fault).\n\nTL;DR: Could someone at Google tell me details on where my phone is or an estimate on how much longer it will be or something? Anything? I realize coronavirus has made things a little weird, to say the least, but I really, really need my phone back.",

I have always had my phone on backup, so I knew that it would be as simple as logging in to my account once prompted in order to recover my data and settings....\n\nNow that I have gone through the set up process and logged in with my account, none of my settings or apps have downloaded. I can see my backup on my Drive, but there is no way to download. I am not sure what to do. Will have I have to factory reset again just to access that recovery screen again?\n\nThank you in advance!",

Interestingly, if I plug my phone in, it would power up, then power down after a few seconds because the battery is too low and then reboot. If I do not plug it in, it would signalize me to be unable to power up because the battery is too low. Do you think the battery might be damaged? Is there anything I can do?\nPlease help ;) Would be happy to be able to get my phone running.",

When I click on an app I get a message \"App Isn't Available...XXX app isn't available right now.  This is managed by Google Play Services\".  I can uninstall the app and reinstall.  If I do, the App becomes available again.  The problem is I don't want to have to reinstall every app but more importantly, the Settings are not even available.  Can I hard reset the phone?  Since Play Store is available I checked for updates (there are none) and also looked for any recent updates and nothing related to Google.  I only had 2 apps update since yesterday.  Have never had a problem and Installed Android 11 the week it was launched so it's been running for a while with no issue.\n\nthank you",

      "content": "This has been a horrible experience. \n\nFirstly I bought a completely new Pixel 2 XL. \n\nLittle did I know, Google has been selling defective products through retailers and I am now only able to obtain a Refurbished replacement. If I wanted a refurbished product, I could have bought one for hundreds of dollars cheaper than what I initially bought.\n\nI did as requested, sent my originally completely defective phone. And received a replacement. I immediately noticed that your promise of it being completely inspected and passing Quality tests was not upheld. \n\nI contacted Google again. Requesting they replace the replacement phone. As It has failed Quality inspection and was sent to me regardless. \n\nAgain you requested that I send you my phone first. Meaning I had to use my old phone which barely works. Jeopardizing my job as I need my phone for work. \n\nSo I complied and sent you the second defective phone. Days later I received a third phone. \n\nYet again, the phone did not pass Quality inspection and was sent to me. \n\nI've had enough.",

In order to troubleshoot I have factory reset the phone, updated to android 11, and updated all default apps.  I have not installed any additional apps.  I have rebooted in to safe mode and the phone will reboot randomly during use.   I'm leaning toward returning the phone, but I wanted to check here first.  Thanks in advance.",

DND has permission for my stared contacts to be able to message or call, yet my phone never chimes or vibrates when it's on and those people try to contact me. For my alarm routine I'm trying to make it so it tells the weather for the day, then plays one of my playlists from YouTube music app. I had no issues with either of these topics on my last phone which is a Pixel 2. I also find the Bluetooth extremely slow to discover devices, connect to new ones, and it won't discover my Bluetooth ear phones even though other devices not previously connected to them have no issues finding them.\n\nAny help is greatly appreciated as I'm regretting buying this phone since I'm sick of having to troubleshoot it.",

      "content": "As of July 4 on my Pixel 3 my camera app crashes every time I attempt to open it. Also, as with many other comments I've seen online, my flashlight app is greyed out and cannot be turned on. Clearly the two are tied together.\n\nOf note, I am able to open Snapchat and use my selfie cam within the app. When in Snapchat there is no longer an option to switch to the back facing camera. \n\nI have tried clearing the data and the cache for the Google Camera app, uninstalling and reinstalling the Google Camera app, removing all permissions from third party apps to the camera, restarting my device multiple times, restarting my device in safe mode, clearing the data and cache of my Google Photo app, and I installed the July 5 software update as of just this morning, all with no resolution.\n\nI contacted Google's support via message option and was told that the only option left is a factory restart (which of course is only part of the trouble shooting options and as with any issue with a phone I've ever had will very likely do nothing to help, but I'm not able to try this this morning as I am not in a position to back anything up so I did not do so as of yet) and that since I'm out of warranty I am unable to send my phone in even if the factory restart does not resolve the issue. \n\nI informed them I've sent status updates multiple times since this started and inquired as to whether this is a known issue being addressed. Of course I was told it is not and that there is no work being done on what is clearly a software issue. I was told that they would pass on my issue and that \"there are many user reported issues coming through that need to be addressed\" but that they would pass this on at my request. \n\nI mentioned the fact that there was quite a bit of reporting done on the Pixel 2 camera issues and that if I have this issue then clearly others do as well and this has been reported to them, but as always they are going to play ignorant.\n\nOnce again Google is not owning up to software issues and is shoving them under the rug.\n\nTo add insult to injury the person \"helping\" me thanked me for my understanding, as if I had any choice in the matter.\n\nThank you, Google, for charging exorbitant prices for flagship phones that you do not support.",

Not to mention wasted my entire morning on this to no avail. It still does not work. \n\nThe customer service rep told me to email back with the results after my factory reset, which I did.

Factory data reset.\nThis has happen to me twice in the last couple of months. Not sure if the first time was shortly after an update or not, but my phone updated a couple of days ago and had been running okay. Both times it has happen in the middle of the night. The first time I just happen to wake up and noticed it was dead and stayed up to reset everything. This morning I woke up way late due to my phone has always been my alarm clock for over 10 years now, only to find it did it again and had to do a factory reset. Had to wait 7-10 minutes to go through the initial setup to even text my boss letting him know that I'm going to be late. Very frustrating and now I'm not sure if I can trust it anymore. I've used Google products for a long time, but lately I'm just not sure of the reliability of the products now. I have constant problems with my Chromecast Ultra too. Now I'll lose about an hour of my time installing apps, setting them up, reconnecting to Bluetooth devices (listening to actual radio on my way in to work was frustrating :-P), setting up additional email clients, and etc...

To my surprise, I could see the drainage very fast within minutes. \nI tried to charge, ofcourse with original charger, but the device is not charging. \nAs mentioned in these forums, I tried to charge the device for an hour and pressed Power button & volume down button to restart. But it didn't switched On at all.\n\nI had charged for 4 hours and tried the above approach. It vibrated once and the red light was constant. It blinked for 3 times and it was constant most of the times. After 4 hours of charging, I don't see the red light at all. \n\nLater I tried to change the charger to see if the issue is with charger and charged for 5 hours. The issue is still the same.\n\nOne thing happened good to me is that the device is still under warranty, bought in Dec-2017 and Google gave 2 years of Warranty. When discussed with tech support, they raised a pick up request, and it's 3 days there is no update on the device. The device is still with courier and is in transit. Hoping the best that Google would repair or replace the device so that I can continue to use the device for some more month.\n\nLast time it happened the same with Nexus, Pixel devices that the MotherBoard crashed on the next day of the warranty expiration., and I ended up spending thousands of rupees for Motherboard replacement. \nWish Google would help me in this aspect and not let me to spend thousands again and again.",

Tried every one of my six systems, tried different USB-A to USB-c (2.0 and 3.0) cables, tried different ports, updated my Pixel OS, am in Developer Mode, deleted Storage and Media caches and data - nothing changes.\nI've tried to download the latest Pixel 2 drivers but everything is Zipped and when I unZip the packet there's no executable or seemingly anything I can use to point the :Unknown USB Device\" in Device Manager to an updated driver.\nAnyone have any new ideas?\nThanks for looking and any advice you might have.\nTom",

Fingerprint doesn't wake it.  Power button does nothing.  Tapping the screen doesn't wake the phone either.  I can't end a call, I can't access the keyboard to entire in numbers for call centre menus, I can't swap to speaker, I can't put a call on hold, I can't mute, I can't even turn the volume up or down.\n\nI haven't even put the phone to my ear to set off the proximity sensor so its not that.  I have no case or screen protector and my phone is always clean.  The phone sits face-up on my desk and when I answer it, BLACK. the only time it doesn't do it is when I have the stock pixel headset that comes with the phone plugged in.  When I answer or make a call with a bluetooth speaker or in car, or other type of headset it's the exact same issue.  Only the stock pixel headset will stop the screen from going black.\n\nI have factory reset the phone, I have reinstalled the latest OS, I have ensured everything is update, I removed every non-stock app to see if it was a third party app playing havoc with the sensor.  None of that has fixed the issue.  Something is clearly wrong in the updates or the actual phone app itself.",

I have not received any updates and all of my inquires have been ignored. \n\nHas anyone experienced customer service similar to this?

Was told to take the phone to UBreakIFix for diagnosis and repairs. Was not expecting a lot of resistance given how widespread the issue was and the lawsuit that followed.\n\nSpent several weeks going to multiple repair locations. Each told me the motherboard needed to fix the problem was no longer available, that Google destroyed the tooling needed to make more parts, and that repairs for all Pixel 1 and 2 devices were no longer available aside from screens. \n\nSpoke again to overseas-based support. Was then essentially told \"Too bad, so sad, you're out of warranty.\" They of course are unaware of the manufacturing defect and class action. I bought the phone through an authorized reseller, and now have a bunch of money in a device that I can't use as a phone unless on Bluetooth or speaker. Assistant works about a third of the time. This is my 6th Nexus or Pixel device, and I pay for Google One storage for what that's worth. \n\nI basically got 15 months of use from this phone because of a defect I didn't cause. I don't care about settlement money, I just want the phone I bought to work. This is round 2 for me after my Nexus 5x developed the charging port issue and required replacement.

      "content": "I have a Google Pixel 3 and sometimes listen to news by saying \"OK Google, tell me the latest news.\"  After I'm done with the news I usually just close the Google app (that was playing news), and continue to do other things while listening to ebooks in the @Voice Aloud Reader app. The earbuds' middle button can be used to pause and resume the ebook when I need to. Very convenient.\n\nRecently I paired the phone with a new pair of Google 3 earbuds (my original pair was broken), and after the setup I found that the earbud buttons can be used to control Google Assistant. For example when new notifications come in, I can press the top button to listen to the notification, without taking the phone out of my pocket, which is very cool.\n\nBut then I bump into another problem: nowadays when I listen to ebooks in the @Voice Aloud Reader app, and press the middle button to pause the ebook, next time I press the middle button the ebook doesn't resume, instead the audio news starts playing. This often forces me to stop whatever I'm doing, take the phone out of the pocket, and manually close the Google app, to resume the ebook.\n\nIs there an easy way to make the middle button only pause/resume the ebook in @Voice,  instead of always triggering the audio news? Or do I have to completely turn off the earbuds control with Google Assistant, to get back the convenience to pause/resume ebooks in @Voice with the middle button?",

      "content": "I set up the wifi hotspot on the Pixel 3 to connect my laptop and other devices to the internet through my phone. I had a different Android before the Pixel 3 and did the same thing. When I sit on the train and move through areas with lots of other wifi networks/hotspots, which I will see, because the Pixel 3 will offer to connect to them, the Pixel 3 will change frequencies five six times a minute even between channels from the 5Ghz and 2.4Ghz band. \n\nMy laptop will still show the connection, but the ping to the phone's IP (gateway) will fail. My other device behaves different. It will detect that the connection has failed and cease to show the wifi connected logo in the upper right corner, but none the less lose connection to the internet and have to be manually reconnected. \n\nThis did not happen previously on the same train that I use to commute every day, when using my previous phone.\n\nThere might be other reasons for the loss of connection besides the Pixel quickly changing frequencies. This is only my suspicion, since the connection loss happens when I sit on the train and the train moves through the inner city. And because I see all the channel switches in my log files of my laptop.\n\nI tried changing the preferred frequency. I usually have it set to 5 Ghz preferred, but the Pixel phone will most often still choose 2.4 Ghz. \n\nI also disabled bluetooth and wifi on the phone as well as the Google assisted location service (uses wifi) and wifi and bluetooth location search for apps. All of that does not help. \n\nI would love to force the Pixel to stop changing frequencies or manually set the frequency for the hotspot, but have not found a way to do that. Do you know how to enable that or do you have any other idea? My current workaround is to toggle flight mode on the laptop to reconnect about once a minute.",

There is a tapping noise during all of my videos and it makes them un-usable.\n\nThis has started to become quite detrimental to my business. I work with influencers on Instagram and I recommended the new Pixel 4 phone for its camera quality. Low and behold, any videos they take are a waste of time because of the tapping noise! \n\nI noticed in some of the forums Google representatives have replied and promised a fix \"in the coming days\" but that was 3 weeks ago, and is now false. I'm not sure why a tapping noise is taking this long to fix on what should be a top priority device, it is a brand new phone after all! \n\nIs there any update on when this issue will be resolved? I only have a few more days until my return policies expire for the devices, I enjoy the Pixel and I would love to be able to continue using it, but this tapping noise in videos is very important to me and would force me to choose a different brand.\n\nIf you read through to the end thank you for your time, hope to here back soon.",

We have tried to update APN settings, we have reset network/wifi/Bluetooth settings, toggled airplane mode off and on while restarting, we have scrubbed the Pixel threads trying everything and to no avail.\n\nAny suggestions?

The case never moves, it's not charging, just randomly makes the connection to the headphones...which are still stored in the case.  \n\n2. On the flip side of this, now I can't get them to disconnect from my phone without turning off Bluetooth entirely. I want to listen to music via the speaker on the phone, but because they're connected to the Pixel Buds, it's sending audio there. I've made sure the headphones are seated properly in the case (the magnet clicks), I've cleaned the charging contacts on both the buds and the case, I even cleaned the entire buds to make sure there wasn't anything preventing them from making contact...and nothing. Eventually, not making the connection in the case is going to be an issue for charging as well. \n\nThis is my second set of Pixel Buds (first one had wires protruding from the bend in the cable) and they've never worked quite right. Anyone have any tips on how to prevent random connections when most inconvenient and then to kill the connection when trying to return to audio via the device?",

      "title": "Pixel XL boot loop with locked boot-loader - how to save at least the data?",
      "content": "Hi,\n\nMy wife's Pixel XL (gen 1) is stuck since one week in a boot loop that started suddenly when she was simply shopping online - on a trusted website. The bootloader was never unlocked and the phone never rooted, so this is stock kernel on stock HW. She was using the latest FW (QP1A.191005.007.A3) since some time without issue.\nAfter the boot loop started, I tried to side load the official OTA image. The loading worked, but it didn't change anything to the boot loop. I did it a second time, no change. I then factory reset the phone through recovery mode, no change. Side loaded OTA again, no change.\nI know the factory reset worked, since if I let the phone shut down long enough (or put it in the fridge), then it starts and attempts phone setup, but freezes while acquiring its IP address, and the boot loop soon restarts. I am thus unable to unlock the boot loader.\nSince the boot loader was never unlocked (only USB debugging was activated),  it seems I have no way to flash the factory image or any recovery ROM that would allow me to backup the phone. Is there any way to get back the data that was on the internal storage? We don't care about app settings, but pictures and documents. adb backup doesn't seem to work in side loading mode, and adb wait-for-device never fires while booting, so no way to have a shell to manually backup.\n\nIs there any hope? Either to get back the data, or to get a usable phone again.\n\nI just hope this is not the same issue as https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/2235808\nThere are no official repair centers in Switzerland or around, so this is not an option.\nI know that by factory resetting, the personal data was erased. But it is still mostly recoverable if able to dd the flash out of it.\n\nThanks in advance for your help!",

Flushed DNS.\n\nResolution:  Factory Reset  :(\n\nFurther discussion: I am wondering if ESET had something to do with it as it had no permissions for device location and was flagging all my home networks as an \"open\" or \"public\" wifi hotspot.

When I plug in my mobile in the evening, it displays \"adaptive charging\" and shows me when it's full in the morning, but my phone reaches 80% within an hour. \n\nDoes adaptive charging only really work for the last couple of % or does it need to calibrate and I am screwing over the calibration process?",

However the phone is completely intact, no damage to the outside or screen. I live in Brazil, so since the phone was bought outside of the country and brought in, there are no repair shops that deal with the brand or change/replace parts. This has become so annoying in fact, I have to plug the phone in about 20-30 times until it charges without turning off and ending up in a on/off cycle.\n\nHELP!",

Now the device starts up in Fastboot Mode with the \"Enter Reason: failed to load/verify boot images\"\n\nI connected it to my mac and downloaded the android platform SDK. It responds here.\nWhen I try to flash the bootloader, I get the following error\nFAILED (remote: 'error getting device locked state No Response')\n\nI think this error comes up, because I did not unlock the bootloader. But I cannot unlock the bootloader because android does not boot up.\nI did not enable USB debugging, and I cannot enable it now.\n\n\n\nAny suggestions?\n\nThanks for your help\nJanis",

      "title": "I am not receiving Google Verification message after enabling chat features - Google Messages",
      "content": "     First, a little background.  My carrier is Verizon Wireless and this is my first Pixel device.  I recently swapped to a different smartphone using the SIM out of my Pixel 2.  Prior to swapping devices, I had no issues with my Pixel 2, especially using chat features (RCS) in Google Messages.  \n     At first I was not receiving SMS messages on this other phone.  I reached out to Verizon and they informed I would need to enable CDMA Less feature on my line/phone number.  Once this feature was enabled, I was then able to receive SMS.  However, was never able to use enhanced chat features through Google Messages.  So, I used the Verizon Messages app instead.\n    This \"other\" phone was not a Pixel and I soon decided to switch back to my Pixel 2 after a few weeks.  Verizon recommended that I replace the old SIM with a brand new, mainly due to the CDMA Less feature that was previously added.  So, I picked up a brand new SIM at Verizon.\n    Almost immediately I learned that the Chat features were not working properly on my Pixel 2.  It was stuck on \"Verifying Phone Number\" - \"Setting Up\".  Before you point me to the other forums, I tried all the troubleshooting steps mentioned there.  I cleared cache, storage in Carrier Services and Google Messages as well.   None of these steps resolved the issue.\n    I spent hours in chat with both Google and Verizon.  Verizon explains that the CDMA Less feature is no longer tied to my line and the phone has been provisioned properly and everything looks good on their end, and refers me to Google.  Also, of course, they tell me my Pixel 2 is not on the supported list for RCS.  My wife has a Pixel 2 (same Verizon account) and chat features (RCS) work flawlessly on her device as well. \n    Google support advised me to leave feedback through the app and through the system settings feedback as well.  They also recommended that I contact the carrier.\n    Well, I did determine what I believe is the issue.  I am not receiving the Google Verification message upon enabling the Chat Features in Google Messages.  Just not sure how to resolve. I swapped SIM cards with another device on my Verizon account, this is a Samsung J3.  Incidentally, chat features work flawlessly on this device as well.   I powered both devices off, and put the SIM from the Samsung Phone in my Pixel 2.  Of course, this configured my Pixel with the other phone number of the Samsung.  I enabled the chat features in Google Messages and the phone immediately received the Google Verification message and chat features began working.\n\nAdvice?  Ideas?",

After ending that call, the sound continued until I reset my phone.\n\nThe second time, when I had taken my phone out of my pocket, it began playing loudly again. I tried turning it down, but again no effect. I opted to restart it, which fixed the issue for the time being.\n\nBoth times this has happened, I was home and the phone was on vibrate (my default \"ringtone\"). I bought the Pixel 2 from Google and put a Verizon wireless chip card in. I have a formerly Google Fi phone number that I used internationally this last summer that is now my family Google Voice number after cancelling the Fi subscription stateside and I have my original Google Voice number that is tied to my work account. I've opened Hangouts and Voice with these other accounts to check for any missed calls, and there is no indication that there were any. The differing times the sounds went off and my alarm settings make me want to rule out it being alarm-related.\n\nAny ideas or suggestions?",

Thanks.",

      "content": "Whenever I power up my device I get this message \"The bootloader is unlocked and software integrity cannot be guaranteed. Any data stored on the device may be made available to attackers. Do not store any sensitive data on the device. Visit this link on another device: g.co/ABH\"\n\nI read another forum post and it was recommended to \"flash a factory image on the phone\" using the steps found here https://developers.google.com/android/images . However I just got confused when looking through the steps. Like right off the bat it says it's easier and safer to \"sideload the full OTA image\", so I followed that link and one of the first steps says \"Don't forget to either add adb to your PATH environment variable or change into the directory containing the executable.\" Suffice to say I have no idea what that means.  So is it really recommended to do this (what are some of the possible repercussions I don't?) and if so is there a video or some other guide anyone knows of that I can follow?",

      "content": "Dear Google (or any kind fellow human-being),\nI had some issues with the built-in photo app (the pinwheel logo), namely it kept crashing while browsing photos. Therefore I tried to reinstall it through the play store. Then something super weird happened: all my photos and data seemed to have gone. They are still on my phone, somewhere, but my (Google?) applications can't detect them, so all the photos I've taken (camera as screenshots) just don't show up, I can't play music in the stock music player, nor take any new screenshots/photos.\n\nWhen I try to take a photo (with the stock camera app) or screenshot (by holding the power and volume key) it just says the memory is full, but it's clearly lying, since I can go in through the file browser and see there's space left. Also, all my personal ring tones, sounds, etc, have been replaced by some super weird stock ones (I presume; maybe even hard-coded midi files, by the sound of it...). The weird thing is that all other apps seem to work normally and I can, for example, take and receive photos with other apps.\n\nSince all the data is clearly all there, I wanted to connect to retrieve it, but I can't do that either. I went to the store to get professional help, but they said they couldn't connect to the device, although their computer did sense \"something\" was connected, but they didn't want to install new drivers and instead directed me to you.\n\nSo here I am: can you please help me connect my phone to a computer and then fix the problem with my stock apps? I was told by the store where I bought the phone it has been reported to happen because all the Google apps are connected with one another.\n\nI really to get help with this asap, because it's really embarrassing. I'm a staunch supporter of Google over for example Huawei, because I trust Google more, so I really hope someone can help me with this.\n\nThank you very much in advance!\n\n\nBest regards,\nFredrik",

Whenever I try to unlock the lock screen, it goes black too fast for me to put in a passcode. \n\nI tried to load the latest OTA from March, but my device already was running it, and after I did so, it still has the same problem.  I am trying to not have to factory reset my device and lose all my data.  Is there a way for google to fix this, or possibly save my data without a factory reset?\n\nThank you\nRory",

      "content": "Any help would be appreciated as both Verizon and Google have told me over the phone it is a very difficult situation:\nPurchased Pixel 4 from carrier outright. Traveled overseas and 60 days later the device did not unlock. Apparently it was never activated under a phone line. Purchased prepaid plan on the phone to activate  while oversees in order for the phone to communicate with Verizon so it can be unlocked. I am now told that it needs to ping a Verizon tower or it will never be unlocked and need to ship phone back. Google is saying there is nothing they can do to unlock the phone which I find highly unlikely. Thank you all in advance.",

After using my phone with a wireless charger for a while I decided to send the phone back to google to get the replacement device.  I was living in Germany but bought the device from US, so I sent the phone back to US with a friend. Finally, the device was sent to Google back and the problems started. They first sent the refurbished device to the address that I provided. after 3 days of shipment period Fedex somehow did not deliver the phone and just returned it back to google without any notice. Then I asked them to send it again and the same happened. After this last delivery issue, they started to not send the device to me. A month has passed and no actions from google about the refurbished device. Each time it took a week to try to deliver the device and it gets returned to the warehouse once again. The only thing that they can say is to be sorry about the situation that I am faced. I already bought a new device after not having my phone delivered for a month. This is the worst experience that I have ever had with a phone and with customer service. They did not come up with any solution so I can get my device back. I decided to not even get back the device. I would prefer it to be sent to anyone who needs a refurbished google phone. This experience already teaches me to never go with google products to not face with this customer service experience.",

Unfortunately I can't use my backup phones on the carrier, no loaner available from carrier either. Google said they can't do anything other than make me wait 10 days!!! Seriously I have apple phone and they have physical location everywhere and I get a new phone iin minutes!! This all online thing with Google and no plan b for consumers using single pixel device! So if u buy pixel make sure you have another primary phone, because if pixel stops working(by the look of it most of them does have defects) you will be without ur phone for 10 days!!!! Never buying another piece of hardware from this company again. Fix your warranty process or sorry we are better off with apple or Samsung.",

We checked our resources and found that we do not have a slot available for device pickup via Field Service Technician as of now, so we can only arrange for a pickup via the mail-in process. In mail-in, the device is picked up and delivered by our courier partners and no loaner device can be provided for the same. Also, the turn around time for the mail-in process is 15 business days. Please confirm, if you agree for the device pick up via mail-in process, so we can create a new service request.\nAwaiting your response.\nThanks!\nTarun\nThe Google Support Team",

Does anyone have advice or contact details if anyone in Google uk who can actually do something? The scripted responses I occasionally receive are useless and annoying.

      "content": "Is anyone else experiencing decreased signal strength since March 1st update? My pixel 2, immediately after the update, started showing no connection. When this started, the display would show the LTE icon, full bars with an x underneath. After restarting the device it shows me on H+ or 3G connection. This is mostly happening at work, not sure if it happens at home as i switch to wifi as soon as I'm home. Before the update I had no network issues at work. Nothing has changed at work, in the same office. Signal strength is decent around town. \n\nI've been working with T-mobile for the past 2 weeks doing resets. T-mobile put in a ticket with their engineering team to check on issues in my area. I've replaced the SIM card. T-mo found no issues on their part and are still trying to work with me to find a resolution. \n\nI realize T-mo doesn't have the greatest signal inside buildings, but as I mentioned earlier i was having no issues until the latest update.\n\nOne weird thing that's happening, my phone will show LTE signal with full bars when i arrive to work but nothing loads, not even slowly. i have to restart my phone for it to switch to H+ or 3G. \n\nHas anyone else encountered this? Anyone have any ideas they could share?",

I live in Canada, and purchased what were labelled as  a \"Certified Refurbished\" Pixel 2 XL. Twice. It's important to note that I purchased it from Best Buy Canada, through a wholesale company, but from what I understand, the process for certifying the Pixel is done by Google.\n\nThe first phone I received had a defective charging port, and defective bottom speaker. I had it refunded. The second phone, the most recent one, simply stopped working after approximately 2 weeks. I am currently being sent the replacement (also refurbished). This has left me wholly unsatisfied with the Pixel experience. I was wondering if anything could be done (on the part of Google), to resolve this issue.",

This issue can occur after a fresh restart when no apps are open. It just occurred as I was trying to write this sentence. \n\nAny ideas to fix this are appreciated.

      "content": "Hi, hoping someone can help. As of yesterday, certain podcasts won't play through ANY podcast app. Have tried Google Podcasts, Castbox and Pocket Casts. Some podcasts play fine (eg: Louis Theroux's Grounded) and others won't play at all (eg: Not Another D&D Podcast). Have tried clearing caches, re-installing app, restarting phone, updating to latest OS, downloading the problem podcasts, and nothing seems to work. I just get an error saying \"An unknown error occurred playing this episode. Please try again later.\" \nI have also tried playing the problem podcasts directly through their website, but the embedded player is greyed out and will not allow me to click play. Any help would be greatly appreciated.",

Below are the instances that I can/can't hear sound.\n\nI CAN hear sound when:\n - I can hear my ringtone when someone calls me\n - I can hear someone when I switch to speakerphone (they can hear me through the mic both on speaker phone and normal earpiece mode)\n - I can listen to music via earphones plugged in using 3mm cable (though my inline buttons are not working - not sure if this is related)\n\nI CAN'T hear any sound when:\n- I answer the call and listen using the default speaker at my ear\n- I play media via spotify, Instagram, YouTube etc\n\nThe weird thing is, in the sound settings which break the levels into media, call, ring and alarm volume, only the ring and alarm volumes make a noise when adjusting the sliders. The media and call volumes do not make any sound.\n\nAlso, if I try to set a new ringtone for my phone or alarm sound, I can hear the demo noises. However, if I try to set the ringtone for notifications I cannot hear any of the demos.\n\nWhat is going on? Hopefully someone can shed some light on the matter and the sound may follow ;)",

      "title": "Pixel 2 phone shuts down suddenly when playing audio or vibrates on low battery levels",
      "content": "Got a Pixel2 since launch with it having Android 10 installed. Since the start of this year, I've been having issues that shut down my phone at around 25% battery or less whenever I play audio on my phone speakers/alarm sounds/or sometimes a vibrate from a incoming call. Whenever it shuts down, it does sort of a like a sudden screen blackout without warning, with a few horizontal white lines in the middle; then if its somewhat >10%, it just restarts, but otherwise will stay off. I've downloaded some apps to check battery life (Accubattery), and it seems to be at around \\~65% battery lifespan (though I'm not sure if this is an accurate measurement). However, I'm now very aware of when my phone is at low percentages, and am curious to know what could be causing the audio in low percent shutdowns to occur. As for physical damage to the phone, since a year ago ,I've only had one major drop to the phone's bottom left, with it landing screen side down causing a minor crack, but all parts of the screen still touchable and usable. Not sure if this is a common occurrence among the first set of Pixel2 phones, or this is just unique to my case. I've tried battery saver and turning it on/off to no avail, and also did a full battery charge to full drain to no improvement on the audio shutdown problem. I don't want to do a factory reset yet, as i am not sure if that's the fix for the problem, and would only waste time setting up stuff again if that's nit the solution. I need some direction to look into what I can troubleshoot or if this is a hardware defect, if someone has come across this before. Any and all help on this with this would be appreciated. Thanks",

However, it only shows one number for each contact. In my Google Contacts, I have a friend called \"Rita\" - she has a home number and a mobile number against the contact. On my old Samsung, it would show both numbers and I could choose whether to call the home phone or the mobile. On the Pixel, it only shows one number. Going into Google Contacts, I could see that her mobile was set as \"default\" so I removed the default - but then the phone pad just showed her home number. I'd like to be able to type her name, and select which number to call, like I did on the Samsung Galaxy. Is this not possible on the Pixel?",

None of the numbers are set to Divert to Voicemail. First call from each number goes to voicemail (If they leave message I get a notification). If they do not leave a message I have no idea they have called.\n\nI have gone into phone app, clicked 3 dots, gone to calls and calling accounts and ensure \"receiving incoming calls\" is on.\n\nI wonder if an error was backing up to the replacement phone  (thus potentially introducing the error back to this new/refurbished phone?).\n\nI only have three Blocked numbers on the phone. none are the ones I was calling from (to test it).\n\nMy call forwarding options are showing as follows:\nalways forward: off\nfwd to voicemail when.....busy, unanswered, unreachable. \n\nThis morning I did a reset of network & app settings . There was no visible benefit to doing this. \n\nMy wife uses the same network as me (albeit on an apple phoen0 and has no reception issues).\n\nThe original Pixel3a worked perfectly for about 9 months before suddenly \"getting invisibly stuck on Do not Disturb\"). This replacement only arrived a couple of days ago but has same problem. \n\nOne suggestion I have read on another forum (another user had similar problem) is that maybe a third party app is causing the problem. But where would I start tracking this down?\n\nMy next action was going to be to launch in Safe mode to see if that allows phone to ring. (is this a logical test?)\n\nFantatstic phone until it stopped ringing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! \n\nThank you for reading this.",

      "title": "Pixel 2 XL Bluetooth Issues",
      "content": "In the last week or so, my Pixel 2 XL started to have issues connecting to my OontZ Angle 3 portable blue tooth speaker. I would turn the speaker on and music would play for about 3 seconds before the music would stop. I tried to follow the exact instructions to reconnect the device to my phone, but still it would not work. I could only get it to work if I turned my phone off and on again.\n\nAfter several days of doing this, I went to the Bluetooth Device Details for my speaker. I turned off Phone Calls and suddenly my speaker started playing music again. I didn't think anything of it again as the speaker was pretty cheap, so I figured there was some weird thing off in the speaker.\n\nTurns out, I was wrong. For the first time in about a month I tried to listen to music using my Pixel Buds as well and the same thing was happening: music would play for a few seconds and then stop. I went in to the Device Details for the Buds and turned off Phone Calls and it started working again. However, doing this also made it so I can't control my music with gestures on the Buds.\n\nI can understand issues with a cheap speaker, but for a pair of expensive ear buds that were designed specifically to work with the Pixel 2 is a bit much. Is there anyway to fix the Bluetooth settings on my phone so I can actually use the Buds for their intended use?",

Once in awhile, the phone charges, more often with a slow USB A 2.1A charger, so with a lot of persistence, I've been able to keep it charged.\n\nSometimes when I plug it into one of the USB C PD chargers, the phone cycles charging (not charging) charging (not charging) every few seconds for a few minutes, then quits.   unplugging, and replugging the charger doesn't help.     rebooting the phone doesn't help.",

I have done so, many times without any problem and everything worked perfectly before.\n\nNow, I am having the following problem - when I first insert my GSM sim card, it works fine, I can make phone calls, send/receive messages and etc. But, as soon as I connect to the Internet, the phone says that the Sim card isn't supported and asks me to contact Verizon.\n\nThe phone is definitely unlocked, because it reads my sim without the Internet. Furthermore, Verizon has a policy, when after 60 days, they automatically unlock phones and 60 days has already passed.\n\nSo, I am quite sure that it is a Google problem (when I received the device, it had Android 10, I updated it to Android 11 and I still have the same problem). After a factory reset, the phone again reads the sim and again does not recognize it after I turn on the Internet.\n\nCan someone help'?\n\nJust in case, here is the video demonstration of the problem - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR6bVrYVXqk",

      "content": "My Pixel 3 XL recently started to close apps while in use, this has happened with multiple apps open during multitasking, as well as when just using a single app such as maps for driving on it's own on a freshly rebooted phone.\n\nI've tried a fresh start on the device returning it to factory settings and then only installing a select few apps - it still randomly closes apps and specifically Google Maps when being used for voice based driving directions. This is a consistent problem using maps for directions but occurs across nearly any visually intensive app as well (everything from chrome to YouTube to Pokemon go will just close fully while in use)\n\nOn opening the app again, it will start fresh as if it was evicted from RAM. I'm at wits end, I know these phones have memory management issues but I wasn't aware or told the applications would close DURING active usage.\n\nEdit: I should mention that the regular Google Pixel 3 XL Memory Management Errors do occur as well, background apps are unable to keep their active state (or in the case of a music based background usage such as play music or pocketcasts - it will close them as soon as you switch to a new activity no matter how many apps are \"open\" in the task list). This is NOT fixed by turning off or changing any adaptive battery settings, the issue is the same regardless of any settings in adaptive battery settings.",

Can anyone suggest how I might fix it? I've already tried my own EE sim in it several times and it doesn't recognise the SIM so although most are sold unlocked it seems I'm unlucky that mine wasn't",

      "content": "I received a replacement for my Pixel 3 and copied all settings / data from old Pixel 3 to the new one (using cable method) and followed all prompts and waited until the new phone set-up was complete.\n\nSadly though, some of the apps were missing on the new phone, some settings were wrong too and my wallpaper / display settings were incorrect (all set to defaults).\n\nI then realised my old phone was on Android 11 and the new replacement I'd received was on Android 10.\n\nSo I upgraded new phone to Android 11, then did a Factory Reset,  then went through the entire set-up process again and this time all apps / settings and wallpaper were copied over fine.\n\nIt would be cool if the set-up process detected the Android mismatch and gave an option to upgrade Android on the new phone BEFORE set-up does its stuff...... but meanwhile, as a suggestion.....\n\nPerhaps you could amend your help pages (e.g. https://support.google.com/android/answer/6193424 ) to.....\n\ndescribe how to ensure new phone Android version is greater than or equal to Android version on old phone BEFORE starting set-up, then (if needed)\ndescribe how to exit set-up and do Android upgrade beforehand\n\nMight save some confusion and having to run set-up twice.\n\nCheers all",

      "title": "Inherent problems with Pixel 2: camera, phone crashing",
      "content": "Numerous problems of similar nature, would appreciate if anyone has found solution to any, Google Email support has been of no help. \n\n1. Pixel 2 randomly switches off phone when:\n        a)  you open any app that uses camera (including Google's camera app) \n        b) sometimes when a call is coming - and then it doesn't show that missed call\n        c) even while it is charging!! And it shows the 0% discharged sign while it is charging and has a significant amount of battery left. \n        d) randomly at other times when using the phone, this is extremely annoying because the battery drains significantly when this happens (more on battery draining/battery life on number 4). This is also dangerous because if I'm travelling I need to have a reliable phone that won't randomly switch off while I'm trying to call or use the phone. In detail this happens even when on the home screen but also with apps namely like Ola. *disclaimer: not an ola app problem, since this happens with a lot of apps and even while an app isn't even being used.* \n\n2. Problems with Camera: \n         a) Camera randomly stops working, the video doesn't record - gaps in video, \n         b) photo disappears after being taken, \n         c) or the photo doesn't get taken, phone hangs on camera app and must be restarted. \n         d) Additionally, the time lapse feature randomly works and doesn't work: sometimes it is able to stay on for 30 minutes, but other times it switches off by itself after 10 seconds.                       Timelapse randomly automatically switches off. \n\n3. According to cnet (for lack of information regarding battery life given on google's official website), the battery life of the Pixel 2 is supposed to be 13 hours, however it is barely averaging 6-7 hours in a day, and that's with battery saver on. \n\n4. The phone has also randomly switched off and refused to turn on two times, wherein I had to force reset it by going to the BIOS screen; this happened completely randomly and has taken place twice already. \n\n5. When calling, or even if not, there are some weird sounds at a (high?) frequency that are emitted from the speakers, this isn't a huge problem but I don't understand why this is happening. \n\n6. While Pixel 2 is charging (using Google's original adaptor and usb a to c connector with usb a to c cable) the charging reduces!! If the battery is 11% before charging, after \"charging\" it becomes 10%; however when the same cable is plugged into a laptop, it charges albeit slowly - I'm guessing the connector shouldn't be used for charging?",

      "content": "After my Pixel 3a took the December 2020 update I noticed that the corners of the screen are no longer smoothly curved, and appear more like 45 degree edges. The screen's physical corners can now be seen to extend under the bezel, especially if you tilt the phone. It's most noticeable when the screen shows brighter colours.\n\nIt seems like up until this update, the OS implemented smoothly curved corners via software so that the physical corners of the screen under the bezel were effectively 'off' or black. Has anyone else noticed this?\n\nThe effect is a bit distracting and removes some of the polish of an otherwise amazing phone and lovely screen!",

When it comes on every thing works well.Usually, before I did factory data reset, my alarm sometimes, but not all the time, wakes the screen up. I have tried volume down and power button options several times when the screen goes out but to no avail. It will rather come on by itself. I don't know whether I bought the phone or it bought me. Now it's has been reset,  it responds to cable and charger plug( only soft plug in sound, no charging  display) in and vibrates when you try restart (power and volume button) but no LED lights.

However, i just noticed that there's this like stain about 2 cm long (diameter) in the upper right side of the display, near the power button. It is barely noticeable and only seen when the screen displays a dark color (Dark gray for example, like twitters dark mode) and the screen brightness is about 30 to 60%. It is a white stain tho. The screen has no performance issues. I haven't dropped the phone or done anything that could damage the screen.\n\nShould I worry about this? Will it become worse with time? Should I return the phone?\n\nThe phone works flawlessly but this drives me crazy because it makes me think that it will become a real problem later on.\n\nThank you!",

A lot of times it'll hold onto a signal from a puck far away as I walk across the house, then switch to LTE only, and then about 10 seconds later pick up the newer, closer Google Wifi puck.\nThis is my first Pixel 3 but we have other Pixels in the house (3a, 2, OG) and they all hold onto the Wifi smoothly from room to room across the house.\n\nI already assigned a static IP.  Didn't seem to help.\n\nI tried it in safe mode.  Also didn't seem to help.\n\nI don't have any weird apps on it -- the exact same ones I had with my previous OG Pixel, which didn't do this.\n\nMy guess is that I have a wonky wifi unit (i.e., hardware problem).  In the grand scheme of things this is a minor annoyance and the world won't end.\n\nAnd as the other phones don't do it and my Google Wifi setup hasn't changed in 2 years, I don't think it's the Wifi.  I \"turned off and on again\" all the google wifi pucks just in case it was acting funny after an update or something.  No difference.\n\nCould this be a known 11 beta 3 bug?  (did it in 2.5 also).  I didn't really use this in Android 10 -- as soon as I got the phone I upgraded to 11 beta 2.5.\n\nI don't want to factory reset the phone.  Not worth it.  Especially since I just got it (have had it for about 2-3 weeks) and the apps are exactly the same as on my OG pixel.\n\nAny thoughts/ideas welcomed.  Not expected anyone to solve this.  Just wondering.\n\nthanks.",

Regardless of the battery level or if the phone is plugged in or even if the phone is in airplane mode the phone randomly dies (most likely weekly). One thing I've observed is that after the phone crashes the battery level is not reporting properly as an example see the image; the phone restarted when the battery was about 70% then when the phone was back online the battery level was reporting around 30% which remained steady throughout the day:\n\nThe OS is not rooted or modified whatsoever, I dont even have a ton of apps so any hint would be appreciated. If you happen to know how to review the OS logs without rooting the phone it would be appreciated.\n\nP.S. I suspect the DNS ad blocker app could be causing this but I am not 100% certain.\n\nRegards,\nAlex.",

      "content": "Hi everyone,\nI have a Pixel 2 XL, everything was working fine until the other day I dropped it\nNow the screen is completely black, doesn't turn on\nIt doesn't have any scratches or anything, it just doesn't turn on\n\nIf I put my finger in the fingerprint scanner, I can feel it vibrate\nSo it seems like it is somewhat working\n\nI can get to fastboot by doing the volume down + power combo, and I can see it when I run fastboot devices command\nBut I cannot get it to show on adb devices, maybe because I'm missing steps, but it's kinda hard when you can't see the screen\n\nSo now I'm wondering if it's just the screen that is not working, and I can maybe order one from eBay or something, or if it is the mainboard that is not working well, in which case, well, guess there is not much else to do\n\nAny suggestions?",

After a while, it came back to not-normal.\n\nAfter closing all the apps, a hard reset and factory reset, the problem persists as the phone won't recognize more than one touch simultaneously. I've also enabled the High sensitivity option in the Screen menu. We don't live in the States so returning the device is nearly impossible for us.\nThe device has the OMOTON screen protector but I'm 80% sure that this isn't the root cause.\n\nShall I remove the screen protector or wait for further software updates?\nAny idea?\n\nThanks!!!",

Now since last night my phone has been saying it has a 58% charge, not only that the thing lasts about 30 seconds after taking it off the charger. I can only use the phone while it's plugged in. I got the Google pixel 4 XL for Christmas just 4-5 months ago.\n\nToday I tried factory resetting, deleting new/un-used apps, changing a few settings to help battery life. Nothing worked so far. Any tips?\n\nEDIT: and on top of all that I've noticed my phone has been super choppy and slow when scrolling through messages, Snapchat, and other apps/pages where you can scroll up and down",

      "content": "Well here goes , long story cut short. Since the day i setup up my pixel 3a it has had soft and hardware issues.  Could be multiple issues but i have identified a few and realise a new one that is causing problems. Google play music since day one seems to notify me it trying to update.  I don't use it and have not for years. Had one song one it.  But seeing as they are phasing it out and starting YouTube music.  Why have they bothered to preinstalled it on my device. Issues got worse when i opted to enjoy a free 6 month trial with apple music offered by my network provider.  Honestly i don't think the apple music app does well on a pixel anyway. But it has affected hardware mainly volume of music and various other software issue. issues. But last night i decided to access Google dashboard to try and wipe permanently the play list it claim i have in play music account that are not.  It offered to transfer them to yt music so i though go for it.  What is did was transfer playlists i had set up in apple music. So clearly a clash between and Google play music and yt music app issues. And now all those playlist are on yt music . With the one song i had in Google account. But yt music app setting are now clashing in the triangle of google play music, apple music and yt music app.   I am finding the yt music web page has amazing play back volume through chrome of all browsers, but absolute shockingly low and the equaliser settings seem to be like a petulant toddler that change themselves or do not change at all in the app. This has had a profound affect on my device and has definitely caused it to  suffer before its time .  So how do i get them to accept this and get a replacement that has not suffered the strain due to Google not thinking this through.   40gb data plan a month and i ain't using more than 12% because i just have given up with my phone.     It really has not helped with all the ways Google back up you data in various ways as you can not getting it clear enough. Device personalisation services just another spanner in the works that pushes the issue even after factory reset.   Feel so let down as i have been an android user since htc first released smart phones . Now Google the creator of android have come so far and messed up spectacularly.  And honestly i really hope i am right about this because if not then not only have they left use with a worse os than year gone by but clearly are producing poor quality hardware.  I am one of thousands having similar issues. This is not a user issue, but a google problem \ud83d\ude25\n\n\nP.s. they also have the nerve to call this a community but yet i can not comment on others questions that are having the similar issues. Why, because they do not want users communicating and figuring out between us that they are at fault.",
