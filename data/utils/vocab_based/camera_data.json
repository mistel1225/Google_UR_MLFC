The pictures are too grainy and blurry. It is even worse when used in snapchat and whatsapp.\n3. Even at half of the full volume i felt big vibration on the backside.\nIs these problems common among other pixel 4a phones.? Should i return it? I have 4 days more of return period.",

The phone is in pristine condition, just for the sake of not talking in mind hardware related uses.\n\nIs the gcam bugged because of any update of the camera or Android 11 itself? Everything worked flawlessly till yesterday night when I tried to take a photo of nightsky and the rear camera displayed a black screen. As of today the rear camera doesn't even display in the gcam nor any other app, including QR ones. How do I may proceed? The phone is 2 months old so I would not think it's hardware related, but who knows. I'll attach a couple of pictures displaying the problem.",

I followed all steps suggested including booting in safe mode and factory reset but had the same crash always. Just today as I was about to return the phone to seller, I disabled some features from developer settings for camera including Google Lens Suggestions, Framing hints, Video stabilization and Show dirty lens warning. Then opening the camera app was a success. After reenabling all 4 features the app keeps working correctly. I suspect this is a software bug, unfortunately as I was frustrated I didnt try to disable 1 feature at a time so as to be sure which was the culprit. Has anybody experience a similar issue?",

    "content": "Hi,\nI am currently investigating getting a renewed Pixel 4 phone specifically for the camera. One of the things I would like to be able to do is use audio from a USB audio interface when recording video (I want to record myself playing guitar and have the sound coming from my PC's DAW as the sound source rather than ambient sound from the mic). To do this I need to be able to connect the USB interface directly to the Pixel 4. I cannot find out anywhere if this is possible. It seems that I need USB OTG functionality for this to work, but I cannot find out anywhere if the Pixel 4 supports this as all specs just mention USB C 3.1. Has anybody tried this successfully? I am looking at the iRig Stream interface to take the sound from my PC and convert it to USB C.\nThanks for any info\nColin",

    "title": "Pixel 3a front camera repeated failure",
    "content": "My Pixel 3a front (selfie) camera stopped working in late November 2020.  I tried different camera apps, doing a factory reset on the phone, and all of the other troubleshooting steps from Google.  None of them made any difference, so I was advised to send my phone to a Google authorized repair partner (Ubreakifix was the only option in Canada) for out of warranty repair.  They replaced the front camera module and midframe (which I assume was damaged in disassembly) and it worked great until March 2021.  Suddenly the front camera stopped functioning again - giving me the same \"Something went wrong\" message in the camera app when I try to switch to the front camera.  As in November, it doesn't work in other apps either.  In early April, I noticed the bottom right corner of the display is lifting away from the midframe and I started getting \"phone is getting too warm\" messages occasionally when using the phone in bright sun.  I'm rather frustrated as I spent about $250 for the repair and it seems like the camera modules are prone to failure based on anecdotal evidence online.  I'm not thrilled about the idea of shelling out more to repair this again, only to wonder if the camera module will fail again.  I'm going to try to make my case to the Ubreakifix franchise to give me a break on it, but since it's outside of their 90 day warranty, I don't think I have a leg to stand on.  I do suspect something was wrong with the replacement midframe/adhesive or application thereof since the display is separating from it, but I don't know if that's a factor in the second camera failure.  Any thoughts?",

    "title": "Pixel 4a front-facing camera not focusing correctly on subject (FIX)",
    "content": "The Pixel 4a has a well-documented problem with the Pixel 4a front-facing (selfie) camera not being focused on the subject.  It is fixed focused 10 feet behind the subject, even at the recommended distance of 18\" or more - the subject remains out of focus and blurry while the background is crisply in focus.\n\nHere's a test my professional video engineer dad ran on the 4a front-facing camera:\n\n\"The problem is a design or manufacturing fault.  Here are photos of the Pixel front facing camera as delivered and with a +2 or +3 close-up filter.  There are focus star charts at the subject distance of 14\" and also in the background at 9 feet.  As set at the factory the background is more or less in focus, but the subject is not.  It's better with a +2 close-up filter taped over the camera lens, and perfect with a +3 close-up filter.  Clearly the camera is not focused properly, either because the wrong focal length was spec'd or delivered for the camera, or because the lens is too close to the sensor.  The simplest fix for existing phones, under the circumstances, would be for Google to admit the camera has a fault, and send a small stick-on +3 close-up filter to place over the camera lens to anyone who requests one.\"\n\nStep up Google, and make good on your defective camera.",

It seems that the 5g has more saturated (over saturated?) colours (especially in video mode), slightly less detail perhaps, better skin tones and a less washed out look, but maybe less good night shots? The cameras are the same so must be the software. These are just my observations from literally two comparison videos, and so I'd be really keen to get feedback from anyone with experience of both phones!\nCheers, \nAlex",

You can see the noise in the darker sections of the picture. Does anyone else have this problem ? Is this how it's supposed to work ? Is there a fix ? The noise makes the photo unusable.

    "content": "I don\u2019t know why. Maybe it\u2019s because I upgraded to Android 11. My camera can no longer be used normally. I can\u2019t use the rear lens without dropping it on the ground or getting water. After turning the camera apps on, there is a black screen. I need to wait a few minutes to see the image. Even if I see the image, it is blurred and out of focus, and it will get stuck immediately. This makes me very bad for the pixel 4a. I think the core advantage of the pixel 4a as a cheap phone is that its camera function is comparable to flagship phones. But when I can no longer use its camera function, it loses its appeal to me. Can\u2019t use the rear the lens is a problem even for daily use. I can't even scan the QR Code. I am quite disappointed with Google phones. I hope someone can help me solve the problem. I have tried using safe mode, using Third-party camera software, clearing camera data, and even Restoring the phone to the factory settings, but I still can't restore my camera functions.I have just gotten my Pixel 4a for a week only.",

    "content": "Whenever I try to use the dual exposure toggles on my Pixel 4a it adds a lot of noise, for example, to the darker parts of the picture if I bump up the shadow toggle. The noise is retained even beyond the processing. I have attached two pictures - both were shot in normal camera but one was with the dual exposure toggles manually changed. You can see the noise in the darker sections of the picture. Does anyone else have this problem ? Is this how it's supposed to work ? Is there a fix ? The noise makes the photo unusable. This also happens in day time photos, when there's plenty of light, which is even more annoying. Please help.",

Portrait mode. 2. Nightscape mode. 3. Low light photos.\nLast but not the least main thing how is the 4k recording in pixel 5 is it good enough ?\n\nDoes Pixel 5 camera quality is upto the level of S21 ultra and iphone 12 pro max ?",

Currently it always starts in stills mode.\n\nI know it is a simple swipe to move between the two modes but 90% of the time I want video rather than stills so it would make sense to me to swap the default setting, especially as I often film from my bike so need quick access with the least fiddling around.\n\nThis is my first Pixel so apologies if I'm missing something simple. I came from Samsung where I was able to do this and so just assumed I would be in there somewhere.\n\nThanks for any advice you can offer",

I purchased a pixel 5 a few months back and right away I noticed two main issues with the Pixel 5's images. \n1) The HDR bracketing is really bad and not even very noticeable when compared to the Pixel 3 \n2) When editing photos (raw or jpeg) and you adjust contrast, darkness or exposure you can start to see a grid pattern in the image. This is really evident when increasing the HDR in a third party app like Snapseed. \n\nNote: this issue is present using both the wide angle and regular lens\n\nIs this a hardware issue? I have updated my build to the latest release as of the date this is posted. This problem has kept me using the Pixel three. Supper bummed...",

(He sent me the device which is he bought from the Google Store.) \n\nBut around February, the back camera suddenly died black and it didn't work. Whenever I open the camera app, only got a pop-up message telling me to turn off and turn on the app again. There was also a problem that flashlight icon was grayed out and stated in being used. \n\nI've tried all the possible solutions google mentioned in help center. also searched in the Google community and found many people suffering same issues like me, but there was no clear solution. so I finally contacted Google Support to get an RMA. \n\nWhen I contacted them, they told me my IMEI number was blocked. However, when I checked my IMEI on another IMEI checking website(even google store page), it didn't say it was blocked. anyway Google told me to take over ownership from a friend because the email account and the owner did not match, and I asked my friend to transfer. Then they asked me to start a new chat again so that they can  authenticate my device and check the ownership. I did that and waited for their response.\n\nBut all of a sudden, they responded \"We have conducted an investigation and determined that this device is not eligible for a warranty replacement/refund due to previous illicit activity. We recommend you reach out to the place where you purchased this device, as they may be able to provide you with further information.\" \n\nWhenever I asked them what kind of illicit activity I was being accused, they only send the same answer over and over. They're driving me crazy. I'm told to reach out the place I bought it from but I bought it from you Google store! who do you want me to contact?  I've been suffering for two months and losing hope... All I want is RMA with warranty.",

It's a nuisance having to repeatedly move all the images into just \"Camera\" rather than the phone do it automatically. It is especially a pain because I want my Dropbox app to be able to automatically sync my phone's pictures onto my Dropbox, but I am struggling being able to get my Dropbox app to recognize my phone pictures since they're all split into different folders.

    "content": "I have been having problems with camera/photos for a couple of weeks. I concluded a long chat session with a Google rep but he was unable to fix it.I have also sent this in as Feedback from my Google Pixel 4a phone.\n  These are the issues:\n  (1) Deleting photos and videos on the Google Photos 'roll' is problematic. Some will not delete at all. Some remain but are blurry, out if focus, when I know that the original photo was in-focus. Some stay on the photo directory as grey squares; in other words they take up space on then 'roll' but there is no image.\n  (2) Images/thumbnails on the Google Photos directory/roll have a right arrow in the middle, indicating that they are videos. When that thumbnail is tapped the full image fills the screen, the arrow is still there. When the arrow is tapped nothing happens, i.e. no video plays, the still image stays. I am not 100% sure that the image ever was a video-- I think it was (there are many fake video icons, it's not just one) but it is possible that it was a still in the first place and a video icon was somehow added.\n  (3) The dates of many photos have been changed. Photos that I know for certain were taken in Nov, Dec, Jan, and Feb are appearing under Oct 25th or 27th, etc.The 'roll' is really a mess. Some images from long ago, prior to October, are dumped in the Oct 27th (or nearby date) listing. It's ridiculous. And a big mess.\n  Has anyone else experienced these problems?\n\nThanks.",

It is getting freezed and the images are getting distorted. I tried troubleshooting in everyway but still the problem occurs. I had no other option other than returning the product to amazon as they can't replace the product as there was no other device on stock. I felt really sad. Because, i kinda liked the device a lot. But at the same time google has disappointed me in the way they give support to these devices and the availability. If i buy a device and it's having camera issues right after one week, camera which is a primary component of such google device getting such issues are unacceptable. And it's really bad that google haven't reported this issue officially, because combing through a lot of Reddit threads i came to the many people are facing the same. I don't think i can afford such device even when i like it so much. It's really sad.",

    "title": "Back Camera and Flashlight not working",
    "content": "Yesterday I took a video through the messenger app and sent as a text message. After that the back camera has stopped working. The flashlight is also not able to turn on. Flashlight button says \"camera in use\" and is greyed out. I have cleared storage and cache of the camera app and have done a factory reset. Still, the back camera will not work. I have tried on a third party app as well (Snapchat) and I have the same problem where only the front camera works. The day before this happened my phone updated to the March 5 security update. So I'm thinking might be software related? Is anyone else having this issue? And if so do you know of a fix?",

    "content": "Hi everyone - I've recently been having some issues with my camera on my 4XL. I haven't been having much luck narrowing down if it's a hardware or software (camera app) issue and the keywords I've been using and searching for haven't been helping me solve my specific issue. I'm aware of the Pixel 3 \"camera shaking fiasco however, mine doesn't seem to be exactly the same. While in video mode or using the view finder to take still pictures for that matter, the \"video\" rips or tears. This issue also gets recorded on video. The things I've noticed are:\nIt seems to happen no matter the orientation\nIt seems to rip/tear more when I pass vertical objects, almost like the stabilization has something to do with it.\nIf I have my ear near the phone, which is difficult to do, I can sometimes hear the optics clicking, this may mean nothing\nMy phone is still under warranty until May 2021\n\nHere's a video of what I'm seeing, more of the rip/tears are at the end. Chose the woods because of all the vertical trees. Hopefully the quality of this example is high enough:\nhttps://vimeo.com/519594905",

    "content": "I am extremely disappointed with the front facing camera on this device. I switched from Samsung to Google after hearing great reviews about the pixel cameras. I totally regret purchasing a google and would never purchase one again.  Google you should seriously investigate and fix this and arrange for your customers either a replacement or a software update whichever is applicable in this case. People purchase google phones due to the high quality of the camera however this greatly disapoints. Please resolve Google otherwise customers would be going elsewhere.",

I tested it with professional light etc....my old Motorola one vision take a better looking shoot btw and is a 200\u20ac phone.\n\nWhy? Is a lack of software optimization? \nI'm very disappointed! Not what i'm expecting from a google flagship!\n\nThanks, G.\n\nIn order:\n\nYoutube link to video comparison: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jM0kqoJMvjc&feature=youtu.be\n\nPixel Cam Front \nWhatapp cam Front \nInstagram Cam Front ",

At the same time as Pixel 3 launch (October 18th), we will introduce support for Android-compatible plugged-in external microphones in the default camera app for all Pixels. I hope you all enjoy the update.\"\n\nI have an old Pixel 2XL and a brand new Pixel 5   Cant make it work on either.

The app would crash any time it was opened.\n\nI figured the problem was solved until last night when I tried to record a video. The moment I clicked on the video tab, the camera app just closed. Now it just closes any time I open the app. It doesn't crash, it just closes. I've factory rest the phone already but it keeps having the same issue.",

    "content": "I bought my Pixel 4a in October, when it was launched in India. The main reason for buying the device was it's camera. And I was super happy about it at the beginning. \n\nHowever, over the course of time, the quality of images from the front camera has reduced drastically. It's not like the phone is taking bad pictures; it looks more like a focus issue.\n\nSince the camera used to take splendid images earlier, I feel it is a software issue rather than anything to do with the hardware. Just look at the attached image, the one on the right was taken the very next day I bought the phone while the one on left was taken today. \n\nI understood that I'm not the only one facing the issue as couple of my friends who own the phone also told me the same. There are also numerous posts about it in this forum too. And if we google it, you can see a lot of people have the same issue.\n\nWould really love it if Google can do something about the front cam software as I know my device can take better selfies",

    "content": "Hi All,\n\nI am on my second Pixel 5 now and am experiencing an issue in which the phone temporarily freezes after deleting a photo within the google camera or google photos app. \n\nSteps to reproduce are as followed:\n\n1. Open the camera app\n2. Take 4 photos\n3. Wait about 10 seconds\n2. Review the photos within the camera app\n3. Delete the 4th photo\n\nAt this point the app displays the 2nd photo ( instead of the 3rd), freezes the phone for about 3-5 seconds, displays the 3rd photo and unfreezes the phone. This is also happening with the google photos app.\n\nI have tried the following:\n\n1. Uninstall all updates\n2. Install all updates\n3. Run in safe mode\n4. Delete all cache and data\n5. Factor reset the phone\n\nNothing above solved the issue. \n\nI am not running any apps other than the ones installed by default, and this is the second Google Pixel 5 that is experiencing this issue.\n\nAt this point I'm thinking about returning the phone for a refund. Support had been back and forth on this; but has not resolved the issue. \n\nI'm hoping that someone in the community here can shed some light on this issue if they have experienced it. I've always had Google phones and this is my first phone since the Nexus 5 (it served me well). I really want to keep it; but this freezing issue is driving me nuts. \n\nThanks!",

I've tried manually changing time zones, changing the time on my device manually... nothing. If I take a photo at 6am, the name of the file will read 1000 for HHMM. It's incredibly aggravating.\n\nI've tried turning off location globally, turning it off in the Google Camera app itself, still nothing. It's like the camera app is pulling my time zone data from somewhere else.\n\nI should also add that the timestamp in the metadata shows the correct time for when the photo was taken. It's just the actual filename that is offset.\n\nI've also tried using a different app, like Open Camera, and the filenames are correct. The problem seems to only be with Google Camera.",

In the Samsung I could see the Camera storage as a folder in Win 10, just like any other folder and the photos were thumbnails of the photos, you could ID each photo by looking at it.\n\nThis is not the case with this Pixel, I cannot see individual thumbnails, just a generic artistic thumbnail with each jpg labeled separately, but no idea which is which. I want to leave some photos on my phone and know which ones to keep or delete by seeing them in the Camera folder as I have done for years with Samsung, and this Pixel will not allow me to do that. I often take a photo and then post it to a forum and being able to see the individual photos in the phone, on the PC, it what makes it easiest for me. \n\nit's impossible for me to remember each generic jpg's name, and if the only way of dealing with seeing the photos in the camera folder is going to involve using the cloud or some remote/3rd party way of visualizing the individual thumbnails, I need to know ASAP so I can return this phone while I can. I will hate to take my 15% restocking hit and go back to looking for a phone that works seamlessly for my needs. \n\nAny help will be appreciated & thanks.",

    "content": "A week or so ago, while taking pictures, my 4xl started having intense wild glare, on anything with any amount of light. Didn't matter if it was a dull light or a bright one. The blurry glare would stretch across my screen. If I hit the 2x zoom, it would go away, but as soon as I went back to normal, boom, crazy blurry glare everywhere. \n\nI will attach some pictures I took, just for this message, so you know they're recent. I bought this phone to use mainly for the camera, and have bragged on the capabilities to everyone. I am a author, but over the past couple of years, photography has taken up much of my time. \n\nI have a DSLR, but this phone takes such amazing pictures, and is easy to carry. I haven't quite had this phone a year, maybe if it were a few years old, I could see something not working as well. I searched the internet for answers, with no luck. \n\nLess intrusive, but still terrible, the vertical lines that sometimes appear, when trying to take a picture are terrible. Please, please help me fix this issue. I have tried every fix online I could find, followed all the steps, but no luck at all.\n\nPapaw Shane",

And the issue is just the same. \nIt is a massive let down, to buy the flagship phone from Google and yet encounter such issues. If I cannot use the phone at night without such issues, then I am not sure how I feel about staying with Google or the Android ecosystem.  Not sure what DxOMark are rating the camera on.\n\nHave others using Pixel 5 faced this issue, and if yes, any resolutions? \nIs this a hardware issue?\nAny support/resolutions from Google? ",

How can I turn it off?\nThanks,",

    "content": "I have had several pixel phones and google devices in the past. Most recently, switched from the pixel 3. The pixel 3's camera is fantastic! I purchased two Pixel 5 devices and so far the camera quality is horrible. In both the front and rear facing camera I am experiencing the same quality issues. Blurred photos, noise, no clarity or details, etc. It's comparable to the very first digital camera I ever owned in early 2000. I contacted support a few times, they suggested a few soft items and factory reset. This did nothing to resolve the issues. They then suggested to take it to be \"fixed\" at an authorized store (Ubreakifix). The store did not have parts or believed it would be a hardware issue they could fix. Finally, they offered to replace ONE of the phones? Ok. We will see if the replacement device is better, but I feel it's a fundamental flaw in the current hardware / design. I will come back with an update once the replacement comes, but I am not hopeful. At this point I would not recommend buying a pixel 5 - especially if you use it for your main camera like most people. Worst. Camera. Ever.",

Knowing Google it just seems like another discrete way to get user data without their permission. Additionally the Google app won't let you choose the option of \"Use microphone while app in use\" and only lets you pick either use ALL The Time or Deny. Another fishy example. Does anyone know the reason for this or has anyone found a workaround to not allowing the Google app to use microphone at all times and only when using Google Assistant or the app? I emailed support but they were of no help with this.",

    "content": "Hi, when I go into my camera app I assume it is going to take pictures, so I start snapping away, under pressure for work, but when I go back and look at them it has taken short videos. I can't go back and re-take them. This is really annoying. No other phone in the history of my phones has done this. Why can't it just take pictures without me having to think - oh, hang on, there is something I have to do here because this phone likes taking short videos. Why am I in video mode by accident? Not only is it annoying that I can't plug it into the computer and get them off the phone, once I go through the process of waiting for them in google photos and downloading them, half of them are vids. They seem to be a rather odd video jpeg file. Perhaps I can guide the programmers here: When you open a camera app it should default to taking still photos. Jpegs are fine. The next option is shooting video. We don't want some kind of in-between file, as these are no good to get into photoshop or view as stills. Is it supposed to do this? Do they think it is wanted? Provide the option. Allow us to switch it off. I'm a stills man not a moving jpeg man. I want small files that can be emailed. I want to get them into photoshop. It seems like everything normal I want to do with this phone is made more difficult. Shall I throw it in the bin? No settings are available in the camera app. Using a different camera app makes it even more complicated. Who knows where the photos go. How do I get them onto PC? Has anyone heard of a wire? I am not looking for a learning curve. I want to snap a photo and see it on my PC asap. I also recently bought a small digital camera that plugs into the pc because this thing is doing whatever it wants",

    "content": "I discovered that some of my photos had more \"suggestion\" edit features yesterday. However, I cannot figure out why. I took several photos during a walk in the woods with the same camera settings, yet only a batch of four photos with the same subject matter had more editing options. With this batch of four photos, I have 9 total \"suggestions\" options, (enhance, dynamic, vivid, luminous, radiant, ember, airy, afterglow and stormy.) Literally no other picture seems to have these options. They just have the standard four, (enhance, dynamic, warm, cold). So what is up with that? ",

Cleared cache and storage, reset phone to factory settings, went into developer mode to submit a bug report, chatted and passed around 8 different Google people, unselected all the camera permissions, turned on airplane mode, etc. The camera will still not work. Does anybody have any other fix? Google denies a massive issue and only states that I should take the phone to a repair store. The problem started immediately after a software update, so I do not understand how this is a hardware issue. Any ideas or magic fixes? Or, is this simply Google's way to brick my camera to push me to buying a new phone? The last agent told me they had several great deals going on (sarcasm I hope)...",

If i turn on auto rotate , it does work properly however that is not a solution because i keep auto rotate off, and it used to work with auto rotate off.\nThis issue happens in whatsapp mainly, the main camera just presents the pic vertically while it was taken horizontally.\nIve deleted the camera cache, reinstalling whatsapp , updating , deleting recent updates and apps.\n\nThe issue persists even in safe mode.\nI wont factory reset my phone, this is unacceptable.",

    "content": "Hello\n\nNormally when I take a photo in portrait mode the camera saves 2 versions of the photo - 1 in portrait mode and another in normal mode. Both versions appear in the photos app with a thumbnail for both images allowing you to switch between the two when you open the image. \n\nLately the camera just saves the photo taken in portrait mode and the normal version just doesn't appear at all. \n\nIs this a recent update (which I don't like) or has something inadvertently happened and there's a way to get the old settings back for this?\n\nMany thanks for your help.",

    "title": "Why are selfies still being retouched with retouching disabled on front camera?",
    "content": "Selfies taken using the front camera on my Pixel 5 are being noticeably retouched during image processing, despite face retouching being disabled on my device. It's unclear if this is a bug or intended camera behavior.\n\nI've done some testing on my own and observed that selfies taken with the front facing camera undergo the following changes even with retouching disabled:\ngeneral loss of sharpness (smoothing of skin)\nremoval or reduction of visible blemishes\nconsiderable lightening of skin tone\n\nThe result, after processing, is a photo that often looks unnatural, waxy, and overcorrected.\n\nIn my own testing, enabling retouching caused the same changes listed above, but moreso. I've also determined that this is not due to the portrait lighting feature, since turning this feature off in google photos produces the original retouched photo.\n\nIn addition to feeling like unintended behavior, since the change is highly noticeable and fairly drastic,  it also flies in the face of Google's recent, highly-publicized decision to disable retouching by default on its devices. Unwanted facial retouching can be highly damaging to users' self-image, and it's also causing a general lack of image fidelity\u2014my face looks less detailed, as if the image quality has been downgraded by the device.\n\nI'm including some samples of my testing here:\n\nThe first photo is a side-by-side comparison of the before and after images. The top photo is the original image, pre-processing (Screenshot taken from the gallery). The bottom image is the retouched selfie.\n\nThis is the processed and visibly retouched image, by itself:\n\n\nNote the general lack of fidelity when comparing the final image to the original.\n\nFinally, I have attached a recording of my camera app, documenting the process of taking a photo, viewing it in the gallery app, and the image dramatically changing when processing is complete. Note that my face is a completely different tone.\n\nI've discussed this with other pixel users, who have described similar results with their own photos: a loss of image quality, unnatural looking photos, feeling like a mask is being applied to their photos taken with the front-facing camera. This is a worrying trend for me, and for these other users, because it suggests google has incorporated facial retouching directly into its HDR+ image processing where it cannot be disabled by the end user.\n\nIs this behavior intentional? It seems antithetical to google's own public positions on facial retouching. I'd appreciate feedback from other users about this.",

    "content": "I feel like I'm going a bit insane but I could've sworn I could hold my phone sideways and take a panoramic photo using the Camera app.  I have a Pixel 4 and recently had the OS upgrade to ver. 11.  Now when I go into the camera app - other - Panoramic...my only option is to hold the phone vertically which I've pretty much never done before.  If I do rotate the phone horizontally it doesn't auto-rotate (yes, it is enabled on my phone and works fine when taking a regular photo) and appears like it is designed to take a vertical panoramic photo.",

    "title": "My Pixel 5 Zoom is worse than my Pixel 2",
    "content": "Hi,\nJust sharing something I found interesting. I just compared 2 photos side by side from my old Pixel 2 against my pixel 5. Both photos were pointed at the same subject and at the same zoom level (3.2x). The results were not what I expected. Both phones were running the stock camera app with the same version #.\nThe pixel 2 was taking clearer and shaper photos than the pixel 5. I know google updated its Super Res Zoom algorithms with Google camera 8, but man, its actually worse than not having it. Pixel 2 doesnt support super res zoom so I dont understand how its taking better photos.\nThe problem is that the pixel 5 is creating really pixelated \"checkerboard\" patterns around text and objects and the pixel 2 does not seem to do this, resulting in a clearer image.\nIm getting more and more disappointed by this phone and regretting my purchase. The only reason I buy pixel devices is for the camera and stock android. But more so for the former.\nAnyone else notice this? I will post a link to some images to highlight the differences.\nLink to comparison https://imgur.com/gallery/ydKlB3u",

I wouldn't even complain about it if it wasn't the camera-phone Pixel. The phone got the latest updates on board, clear front lens, good environment and light.\nI have contacted the Google support, they are proposing free repair but the thing is - I live in Russia, so I'll have to send it to the US, what will take forever with our post-office and upcoming holidays (I'll do it in January then anyway).\nTo make sure, could anyone please send any examples of selfie from exact this model (Or if there any fix for it?)? I'm just afraid that the repair service would say everything's fine.\nAccidentally I found what caused the problem, but it isn't exact. When I cover 75% of the camera with something, the picture becomes clearer.\nHere's some examples:\n A selfie without portrait mode\n\n A selfie in portrait mode\n\nA selfie with covering the lens",

    "content": "While cleaning my Pixel 5 which is only around two weeks old I had the impression to see a small scratch on the main camera lens. Checked that with a magnifying glass and a flashlight and it turned out to be a light scratch underneath the glass \u0ca0_\u0ca0 I could see that it's underneath because light reflection was really \"weak\" and dust particles on top of the glass changed position to the scratch perspectively so it could only be underneath the glass.\n\nTook some test shots with bright light sources to see if any obvious flares or similar occurs but couldn't notice any impacts on the images. Scratch is only visible with a bright flashlight but somehow I'm disappointed.\n\nWould you consider to go for an RMA hassle because of this?",

I only ever take horizontal panoramas, and now Google makes me take these using vertical mode, which is so stupid!\n\nBut the main reason for this post: before the recent \"upgrade\", the camera used to have a soft sliding key up and down with 7x the zoom. Now: depending on night mode or regular camera mode, you're only given two options-- 1x or 2x. How is this an upgrade?!  Not only that, there used to be another slide meter on the top side of the camera viewfinder which allowed you to maneuver light/exposure.  Now, that feature is hidden or not available.",

I followed all of the cache and storage clearing steps, turned of the phone, tried in safe mode to rule out any new apps (which I haven't added anyway), and got nowhere.  Also followed final recommendation to factory reset.  Same problem,  camera stopped working.  I put the phone in developer mode and connected to my Windows PC Android Studio to watch Logcat.  Although the app does not display an error, Logcat shows:  \"mbd: Camera 0 encountered a fatal error while opening: Camera encountered a fatal error (4)\".  I believe my camera hardware arbitrarily decided to stop working spontaneously.  What do I do now?  Nothing I'm guessing?",

The ones not showing up in the photos section are the ones that I cannot post (both Instagram and Facebook).

    "content": "I have a Pixel 2 XL and am having a hard time getting the camera to focus properly and take good pictures of my foster kitten, which I need for his personal ad. Usually the camera on this phone takes excellent kitten pictures in varying levels of light and activity. This kitten has dark brown to black fur. Typically dark cats are typically harder to photograph, though I have one that is mostly black that I regularly get great pictures of. I've watched a variety of videos on how to improve the pictures (direct sunlight, simple background, no flash, adjust exposure, focus on eyes). Still, it's not helping. \n\nI've tried portrait and the regular camera mode, as well as adjusting the exposure and shooting with direct sunlight on the cat and behind me. I'm tapping the screen to focus. Is it simply too dark or that I need additional direct light on him? Other than a couple of pictures, most came out blurry or low detail, which you can see in the gallery of pictures I took today. Any thoughts on how to get my little guy some great pictures so he can find a good family to adopt him? With kittens, time is of the essence, because they're most adoptable when they're really tiny and cute. \n\nAlso - a Black Cat Photo Mode (or black dog) would be a brilliant feature for Pixel phone cameras to have.",

The photos look completely different and morphed after you click the shutter button (not in a good way at all, nothing like my pixel 3xl). The photos for the most part come out looking soft and very noisy. \n\nI know people may say it's down to the app developer, but I don't understand how it can be so much worse than my Pixel 3XL.

    "content": "After this summer with the Neowise comet and plenty of clear nights, I've become well acquainted with astrophotography mode. I've got a tripod and have dozens of fantastic images. But, when I updated to Android 11, astrophotography has failed to be as reliable as it once was. After setting night shot (with tripod), it will occasionally show astrophotography mode activated, but only for a few seconds, almost as if it thinks my phone is moving. If I switch from 4:3 to 16:9 images or vice versa, it will almost always activate night mode, again only for a moment or two. After clearing cache/master reset failed to improve the situation, I was concerned my hardware sensors was the fault, but numerous apps confirmed normal operation. To verify it was software related, I flashed back to Android 10, and it's working flawlessly. Anyone else confirm this issue? Found a fix for 11?",

The March update seemed to help the issue (didn't fully resolve, but became much more manageable) but the update to Android 11 has DESTROYED the camera AND photos app on my phone! It manages to take two photos on portrait mode before freezing and either shutting the whole app down or saying it's processing HDR+ for sometimes upwards of a minute. Flipping through pictures I did manage to take can take minutes instead of seconds. I'm at my wits end and honestly I doubt I'll be keeping the phone much longer at this rate.",

    "content": "Ok, guys here is the situation.  I had a Pixel 4XL 64gb and gave it to my dad.  I ended up buy another Pixel 4 XL 128gb.  The new Pixel I got for myself has horrible focusing issue on the selfies.  The selfies come out blurry.  This was never an issue with the previous Pixel 4 XL.  I thought this was probably an issue with previous Pixel as well!  So I went to my dad's house and took selfies with each!  His is perfect sharpness and focus!  The new one I got for myself is out of focus!  No matter what I do to focus on my face!  I got the phone recently and I took a trip and when I got back I was looking at photos and noticed they were all blurry.  The front camera is perfectly fine! It's just the selfie camera!  So then I tried to compare the selfie camera under good lighting at the actual hardware and I think during assembly there was a fuck up somewhere. Because one is pushed further out, deeper and my dad's Pixel 4 XL is much closer to the glass. I think the assembly wasn't perfect and therefore causing this issue.  Have any of you experienced this? And what has Google done to fix it?",

    "content": "I have the Pixel 3XL mobile phone, and everything was fine with it until a few months earlier. All of a sudden, my rear camera started to take blurry photos (for the distance above of 5-8cm).\nI have contacted to Made By Google team, and was requested to clear the cache, update the camera app, install a new app and even a factory reset. I have followed all the steps, and the issue remained. \nI have requested from team to direct me to a repair shop, but they told me that I can't get a coverage as I am currently a resident in UAE. This is a super annoying situation, as I have paid more than 800 EUR for a phone and can't take photos, and even can't get it fixed. Below was the latest message I got from the support team, and then they have stopped responding my messages. I just don't know what to do with a super expensive and malfunctioning device in hand. Super annoyed and sad. And a very bad customer experience for Google.\n\n\nThanks for the info. It looks like you're currently in a location where we have limited support options. Please note that we offer warranty support only in countries where we sell devices. You can get in touch with our team directly when you're back in a country where we sell Pixel phones or ask a friend (in a country where we sell devices) to do so on your behalf by clicking on \u201cContact Us\u201d on the top right corner of this link: https://goo.gle/2Eqys1z Appreciate your understanding.",

    "title": "Camera Roll not showing pictures, and Photos not backing up the same pictures",
    "content": "Hey Everyone,\nCould use some help with this.  I have done a lot of troubleshooting and will try to describe everything.\n\nThe camera roll is not showing any pictures.  I take a picture, see it hit the camera roll to the right, then click the roll and the picture will load.  I see a progress circle in the bottom left then the camera app closes and photos opens, the new picture is not there.  I reopen the camera and the camera roll is grey with no pictures.  If I touch to open nothing happens.  I have Astro file manager installed and can see the picture saved to the DCIM/Camera folder fine, in JPG format.  \n\nVideos work fine with MP4 format, videos actually show fine in the camera roll\n\nI have tried the RAW thing, this gets the pictures to show up in photos but not the camera roll, but creates 3 pictures for every one taken and is not practical for space.  \n\nI have cleared the cache in both Photos and Camera, I have booted in Safe mode, same issue.\n\nI have factory reset my phone.  After this and before restoring from a backup I tested one picture.  I was able to see the picture in the camera roll and clicked it to open and it showed fine.  I did not test photos as it needed to be set up yet.  \n\nI restored from a backup before the reset, the issue returned\n\nThe camera folder is not showing up as selected in the backup folders but I don't think this matters because the camera folder is the default and is backed up by default.  \n\nPermissions are showing fully allowed for each app.  However, if I go to Permission Manager/Additional Permissions I see access Google Photos and 0 of 0 apps allowed.  I am unable to select any apps to allow this.  \n Any help is appreciated.\nThanks,\nRyan",

    "title": "Pixel 3/XL Camera Color Balance Defect still not corrected nearly a year later",
    "content": "There are continuing complaints about the removal of color balance correction on Pixel phones. As of this date, nearly a year later, Google has demonstrated that they do not have the technical expertise to correct the \"automatic\" software  color balance issues (they appear to have gotten worse with the most recent OS updates) and \"for whatever reasons\" will not add back color balance adjustments, a foundation, expected requirement for taking quality images in any camera and a reason why so many advanced amateur and professional photographers selected Pixel. Reluctance to interact with the user base is disconcerting.\n\nGoogle cannot claim it's camera's produce high quality JPG images if it's software is unable to manage color balance correctly. Resorting to the use of RAW images is no excuse.\n\nAs Pixel owners, if camera image quality was a deciding purchasing factor, and Google will not fix the problem, we have to make a decision to continue with defective cameras (this is a defect), or move to another manufacturers device. While we're getting fairly sharp, technically corrected images, the color balance issue makes them look like cheap smartphone camera's from years past, and today almost any other manufacturers camera's provide a more pleasing image. Don't you feel embarrassed when in the past people complimented you on the image quality and now ask you what happened to these images, why so poor? You can only say, well it's Google.\n\nWe no longer have a product that justifies its asking price. It's time to move on for those who need the best quality images in their life applications.",

My phone by the way is a Pixel 2 XL 128gb.\n\nPlease let me know if there is anything else you need from me.\n\nThank you for your time!",

I've tried turning on and off every possible setting.  You can see in the initial image it looks normal, then the processing loads, and I look like a caveman. Its odd because I just upgraded from the OG pixel to the 4a. I never had this issue before on my Pixel and now I'm regretting my purchase of the 4a if this can't be fixed. \n\nI bought this phone for the nice camera, so what gives?",

I can't use Google Photo Sphere or Google Street View on my Google phone to make panoramic pictures.\n\nIronically, I got the Pixel to do just this as a Samsung crapped out right before this and I chose not to replace it with another one.\n\nSounds like a Google Android update was the culprit in regards to the sensor a year ago.\n\nAnyone know what is going on. There is a new August security update. Will this fix it?\n\nI really would like to make a panorama shot at this time.  \n\nMaybe I need to upgrade to a 4a, but I just bought this one and my experience isn't such that I'd want to buy another.  Maybe a direct replacement if it would fix this and other issues like brightness settings changing on their own and other behaviors.  It seems as if the phone is possessed.",

I also did a factory reset on my phone, which has now caused a whole slew of other problems, and thought that might magically fix the issue. It did not. What is going on? As you can see, none of the fixes recommended by these boards has helped. Now I'm stuck not being able to use my rear camera.",

If I knew about this issue, and also that Google support is giving solutions such as resetting your phone, uninstalling updates from the camera app, and so on...I would have never brought this crap.\nI tried to remove the updates, it works fine. However, why would I not want to use an updated camera app?\n\nPixel being a \"Google\" Flagship fone, which boasts about its camera, has not yet resolved this problem is utterly not digestible. This is the incapability of Google.\n\nI am writing this post just so that everyone knows the attitude Google has towards a common issue.",

I have factory data reset and even downloaded the beta version (Android 11) and now I am back on Android 10. When I was using Android 11 the camera was working on and off depending on the day and YouTube and Amazon apps worked perfectly... Now switching back to Android 10 neither the YouTube, Amazon, Google Camera, or the flashlight are working... Please try an answer these questions with sincerity and not like a bot. Thank You",

But when watching the video afterwards there's no sound at all. I have tried to unplug the external mic before watching, I have tried to restart app and watch, I have tried to send video to my pc and watch - no sound at all. \n\nIs it some kind of gear that I need that I don't have (adapter of some kind, specific microphone), even though I get the option to choose the external mic? Or do I need to use a third party app to get it to work? Or is it some kind of setting I have missed besides simply choosing to use the external mic? Or does it simply not work (STILL)??\n\nThanks for any answers.",

    "content": "Why can't a massive company like Google seem to figure out how to enable switching front and rear cameras while recording a video? This is such a basic function that it's extremely EMBARRASSING that the all-mighty powerful Google flagship phone can't seem to handle something that has been possible on basically all other devices seemingly for over a decade now? My next phone might be one where the company actually listens to the customer feedback to create or improve basic functions, instead of working on new features and gizmos that no one cares about and basic functions don't exist....",

This is the first client that I've done photos for, with this phone and new laptop...\n\nWhen I started looking through the edited photos on my pixel 3a XL (which I had taken the pics on originally), I noticed much to my horror, that almost every image looks over saturated. They did not look that way on my laptop screen... \n\nI'm very concerned to find out which screen is showing the most accurate representation of the colors my client will get when they print these photos. I need to know which screen is likely to be showing the most true representation for future editing as well... \ud83d\ude2c",

    "title": "Camera quality on new Pixel 3a XL worse than my Pixel 2 XL",
    "content": "I just purchased the Pixel 3a XL 3 weeks ago to replace my 2 XL and the photo quality is worse compared to it, is this normal? Everything I read online touted the superiority of the 3 camera and that they were the same ones being used in the 3a, but I was never disappointed in my 2's camera and love using it. These pics on the 3a are consistently slightly blurry and lacking in detail... I've tried all the troubleshooting options for fixing camera focus but it's not as if *where* the camera focuses is the issue--it's that the spot it is focused on is never as sharp as it was on the 2. Cleared cache, tried safe mode, etc. Quality still sucks.\n\nUnfortunately I was 2 days too late to just return it otherwise I would've had the crack in my 2's screen repaired and kept using that. Now I'm not sure if this is something I should send the phone in to have fixed under the warranty, or if I failed to understand some aspect of the 3a's camera that would explain the poor quality and I've just wasted several hundred bucks?\n\nI've taken several dozen side-by-side comparison shots and attached one to explain what I'm talking about. Obviously the 3a's is an 'acceptable' photograph and would've been great a decade ago, but it clearly looks like a downgrade in quality to me.\n\nInfo says both were taken at \u0192/1.8 and the 2 was 1/120 while the 3a was 1/125",

    "content": "As of July 4 on my Pixel 3 my camera app crashes every time I attempt to open it. Also, as with many other comments I've seen online, my flashlight app is greyed out and cannot be turned on. Clearly the two are tied together.\n\nOf note, I am able to open Snapchat and use my selfie cam within the app. When in Snapchat there is no longer an option to switch to the back facing camera. \n\nI have tried clearing the data and the cache for the Google Camera app, uninstalling and reinstalling the Google Camera app, removing all permissions from third party apps to the camera, restarting my device multiple times, restarting my device in safe mode, clearing the data and cache of my Google Photo app, and I installed the July 5 software update as of just this morning, all with no resolution.\n\nI contacted Google's support via message option and was told that the only option left is a factory restart (which of course is only part of the trouble shooting options and as with any issue with a phone I've ever had will very likely do nothing to help, but I'm not able to try this this morning as I am not in a position to back anything up so I did not do so as of yet) and that since I'm out of warranty I am unable to send my phone in even if the factory restart does not resolve the issue. \n\nI informed them I've sent status updates multiple times since this started and inquired as to whether this is a known issue being addressed. Of course I was told it is not and that there is no work being done on what is clearly a software issue. I was told that they would pass on my issue and that \"there are many user reported issues coming through that need to be addressed\" but that they would pass this on at my request. \n\nI mentioned the fact that there was quite a bit of reporting done on the Pixel 2 camera issues and that if I have this issue then clearly others do as well and this has been reported to them, but as always they are going to play ignorant.\n\nOnce again Google is not owning up to software issues and is shoving them under the rug.\n\nTo add insult to injury the person \"helping\" me thanked me for my understanding, as if I had any choice in the matter.\n\nThank you, Google, for charging exorbitant prices for flagship phones that you do not support.",

    "content": "Hi folks, \n\nI have a pixel 3 phone that is just over 1  year old. Recently the camera stopped working during use and refused to work at all afterwards. After a restart it was working again, but only allowed me to take 3 or 4 photos (with the rear camera) before it stopped again. If I took a video it would crash at around 15sec. After this only a reboot could potentially get the camera starting again. Since this started happening the camera never works for longer than this and rebooting only gets it working again, allbeit for limited periods, maybe 50% of the time. \nI have reviewed lots of threads and tried uninstalling camera app updates, clearing cache, rebooting in safe mode, and even factory reset twice. Nothing fixes the camera issue. On the last factory reset the camera worked for 4 or 5 pics and now the issue is back. \n\nWhat on earth do I do Google? I have tried contacting you through the pixel phone help and when I get to the point of raising an email to you, I get an error on my PC advising that I cannot email you and there is no phone number (I live in Australia). \n\nPlease, can someone help!!\n\nTB",

The behavior is most obvious whenever I shift focal distance in a significant way, but can be seen happening every few seconds otherwise. It seems like something is wrong with the autofocus or one of the supporting sensors.\n\nAn example of this odd behavior can be seen here at 0:05.\n\nAny idea what might have caused this? Did I inadvertently rough up some of the internals recently via a small drop or something and now something's out of balance inside the phone?\n\nAndrew",

    "content": "Right now, photos seem to save in different folders on my phone. For example, photos from text messages save to a Messages folder and photos from Snapchat save to a Snapchat folder. Ideally, all photos would save to a single folder called Camera - and this is because my photos from that one folder automatically upload to Dropbox (the other folders do not, and I have to physically move them over for the download to start). Is there a way to force photos to save to one single location?\n\nThanks for your time!",

It has been messed up since then.\nGoogle are also not fixing this issue as it isn't they're \"Problem\" it's Snapchat's.\n\nSteps I've taken to fix the problem\n- Uninstall and re install the app over 20+ times (No Result)\n- Reported this to Snapchat (Won't ever get a reply)\n- Reported it as a bug to Snapchat (Won't still ever get a reply)\n- Reported to Google which they can't do anything as it isn't they're problem and they're \"NOT\" aware of it even though the community is flooded with this issue.\n\nWhoever also says Uninstall and reinstall ur wasting ur time.\nThe more community posts the more Google will notice what they're customers are facing as they're currently blind and can't read what people are having the most issue off.\nWhat really is the point of this community if Google really aren't aware of issues that people are reporting constantly yet they don't listen.",

    "content": "I have a Pixel 3a that is just 62 days old now. I gave it to my wife as a gift before our baby was born so she could take and store better photos of our baby.\n\nThis morning we discovered that the phone made all of our photos more than two days old completely disappear. They are not deleted, they are not in the trash, they are just simply gone.\n\nI have gone through Google Support who tried to help but we weren't able to recover the photos nor we were able to confirm it won't happen again.\n\nHere is all of the information that we can give up front:\n- I have only the native apps on the phone (Google Camera and Google Photos).\n- I did not do a backup to Google photos. I will do it in the future but realistically it shouldn't be necessary on a 62 day old phone. I'd like to keep my photos stored on the device so I can view them regardless of data or Wi-Fi connection.\n- I have restarted the phone a couple of times.\n- I have deleted the cache for the Photos and Camera apps, as well as I uninstalled the updates and reinstalled them.\n- I have searched for the photos through the \"Files\" app and through \"Storage\". I found some of the old thumbnails but they were deleting themselves quickly as well.\n- The photos were not in the trash. A bunch of photos that were supposed to be there (that I put there just yesterday) were there. When I went back in to make sure the photos I wanted weren't in there, trash had deleted all of the photos on its own, even ones only a few hours old.\n- I have checked the app permissions and they are all good.\n- So far Google's only advice is to wait to see how frequently our 62 day old phone fails. I am of the opinion that just once in 62 days is too often but apparently Google thinks that's acceptable.\n- Both Photos and Camera had updates just 16 hours ago.\n\nHas anyone else had this issue? Did you resolve it? If so, how? Can we expect it to continue to fail?\n\nWe have very little confidence in this product now.\n\nAny help at all would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThank you,\n\nBernie (and Christine)",

    "content": "Hi. I recently got Google Pixel 3a because of it's amazing camera quality. I use it for my gaming youtube channel to record facecam and i mostly record 30-40 minutes of footage to max 1 hour and then edit them. I have never had problem like this on samsung and iphone devices... I record the video and when i reach about 15-20 minutes recording stops automatically after showing me the message that says something about overheating. I know many phones get hot while recording and it's normal but can't i do anything so recording won't stop?",

    "content": "SeeI was camping all weekend. June 13 to june 15. I took many many photos every day.  Nearly all of the photos from june 14 are missing. There was no or limited Network access during the trip.\n\nI noticed on June 14 (evening) when i went to share a photo through WhatsApp that i had only photos from June 13 available. We had climbed a hill and had 3G signal available. WhatsApp gave me a \"time and date error\" and asked me to change my time and date settings. (And my clock was indeed completely wrong. The network signal changed the time to 2 hours later).\n\nI took some new photos to see if maybe there was just a delay between the camera app and google photos but the newest photo was instantaneously there. I knew something was wrong. \n\nWhat happened to my photos?  \nThey are very important. We only took one camera and this is the only camping trip i have had with my daughter before her surgery!\n\nIf they have the wrong time and date where do the photos go? \n\nWhy was my time and date wrong?\n\nIs this common with Pixels? \n\nPlease help..i just really want the pictures back...\n\nUpdate: \nThere is an animation with some of the pictures in my google photos \"for you\" tab. So the pictures do exist.. but I still cannot find them (and yes I tried looking in the device folders).",

Can someone please assist me with this?",

They both said I was to get a new phone overnighted to me, but then Josh couldn't finalize the process, that Google had to sign off on it.  So, I spent the last 2 hours with Edd at Google because Google wasn't doing phone support because of Covid-19. , chatting for around 2 hours.  We backed up the phone and then did a factory reset.  STILL NO CAMERA OR FLASHLIGHT!  Instead of approving the new phone, he said I had to go get a new motherboard, and the closest location is 62 miles away, with the soonest appointment on May 22.  The guy there said they are seeing a lot of this since the last update, and that there is fear that if people get the new motherboard, the same thing might happen when Google issues a fix for what I am going through.  SO...... I am leery of getting the new motherboard and going through this again, if that is even the root cause.  So far, I truly think I have been given a run-around by Google and will NEVER buy another Google phone or product, if this is their support.",

The natural idea was to do it overnight when I am not using my phone for routine operations. I have all the set up with lightning and tripod + developer option for always on while charging set to on. \nFor this kind of recording I have to choose 120x speed and short recordings coming alright. \nThe problem is when I am trying to record overnight. I had multiple failures there,\nThe latest attempt when I examined the result brought a mp4 file with size of around 300 MB, which I guess has been recorder over approximately 4 hours looking at the details  info of the file.\nUnfortunately the file can't be played neither on the phone nor on external apps on PC. \nI have tried VLC Player - came nothing. \nI have try to import the file in Adobe Premier for deeper inspection. \nThe result was ( see attached screenshots):\n- The  Import reported Generic Error;\n- File importer detected inconsistency of the structure [ Name of The file ] . Reading and writing this file matadata (XMP) has been disabled. \n\nI have not found similar  issues reported in the community and trying to get some advice if someone has come to such and any suggestions to overcome this, so I use the feature as Intended.\n\nAppreciate all contributions in advance.\n\nThanks!\n\nSvetlozar",

This has been going on for a few months now, and is at the point where it happens EVERY time I start up the camera. This means I can't use any video calling featuring (i.e. Duo), and takes an extended amount of time to use the front facing camera. I've cleared the apps cache and this has not helped at all. I've started in safe mode, and have also experienced the same issue. This looks like an on-going problem as several people are posting about this issue. \n\nThis is my 3rd Google phone (Nexus 6P, Pixel 2XL, and now Pixel 3) but only the first time I've ever experienced an issue this extreme. Disappointed to see that Google isn't doing a better job of addressing this issue since it seems rather wide-spread at this point.",

    "content": "Hello,\nI am looking for a way to contact Google other than through https://store.google.com/gb/repair\n\nMy Google Pixel 3 camera has problems fixing focus on anything - autofocus is erratic, which is especially visible when shooting videos. The focus oscillates back and forth, but the objects are never sharp. The same happens when taking photos - my photos are out of focus, no matter what I do (even when touching the viewfinder to tell the phone which objects to focus on). I tried clearing the camera app's cache, but it did not help. I have a strong impression that it's a factory fault.\n\nThis is disappointing considering I bought this device specifically hoping for superior camera experience. I've found there are many other users with the same problem.\n\nWhat makes things worse, Google support is simply non-existent. The site clearly says my device is covered by manufacturer's guarantee (see attached screenshots), but there is no way to send it back to Google - neither call nor chat are available at any time of the day for me.\n\nIronically, the Made By Google Twitter uses the slogan Help Done the Google Way.

Also, the total time of the video is insane (e.g. 52 hours 46 minutes)\nHere're a couple of screenshots https://imgur.com/a/c5yJfCd\n\nI followed all the troubleshooting steps to try to fix the problem (reboot phone, safe mode, delete cache and storage,..) and the only thing that worked was Uninstalling Updates. If I update the app again, the issue comes back.\n\nI don't know how to report the bug",

    "title": "Front-facing camera: blurry and terrible static noise",
    "content": "Very often, when my front-facing camera on my Pixel 3 is activated, the camera both: goes terribly blurry (like static on a TV) and there is a horrible static noise that is very audible and very annoying. Essentially the front-facing camera is completely unusable while this is occurring.\n\nEventually, if I hit the flip camera icon enough times, it stops. But it will trigger again randomly.\n\nThis has been written about in numerous other places with no clear solution. It is something that seems to be a software issue, not a hardware issue.\n\nIt happened randomly ~4 months ago. I wasn't using the front-facing camera much then (pre-coronavirus), so I didn't make a big deal of it.\n\nI've tried other solutions written about on other threads and Reddit, including clearing my camera's cache (in storage), deleting my phone's voice match for Google Assistant (which I now have off), removed Google Home entirely, etc.\n\nAny other troubleshooting tips for this? Help would be infinitely appreciated; this issue is horribly annoying and is a daily problem now.\n\nI won't be clearing my entire storage (too annoying). But one thing that's interesting is that I did boot my phone in safe mode and this still happened.\n\nSo I'm wondering if it's some sort of Android / Pixel software setting I can roll back - rather than an app causing a problem.\n\nI am not interested in sending my phone in for a refurbished model.\n\nAnd naturally, during this pandemic, Google's 1:1 support is unavailable and their response time is...well, not helpful.\n\nThank you!",

    "content": "I am having a problem with the camera on my Pixel 3. It was working fine yesterday, and all of a sudden, this morning it would no longer focus when taking a picture. At first I thought that this was just a random fluke, so I rebooted the phone, which didn't fix it. I went on to clear the storage and cache folder of the Google camera app, restart the phone in safe mode, force stop any apps that may have been using the camera, none of which worked. \n\nI thought at first that this could be related to the April security update I received late last night, and began talking to my friend who has a Pixel 3 XL. He mentioned that this morning, his camera also would no longer focus. However, he has had the April update for quite a while longer than I have. We tried ruling out apps that were updated or installed since last night, which included Android accessibility features, Android System WebView, and the device customizations app -- we tried uninstalling updates to these but that did not fix the issue.\n\nI was about to throw in the towel on this being a hardware issue until my buddy mentioned his phone having the same exact issue, at the same exact time. I am wondering if anyone else has experienced this issue. Unfortunately, Google Support is not exactly helpful in this scenario -- the best piece of advice they could give was to just send the phone into the repair depot or buy a Pixel 4 and trade this in.",

When focusing on a particularly beautiful array of pink clouds, the camera could not pick up what I was clearly seeing. The clouds and sky had an orange tint, were less defined, and the greenery below was dark and also less defined.\n\nI notice that sometimes the camera looks to fall short of accuracy in full daylight when I shoot, but then the algorithm seems to correct and the output is great.\n\nThis was not the case here, as shown in the first pic below.\n\nHOWEVER, I stumbled upon a short-term fix, which indicated to me that there is an issue that might be resolved. \n\nThat fix was to point the camera at the ground, then raise it quickly and snap a shot before it could focus and washout the picture. It was the photographer's equivalent of taking shots like a quick-drawing, Wild West cowboy in a shootout outside the saloon. Not the best scenario for making a composition, or much else.\n\nThree result was the second photo below, a pretty decent shot considering the quick, sweeping action I had to make to take it, and much truer to what my eyes saw.\n\nCan anyone steer me towards a fix so I don't have to act like a outlaw at the ok corral when I want to take pics at sunset?",

Just my camera roll, and considering I don't use the camera itself all that often that means these apps can only see like 10 photos, anyone have any suggestions on how to fix this?",

    "content": "Was looking forward to using this phone when it arrived it's all round neat apart from the selfie camera.\n\nThe shots look blurry and have dark contrast they look awful with lots of noise, I have tried everything but it remains poor quality even in outdoor shots. I have read many people complain about the front facing camera having same issues as me. I simply can't believe the quality my old LG G3 only had a 3 mega pix selfie camera that at least have clear shots so why is this performing like it is?\n\nIt's the worst front facing camera I've ever used.\n\nThe phone is brand new so I shouldn't be looking for fixes, I've reset phone got gcam updates etc but problem persists so I've no choice now but to return it ASAP and choose replacement.\n\nI'm extremely dissatisfied with the pixel 3a front facing camera how can they ship it with a camera like this? I don't think il be choosing another pixel phone now unless someone can show if I'm doing anything wrong or it was a faulty unit.",

    "content": "Searched the posts, but all the hits seem to be for different issues. I'm a bookseller using my phone for product photography. In my photos I'm getting three or four greenish-brown vertical bars of discoloration. Sometimes they move horizontally while I'm waiting to take the shot. I experienced this once on an older Galaxy phone (7?) while using a 3rd party camera app but it went away when I switched back to the regular camera, so wondered if there's a setting I'm missing in the Google camera or a different camera app that would process it differently?\n\nI'm using CFL desktop lamps in a flourescent-lit warehouse space, same as I was with my previous Galaxy S9 that didn't have an issue with it. All my other photos elsewhere look great. I can get the bars to disappear by nudging up the brightness bar on the right, but it's a tightrope to over-exposure. \n\nBelow is a quick shot of what I'm usually getting. I know I need a better lighting setup (soon), but the end pics actually look great after adjusting white balance and knocking out the background in post. The discolored bars remain, though, so any thoughts on getting rid of them would be amazing. ",

Answer says symptoms point towards a hardware problem, but given the additional information from multiple users it does not seem to be a hardware problem.\n\nAfter an update this summer Camera won't start on Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL for some users. Sometimes it may start (just after reboot or if you hold phone upside down a few times while starting camera), then it will not focus. This only applies to main camera, and applies to any application attempting to use camera.\n\nThis is clearly not a hardware problem and it affects multiple users. And it came the same day as phone was updated. I assumed a fix would follow soon, but it did not.\n\nReboots, clear cache, uninstall and reinstall camera, resetting phone, etc has not helped.\n\nPlease acknowledge error and give feedback on plans forward.",

    "title": "Pixel 2 XL Camera Fails to open or Load",
    "content": "OK so I've seen lots of posts about the Pixel 2 Camera failing after a recent update. \n\nI was one of the people affected by this issue. my camera on my Pixel 2 XL didn't suddenly stop working, it started to fail to load a few times and then it started to fail to load a lot of the time. Finally, after a few weeks, it got to the point where the camera failed to load at all.\n\n I contacted support and did all the normal tricks like try a different app, clear cache, uninstall updates, wipe phone none of these things worked. \n\nThe only workaround I found was to wave a small neodymium magnet near the camera while opening the app. This would allow the camera to open.  Once the app was open you need to move the magnet away from the phone or the focus would go all wobbly. \n\nAfter a few more weeks of this, I found it really annoying to have to remember to carry a magnet around in my pocket. I logged a new call with google and they instructed me to RMA the device. about a week and a bit later I received a refurbished phone from google (which was actually pretty nice since the phone was out of warranty by about a month.) \n\nNow this phone was way behind in patches. So as a test I would update and then test the camera and update again and test the camera (all previous apps were loaded) \n\nQP1A.191005.007a1 OK Tested 6 times\nQP1A.191105.004 OK Tested 6 times\nQQ1A.191205.008 OK Tested 6 times\nQQ2A.200305.002 OK Tested 6 times\n\nI actually don't think this is a software update issue. I believe the actuator arm of the camera wears out after about 2 years of heavy use.  I use my camera daily since it's the one I have on me. \n\nI did previously post the logcats where it said the actuator arm failed but the post has since been deleted by someone else. \n\nSo for anyone else out there with a similar pixel 2 camera issue. have you logged it with google?",

    "content": "Hi\nI have a Pixel 2 XL and I have been experiencing problems with my camera app.\nIt keeps crashing and it doesn't seem to a hardware problem. Because it works for a short time after a re-installation. Today, for example, I received the March update and the camera worked for a short time after the reboot but now it is crashing again.\n\nSteps taken to solve this problem:  \nBefore the march update of today I tried a factory reset twice!  Once through the recover menu and the second time through the GUI.\nI tried also cleaning the cash of the camera app\nRebooting the device many times\nClosing and restarting the camera app.\n\nNow I think the problems started after installing the update before the march update. I am not sure if this is cause but it might.\nAnyway.... I need help! I miss using my camera... \n\nThanks in advance for the advice.\nKind regards \nJose Hoyos",

    "content": "Over the past couple of months, I have noticed that the camera on my Pixel 3 has been having a lot of issues. 1- The front-facing camera distorts photos after it goes through the \"processing stage\" making everyone's faces look squished, making the photos pretty much unusable. 2- Pictures are coming out fuzzy, and even when I log onto Google Photos on my PC, they are fuzzy and look like they were taken on a phone 10 years ago. 3- Videos are also insanely blurry both on the phone and when I try to view them on my PC. \n\nThe main selling point of this phone when I bought it last year was how exceptional the camera was on it, however that quality has seemed to change for some reason. I have tried reaching out to Google and have tried all of their recommended ways of fixing this issue with no luck, other than them offering me a new Pixel 3 (which I would have to wait 15 days for once they received my old phone). I'm 99% sure this is a glitch with the Pixel 3 system but figured I would see if anyone has found a way to fix this.\n\nThank you!",

I want my image to appear as others see me, not mirrored. (In fact, I can't understand why anyone would actually prefer this, but that's beside the point)\n\nI went into the camera app settings and found \"\"Save selfie as previewed\" was already disabled, which I would expect would un-mirror my selfies, as I want. It does not! I tried setting it back and forth, and no change. No matter which way I change that setting, all of my selfies using the front camera are mirrored.\n\nI have tried restarting the phone, no change. I have tried toggling the setting and restarting the phone and toggling the setting back, no change. I have force-quit the camera app and opened it again, toggling the setting and force-quit the app between toggles, no change. Literally nothing will make this change. It's stuck in mirror selfie mode.\n\nI have a Pixel 4XL. I have a friend with the exact same phone model, he has the same problem. It's not my specific phone having the problem, I can say that with certainty now.\n\nDoes anyone have any suggestions for me to try? This is quite frustrating. I'm pretty sure this is a bug in the camera app, but that's just my best guess.\n\nThanks!",

I contacted Google Support and told me that the phone was, a hardware problem and told me to go to a UBreakIFixIt shop or something. Any other solutions? I heard it was a laser autofocus issue and when I told them they say that they couldn't provide a answer (That's what google support told me)\n\nBut hey, atleast there support is better than a company which has a logo of a fruit. \n\n(also it's the 1st Gen Pixel)",

Have tried disabling video stabilization. even tried the suggestion of giving the camera a strong 'tap'....EVERYTHING. Nothing worked. however, after the factory reset (which didn't work, as many strings had said it would not), I got tired of testing the camera and waiting for the HDR+ to resolve, so i tested the camera with HDR OFF. THAT WORKED. Photos finally back in focus. Quality looks fine. Looks to be an HDR+ software issue at Google to me. \n\nThis just resolved, so i'm hoping it stays fixed with HDR off and that Google fixes what certainly seems to be an HDR issue.",

Some are okay, but some have picked up the date/time that I transferred on. Some have just completely random dates now - there are pictures that were taken within minutes of  each other that are now in my phone as being taken months apart.\n\nDoes anyone know how to go through and amend the dates, or redo it so they transfer with the correct dates?\n\nMany thanks\n\nSteve",

It doesn't do this every time and I can go 30 min or an hour using the phone, turning the power on and off without incident.\n\nHowever, when it does exhibit the problem, it'll usually occur multiple times when successively single pressing the power button. This results in the phone continuing to return to the camera application instead of powering the screen off.\n\nI've attempted the following to rectify the issue\n\nStopping camera app, and clearing cache and data\nRemoving phone case\nBooting into safe mode\nFactory resetting the phone\n\nNone of the above has rectified the issue.\n\nI've called Google support, who have advised that I take the same set of trouble shooting actions, and have subsequently advised I report the issue through the settings app as well as post here.\n\nAny help would be appreciated.\n\nCheers",

It's becoming more and more prevalent recently and detracts from taking nice clear video of those special moments. Video quality has usually been quite smooth but not recently. \n\nTo replicate, take video in either 1080p or 4K and pan slight to the right then left (or vice versa). What you see is what you get essentially. The panning live with choppy or stuttering is shown on playback. I'd expect there to be a fluid video picture as opposed to what I'm currently seeing.\n\nI'd almost describe it as slight \"jitter\".

However, I noticed the other day during a video recording in a quiet environment that auto focus or OIS make a quiet noise when you turn the phone around the vertical axis with short movements. Either auto focus/OIS corrects the movement or the mounted lens swings. If the camera app is closed, you won't hear anything.\n\nA user has already written on reddit. Since it is only perceptible in absolutely quiet surroundings, probably not too many have noticed this phenomenon. But unfortunately you can hear it on the video.\n\nIs it a HW issue or just normal beahviour? I assume it's the OIS is moving the lens.\n\nHere the video on reddit, with me it is absolutely identical. Another one has probably confirmed it:\n\n\nPixel 4 xl OIS sound or noise - Streamable",

The sodtware is about 10 gb itself. I decided to get 64 gb version, and total I am at 52 percent of that. Would you guys stay with this 64 gb version or do you think that after use for a year or two would fill up the phone? I have cut down quite a lot on my music that is offline available in anticipation of this. I have 15 gb data plan, so I have some room to stream music but it's not unlimited. Just wanted to see what others who are experienced with Pixel/Android would think. Thanks \ud83d\ude0a",

I contacted a Google rep via chat on the Pixel, and the issue was not resolved.\n\nWe tried updating the stock camera google app and Google photos.\nWe uninstalled updates for both apps.\nReinstalled them.\nEntered the phone in safe mode.\nMade sure my phone is updated (has been running Android 10 for maybe a week now?) \nNothing has helped. Any help is appreciated!\n\nUPDATE: I fixed this issue a few days after posting this by uninstalling recent apps. This made me realize that it was a permission issue.  \n\nAfter pinpointing which application it was, I went into the device settings and turned off permissions from applications for the \"camera\". \n\nWorked fine until today, (December).

Then a lock button appears at the top, which is just as unresponsive.\nAnd suddenly from a slow paced phone, it become an F1 phone, when it comes to hide the lock button, if you spent time trying to get it to focus, then if you fail to press lock button on first try in 2 seconds, then you can start over.\n\nOn top of that, if you use touch to focus with flash on, then the exposure is locked when the flash is off, and it doesn't even use flash to focus. It's surprising that the best camera phone has arguably the worst manual focusing. It's only to be used as a point and shoot phone, which it's really good for.\n\nFor comparison Nexus phones had a reliable touch&hold to lock focus and exposure. This is replaced by lens camera, which I personally only activate from Google Assistant button, not from camera.\n\nCan we finally get a better solution, please?",

Everything's working fine, except the twist gesture to flip the camera to selfie and back.\n\nWent through all the steps with support, including a factory reset - nothing helped.\n\nI checked the gyroscope using other apps - it's working fine. Other similar gestures, like \"flip to shh\" is working fine too.\n\nI even tried opting into the Android Q beta, but the feature's still not working there.\n\nAt this point it's either go through the entire return process (a lot of hassle) or live with the problem. I'm ok with the latter if this issue is not signifying any underlying hardware problem.\n\nAny idea what it could be? Should I be going through the return process?\n\nThanks!",

    "title": "Pixel 2 Rear Camera Autofocus Issues then Stopped Working; Selfie Camera Still Fine",
    "content": "Hi, I have a Pixel 2 that is almost two years old.\n\nThis week the rear camera began having autofocus issues. The focus looked like it was stuck in macro mode. It'd focus on extremely close objects but not close to distant objects. When shooting video, the camera would go in and out of focus. Closing and reopening the app solved the focus issues.\n\nLast night, launching the camera app stopped working altogether. Clicking the camera icon results in the app launching then immediately dying. Sometimes there's an error message, sometimes there's a request for feedback, but most of the time the app just silently dies.\n\nIf I hold down the camera app icon and select take a selfie, the camera app usually launches and works. this leads me to believe that whatever is happening is limited to the rear camera.\n\nSometimes if I force stop the camera app then open it up a bunch of times (four to ten), the rear camera will start working perfectly again. The next time I go to use the rear camera though, the app starts the crashing again.\n\nCamera app version is 6.2.030.244457635. I tried clearing cache, clearing storage, safe mode, everything short of a factory reset with no success.\n\nThis seems to be a fairly widespread problem. What gives and how do I go about getting it fixed?",

The 30 fps file has better overall detail(look at texture for example).  I took few sample videos with 30 and 60 fps and they came out with consistent results. The 60 fps does have better frame rate but lacks in quality/details of the content being shot.  I have checked file details and 60 fps file shows better bit rate which is about 6K+ more than 30 fps.  This is not isolated to my devices or the lack of app/system updates.\n\nI am personally forced to select 30 fps because of the above.  The issue is present since owning Pixel 2 and I thought Google did something to make 60 fps as the name implies.\n\nIf we don't have 4K 60 on Pixel phones, then please make 1080p better!",

In addition, the flashlight option is also grayed out which shows to me that it seems to be a driver/software related within the OS rather than hardware related to the camera itself. \n\nSnapchat seems to have issues working due to this, I've since uninstalled it and tried to reinstall it but it will lag when trying to log in; I'm leaning towards whatever the issue is with the camera also affects the app. \n\nI have tried: \n\nReboot\nForce Stop app\nClear app cache\nSafe mode. \n\nIssue persists. \n\nIt's nearly Black Friday, and while there are decent phone deals I'd rather not have to drop hundreds upon hundreds of dollars because of this. \n\nThank you.",

This was the first thing he tried as this was an important part of the phone he likes to use a lot but says it is not as good as the pixel 2 which can't be right surely?\n\nAny help would be great.\n\nThanks,\nJohn",

I haven't been able to test this outside with the sunlight, but I used all of the lights in my house and I still get the same result.\n\nI'll provide two photos, the first being taken with the Pixel 3, the second with the Pixel 4.\nYou can easily see the detail in the facial hair on the Pixel 3 as you zoom in, but on the Pixel 4, all of the detail is somewhat lost and, for lack of a better word, \"blurry.\" And it's no small difference, it's massive.\n\nThis has been consistent regardless of the use of portrait mode or facial retouching. \n\nHowever, as I pull the camera further away from my face, the pixel 3 does seem to lose its sharpness and the pixel 4 provides a close, if not better, image. Is this a software issue, or is this a hardware issue? How did Google not test these cameras out more, and why aren't there more people talking about this?\n\nEither way, this is super frustrating. Just another reason for me to wonder why I even bothered upgrading.",

You can hear a weird, dull popping, at random times - like something was tapping the mic, but it wasn't. Unless it was a ghost? LOL \n\nOne hand was swiping the iPad screen, the other was holding onto the phone - in a silent room, indoors. \n\nThe mic anomalies are quite evident toward the tail end (very end) of the video. You can also hear the pops when I say \"okay\" toward the middle. Then, possibly, there's also light crackle. \n\nHere we go again... the mic on the Pixel 4 still needs tweaking (like mics on earlier Pixels did).",

Are night sight photos only shot with the selfie camera which would allow the individual controlling the camera shutter button to easily touch the shutter button while the phone's screen is facing the sky?",

There is a tapping noise during all of my videos and it makes them un-usable.\n\nThis has started to become quite detrimental to my business. I work with influencers on Instagram and I recommended the new Pixel 4 phone for its camera quality. Low and behold, any videos they take are a waste of time because of the tapping noise! \n\nI noticed in some of the forums Google representatives have replied and promised a fix \"in the coming days\" but that was 3 weeks ago, and is now false. I'm not sure why a tapping noise is taking this long to fix on what should be a top priority device, it is a brand new phone after all! \n\nIs there any update on when this issue will be resolved? I only have a few more days until my return policies expire for the devices, I enjoy the Pixel and I would love to be able to continue using it, but this tapping noise in videos is very important to me and would force me to choose a different brand.\n\nIf you read through to the end thank you for your time, hope to here back soon.",

    "content": "Since I can really only find one other post on this and Google support by phone had no clue what happened I'm going to post here.\n\nLast night my wife asked me to email a picture to her. I opened the photo from the camera album in photos and shared the photo to gmail and sent it to her, which she said she didn't have an attachment. I tried again as watched as I did it. When gmail opened it said, \"file could not be attached\". I then opened the photo from the album again and swiped up to see the details. The file size was 0 bytes, which seemed very strange. I then did a normal restart on my phone and went back to the same photo. This time when I swiped up to see the file size my phone starting quickly flashing through photos, about one each 1/4 of a second. When I finally got my phone to go to the home screen I went back in to my camera album and every photo from the last year was gone.\n\nTo answer, no, my backup was not turned on so please move beyond that. Google support by phone last night had no answer other than to have me search for a video on YouTube that ended up being an ad for some software, which I thought was pretty unprofessional. They honestly act like this had never happened and have no idea what occurred. \n\nThere must be a way to run a legitimate data recovery on my phone, right? My storage dropped by about 15Gb when this happened. The data has to still be there. I tried a basic recovery app from the play store and as it ran I could see thumbnails of the missing photos but the app was so garbage it either didn't complete or is a basic version to have you buy the upgrade one. \n\nHas anyone else seen this situation or know if there an actual way to run a recovery on the data?",

    "title": "Can you stop removing features on Pixel phones, please?",
    "content": "I bought a 3a pixel a couple of months ago and since then I've only seen the features decrease:\n- Instead of the ringtone/notifications the volume keys change the multimedia volume even when you don't use any multimedia. \n- The ambient display could be set to appear only when the device was raised, shortly after this feature was replaced by the full display which blinds when the device is raised in the middle of the night.\n- Recorded videos have a very loud hiss that makes them horrible. To be able to remove this whistle is necessary to disable the Now Playing function or the Voice Assistant (both features that I like.)\n- In the latest version of the camera you have removed:\n    - burst photos (one of the best features!)\n    - the possibility to choose video resolution\n    - the astrophotos added with V7.2 and removed immediately (I was very keen on it but I didn't had time to test it)\n\nIs it possible to have a PIXEL with features that increase over time instead of diminishing?\n\nThanks.",

I've noticed a blue spot/flare/reflection that seems to move as I move the camera to focus. It seems to be a light being emitted from the camera itself. I'm guessing some sort of focus function. When I zoom in user pinch to zoom via the camera the spot becomes larger. I'm green when it comes to photography matters, so maybe someone can explain the effect as well why the camera is doing that. Is this a bug? I've read reports about the halo effect and the circumstances under which that effect was reproduced seems similar to my issue.",

I would select the image I wanted to move, tap the \"Move to folder\" button, and select the folder I wanted to move it to. The pic would disappear from the screenshots folder and reappear in downloads (again, using these two as an example). This process has worked for years up until a week ago. Now the file stays in both places and leaves what I'm going to call a \"ghost file\" in the original location. This ghost file takes up the space that the original image took, is incredibly low resolution and when I want to upload photos to Facebook (for example) It appears as a corrupted file (see attached image [yeah I play alot of maker games, lol][I also already used that coupon code]). Yeah, I guess this isn't a huge problem but it's certainly annoying. I restarted my phone But that didn't work. Anybody else have the problem and was able to fix it?",

Also double checked that all permissions are given and even re-applied all permissions as well. Since I don't know if the problem is with the camera app, I have also done the same with the Photos app.\nIn addition, I have tried to run the phone in safe mode, but the problem remains the same which seems to indicate that the problem is most likely with the Camera app itself.\nI just discovered that I can still take photos with Instagram and they show up in Photos just fine. So, it seems to assume that this is a problem with the Camera app.\nAny ideas what else I can try? Thank you!",

    "content": "I'm having an odd problem with my Pixel 3 XL. More precisely with the device's camera. The camera works perfectly fine when it is functional, only problem is that it is functional around 40% of the time. It seems that at random moments, the camera simply stops working or doesn't turn on anymore. In fact, it leaves me on a black screen and the app crashes after a few seconds. When using an app that uses he camera (e.g. Snapchat) the app will show a message saying that it can not open the camera. Often times, the camera will be working just fine until I switch from front facing to back facing, then it will freeze, turn to black, and not be functional for an unknown period of time.\n\n I tried fiddling around with it to understand the problem,  and sometimes I need to switch from front to back a couple of times until it stops working. I also tried restarting the device many times and it seems to temporarily fix the problem until the camera stops working again. Factory reset had the same effect. \n\nAnother thing I noticed is that whenever the camera is in its \"dead\" state, I can't turn the flashlight on either (the button is greyed out), which leads me to believe that it is a hardware issue? But when the camera works it looks absolutely perfect which means it might be a software issue?\n\nI have searched online and haven't found any solution to my problem, it would be nice to know if anyone has experienced the same issue and if a solution has been found.",

Additionally, it takes many hours (or even days) for pictures to be populated in photos. \nI started a support chat, where after some very basic troubleshooting, they asked me to factory reset the phone. \nI escalated as I did not think sufficient troubleshooting was done before the ask. I was told a supervisor would get back to me. The supervisor got back to me after 1 FULL day and parroted the exact same line - just saying that they absolutely needed me to do a factory reset. If that did not fix it, they would look into what else could be done. \n\nBeing an engineer, I asked as to what other troubleshooting were they looking for. 12 hours later, he responds saying that they are trying to understand if it is a HW or SW issue. If the issue persisted, he vaguely said he would look into talking about warranty options.\n\nI have now done a factory reset and the issue still exists. I reached out via chat and was told that support cannot help as it is with a specialist. The specialist will get back to me within 24-48 hours! \n\nThere is absolutely no way to get a faster response.\n\nI am stunned that a company the size of google has such limited staff that they take 24-48 hours to respond, and they have such a poor support structure that no one deviates from a very set script - repeating and parroting the same lines again and again.\n\nAt this point, I am just frustrated with the Pixel support experience and wanted to share these experiences with the broader audience so people know what to expect!",

I tested it a few times and it seems to happen intermittently. I just want to see if others are experiencing this. \n\nI suggest testing should be done by taking one portrait photo then review it. Then immediately take another one (or two) and see if the image you review is the previous one. The latest photo you just took will be saved, but you'll have to move an image ahead to see it.\n\nThanks for any confirmations on the same issue! Pixel 3 with July patch has been applied.",

    "content": "I have a Pixel 3a that sometimes has an issue when using the flash on the camera that causes the phone to suddenly shut off/reboot. Usually, it's when I try to rapidly take multiple photos using the flash (within a couple seconds of each other), but it will sometimes have the problem even when just using the flash to take a single photo. To the best of my recollection, I have not changed any of the camera settings since I set the phone up, and the phone does not have any other issues. Everything else on the phone works properly and smoothly (other than the camera not focusing as quickly and accurately as it usually does; but this is not a big deal).\n\nI don't want to have to do a factory reset, but is it possible that a factory rest might help to resolve this issue? Also, I have cleared the cache on the Camera app multiple times, but the problem with using the flash causing the phone to restart still happens sometimes.\n\nI got the Pixel 3a as a gift and don't have the receipt and don't know that I could still get in contact with the person who originally bought it. Is it possible to try to get a Pixel phone fixed under warranty, if you don't have the original receipt to provide? Or, as I suspect, am I SOL when it comes to possibly being able to use the warranty (assuming that it's still active/valid)?\n\nSorry for the lengthy post. This isn't a major issue; but it it something that is really annoying when it happens, as I have to unexpectedly wait for my phone to reboot. If anyone has any helpful information, ideas or suggestions, a reply would certainly be appreciated.\n\nAlso, has anyone else had this camera flash issue with their Pixel 3a device??",

Repeated steps on Android Pie - no change\n\nNote:  Both cameras on my Pixel 2 XL do not function.\n\n\n\nPlease assist or point me in the right direction.\n\nThank you!",

    "content": "Compared to the Pixel 3, the fourth family has only one selfie camera and autofocus has been removed from it, this is a minus, why remove it, what works better?  The question is open!  Everyone puts ultra-wide-angle cameras on smartphones, but Google thinks that zoom is more important to users - that's why the Pixel 4 just has a dual camera with the zoom that Apple has had since 2016, although Google insisted that they did not need a second camera for optical zoom, each  year they contradict themselves.  Next year, they will add a third ultra-wide camera and a self-focusing camera with autofocus.  Maybe the main camera in Pixel 4 is very good and it is slightly better than in the previous generation, but it would have been earlier if Apple had not worked out its deep fusion and night mode as it should on iPhone 11, in pixel 4 there is no such separation from competitors as  was earlier in comparison with pixel 2-3 versions, competitors worked out software algorithms.  The video, as it was 4K 30 frames, remained, the competitors already have 4K 60 frames on the front camera, but what the hell is Google?  put another sensor that can record 4K video 60 frames, purely for video, if the IMX 363 is so good for the photo part, leave it too, there is only two cameras in the back, and on the front, put the sensor up to 4K 60 frames, the prices are almost the same  same as Apple, but in the aggregate and in general worse!",

    "content": "Dear Google support team\n I bought a Pixel 3 (64gb) on November of 2018 from your official Google store in France. In June 19 it started to have some issues during video recording (like camera shaking) which became worst on September 19. Now the problem is on both camera and video mode. I can see that some people worldwide have the same problem too. I tried to do what you told others to do (uninstall camera updates, uninstall third party apps, start in safe Mode, do a factory reset) but nothing worked out. Please let me know what to do next. \nCan I return it to you and send me another device? Please bear in mind that right now  I don't live in France anymore. I am in Greece and as far as I know you don't have an official Google store here. So in case of sending it back, is it possible to send me another device here?\nBest regard\nBill",

    "content": "Hi, Mark! First of all I wanted to say a huge thank you for all the hard and tremendous work you've done! Especially considering that there aren't too many people at your Pixel photo team (there are around 12...18 people if I am not mistaken and I thought there were like 100 to 200 people who made this Hdr+ mode come true). There is an issue, however, related with current pixel processing. I remember you once said in your interview that pixel's processing is very tolerate to noise reduction process. I do not know whether you are aware of that or no, but pixels' noise suppression has been becoming more and more intense and now has become one of the strongest in the industry. I'm using the Pixel 1st gen by myself and recently discovered a modded app which allowed adjust the NR processing for one's liking. I was shocked. Photos became like 3 times better with only colour NR turned on. Altogether I understand that there can be some problems with the marketing department which very well may insist on making this NR process that heavy. But still. Maybe there will be a way to add a hidden toggle, like the one with the raw feature somewhere deep in the menu. Because this noise adds professionally edited look to the photos (photos taken in RAW with ,,adited to taste,, label on DPreview often has the similar look as the ones I got with this modded cam app) Thanks for your time and thank you one more time. Just so you know. You and your team inspire people! I believe in you! #teampixel!",

    "content": "Bought a Pixel 3xl from the Google store 30-40 days ago.  Everything was going great until Sept. 18th, when the rear facing camera stopped focusing. Contacted support, got an RMA underway, with me placing a temporary hold on my credit card to cover the cross-shipped device.  The RMA phone arrived today, and it was completely DOA. Wouldn't power on, respond to a charger.  Contacted support again about the DOA replacement phone, and after a lot of explaining that it was the refurbished replacement phone that was also non-functional, I was advised to put the refurb phone in the packaging and ship it back using the  label I was e-mailed.  I did so, and now I'm being told that I cannot receive a different RMA phone until the first one arrives at the shipping location, then I can start another RMA.  \n\nIn essence I've been without a fully functioning phone for 6 days, and it will be at least another two until they receive the DOA refurb I was sent before I can start yet *another* RMA to get another refurbished phone that may or may not work.  In essence I'm looking at at least another 5-6 days without a fully functioning phone.\n\nThe quality control on the refurbished units is obviously non-existent and I'm not sure the next replacement will be functional.   \n\nI'm seriously considering a return/refund and I'll just buy another manufacturer's  phone elsewhere. The support has been nothing short of horrible and frustrating.",

    "content": "Yesterday I tried taking a video and got a notification that I didn't have enough storage. I started deleting photos but made sure to only delete some that were already backed up (my back up is turned on automatically). After deleting 20-30, I tried deleting more and it said it could not delete them. I went to check my phone storage, and it said the total phone was only at 73%, so something happened to the 27% that was there when I was trying to take the video. I had guessed that I somehow accidentally selected to \"Free Up Space\", which from my understanding would only have removed photos that were already backed up, so I wasn't worried about it. Later that night I looked at my photos, and all of the photos I had taken that day said \"Not backed up. Too big or unknown type\" (which didn't make sense because one photo had that message, but the next photo that I had taken 5 minutes later didn't). I searched the internet and someone suggested to clear the cache, and confirmed this would do nothing to harm any photos. I did that and then went back to my \"camera\" album and only the first 32 photos appeared, and the rest were grey squares. If I went to \"photos\", it appears that all of the pictures that are saved to my device won't appear, but any photos that aren't, appeared correctly.  In \"camera\" when I clicked on a photo that isn't displaying, it just gave me a black screen. If I tried editing the photo it said \"unable to edit, check your connection\". I was connected to both wifi and data so that shouldn't be an issue. If I tried to share the photo, it just gave me a white screen. \n\nI decided to try restarting my phone because presumably that fixes everything, but then ALL of my photos, except for those first 32 were gone from my camera album. The ones that weren't backed up because they were \"too big or unknown type\" (even though my camera was the one that took them) were completely gone. \n\nI'm guessing there's nothing I can do and that those pictures are just gone forever? Any one have any ideas at all of what happened or anything I could do to get those pictures back?",

Didnt expect this on OLED. I had my doubts before buying as not a single unit in stores had a proper white screen. \n- I was expecting so much from the camera. But cloudy day shots were so dark and dull, that my 3 yrs old phone was taking better pictures. Even the low light shots from my old phone were comparable to pixel. \n\nAnd even when I sent a photo comparing pixel 3a xl Vs other phone screen whiteness, the response from pixel experts was \"oled screens are like that. may be the phone is not for you\"\n\nSo...

    "content": "I've seen several posts -- here and through Google search, of Pixel phone users complaining about the awful user experience annoyance whereby portrait mode in the stock camera app creating a new and separate folder for every single photo. This is beyond irritating, because if you want to post a photo using a third party app (like Instagram, Twitter or Facebook) you must scroll through a constantly increasing number of folders labeled something like IMG_00000000_000000. In my case, haven taken hundreds of portrait photos, there were hundreds of these folders I needed to delete.\n\nDespite years of complaints, Google and its camera app developers have done nothing in terms of issuing a fix. The problem has persisted throughout each new iteration of the Google phone. This is unacceptable.\n\nPLEASE if you are having this issue, contact Google developers through the camera app, by tapping More--->Settings---->Send feedback and politely ask for an immediate fix. Or consider telling them you will not be purchasing another Pixel phone until this issue is resolved.\n\nWhen a fixable feature has this many complaints, it's hostile to users for nothing to be done. Let's force Google developers to finally pay attention.\n\nThanks,\n\nDK",

    "content": "Starting a few months after purchase (and continuing now for a couple of months), my pixel 3 rear-facing camera has shown non-linear distortions in the image that flicker in and out, along with very poor focus stability.  Pictures are worth a thousand words:\n\nhttps://photos.app.goo.gl/6QoC36SX5UAFCAXe6\n\nThe first is a still image which needs to be viewed with Motion On.  Notice that the image is generally still, but on the left side there is a non-linear distortion of the image that comes and goes.  I see this effect quite frequently in my photos and on the screen while framing a photo.\n\nThe second is a video where I am panning back and forth a bit.  You can see the focus jumping in and out at high frequency and hints of the image non-linear distortion.\n\nI don't see these problems with the front-facing camera.",

    "content": "Hi Google, \n\nThe Night Sight mode in awesome in general, and I love it! But for it kinds of falls short for astrophotography and seems to actually be counter productive. The issue (illustrated on video here: https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/aeuf44/google_pixel_3_night_sight_preprocessing_ruins/) is that Night Sight post-processing makes night sky shots look way worse than what initially comes out of the sensor.\n\nWould you consider an astrophotography mode, where postprocessing is disabled, or at least tuned to retain some of the original deep-sky details? Or, maybe more easily, is there a way to keep the original frames, before they're being post-processed in Night Sight mode?\n\nThanks!",

These photos had the not backed up symbol on the right-side corner and I was unable to upload them to an album. I googled to fix this issue and tried a couple of things. One of this included to Disable the Photos App from Settings and Enable it back after a few seconds. I did that and it solved the backup problem. But now I cannot find the photos that had the not backup symbol on them.\nAlso, since then my camera is also acting weird. In the circle on the right side of the shutter, which generally shows last clicked image, now is gray. When I click it nothing happens. When I click a photo and then click the circle it does shows the last photo but that's it. I cannot swipe to see other clicked photos.\nPlease help me with retrieving the photos. There were about 300 photos from a trip and they are not in Trash or Archive folder or on any other account. Neither are these photos visible when I go to photos.google.com on my laptop.",

I know there's been posts about this before, but nothing specifically with what's happening to me and nothing helped so far.\n\nBasically, I just got the pixel and google photos automatically put all the photos I already had in storage in Google Photos onto my phone. But I don't want them on my phone. That's why I put them in google photos in the first place. But now that I have the pixel they're all on my phone.\n\nI tried deleting the albums. Learned the hard way that doesn't work- even though I checked before deleting all the albums, google was slow to update and turns out deleting them from my phone does indeed, eventually, delete the albums from google photos online. So now I just have a bunch of unsorted photos on google photos. And if I put them back into albums, they go back onto my phone.\n\nI've also tried Free up space. Which doesn't work. I'm assuming because they aren't \"original photos\" from this phone? It just says \"can't free up space\".Can anyone help me out here?",

Although, the effect is hardly visible in broad daylight but one can notice indoors, and if I take a photo of bright light then it's pretty clear as in the photo I've attached below.\n\n\n\nIt's really annoying as I've been using my Pixel XL with great care and I thought Google will solve this through an update but it's still there.",

    "content": "My camera on my Pixel 3 keeps crashing. When it does open, I can take pictures until I leave camera mode. However, when I try to go back into camera mode, it won't load. It's like a one time use situation. Even just looking at the picture I just took can keep it from working.\n\nI can restart my phone and sometimes get it to work again, but it's still a one time use.\n\nOther apps that use my camera can work if the camera hasn't been opened already. If I'm using my camera and it won't load, I can go into apps that use the camera and it's crashed there, too.\n\nAll of my apps are up to date. I've also tried clearing the camera cache which doesn't seem to do anything. \n\nI've tried getting Google Assistant to find the issue, but it just searches forever and never finds anything.\n\nWhen it crashes, the camera screen opens up. It then doesn't show any picture of what I'm looking at. The camera button goes to a darker shade of grey. It thinks for a few seconds and then closes the camera app completely by itself. \n\nClearing the camera from recently used apps doesn't do anything.",

I'm saying it's after the system update because I've tried rolling back the camera software without any result. Phone was not rooted or modified in any way, did not suffer falls or anything like that. All in all, right after the system update the cameras stopped working.\n\nIt seems I have similar issues with a lot of other people on the support forum. \nI have tried:\n- cleaning lens & laser (no effect, duh)\n- restarting the phone\n- clearing the app's cache\n- updating the apps\n- uninstalling / rolling back the apps and reinstalling\n- started the phone in safe mode\n- sacrificing a lamb (didn't help, but it staved my hunger)\n\nHow should I proceed?\n\nThanks and Regards,\n\nBrad",

    "content": "I bought Pixel 2XL in Jan 2018, have been using Instagram from the start. The quality of posts on Instagram Stories used to be top-notch due to the introduction of visual core chip. After a hiatus from instagram for a few months. I started using Instagram Camera again and the quality is so freaking bad. The still pictures are super grainy and color science is so bad. The video is slightly blurred with bad audio. \nIt used to be awesome in the start. Now, it's just useless.",

I don't remember what that function was called. There also used to be a fish eye lens and I think others too. I can't find them anywhere.",

I am thinking that I made a big mistake in choosing Pixel 2 over an iPhone which has very good support here. I paid about CAN$1,000 for this! What can you do to help? I am willing to pay for international shipping both ways if I could have my phone repaired or better yet replaced. Thank you.",

    "content": "When I first bought my Pixel 2, I was able to upload all photos on the device to Photos at Original quality (as the app says) without affecting my Google Drive storage.  Recently I noticed that Google has started uploading my photos at \"High Quality\" which tosses out 50-80% of the pixels reducing the quality of the \"backed up\" photos to an unusable size.  After contacting support (Leo and Rick), they told me I should \"free up space\" on my device which would have deleted the only remaining originals that I have not already lost.  Google support has not taken ownership of this issue and there is no setting I can change in the Photos app to even change this behavior (because the app assures me, without any settings, that I will have the original quality photo uploaded).  I am posting here (and will post elsewhere if I need to) because the Google support seems so unwilling to fix this issue.  I really thought Google cared more about their customers.",

Like many, the front camera began to crash a couple of months into ownership, and I tried all the suggested avenues:\nForce stop the camera app, clear data/cache\nRestart in safe mode\nLook at update rollbacks, try different camera apps, etc.\nReset the device to factory settings\n\nNone of these worked, and because I didn't have time to send in the device for repair, I resigned myself to not having a front camera. However, when the device received the PQ2A.190405.003 update, the camera started working again.\n\nImagine my surprise.\n\nI was equally surprised, however, when I tried opening it this morning (4/14/19), and it's back to not working. I've again tried all the steps that are suggested, but nothing has worked.\n\nWhat's interesting is that this time the app doesn't crash. When I select the front camera, the app pauses for a second or two, then simply acts like nothing happened and I'm taking a picture with the back camera.\n\nI'm not sure if I'm dealing with a hardware or software issue at this point, to be honest. Has anyone else had this kind of on/off behavior?",

    "content": "I love my Pixel 1 and I'm considering an upgrade to the Pixel 3.\nThe camera performance is the most important aspect I'm looking at, so I want to make sure I'm not making the wrong move here. I read in a number of different forums that the Pixel 3 camera app sometimes takes a few seconds to start, which will often make you miss a shot involving  kids moving rapidly. Another issue I've read about is that once you tap the \"shoot\" button, the actual shot is not instantaneous, but it happens a few hundreds milliseconds later. Again, when you have a moving kid, a ~200ms lag can too much.\nHas anyone here experienced these issues? Would you recommend the Pixel 3 to someone who has such strict performance requirements for the camera app?\nThank you!",

I got it back last week and it was fine apart from the camera app still not working and the back camera not working on other apps. But I updated my phone yesterday (big mistake) and now snapchat won\u2019t work, the torch doesn\u2019t work and neither does youtube. I can\u2019t even log into snapchat as I tried uninstalling it, also a very big mistake. The people at car phone warehouse said they could replace it and I was waiting for s replacement, and went in yesterday to ask when it\u2019ll be in. Turns out you have to pay for s replacement even though I\u2019ve only had the phone just over a year. Could someone please advise on this and whether google can even replace this phone as I\u2019m fed up with trying to fix an issue that even the google team cannot fix.",

I've a specific question: when I shoot a portrait picture, Pixel creates a directory containing two files: a regular picture (with background), and a background blurred picture. Maybe it's useful for adjust the blurring level after shooting. The strange thing is when I remove all pictures except the blurred one. Then, I'm still able to adjust the blurring level, and also remove blurring and restore the backgroup. Where are the background information, if I've removed the picture with clear background?

    "content": "Ok so, for unrelated reasons, a few years ago I had my first pixel replaced with a refurbished version.\n\nThe refurbished phone had issues with focusing within a month of using it.\n\nBy that point, I was out of warranty to get it fixed. Google support staff had me try everything including clear my cache, reinstall the camera app, use safe mode, factory reset, etc. None of those steps worked.\n\n* Critical Point: A third party app called Open Camera allows you to manually control the camera focus. This is NOT automatic focus. It's manual. Manual focus on the third party app couldn't even adjust the focus. So the issue isn't the laser sensors. It's the camera itself.\n\nWhat I want is simple: an acknowledgment that this phone has a fundamental fault with its camera that isn't a software issue.\n\nFor years, you guys have refused to acknowledge that it's a hardware problem, and have consistently insisted the problem is from software.\n\nYou guys wouldn't stand by your product or acknowledge it was faulty, and tried to get me to pay for repairs on a phone that was broken out of the box.\n\nAll I know is that, until you acknowledge my complete disgust with the way you handled this, I'll never buy a pixel as long as I live.\n\nOh yeah, I've also shared my experiences with others and talked two people out of buying the Pixel 3.",

I open the app, and sometimes it's frozen on just a plain black screen, other times the app just crashes, in other apps, for example, Snapchat, I sometimes get a warning saying \"Snapchat\" isn't responding and gives me some options to either restart the app or send feedback. I have done everything that the Google Site suggested all the way down to a factory reset.

I'm very familiar with each of the camera modules and what they're good for, however mine can't seem to use the right one at the right time.\nIt keeps choosing to use the 3x telephoto lense when I ask for 10x zoom, and often uses the 10x lense when I ask for 3x. The result is ridiculously grainy images that don't even compare to my Note 10+.  I have tried experimenting by covering up the camera lenses that I think it should be using at the time to prove that it's getting it wrong, and low and behold the image isn't covered up.\nThe annoying thing is, I can see the camera switching between the correct and incorrect modules if I tilt the camera towards different light. \n  Has anyone else experienced this? Hopefully fixable with a software update but this is really affecting the quality of my images.\n ",

However I think it is completely unfair as the whole zoom category checked the phone in the completely wrong way. Look at the test. It does 2.5x,4x and 8x. ALL are ranges where the phone goes digital and crops. Obviously if other phones have a 2x lens that is used for 2.5x/4x/8x the results would be more 'optical'. What they should have done is to test the camera charateristics at 3x and 10x. Not compared to anything but to give an objective assessment of those lenses. They also completely ignored ultra zoom (say X30) comparison between the phones. I also didnt see any note on the macro capabilities. True, there are things to improve (noise, video details) and I hope they are improved in software.

    "title": "S20+ Which camera use and how to set it up?",
    "content": "I haven't written anything about photography for a while, so I feel it's the time to fix it. After all, when, if not when the new generation of Galaxy S has arrived?\nZoom\nThe Samsung Galaxy S20+ has 3 cameras: main, wide angle and zoom.\nSo first we look at the zoom camera.\nI took 3 photos for you, each with a different zoom. So my S20 + should always use a different camera module.\nzoom 0.5x\nzoom 1x\nzoom 3x\nAs you can see, there is half the street on the widest focus, 3 houses on the basic module and 3 windows on the zoom.\nLet's see what it looks like if we put the 3 photos on top of each other:\nHere it is even better to see the difference between modules. So don't be afraid to use all three modules. Switch between them easily by clicking the tree icon. The fewer trees, the more detailed you take a photo.\nBut beware! This applies if there is enough light! Under low light conditions, the wide-angle (f / 2.2) and telephoto (f / 2.0) lenses will appear less bright. It doesn't seem like that, because the basic lens has an f / 1.8, but even this few difference indicate almost half the light transmission of a wide-angle lens.\nOf course, if you need a wide shot, the widescreen module is irreplaceable, but if you want to zoom, consider if you prefer to use cropping or just have less detail.\nAspect Ratio\nAnd now let's look at another setting, namely the aspect ratio. You may have noticed that the camera settings only have the option to set the resolution for video, but no longer for photos. All that is available is the aspect ratio setting. We can choose from ratios of 4: 3, 16: 9, 1: 1 and Full.\n  What is what and when to use? Again we will first show the pictures:\n1:1\n4:3\n16:9\nFull\nWell, what's going on? The table with the resolution of each picture will tell us more:\nAs we can see, the 4:3 aspect ratio has the highest resolution. 1:1 is the same in height but smaller in width, then 16:9 and Full are preserved in width, but the height is reduced.\nHere is again one picture with all images:\nThe whole photo is 4:3, others are highlighted by colored rectangles. Here I would like to point out that, as in the first case with zoom, I did not just paint lines into one photo, but I really stacked the individual photos on top of each other. After all, it's a bit visible, because I don't have a proper tripod at home right now, so the cell phone moved a bit during the photo shoot.\nThe 4:3 aspect ratio uses the entire area of the chip, other ratios crop the photo.\nSo the idea is to always take photos in a 4: 3 ratio and if necessary crop the photos at home. I recommend it and I do it, but there are exceptions.\nWe can use the 1:1 aspect ratio if we know we want to share the photo only on Instagram.\nThe 16:9 aspect ratio makes sense if we present photos on TV (they usually have this aspect ratio).\nFull uses exactly the entire area of the mobile phone display, if we show photos on it, it makes sense.\n  But it is important to realize that anything other than 4:3 means irreversibly discarding some information.\nSAMSUNG Galaxy Z Fold3 5G 512 Black | Galaxy Z Flip\nGalaxy Buds | Galaxy Buds+ | Galaxy Buds Pro",

    "content": "Since getting the phone (S20 Ultra) and dealing with some autofocus issues, I've come to appreciate the pro mode. Not for any of the pro features, really (I'm no photographer and don't get how to use all the features properly) but for the fact that it has manual focus. When auto focus fails (which it regularly does on the current firmware) it's great to be able to have a backup option. There are 2 problems with the pro mode, however:\n  1) You can only use the main camera sensor\n2) You can't use 108mp mode on the main sensor\n  Personally, I think it would be great if Samsung enabled pro mode on the telephoto and wide angle lenses - especially the telephoto lens. While it wouldn't negate the need for better autofocus on the normal mode (which the phone desparately needs) it would at least give people an option when the camera is unable to focus, or in situations where the camera just keeps focusing on the wrong thing (which can happen on the best of autofocus implementations).",

If I try the same shot with the S10+ it's absolutely fine - I can get pretty insane quality pictures on the 2x lens on that from about 5cm away. This appears to be an issue on all lenses but is certainly much worse when it's using the 4x lens - as soon as it goes beyond the 4.0 point on anything less than 30-50cm away it just becomes a blurry mess, which wasn't an issue on any of my previous phones. Right now the camera feels like a downgrade in this regard...\n  Has anyone else had this? Or is there a firmware due to patch it? One of the main reasons I got the S20 Ultra was for the incredible camera but right now I'm quite disappointed with its performance. I did hear that a patch was due but I don't see any when trying to update - maybe it's just not been rolled out yet.\n  EDIT: Just had a look around and noticed that I was looking at the wrong part of the software version number, assuming I already had the update and it was still bad. It looks like the phones come shipped with firmware version ending in ATBM and the firmware that fixes the camera issues is ATC2\n  Either way if possible I'd still like to know an ETA on the update.",

My research on the phone highlighted the good videos that all three rear lenses produce. \nI have discovered that in Pro Video Mode, the video stabilization has no effect in any of the 24fps 'Pro Video Size' resolutions available. E.g. I can record but all the videos are shaky whether I have stabilization switched on or off. 24fps is an option I do want to shoot in and one reason why I purchased the phone.  When I select a 30fps or 60fps option the stabilisation is good, and you would think more frames per second would be more demanding to stabilise for the phone. These are no 24fps options in normal video mode\nI have reset camera settings and cache, restarted and factory reset without any improvement.  It makes no difference using auto or manual focus, nor if I save the videos to the phone or SD card. \nHas anyone else had this issue and/or suggestions as to how to make stabilization work for 24fps please? \nMany thanks, Somer.",

Want to take some close ups? No macro again. So try Food setting but even this has its limits. Most shots end up blurry. They look perfect on the screen then you press the camera button and bam a ***** photo.\nNext thing is when the phone is in rest mode. I miss the LED light flashing to let me know I have a message, or what's app, snap chat etc. Instead I had to download an app which lights up around the camera lense to have the same functions as previous phones. Upgrade? Yeah right. Hold on a minute you can have a flash around the screen I hear you say. Wow its so bright and lasts about 2 seconds. Useless. On mine while browsing the Internet it crashes and the screen freezes. I have put it into safe mode and tried to see if any apps are causing this but nothing.  Its still the same after 2 months. Sometimes happens when writing messages. Let's hope I'm never in an emergency as the phone may not allow me to be saved.\nFor all the years I have owned a phone which includes a large amount of Samsung I have never managed to call 999 emergency services while the phone was in my pocket. Yet with this one I somehow managed to phone them without touching any buttons. Everytime I take the phone out its pressed loads of keys as it's lit up with loads of stars. \nTurn the sensitivity down I hear you say, well if I did that then my thumb print wouldn't let me get into the phone. Another useless feature I've register's 4 different sets of finger prints and only 40% of the time will any of them work then comes up 5 attempts have been made wait so many seconds and all that rubbish. The face unlock isn't too bad.\nThe Samsung keyboard is still rubbish and I use swift key. Samsung keyboard seems to make up non existent words and then saves them so that when you write a message you sound like a five year old. \nWith all the issues I have with this phone I did try to send it back within a few days but due to covid by the time I actually got in touch with the phone company and how they wanted the phone to be with all original coverings etc it was too late.  I have also considered selling or swapping with money my way to go back to the S9. Don't know why I haven't yet. This is the worse Samsung I have ever owned. And I've had at least 10 other Samsung in my life time. Poor job Samsung. Putting me off buying in the future. Good lick to anyone who buys one.

I explore places that are haunted or just abandoned showing my content to the world. My original phone was a Samsung j3 2017 it did me well with my videos. However the new year came about and I had a chance for a new phone. I knew instantly it was going to be samsung but which one, then I got a awesome deal in my price range the Samsung galaxy s20 4g fe. So I jumped at the chance for taking explore pictures it is awesome. Great lenses and good pictures jsut wish they could make it so you could alter the picture setting personally not just the aspect ratio. Also when filming as you guessed it my videos mostly are night time to add to the feel of them. I thus have to use a external panel light which then poses its own issues for example low light or light in my way creates the screen to struggle to keep up. As the crew isn't 4k ready screen it it's a lot lower resolution. All in all its a awesome phone tho with people.like me testing them and polishing then to there limits then I hope samsung will push and improve even further on their phones. I would also like to be able to test out new phone to help them get better. Wanting a video review go subscribe to my channel https://youtube.com/channel/UCLNESzbp0wsxzYQlCOYjaEA\nAs with me now having the phone a month I will be making a review on the phone pros and cons on my YouTube channel. Along with further review as I progress in using this new phone. Also anyone into filming and equipment reviews or even just adventures like I do check my channel out as I push this phone to its limits and beyond",

    "content": "Hi,\n  there are a few posts that related to some camera issues on the Galaxy smartphones like the missing pro mode for the ultrawide and telephoto lenses. I would like to ask if there is any possibility to let the users at least take some sort of control of how the pictures are edited by the software.\n  Main \"problems\" are (as stated by many on forums and videos) the very aggressive sharpening in combination with a noise reduction filter that results in a huge loss in picture quality and dark area information. \n  So there is my suggestion: Is it possible to give the user an option to lessen or even disable the smoothing and sharpness software editing for all cameras? That could be implemented with a slider similar to the one controlling the smoothness filter on the selfie cam. I am looking forward to your replies.\n  Kind regards\n  P_A_\nPascalis Arvantas\nLink to a youtube video that shows the issue:\n  https://youtu.be/Yixfk5c9974",

    "title": "S20+ Which camera use and how to set it up?",
    "content": "I haven't written anything about photography for a while, so I feel it's the time to fix it. After all, when, if not when the new generation of Galaxy S has arrived?\nZoom\nThe Samsung Galaxy S20+ has 3 cameras: main, wide angle and zoom.\nSo first we look at the zoom camera.\nI took 3 photos for you, each with a different zoom. So my S20 + should always use a different camera module.\nzoom 0.5x\nzoom 1x\nzoom 3x\nAs you can see, there is half the street on the widest focus, 3 houses on the basic module and 3 windows on the zoom.\nLet's see what it looks like if we put the 3 photos on top of each other:\nHere it is even better to see the difference between modules. So don't be afraid to use all three modules. Switch between them easily by clicking the tree icon. The fewer trees, the more detailed you take a photo.\nBut beware! This applies if there is enough light! Under low light conditions, the wide-angle (f / 2.2) and telephoto (f / 2.0) lenses will appear less bright. It doesn't seem like that, because the basic lens has an f / 1.8, but even this few difference indicate almost half the light transmission of a wide-angle lens.\nOf course, if you need a wide shot, the widescreen module is irreplaceable, but if you want to zoom, consider if you prefer to use cropping or just have less detail.\nAspect Ratio\nAnd now let's look at another setting, namely the aspect ratio. You may have noticed that the camera settings only have the option to set the resolution for video, but no longer for photos. All that is available is the aspect ratio setting. We can choose from ratios of 4: 3, 16: 9, 1: 1 and Full.\n  What is what and when to use? Again we will first show the pictures:\n1:1\n4:3\n16:9\nFull\nWell, what's going on? The table with the resolution of each picture will tell us more:\nAs we can see, the 4:3 aspect ratio has the highest resolution. 1:1 is the same in height but smaller in width, then 16:9 and Full are preserved in width, but the height is reduced.\nHere is again one picture with all images:\nThe whole photo is 4:3, others are highlighted by colored rectangles. Here I would like to point out that, as in the first case with zoom, I did not just paint lines into one photo, but I really stacked the individual photos on top of each other. After all, it's a bit visible, because I don't have a proper tripod at home right now, so the cell phone moved a bit during the photo shoot.\nThe 4:3 aspect ratio uses the entire area of the chip, other ratios crop the photo.\nSo the idea is to always take photos in a 4: 3 ratio and if necessary crop the photos at home. I recommend it and I do it, but there are exceptions.\nWe can use the 1:1 aspect ratio if we know we want to share the photo only on Instagram.\nThe 16:9 aspect ratio makes sense if we present photos on TV (they usually have this aspect ratio).\nFull uses exactly the entire area of the mobile phone display, if we show photos on it, it makes sense.\n  But it is important to realize that anything other than 4:3 means irreversibly discarding some information.\nSAMSUNG Galaxy Z Fold3 5G 512 Black | Galaxy Z Flip\nGalaxy Buds | Galaxy Buds+ | Galaxy Buds Pro",

    "content": "Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra phone is great the hardware too. but the camera software needs to get better, for a phone that costs a lot for the camera capabilities i gotta say that it doesnt do the job, it had one job, THE CAMERA .\nthe numbers on paper are different than the reality, the low light performance of the camera is horrible, comparing it to my brothers 1 year old Huawei P30 Pro it doesnt come near its night mode, especially the focusing issue and the level of night mode as the P30 Pro has a F/1.6 Aperture Super Spectrum Sensor and the camera needs a lot of future updates and needs to get better especially the night mode and low light pics. Again, the phone is that expensive because of that huge camera on its back, so this huge camera better be good ... I think a larger sensor that can process enough light and more options in the night mode setting like the ISO option and shutter speed and AI  (Artificial Intelligence) option and the option to change the megapixel in the settings on night mode. My brothers P30 Pro has taken exceptional photos of the moon and stars. Please could your developers work on this to bring the loyal Samsung fans what we want and expect. I think Huawei uses a RYYB SENSOR PLUS and I think Samsung should use a better sensor for low light and night mode like a Sony one or a RYYB sensor plus. Could you introduce a Astrophotography mode on the camera (ASTRO MODE) for night time photography. The camera processing software needs really improving. Hope there will be more software updates.

I feel like many others in that it needs a major improvement and especially on night mode shots. and many feel that. Huawei use a SUPER SPECTRUM RYYB (RED YELLOW YELLOW BLUE) sensor/filter but needs to be processed much better than it is now for a major improvement so maybe Samsung should gp down the Huawei route. Also a Pixel enhancer and a Leica or Zeiss lenses for high quality like Huawei phones as they use Leica but feel Samsung NEED to up there game with regards to this as I am a loyal Samsung owner of many phones. There needs to major improvement with the sensor so will be on par with the Huawei phones like P30 and P40 PRO+ so we can all capture amazing shots in night mode and low light of the moon and stars etc. Please can you send the software updates if it can be done.  There is also a lot of noise in the picture processing which is a fault with the camera software Its an expensive phone so feel that we deserve a higher quality phone to stay at the top.

    "content": "All,\n  The purpose of this post is to understand whether anyone has been able to mitigate or successfully resolve any of these issues or if unresolvable technically, successfully resolved it through other means (given the return window has passed).\n  All these observed with the 1 May version (ATE3 baseband / ATE6 build, camera 10.0.03.10).\n- Autofocus issues, especially with objects closer than 30 cm, it can physically focus but misses focus most of the time. Results in a lot of shots being out of focus.\n- Generally poor focus even at distant objects (3m ish), even if face tracking identifies a face, half of pictures focus on the background.\n- Shutter lag is very noticeable\n- The above means that the ability to snap shot is limited and often results in out of focus pictures on a variety of subjects.\n  - Focusing in video is suffering from similar issues, have to constantly manually refocus. The focus transition is very sharp and often results in hunting. On a positive note, some of the autofocus glitches with hunting was a lot worse in previous versions and seems to have improved.\n- Poor focusing in low light, low light performance in general is not impressive, especially video.\n- Way too heavy NR on telelens, prefer noisy but high detail. I need to be able to turn this off, the preview looks better than the actual photo and you see when the heavy handed NR kicks in half a second later. \n- No RAW unless in pro mode\n- PRO mode doesn't support 108Mpx or tele lenses\n- SD card storage for 4k60fps, seems to be a hard coded option regardless of card speed, or is it the interface speed that limits?\n  The focusing issues are really a dealbreaker with this phone, so is not being able to shoot in pro mode with all cameras and having heavy NR forced on you on the telelens. For a flagship camera phone advertised for this purpose and at this price point I would say that this in aggregate is enough basis to claim that this phone does not work as advertised but I would be interested in hearing your experiences.\n     ",

    "content": "I updated my phone a couple of nights ago to One UI 3.1 and have been going through it to see what's changed and i have to say that it was a pointless update, i don't know why they bothered. Extra features that are so minuscule that most people are not going to notice, let alone care about, which makes me wonder if it was an excuse to implement the biggest change, the camera.\nSingle Take has more customisation, though its a feature i have only tried and not used.\nPhoto doesn't look like its changed.\nGone is the ability in the Settings to select the default Video Size/Aspect Ratio (UHD/HD etc.) and moved to the top ribbon on the camera where you can select which size you want much quicker.\nThat is where the good changes end.\nVideo size up to UHD is now only supported under 9:16 Aspect Ratio.\n1:1 defaults to 1440x1440 and FULL defaults to 2288x1080 and can't be changed, whereas before in the settings, you could shoot in any aspect ratio from HD to UHD at any frame rate at almost any video size/aspect ratio.\nThere is a distracting circle with a lock icon and a bar underneath constantly hovering on the screen, this allows you to change the brightness, the problem is, as soon as you touch the screen, if you are lucky enough for it disappear and it often doesn't, it reappears.\nAll of these downgrades are the same when using the front camera.\nBut, the biggest change? YOU CAN NO LONGER RECORD VIDEO WITH THE WIDEANGLE CAMERA. This option is gone. Sometimes you had to pinch the screen for the zoom options to show and you could select 0.5X, thus being able to switch between both cameras while recording or to record with the wide angle camera or it had 2 icons like in the Photo section to select. So now, as it stands, the Wide Angle Camera is nothing more than a hole on the back of the phone, except for photo.\nSame again in Pro-Mode Photo, all looks like before except one thing. You can no longer use the wide angle camera.\nPro-Mode Video, all the missing features above, again, gone from this option. No UHD on most Aspect Ratios and no ability to use wide angle camera.\nI can't remember if pro mode for photo and video could be used with the front camera but i know it can't after this update if it could before. They have added Portrait and Portrait Video under More, they don't seem to add anything that couldn't already to be done in Photo and Video mode and seems like a waste of human resources to me to add these features but ymmv.\nLittle did I know that when the description for the 3.1 update said that it had enhanced the Camera that what they really meant was they butchered it. Samsung have been pushing updates out quite fast and I have had no complaints but this one has not been thought through, I don't know if it was rushed out or if they have intentionally restricted the camera in the most petty way to try and encourage people to buy one of their newer phones but i would like to know their reasoning.\nIf you like One UI 3.0 and haven't downgraded yet, I would block this update. Gutted that you can't go back on updates. Now its back to using my trusted clip-on lenses because of these pathetic changes.",

The cameras on this phone are pretty great, why is the use of them so limited?\n  Here is a post from about a year ago that gives references to Samsung claiming they would release the SDK to enable 3rd party apps to take advantage of the other lenses:\n  https://eu.community.samsung.com/t5/galaxy-s10e-s10-s10-s10-5g/camera-pro-mode-60fps-amp-telephoto-i...\n  In a response (6 months later...), a Samsung representative says that Google released a new CDD (compatability definition document) which I am guessing was for Android 11. This has been out for almost 6 MONTHS, there should be nothing holding them back now from releasing it.\n  Is there any way a representative from Samsung could send a message to the relevant dev team like in the linked post and ask them again to release whatever data it takes to have full camera support in 3rd party apps?",

The image quality is on par with the Samsung Camera app in normal mode with the normal settings and in Night Sight with the XML file loaded, GCam crashes at 1.5 ms and 2.64 ms Night Sight Correction levels and at 2 ms, GCam doesn't finish the exposure process, so I have to restart GCam, taking a blurrier picture than the 1 ms image in the process.\n So if you're kind enough, please send me daytime and night mode XML files that fix the bugs and make GCam take excellent, vivid and sharp photos.",

    "content": "Smartphone users count on Galaxy devices to deliver a camera experience that\u2019s second to none. That\u2019s because Samsung Electronics packs each new addition to the Galaxy family with innovations that make it easier for users to capture more moments in exceptional detail.\n  The Galaxy S10 line builds on Samsung\u2019s camera leadership \u2013 which includes the company\u2019s game-changing Super Speed Dual Pixel and Dual Aperture technologies \u2013 by introducing a slew of exciting enhancements and even more advanced intelligence. Together, these innovations offer users all the tools they need to take truly epic shots and videos.\n  See More, Snap More\n  Each Galaxy S10 is like a professional-grade camera that fits in your pocket. The devices\u2019 easy-to-use cameras were designed to allow you to capture any shot and angle. So no matter what you\u2019re shooting, you\u2019ll always have the right lens for the job.\n  At 123-degrees, the rear camera\u2019s new 16MP Ultra Wide lens features a field of view that\u2019s similar to the human eye. It covers approximately 4.3 times more area than a 77-degree Wide-angle lens, and allows you to capture the world as you see it. Perfect for taking epic landscape shots, big panoramas (both horizontally and vertically), or simply fitting the entire family into a photo, the Ultra Wide lens ensures that you\u2019re always able to capture the full scene.\n  Pictures taken with Galaxy S10\u2019s Wide-angle (left) and Ultra Wide lens\nEach Galaxy S10\u2019s rear camera setup also includes a 12MP Wide-angle, Dual Aperture, Super Speed Dual Pixel lens. It combines an f/1.5-aperture lens with an f/2.4, and automatically adjusts to light just like our eyes to help users snap professional-looking photos, day or night. The Galaxy S10 and S10+\u2019s triple rear camera setup also includes a 12MP Telephoto (zoom) lens. For those times when you need to get a little closer to your subject, the Telephoto lens provides two times optical zoom and ten times digital zoom.\n  Each Galaxy S10 comes equipped with a 10MP UHD Dual Pixel front-facing camera that\u2019s perfect for taking high-quality selfies. The Galaxy S10+\u2019s dual front camera setup offers improved megapixels and super-fast autofocus, and includes an RGB depth lens for enhanced quality of bokeh effects.\n  A Smarter Way to Shoot\nThe Galaxy S10\u2019s hardware is complemented by a next-generation Neural Processing Unit (NPU) \u2013 a layer of intelligence for all your photos \u2013 that streamlines image processing and makes already smart features better.\n  The addition of the advanced NPU makes the camera\u2019s Scene Optimizer function that much more powerful. Now, Scene Optimizer is capable of analyzing even more complex scenes, and can simultaneously process more image recognition data than before. The camera recognizes up to 30 different types of scenes in all (up from 20 with the Galaxy Note9), including \u201cFace,\u201d \u201cBaby,\u201d \u201cDog,\u201d \u201cVehicles,\u201d and more. The function will also automatically optimize the color, saturation, white balance and contrast in order to ensure that the image you see on your screen appears as true to life as possible.\n  Pictures (right) taken with Scene Optimizer\n  When the camera recognizes specific scenes, it will also suggest other ways to potentially improve your photo. For example, if you\u2019re taking a picture of a sunrise, the camera will automatically ask you if you\u2019d like to switch to the Ultra Wide lens to ensure that you capture the scene in all its glory. If you\u2019re taking a picture in extreme low-light conditions, it will propose that you take a Bright Night Shot for a professional-quality picture.\n  The camera also offers users instant, automatic recommendations on how to best frame their photo through its Shot Suggestion feature. Utilizing a database of over 100 million pictures, Shot Suggestion\u2019s composition guide offers helpful tips to help you improve your photo\u2019s proportions, positioning and overall composition.\n    The camera\u2019s upgraded Live Focus mode allows you to customize your photos with artistic effects. The Galaxy S10+ utilizes its dual front cameras to support the feature, which includes options to add new spin bokeh, zoom bokeh, and color point effects, while the Galaxy S10 and S10e\u2019s front-facing camera utilizes the NPU\u2019s intelligence.\n  (From left) Live Focus\u2019s new spin bokeh, zoom bokeh and color point effects\nSilky Smooth Videos\nRecorded videos are so much smoother with the Galaxy S10, thanks to groundbreaking innovations that ensure that users\u2019 footage looks fantastic.\n  The camera\u2019s Super Steady video-recording feature is the first of its kind on a smartphone, and offers users up to three times better video stabilization than conventional technologies. Powered by anti-shake stabilization technology (VDIS), Super Steady evens out shaky footage, allowing you to record fluid video during even your most active moments. So whether you\u2019re dancing at a concert or recording a bumpy bike ride, with the Galaxy S10, the content you capture will be nice and steady.\n  Both the front and rear cameras are capable of recording pro-grade UHD footage, which allows users to step up their social game with true-to-life video quality. And in another smartphone first, the rear camera offers users the ability to take their recordings to the next level by capturing them in stunning HDR10+.\n  Utilizing dynamic tone mapping technology that provides 2.1 times broader color range than SDR, the Galaxy S10 allows you to take videos that are brighter and more dynamic than those taken with other smartphone cameras. That\u2019s because the camera uses tone mapping techniques to go frame-by-frame and optimize the color for every scene.\n  A New AR Emoji Experience\nSamsung\u2019s latest flagships offer users a brand new AR Emoji experience, highlighted by a revamped design, greater customization options, and the ability to track not just your face but also your eyes, tongue and body movements, including your arms and legs.\n  Samsung\u2019s Most Epic Cameras Yet\nIn addition to placing more fun and convenient features at users\u2019 fingertips, the Galaxy S10 line\u2019s powerful cameras allow you to capture moments in more detail \u2013 and with more lenses \u2013 than ever before.\n  The Galaxy S10 5G truly packs the power of a professional-grade camera into your phone by offering a total of six lenses \u2013 two on the front and four on the back. In addition to featuring all of the lenses included in the Galaxy S10+, the 5G model introduces Samsung\u2019s next-generation 3D Depth Camera.\n  This innovative camera allows the device to accurately capture depth by measuring the length of time it takes for an infrared light signal to bounce off the photograph\u2019s subject. The camera uses the resulting depth information to improve the quality of portrait-style images, and to power exciting new features like Video Live focus and Quick Measure. The former allows you to apply cinema-quality bokeh effects to recorded videos, while the latter enables you to use your phone to instantly measure distance, area or volume.\nhttps://news.samsung.com/global/",

    "title": "Hybrid smartphone concept. External photo sensor and interchangeable lenses",
    "content": "Hello darlings.\n  As a photographer for 3 years, I have been following the evolution of cell phone cameras and, one thing I realized, is that despite the post processing in today's cell phones have evolved a lot, the quality of the sensors has not evolved that much. Of course, they will say that today we have pixel binning technology. But if we take a raw photograph captured by a flagship 5 years ago and compare it with a raw capture from a current flagship, the differences will be very minor. So much so that if we take a RAW file from a Galaxy A71, F / 1.8 with a Samsung Bright S5KGW1 sensor and compare it to a Galaxy Note 10 Lite, F / 1.7 and with a Sony IMX333 sensor, which is an older, smaller model, and without the pixel binning, the photos with the Note 10 Lite will still be clearer and with less noise.\n  Each year, manufacturers squeeze insignificantly larger sensors into tiny spaces, in an attempt to capture better details in dimly lit environments, with a lower noise level and also to secure first place in the DXOMARK. Are you going to say it's not true? It is a real war between manufacturers to find out who wins the dispute for almost negligible improvements. So I ask myself: Why keep fighting for these tiny sensors and lenses, if we can elevate the photographic experience of cell phones to a professional level once and for all? Why not turn a cell phone into a mirrorless camera? This would be the perfect solution for both photographers, enthusiasts, and even the average user who is willing to invest a little more to shoot with professional quality, without having to carry heavy and bulky cameras.\n  I had been thinking about it for a long time. But only last year I decided to create a design of what a hybrid smartphone with bayonet and support for an external sensor like APS-C or even full frame could be. I sent the project to Samsung, but in my attempts to contact, the answers are always standardized, copy and paste. Samsung definitely doesn't value customers' opinions or ideas. So I updated the project again this year and I'm sharing it publicly here. I would be happy just to know that Samsung was interested. Or if interested customers themselves shared that idea with Samsung. Maybe one day this idea will reach their mobile engineering sector. I have no commercial or financial interest in this idea. I just ask you to keep the credits of the project. Project images below. Thank you!",

Yeah it is true that specifications show that the front camera is 16 MP , but nowhere is written that the camera has fixed focus to the few cetimeters and it cannot be changed anywhere!!!!. So when i take pictures my face is clear but the background is totally blurred (it might be useful as a filter....SOMETIMES!!!!...otherwise it is really useless!!!!) . So even using the selfie stick is not possible becuase the whole picture will be blurred and out of focus. Due to this the pictures made with the front camera are completely useless and the camera is useless as well. When I want to make clear picture with friends or a selfie with something interesting in the background I have to use other phone (then what was the point of buying this one??????!!!! for 400 Euros?!?!?!?!!!) or there is another option, and that is to use the rear camera to take selfie photos like in 2005 with my old nokia phone. (maybe i make 1 good picture out of 100 attempts......like really...only possible solution for now.....the front camera is really useless).\nSo I want to ask, if there is some magical way to change the focusing of the front camera with any update or at least if it can be solved in service centre after changing the whole lense (or something).

Also personally for me I don't know if it's the lenses themselves or because the lense are too big but I feel like instead of Samsung adding more cameras every year, they should improve their camera software quality specially the Camera Lag and the Video. Let's be honest, the images look amazing and the zoom looks fantastic but the video software in the camera is really bad and I hope that you can fix these issues. If not the S21 line up then I hope you fix the issue for the upcoming S22 ultra or Note 22 ultra because I really love Samsung and I really want damsung to improve in all of the aspects. It personally pains me to see youtubers making fun of Samsung specially the video quality and I hope that they could fix this. Also I hope that Samsung would cooperate with app companies to optimize the Camera software such as Snapchat, Instagram, Facebook, Twitter etc. Because it also really lacks im these areas. \n Thanks",

I'm about ready to give up on the S21 Ultra, and return it for an iphone pro max if these camera issues continue. Every photo that has any movement comes out blurry. The auto focus never stays focused on the moving object, burst mode is blurry and out of focus itself. Yes, the lenses are clean, software is updated, plastic removed, restarted camera, cleared cache/ data, tried safe mode, etc etc. If there's no motion the photos are fine but a hint of motion and the focus and detail absolutely suck. The auto focus tracking does not keep pets or kids in focus. Out of maybe 200 burst shots I'll get 1 or 2 that aren't completely blurry. The single shot that's supposed to let you select what kind of photos/ videos it captures doesn't work. It completely ignores what you don't want to capture, and then out of many good options in 15s it selects around 5-10 of the worst possible moments and adds ridiculous filters to it that I specifically removed as an option but it still does anyways. At this point it seems impossible to take any clear, detailed photos where movement is involved on the S21 Ultra. Please show me its possible and what you did to capture them. ",

I am a Samsung user for 10 years and I love the fact that they include a pro mode on their camera app.  But the more I use it, the more I realize that I cannot use all its functions on Pro Mode using the touchscreen while either using a gymbal or holding the phone to shoot videos in pro mode. So my idea will be either come up with a remote control to control the ISO, the focus, or the shutter speed or a gymbal to take advantage of the main camera features. If I buy a DJI gimbal or any other third party gimbal I cannot control all its functions using the Samsung camera app. It come with its own camera app which I cannot use to the phone's full potential. From changing to different lenses like wide angle to focus or even most apps can't I shoot at 60 frames. I also like to shoot 120 frames in pro mode to slow down footage in post production which most cameras these days from third party does not support. I wish Samsung would make a gimbal specifically for our phones to take advantage of it's  features in pro mode. It will bring more professional photographers using Samsung phones.  It is very hard to use a cage rig or just using the phone Pro Mode and touching the screen to swipe up and down to focus or change the iso etc. ",
