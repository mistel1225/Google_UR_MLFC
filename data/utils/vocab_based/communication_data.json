    "content": "I have an ongoing issue with callers to my number not hearing a ringing sound i.e. they hear complete silence until I answer or it goes to voicemail. This has only been an issue with the Pixel 4a as far as I'm aware and was brought to my attention a couple of months ago (unsure if it's been a problem the whole 7 months I've had the phone as I obviously can't tell from my end).\n\nThe strange part is it's only happening with certain callers. All of my frequent callers (e.g. family members) hear a dial/ring tone. If I test from my desk landline I hear no ringing sound, and have had this issue confirmed by several others including my carrier.\n\nI've tried troubleshooting with the carrier (including SIM replacement which has not solved the issue) and have an open case with them but I am wondering if this is a known issue and any possible solutions?\n\nTo be very clear - the phone rings at my end and I am able to answer the call as normal. The problem is callers are always surprised when I answer because they haven't heard any ringing sound.\n\nDevice is up to date with Android 11 as of 5 June 2021.\n\nThanks,",

When I click on the voicemail and finish listening to my message I will try to click call from within the VM app, well it gives an error about international calls. So I have to edit the number and remove the + symbol from the beginning before I can call the number. I tried clearing the app cache and I uninstalled the latest update for the phone app. Rebooted and it worked and looked correct until I rebooted and it's back to the same old thing. And could never get it working again.I have cricket as my provider. Could it be an issue with them? The cricket voicemail app works fine but I like the Google one better I want to use it if possible. Oh and the 606-336 number is a local number so why does it keep putting a + in front of it and has a space between the numbers?",

    "content": "This is increasingly discouraging. It just blares in my ear every time I use it and impinges on other people in the room.\n\nI used to be able to turn the sound off by turning down Media Volume, though that was also frustrating since then I had to turn it back up whenever I wanted to listen to music or podcasts.\n\nNow it is even worse. I can only turn it off when I press Do Not Disturb. If I forget to turn it back on after using voice to text, I miss phone calls, texts, everything. I use voice to text throughout the day so whenever I'm writing something, my phone is effectively off.\n\nPlease, please can't we just turn down this sound?!\n\n(This was addressed on an earlier post. The answer was to turn off Switch Access. I never had Switch Access on in the first place, so this hasn't helped:  \n\"How do I mute the ding ding sound when you hit the voice to text button at the top right\" https://support.google.com/assistant/thread/31523011/how-do-i-mute-the-ding-ding-sound-when-you-hit-the-voice-to-text-button-at-the-top-right?hl=en )\n(This issue has also been addressed on other websites and on Reddit.

From this no notifications are showing either.\n\nSecondly, the phone is showing as having signal but with a cross within. It can make calls but can only send and receive WhatsApp when on WiFi. If I go into settings to switch on mobile data the toggle moves straight back to off. I have also tried resetting the connection settings but this hasn't made any difference. I have also tried the sim card in my pixel 5 (which is linked to my own google account) and there were no signal issues.\n\nThirdly, it doesn\u2019t look like google has backed up/synced since the issue started a couple of days back but can sign in to google from a third party device (to rule out someone else changing password etc).\n\nLastly emails seem to be patchy in sending and receiving but guess is linked to the signal issue above.\n\nI\u2019ve restarted the 4a in safe mode but this doesn\u2019t make any difference. Is a factory reset the only option or is there some kind of hardware fault at play here? Ideally looking to avoid a factory reset given the pain of setting up apps etc and losing the last couple of days\u2019 of pics etc.\n\nThanks in advance \nGethyn",

    "title": "Roaming data exhausted phone won't send texts",
    "content": "I visit family and friends in a part of the US where my phone service coverage allows roaming data but that amount expires in about 24 to 48 hours. Because I visit them in a very wooded part of the country, my service only works when I'm in town around stores and businesses. The minute I'm driving between these little towns I have no coverage at all so letting people know I'm on my way or have been in an accident is a total crapshoot and is contingent on whether or not I happen to be close to a cell tower.\n\nWhat's worse is when I'm at the place I'm staying, my ability to send and receive messages is also a crapshoot, especially with group texts. Now I've been having this issue for years and every time I'm up here I'll visit the community boards to try to figure out how can I fix this basic communication issue. Believe me I've read so many replies from the last 5 years of related topics and must have tried them all with little success. And usually I just give up and just use the land line.\n\nThis time around though I've found a workaround that seems to be a clumsily perfect solution and what I want to ask the community, is if any one else has had this issue, what they've done, and is this something that will be different with the Pixel 6 phone. And if you have had this issue, I'm offering my solution.\n\nAt home base I have my phone set to recognize the wifi here to nake and receive calls. It works for calls but not for texts or pictures. I've tried clearing up storage, clearing cache, switching between mobile data, tuning off the phone, nothing worked. Some times I'll send a text and never get a response. Other times I'll be sent a text that may take a while to get to me. What seems to happen is that the messages are sent to cell towers and because my roaming data is exhausted, that protocol prevents those texts from ever landing. One time I received a text that had been bouncing around the cell phone towers for close to 2 years. And I got that message when I was 350 miles away from where it was sent.\n\nMy workaround is this. When I'm at a house -or business that has WiFi, turn off mobile data altogether and turn on airplane mode. Connect to the local WiFi and use that exclusively. When I have to leave that comfort zone I turn off airplane mode and return to open WiFi and turn mobile data back on to get calls and directional data. So in other words if I can restrict all of my data to go through a local WiFi source exclusively, everything work fine. I just have to go into Lisa Douglas mode ala Green Acres to get it to work.",

When switching from \"silent\" to \"ring\", all vibration settings are cleared and all three sliders are maximized.\nIt's very unfortunate when the user prefers to tone down (or disable) haptics, as switching profiles brings them back every time, at full force.\n\nA friend of mine was able to reproduce the problem on a Pixel 4a, running Android 12 beta 1. The Pixel 4a shows toggles in place of sliders, but the effect is the same.\n\nMy Pixel 5 is ~2 Days old, it's up to date as of the time of writing (Android 11).\n\nvideo on youtube",

Google phone displays the account selection dialog to choose an account however the two SIP accounts I have added both report \"No signal\" one account is with a big name SIP carrier provider and the other is my own personally built dedicated cloud server with full gigabit band with and absolutely not restrictions or blocks of any kind. There is absolutely no reason for any kind of connection issues to be reported. Incoming calls work just fine! I have configured these servers onto my freshly and pristine installation of android OS as well as many previous attempts on other phones and have had this issue as well as many other issues trying to use my SIP services on my phone. This problem has been an issue for every company that I know of that uses SIP as well as my own personal experience. When is google going to show this problem some attention? How can I disable google phone from pre-checking signal status or quality prior to allowing the use of sip carriers for phone calls?\n\nIf you search for \"sip calling\" in any of google's help fourums you will not find an single post, not 1 with a solution. Who cares what android touts as \"features\" on their phones if they don't work. Same applies for android device policies, it's all BS. I'm going to recommend iPhone at any of my clients from now on. They don't ignore issues like this for this long. If you're going to have the feature then fix it! if not, stop BSing and take it off so people know Android doesn't support SIP.",

I know the phone isn't broken because it receives calls and an alarm rang, but eve touch screen doesn't work.\nI tried every link to contact support but everyone seem a loop hole to bring you back to one another and i now this is supposed to get people to solve issues by themselves but it made it impossible to really get in contact. I even got to this page https://store.google.com/repair where i put my IMEI number but the links to contact support just redirect you to self help pages.",

Clicking the power button creates a small vibration but nothing else happens.\nAfter a while the phone suddenly start working again (sometimes it looks like it was restarted - widgets are loading, etc. - but sometimes its just going back to normal as if nothing happened).\nI tried everything I thought of to solve it - my OS is updated, restarting and shutting down didn't help, it happened also in safe mode so an app is not the cause. \nWould really appreciate any help to understand the cause and how to solve this \ud83d\ude4f",

To make things worse, whenever this happens, the ringtone plays not at whatever volume to which it's currently set, but full, sure to wake up everyone in the house, maximum volume.  I've searched all over and can't find a setting to change this.

The upper microphone is working, I recorded a video with sound using the Camera application Google Camera.\nI have already tried updating my Android phone to the latest version and even reset it to factory settings. Nothing helped! Where should I go with such a problem? I'm abroad at the moment\nWaiting for your response",

    "content": "For about the last 2 weeks, I have been getting an error on the Voicemail page saying Visual Voicemail cannot load because of a poor mobile connection.  But what's more troubling is that the phone tells me I have voicemails, but when I click on them it says \"Loading Voicemail...\" and eventually changes to \"Couldn't load voicemail\".  I see old posts about similar errors but nothing recent.  I did get live support last week, and the rep told me to clear the cache, which solved the problem for about an hour.  But it came right back again and has been busted ever since then.  Please suggest some ideas to fix this.  \n\nThanks,\n\nGeoff",

Pretty straightforward. \nExcept that it doesn't work on my phone :(  the intercom will call my phone, and I can answer the call, but when I press \"9\" it won't unlock the front door. The Apartment Manager isn't sure what's wrong because this has never been an issue for him in the 5 years he's worked here. I have the VoLTE disabled on my phone and it still doesn't work. No 5G on my phone... I'm not using 3G or 2G either....I really am at a loss as to why this isn't working. Would someone be able to help me out?",

Nevertheless, LTE signal gets stronger (almost 5 bars) as soon as I drive a few hundred meters from the place. The problem is that although i am able getting mobile data while driving (listening to Internet radio), I am unable making voice calls. The number appears as if the phone is trying to connect, but after 10 or 15 seconds, the call drops without ever being connected. I tried rebooting the phone several times, I turned airplane mode on and off, but without success. I even tried removing and reinserting the sim card, but no luck. I was eventually able making calls again after driving 20 minutes away from the place (last week it took about 30 minutes).\nThe other weird thing is that while I am on the highway and on a call, I see the 'x' symbol appearing again, although I am right in the middle of a call.\n\nI thought it might be a network issue, but i really looks like it's the phone. \n\nWhat should I do?",

    "content": "Hi, I've got a Pixel 4a 5g and my friend has a Pixel 4a, both bought in December last year. Everything was perfect untill maybe around February we bith noticed a bug on our Pixels.  Sometimes when someone calls me it's name doesn't show up right away as it should, it takes a good few seconds to show. This happens on the lock screen and on the mini-menu that shows when you're being called while in an app.\nDoes anyone experienced this? I tried disabled all sort of features under Settings but to no avail. I have a single eSIM, my friend has a eSIM + a classic SIM. It does it even with contacts that are marked as favorites in the Contacts app.\nThis is extremely annoying and it absolutely ruins the Pixel experience. I posted this issue on Reddit and it seems other users are having it too, but no known fix.\n\nHow do I fix this?",

I often miss calls and I don't see them until a day later because for some odd reason Google decided it's more important to see missed texts while it buries missed phone calls all the way at the bottom where you must swipe up for a while to see it. I want to change that. I also have to do a lot to see what the text said. It's a very ineffecient notifications system to me and it drives me bonkers daily. It makes me not want to communicate. Anyway to change the order things show up or how much of messages you can see? Or the decrease the amount of scrolling needed to see all notifications",

If i tap on the number to call it, then suddenly the name of the contact appears. \nI have tried to clear the the app storage (cache etc.)\nWe are using Android for Work since some years  with different devices, and no other device has this issue, so it looks like it is a pixel issue. \n\nPlease help me - i really like the Pixel 5, but i can not buy it, if this is not working...\n\nThanks in advance!",

    "content": "I'm having connection issues with T-Mobile and a brand new Pixel 4a 5G.  I recently received the phone and this past weekend set it up (Saturday April 3rd).  The phone worked fine until sometime around Tuesday April 6th, where it only connected to Wifi calling and had intermittent connection to the T-Mobile network (texts had trouble getting in and out and there was no way of making calls using the cellular network.\n\nI took the phone to a T-Mobile store, where they tried different things, all ending with the same issues:  the phone connects for a minute or two (here I can get some texts coming in), but it disconnects from the network.  The SIM Card was changed in the store for a brand new one (no charge).  They also reset the network settings to no avail.  The last thing they told me to try was a factory reset, which once I got home.\n\nI tested the new SIM Card in the old phone, and it works fine.  I did a factory reset of the phone, checked for updates (got the April 5, 2021 update), put the SIM card back into the Pixel 4a 5g, but the problem persists.  I called T-Mobile again and they told me to contact the manufacturer (Google) for the warranty and/or to try other alternatives with the phone.\n\nThe phone is brand new (less than one month old) and I have no idea what might be the problem.  Among the things that have been tried:\nReset network settings\nFactory reset\nmanually connect to cell network (disabled automatic connect to network and I have seen at least 7 different t-mobile networks in different places, but cannot connect to any of them)\nchange preferred network type (tried all, restarted phone, no connection)\ndisabled wifi calling\n\nAny help will be appreciated.  If the phone is defective, I would appreciate an exchange.",

Couple weeks ago I encountered the following problem: I can't hear any sound when on the call except when I turn the speaker on. My counterpart can hear me fine. The same issue seems to be happening with any other messenger (e.g. WhatsApp).\n\n- Boot in safe mode, this helps so the problem should be in one of the apps. I uninstalled all the recent apps, doesn't help\n- Removed permissions to access \"Phone\" from all the apps (except for the system ones from which I cannot remove it). Didn't help.\n- Reboot helps but just for some time. Several hours later the problem is back. So the \"internal speaker\" itself seems to be ok.\n- Not related to bedtime / do not disturb as I turned it off.\n\nSo far very disappointed. All the same apps were working fine on my Pixel 3.\n\nHas anyone experienced anything similar?",

Any suggestions? Since I bought it over the Internet and there are not official Google stores in my country, warranty option is out. Should I get it fixed? Or better replace it with something newer?",

I wonder if others have had similar experiences, and if they have figured out what's going on?\n\nThe biggest issue I have is my 4a's poor choices of wireless connections. I am constantly having to manually tell it to connect to WiFi, or to a better cell tower than the one it has chosen. For example, it will set up an almost uselessly slow \"Edge\" connection with a sprint tower 3 km away instead of an LTE connection with a T-Mobile tower that is 800 m away, and I have to force it to switch (*#*#34866#*#*) before I can send or receive data. Or it won't find and connect to the closest WiFi access point in my home without me telling it which one to connect to.\n\nOther frustrations I didn't have with the Pixel 2 (I realize some of these might be software problems related to newer Android versions):\n\n1/2 hour from text to notification of text\nblanks where texts should be at the bottom of a conversation in Messenger; I have to leave the conversation and return to it to see the texts\ntext to speech ignores punctuation sometimes, sometimes inserts \"{question mark}\" instead of \"?\" often doesn't capitalize proper nouns or days of week or months.\ntext to speech word recognition doesn't work as well as on my Pixel 2\nGoogle Assistant:\nIt often takes two tries, sometimes three, to get the google assistant to wake up with \"OK Google\"\nThe GA sometimes just drops requests after transcribing them correctly\nThe GA sometimes confirms audibly a request like \"set a timer for one hour,\" sometimes it doesn't, even though it does set the timer.\nThe GA sometimes tells me the weather report when I request it, sometimes just pulls up a page with the weather report and refuses to read it.\nThe timer sometimes goes past the set time (by 5+ minutes) without actually ringing.\nPoor sound quality on recipient's end of calls when calls go over WiFi.",

    "content": "Hi everyone, \n\nI am a bit desperate and need help. I am not even able to contact Google Directly (never fond any chat button ou contact option like mentioned on the Google Pixel Support pages). \n\nI bought a Pixel 5 on a well known Belgian retailer called Fnac on November. Since beginning of January, I have got at once loudspeakerss issues : sound was completely unclear and very low. Putting phone calls on loudspeaker made it unable to hear anything. I have tried several things by my self but nothing could solve the problem. \n\nI than decided to send back the phone to the retailer under warranty. \n\nTwo months later, I received a note from the retailer saying that Google refused to repair because there is a little scratch on the back camera protection window. (I can send a picture of it, it's ridiculously small and insignificant). The retailer ask me 418\u20ac to replace my phone by a new one. Off course, this is not even legal as European and Belgian laws and regulations in that case force retailer to prove that the problem finds its origin in a wrong usage which they never did. In fact, I got even the confirmation that they never opened the phone or made any kind of diagnosis. \n\nSince then, I desperatly try to contest their position without success. In brief, I have a unasable phone that I paid 600\u20ac and could properly used for just a month and no other proposal from the retailer. \n\nCould someone help me with this issue, send it to Google or show me the way to get in touch with Google in order to introduce an official claim about this ?\n\nThank you in advance. \n\nKind regards, \n\nArnaud Helinck\n+32 491 15 85 51\narnaud.helinck@gmail.com",

    "content": "I have owned both a Google Pixel 2 XL and now a 4 XL for the last three years, but in that time frame Google has replaced my phone 13 times. I have been waiting for the latest replacement for the last two weeks now. \nOver a week ago when the replacement was mailed I noticed it wasn't expedited like promised and instead was sent through UPS standard delivery. I called to point this out and the agent decided it was best to contact UPS and have my device pulled from the truck and held at the distribution warehouse. Numerous calls later I finally ended up on a tier 2 person's desk and they have been telling me all week to just wait. Well at this point the device is increasingly late, and UPS has told me not to expect the delivery until atleast next week. \n\nHow can I speed up this process?\nHow do I get a hold of anyone that can actually help me?\nHow do I get retribution for them delaying the package themself?\nHow do I get actual Pixel support and receive a new phone instead of the spree of broken ones I've received? The last phone I received was cracked upon receipt.\nHow do I get a hold of someone from Google in North America, preferably Canada?",

    "title": "Pixel 2 screen is blank but phone appears to be on",
    "content": "My phone was operating normally today, but when I went to check it at some point, I found the screen stopped working. It appeared to attempt to turn on, where I would see a flicker of a patch of faint light blue horizontal lines in the lower half of the screen, but nothing more.\n\nIt appears the phone is still operational in some form, as:\nThe normal chime and vibration occurs when plugging in the phone.\nTapping the power button, swiping up from the bottom of the screen, and performing my usual unlock method (drawing a pattern of lines across the dot grid), I can feel the usual vibrations I associate with this action.  This doesn't seem to work consistently but that may just be due to mistakes I'm making from the screen being blank.  I'm sure I've been successful at least some of the time though, as the \"feeling\" of the grid caused by phone vibrations has disappeared after I've done my usual pattern.\nDouble-tapping the power button makes the usual vibration of the camera turning on, and tapping the portion of the screen where the shutter icon would be makes the camera sound effect and even activates the flash (which I had left on from the last time I took a photo).\nWhile the camera is open (thus the phone is definitely active), holding down the power + volume down buttons triggers the screenshot sound effect as expected.\nPlugging the phone into my computer usually makes the device appear in My Computer\n\nHowever, despite all of the above, when I attempt to call the phone, it goes straight to voicemail, as if the device is turned off.  I'm also unsure if something weird is happening with the power button, since there's been several points where I'm SURE I've held it down long enough to force a shut down, then later I discover that opening the camera/attempting to unlock still works.\n\nA lot of the screen troubleshooting advice on Google's help pages has been unhelpful, as the advice seems to consider the issue of a blank screen and an unresponsive touch screen to be interchangable for some reason (and sometimes even points you towards other articles that assume the screen is working).\n\nMy main concern here is whether I can get my files off of this thing in any way.  The fact that my computer recognises it but I can't access my files without a screen to activate USB file transfer is very frustrating - so near yet so far. If I order a USB to HDMI converter to display the pixel on another monitor, will plug n' play just work for that? Google help pages suggest that like USB file transfer, I'll need to activate permission to cast the screen to another device - which I can't do without a working screen!\n\nIt's an old phone now so I accept these things aren't built to last anymore and it's time to get a new one. With that in mind, returning to factory settings isn't an option (even if I'm able to with my limited input to the device).  My goal is just to get my files off.\n\nSo, key questions:\nCan the pixel 2 cast to another monitor simply by plugging it in?\nAre there any other options for getting files off of a device without a visible screen?\nIf all else fails:\nCould someone provide screenshots of the step by step process of opening the USB notification and allowing USB file transfer?  I might be able to navigate my way there blind with screenshot reference, but most how-to videos I've found go the long way through the phone's settings menus (and I can't even remember what location of the screen my Settings icon was on).",

When I dial anyone, the call drops immediately. At that time, no one can reach me either. All incoming calls get routed to voicemail & the phone doesn't show notifications for the new voicemails either. \n\nToggling Airplane mode doesn't fix the issue, but rebooting the phone fixes the issue. The issue appears again in around a week's time. The biggest problem is I do not know when the issue starts, and miss multiple calls. I realize the issue has started only when I make a call. \n\nThe issue is exactly the same issue reported for Pixel 5 in the below thread. There is a response that a fix will be rolling out next week. Can you please confirm if the fix will be rolled out to Pixel 4a as well? \n\nhttps://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/81013955?hl=en&msgid=84081837",

Google then kindly switched the phone.\nProblem repeated itself.\n\nDo not Disturb is not (officially) on.\n\nI have tested the phone by phoning from a selection of other phones. None of the numbers are set to Divert to Voicemail. First call from each number goes to voicemail (If they leave message I get a notification). If they do not leave a message I have no idea they have called.\n\nI have gone into phone app, clicked 3 dots, gone to calls and calling accounts and ensure \"receiving incoming calls\" is on.\n\nI wonder if an error was backing up to the replacement phone  (thus potentially introducing the error back to this new/refurbished phone?).\n\nI only have three Blocked numbers on the phone. none are the ones I was calling from (to test it).\n\nMy call forwarding options are showing as follows:\nalways forward: off\nfwd to voicemail when.....busy, unanswered, unreachable. \n\nThis morning I did a reset of network & app settings . There was no visible benefit to doing this. \n\nMy wife uses the same network as me (albeit on an apple phoen0 and has no reception issues).\n\nThe original Pixel3a worked perfectly for about 9 months before suddenly \"getting invisibly stuck on Do not Disturb\"). This replacement only arrived a couple of days ago but has same problem. \n\nOne suggestion I have read on another forum (another user had similar problem) is that maybe a third party app is causing the problem. But where would I start tracking this down?\n\nMy next action was going to be to launch in Safe mode to see if that allows phone to ring. (is this a logical test?)\n\nFantatstic phone until it stopped ringing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! \n\nThank you for reading this.",

Verizon tried 6 different SIM cards and spent 4 hours trying to program phone I bought at Spectrum. Spectrum made me pay for phone ($640) and advised phone was Sim card unlocked. Had to buy another Pixel 5 through Verizon. What do I do with new Pixel 5 phone from Spectrum?  Spectrum advises phone is not locked, yet when we put Spectrum SIM card back in phone it works. What type of guarantee do I have from Google or Spectrum? Can't seem to get a straight answer?",

    "content": "I really need some URGENT help with the setting up of both Nano & ESIM. Today I found that I have no internet - (mobile network- Optus). I submitted a report, there were no faults or interruptions, I should have it. I have way-enough data. Maybe the phone now, no longer uses my old SIM from old phone, with Optus? So I need to get it sorted ASAP. Also need to recharge phone tonight on a 5G Postpaid plan. Here goes, I hope you can help me;\n\nI've inserted and setup my old SIM card (Nano), mainly so I could get all my contacts & info on the new phone. I used the Google site for that. I believe now those contacts - phone numbers, are all in my Google Account (I've checked). Now though it wants me to setup my E-SIM, why?  What will that do?  \nI have left it for a while (been busy) and now I've had reminders saying \"finish the E-SIM setup in five days or as soon as you complete the setup, you will no longer be able to use your old SIM\".\n \nProblems: When I go out and place my mobile network on, I can not connect to 5G, it just flicks straight to 4G. Yes, I have coverage. Yes, 5G is selected. Reading about it I apparently I have to start turning off one of the SIMS in order to connect 5G. Which one?  It said to select the one that DOESN'T USE DATA??   What do they mean, exactly, by data?  I need someone to explain that to me. \nI'm supposed to choose preferences;  \nA) Select SIM - calls, texts - in this DSDS settings, which I temporarily switch off the SIM that DOESN'T use data (in network & internet - mobile network, settings) \n-  Which one do I switch off?   The NANO?\nB) Select the SIM that will use data  The E-SIM?\nC) Select a Default? How do I know?  When will it go back to the default?\n-  Can I just remove the NANO SIM card? (since my contacts & phone numbers are in my Google    account) and just finish setting up the E-SIM, and use the E-SIM alone?  \n  Solve a lot of problems, I won't have to keep turning off SIMS!\nD) What exactly happens when I finish the E-SIM setup,  Is it going to upload information on it?\n\nWhen out & about, using my mobile network, I will need to do the following; \n1) Make and receive calls and texts\n2) Use Google Maps, Internet Searching.\n3) Use Apps, like ANZ banking, SafeWA, MyOptus- for recharges, Google Play Store (occasionally, if I HAVE to install a App when I'm out), Camera & Google Photos (when viewing)\n4) To connect to 5G (just with E-SIM), when I'm out on mobile network and I need more speed, while also being able to do the above. \n\nAt home I will need to do (I have WIFI with Telstra);\n1) Watch YouTube\n2) Connect to 5G at home when using WIFI. Can I do this? Or is it, WIFI or 5G, not both.\n3) Install most Apps.\n4) Download occasional files.\n\nCan I do all of the above using only the E-SIM?\n\n* I have a Laptop (on WIFI) at home where I use Gmail, Facebook, Netflix. All documents, downloads are done here and not on the phone.\nhere, not on my phone.\n\nThanks to anyone that can help me with this stuff.",

    "content": "Ok, for a year now I've been messing with trying second line apps to send/receive calls and I'm always having issues with call quality.  About a half a year ago, I figured saving $100 wasn't worth loosing my job due to unreliable communication, so I added another phone and line to my Verizon account.  That, if course, worked great.  But my bill was getting insane.  I had some months of our bill approaching $600!  So, I started dropping lines to get it down.  I'm thinking $100 is a lot just so I can have two phones to separate calls.  So, I just switched my samsung note 20 for a google pixel 4.  Think I already like pixel better.  Think I'm a pixel guy now.  But, the pixel has the option when people call you that it will prompt the caller to state who's calling and why.  Perfect, now I don't need to answer calls after hours work related.  But, I can't have that feature on between 8-5.  Is there any quick toggle or, better yet, a way to schedule that feature to turn on and off like a scheduled sound profile?",

    "content": "I have my Pixel 5 setup to recognize my headset as a trusted device and keep my phone unlocked when it's on, but here's the thing... i'm driving... my phone is in my pocket... I need to make a call for whatever reason so I put on my headset and try to call and it tells me it can't until I unlock my phone (unless I am doing a redial... that seems to work), which means I have to physically pull my phone out of my pocket and unlock it, while driving, to make a \"hands-free\" call. Why does connecting it to the headset not go ahead and unlock it, if it is a trusted device... or at least unlock it to make a phone call? Is there any workaround for this other than making the phone pretty much unlocked all of the time, which obviously creates other issues?",

I'm consistently getting 5+ hours SOT on my almost two years old pixel 3. The UI is being polished continuously, removing glitches and bugs with every update.\n\nIn addition to the praise, I would like to point out:\n\n- wake screen when notification arrives is too short. Either make it slightly longer by default, or add an option to tweak it in settings;\n- wake screen when notification arrives while screen is in the pocket or face down should be altered to wake screen only when removed/flipped;\n- please, please make them both speakers fire upon incoming calls, or add an option to the settings, this request has been around for quite a while.\n\nThanks for all your work!",

She claims that she doesn't need that DND functionality on her phone and was wondering if there's a way to disable to the option completely?

When a headphone is plugged in, it works for videos played and audio songs. But when a call comes (physical sim, esim won't work with headphones) it goes to loudspeaker mode. Of you try to unplug and plug-in, we get the call audio for a second and then back to loud speaker\n\n2. When a headphone is plugged in, Esim won't work for calls. It will show the signal and the internet will work. When I have a headphone plugged in and someone tries to call me, they will get an out of coverage area message. If I try to make a call from esim that time, it just drops. Feels like Volte is getting affected at that time.\n Also when a headphone is plugged in, the phone shows a TTY symbol. Is this supposed to be that way?",

I went ahead and purchased a 4XLthrough Google, and had it activated on my Sprint network. I've never had the voicemail tab in my phone app, and there's nothing in settings I'll let me activate it. If I go to settings, and I tap where it says voicemail, the only thing it lets me change is the phone number in which voicemails are coming from. \nI've seen sources say that Sprint has restricted this feature inside the phone so I can use their own app that charges me a fee for the visual voicemail feature. I don't understand how that could be the case whereas my parents who are on the same plan have iPhones, and yet they don't have to do that. Is there a way I can get my voicemail tab back, or is there something here I'm not understanding?",

I can get the call or the message, but the screen doesn't turn on and there's no sound coming to notify me, even if the call/notification is from a starred contact and the phone is set to allow calls/notifications from those contacts.\n\nThis happenes only on the child account, on the adult account it works as it should.\n\nAny ideas?",

    "content": "I have a Pixel 3A XL purchased in the US. I now live in South Korea, so I bought a SIM card from KT. For the last 5 months it has worked perfectly as I wanted it to. I can do SMS messaging, I can do regular calls to local numbers, I can browse the internet with LTE, connects to Wi-Fi fine, etc. Now suddenly I can't call. I cannot receive or make any phone calls. Sometimes the icon at the top of the phone shows that there is no network available (little x) sometimes it shows there is a network. I can still send and receive SMS messages, and use data through LTE normally. I just can't call.\n\nI of course have tried restarting multiple times. I took the SIM card out and put it back in. I went to the KT desk and they said that \"pixel phones are not compatible with Korean networks so you can't call\". But that can't be true, I've been using it for 5 months. I haven't seen this problem on the internet yet. I've been reading about the LTE data issue, but my data works fine.",

On speakerphone, 4/5 times it worked. With the phone's headphones in, 1/2 times it worked. But never just on normal call setting. \n\nLet me emphatically say: I have tried everything suggested: deleting apps, checking for updates, soft reset, and I did a factory reset. After the factory reset and another soft reset cycle, the problem persisted, as did the inconsistent success with headphones or speakerphones. Aside from literally taking this bitch apart- does anyone have any insight or suggestions as to what I should do next?",

If I place a call the phone will show the number dialing but I hear nothing, see none of the buttons either and only can see the hangup button.  I'm not sure what is going on but I cleared cache and then deleted files for the phone and that worked for 1/2 a day and now we are back to the same.  I also seem to have the issue with picking up a call about half of the time as well.  \n\nAny suggestions?  Photo attached.",

C properly displays its name. I created test contacts for 3 names with the other fields matching. Works fine. \nJust before posting this, I thought about those other fields. A and B have the same info in all fields. But C does not. I added the other fields to C and everything works perfectly. Then I removed those fields and again everything works perfectly. Very strange.\nFinally, my questions are:  Is there anything I might have done wrong in entering the contacts?  And if it happens again, is there a more direct way of correcting such a problem beyond guessing which parts were the problem?  Or is this 'simply' a bug?",

    "title": "Set Important Contacts to always RING your phone even if device set to vibrate",
    "content": "My girlfriend is literally going to force me to get an iPhone since Pixel 3 doesn't have this feature...\n\nOn iPhone, there is a setting to make it so that when select contacts call you, the phone ALWAYS rings on loud. Even if the device is set to \"vibrate\" \"silent\" \"do not disturb\" or \"low volume.\"\n\nOn Pixel 3, there is only the option to make it so that if your phone is on \"do not disturb\" your Favorite contacts calling will still make the phone ring. Useful for if you're going to sleep maybe, or in a meeting.\n\nHOWEVER, very often I leave my phone on vibrate or low volume. Sometimes though, you miss a call when you don't feel it vibrating, or its laying on a desk where the vibration can't be felt and you're away from table. Or being on a low volume can be too low for you to hear phone if you're somewhere noisy. Even if most of the time (like 80-90% you catch the call, there's 10-20% of time where you miss it because it wasn't ringing on loud when a particular person, ie: girlfriend, called).\n\nThis means that occasionally, I miss calls from my girlfriend, and she gets pissed. I'd imagine a good number of other girlfriends/wives may also face this issue of not having their calls to their men sound a loud alert so guys never miss the call...\n\niPhone has this \"girlfriend/wife mode\" feature, please replicate it on Pixel. Otherwise I can't get Pixel 4 and have to switch to an iPhone...\n\nI already checked app store for an app to do this. There doesn't seem to be anything and I think new Android software blocks these types of app's permissions.",

I know there's settings for the phone, and then more hidden settings within each app, and I've turned off notifications for all of them.

    "content": "No, I don't have the problem of the \"stuck pixel\" or \"blinking pixel\" -- mine is the opposite where my screen does not turn off on a call, while listening to a WhatsApp voice message, etc. I downloaded sensor apps and can confirm that nothing happens when I place my hand over the sensor (located at the top-middle of the screen). \n\nAll the apps do show that my Pixel 5 has a proximity sensor, but it's always stuck at 5.0 cm. If I disable all sensors via the Sensors Off tile from Developer options, it does turn off the proximity sensor. \n\nSo based on that I was hoping it's a software issue. I went to Safe Mode but no cigar. I even did a factory reset (twice) and still no cigar.\n\nSafe to say it's a hardware problem? I am hoping for a slim chance that someone may have had the same issue and was able to resolve it. I live in a country where Pixels are not sold -- got it shipped to me by a friend. So any returns for repair or RMA would be a pain and expensive.\n\nI could live with it -- I hardly make voice calls. But still disappointed, especially as a Nexus (One, Galaxy, 5) and Pixel (1, 2XL) fan.",

To this affect, my screen stays on when I answer a call, my landscape photos come out in portrait, my phone refuses to wake on lifting, calls can't be silenced by flipping, the phone lags heavily when I try to wake it through finger print or the power button, and squeezing the sides won't activate google assistant. I have all of the appropriate settings activated. \n\nThis seems to be a well known, and well documented problem for Pixel 3 using android Q, since last year. When I contacted Google I was told they can't do anything, and I need to send my phone to a repair shop, because my phone isn't under warranty and that they haven't received any reports about such issues regarding sensors. This doesn't seem like a problem with hardware, but a software issue, how is a repair shop supposed to help?",

My building wont change the cell number connected to my buzzer (i.e. change it to my subletter's) - so each time they come in / out - they need to call me through the buzzer and i hit 9 to let them in,\n\nAs you can imagine, its not sustainable.\n\nAt this point id be fine if every call that comes in would be automatically answered w a key 9 lol.",

This happened 3 days in a row and I ended up buying a new sim card, which fixed the problem for about 6 days. I am now on hour 6 of not being able to get my phone to have any connection. I'm able to be on wifi but I cannot receive texts or calls. I've restarted it. I've turned it on airplane mode, I've tried to boot to safe mode, I've taken the new sim out, I've reset my network settings. I've tried to  change my prefered network type (it seems to be stuck on global. I don't know if this is correct or not, but I can't change it even just to try). \n\nI've been told I can call my carrier to see if they can reset the antenna. Does anyone have any other ideas? Or is this phone a lost cause now?",

    "content": "Most phones allow you to change the volume for your telephone calls and your notifications separately - for example, you can turn OFF the volume for notifications, but leave ON the volume for my ringtone. On the pixels it seems that notification and ring volume are linked as the same volume control. Is there any simple way to separate them? I have parents who are ill, and I need to receive my phone calls, but I'd rather my notifications were quieter, or even off sometimes. Please help. Thanks!",

That seemed to indicate to me that I had accidently blocked the number, but when I go to Blocked Numbers in Settings, there are no numbers listed (which is itself weird, because I have definitely selected to block numbers when they've been identified as Spam, but that's another issue). \n\nAs far as I can tell, it is just the one person. I only know they called if they leave a voicemail, or if I open the Recents tab for some other reason. Every other number triggers my ringtone and shows up as missed if I don't answer. This is a work related contact, so I'd really like to know when they are calling me.",

I've also noticed my volume levels even though they're turned right up and the speaker is on and I'm practically shouting people are having problem hearing me. if I don't turn on the speaker they can't hear me. I would be grateful for any experiences or find out what this stupid non-functional appearing silent bar appears on my home screen and whether it's affecting the operation of the phone audio.\nthanks in advance!",

When I pick up the phone, everything is fine.  I can't imagine how placing the phone (screen side up) on a table would interfere with the microphone, which is at the bottom of the phone and not obstructed when i put the phone on the desk/table.  The speaker is fine, but I when i set it down, the problems begin.  Any thoughts?  It sounds like a minor problem, but I spend a lot of time on my phone and prefer the speaker to headphones.",

I then called and asked if I could have a refund because this was the 2nd defective phone I received from them within a month. They originally said they couldn't because I bought through Amazon but made an exception since this was my 2nd phone. (I think awesome I'm glad they can do that) I then spend the next 2 weeks calling customer service trying to get a shipping label, and it was always an excuse on why they couldn't (had to send IMEI, then they asked for the proof of purchase the next day, then the following Monday after the weekend they say I need to \"authorize\" them to process the refund. I do this and another 2 weeks go by before I hear anything, so I then xall them. And the specialist says that they can't process a refund because I got it off of Amazon. Despite all the previous calls and emails I sent. I ask to be connected to someone else and she refuse, so I decided to just get another replacent phone even though I just spent a THOUSAND dollars on a new phone because I thought they were going to honor their refund we talked about. Now I'm about a 1300 dollars for 2 phones when if they just said no in the first place I never would've bought a new phone. And to top it all off when I asked to be connected to their customer service survey they just hung up on me. Has by far been the worst customer service I've dealt with to date and I wish I neve supported google and has me wanting the unwire everything that's connected to my Google home and never support another google product again..\nIko",

    "title": "044 prefixed to phone numbers when they send MMS but not SMS",
    "content": "Since going to Mexico 1+ year ago, some contacts' # were randomly being prefixed with 044 (eg 301-555-5555 would be 044-301-555-5555).  Over the past month or more (maybe since an update? I'm not sure), it happens EVERY time to those same contacts when they 1) send me an MMS (pic, gif, etc) or 2) are on a groupt text.  I can send texts normally, but the problems arise when they respond.\n1)  Weird thing is their SMS and MMS normally shows up in the same text thread (almost like there's 3 ppl in the group) and sometimes shows up as a separate thread, but either way the SMS shows up as them (ie their contact pic, correct contact info), but the MMS texts just show up as the 044 # as if it's a stranger.\n2) When I create a group text (2+ people) it goes out normally, but when anyone on the thread responds, it creates a new thread with the 044 # instead of the contacts real #.\n\nI called Verizon and had a nice guy help with trying to research but he was just google searching like me.  I've tried the below to no avail:\n1) Erasing the contact completely from my phone & from contacts.google.com\n2) IT 101 stuff: making sure OS is up to date, restarting device (I really don't want to \"factory reset\" without good logic behind that, grr)\n3) checked the \"region\" settings. It's set to \"automatic\" and says  \"Automatically Detected (United States)\"\n\nThanks in advance for help! I saw there's another thread like this, but 1) the delete, recreate contact fix didn't work for me and 2) they didn't seem to have the MMS vs SMS issue.",

Not sure if the issue was Android 11 or the security update, I rarely make contact changes on the phone. I can see all the info in the contacts to dial numbers, send texts, and send emails with it. I if change contact info on Office 365, the new contact data syncs to the phone. If I click edit contact on the phone or click the create new contact button, then the screen is blank. If I go into contact settings and click default account, there is none, and the option to choose one is blank. If I click your info, it is also blank. See screen shots. I tried uninstalling contacts updates and re-updating, cleared the cache, and the storage. Removed my email account and added it back. Started in safe mode. I have not done a factory reset, to avoid reinstalling and resetting up the phone. Contact app version is 3.36.3.346104542, Phone build # RQ1D.210105.003, thanks. ",

I am unable to make Wi-Fi calls, because it says no mobile network is available. this happens consistently despite the fact that I have excellent Wi-Fi coverage in my home. I also live outside of cell range, the most we ever get is a bar for about 5 seconds before it drops again. If by chance I do actually get to make a call over Wi-Fi (it works about 15% of the time) it will drop the second it thinks it has service, despite Google's official page that says \"your device will use whichever network has the stronger connection, whether it is wifi or cellular\" which shows me, that it will prioritize cellular regardless of whichever is actually better at the time. I have missed several important calls, and been unable to return them as the Wi-Fi calling does not actually work, so my question is when can I expect it to work? I bought this phone, and switch to this phone plan because I was under the impression that Wi-Fi calling was a service that was offered. I wonder if the better question is if I shouldn't just switch back to Verizon and get myself a new Galaxy, as I know for a fact their Wi-Fi calling actually works.",

Brought my phone into UbreakIfix, and was told to ship it in to google.   It's been nearly 3 week with about a dozen phone calls to google.  still no email, no shipping label, no shipping return packaging.    Every time I call in the response is the same \"it's been escalated\".    I don't understand how one of the world's premiere tech companies can't email me a shipping label?  So in the meantime, I've been without a phone for 3 weeks, while my phone is still in warranty.\n\nDoes anyone know what the address is for the google repair center?  I just want to pay for shipping myself and send it in for repair.  Please help!",

Have tried the suggestions seen here, still no joy. The only variable is/was that I was able to get 42+ months out of my original XL 128 while she had to, having dropped hers a couple of times, get a 'refurbished' XL from Asurion. When that died, we knew the 4a was imminent so we picked up an interim phone for her, a Samsung J3 or some such. This probably doesn't make sense, especially since we've twiddled the 4a but it 'feels' like some setting or other from the J3 made it over when merging data and is at cross-purposes with the 4a and Android 11. Doesn't make sense, I know, but that's the only difference.",

Sometimes the phone rang with this  and sometimes with the unknown tone. Last week the ringtone was identified as 31676 and now as 33340. The sound is the same for both numbers ( and the previous number which I can't remember). A sort of bong bong bong.\nMy WhatsApp notification is now silent even though the settings show my WhatsApp tone. Help please ( I need the \"dummies\" version as I am over 50. Lol)",

    "title": "Several issues after transferring data from iPhone",
    "content": "I just switched to Android after being an iPhone user for more than a decade. I love the Pixel 4a 5g so far, but there are quite a few issues from the initial iPhone transfer that I can't figure out.\n\nThe \"Notes\" that have transferred to Google Keep are completely out of order, and many notes are bugged or partially missing. Some lists have weird spacing and missing lines, and some notes just have the first line as a title and none of the rest of the content. Because of the missing info, it's also not very searchable, so I basically have no way to find notes between the lack of order and that (and I have hundreds of notes).\nSimilarly, the iMessages that transferred over seem to be in the texting app fine, but it's also not searchable. I can search for normal SMS texts fine, but no former iMessages show up in searches. I've also noticed a couple times where messages disappear, or numbers are no longer associated with contacts.\nAll of my iPhone voice memos don't seem to be in the voice memo app on the Pixel. I'm not sure where in the filesystem they would have ended up. (I have hundreds of voice memos too, so it would be nice to have them all in there)\nMy music appears to be on the phone, but no music app seems to be able to access them. The most I've gotten to work is Musicolet can play maybe 1 out of every 5 songs, but the rest just have a loud click at the beginning of playback and are silent for the rest of it. Sometimes it even plays one song but displays a completely different song.\n\nAny advice on how to fix any of this would be much appreciated.\n\nI also have a bunch of less important general Pixel/Android questions since I'm still new to all of this:\nIs there a way to set up vibration patterns for notifications (or adjust the strength somehow)? I tend not to notice when it vibrates, so it would be very helpful to make it an obvious, hard-to-miss pattern.\nSome push notifications seem to take a while to come through. I still have my old iPhone, and Discord for example comes instantaneously on the iPhone but takes up to a few minutes on the Pixel. Any way I can force sync more often or something?\nIs there a faster way to organize apps on the home screen pages than dragging and dropping one at a time?\nIs there a gesture like the iPhone has to scroll to the top of any given page? iPhones have the \"tap top of screen\" thing and something like that would be nice to have\nMy face frequently touches buttons when I'm on phone calls, and I guess the gyroscope isn't sensing that I have it against my ear. Is there a way to have the screen turn off during calls or something?\nThe volume up and down buttons don't seem to allow holding the buttons when headphones are plugged in, so I have to press it a bunch of times to turn the volume all the way down or up. Is there a way to fix that?\nSome apps seem to be unoptimised because the front camera cutout sometimes falls right on a button I need to press. Is there a way to adjust the screen to get it all to fit below the camera or something?\n\nIt may have been better to separate these questions into individual posts, but I hope this is okay. Thanks so much for your help.",

    "content": "Hello, \nMy Pixel 2XL always disconnects my phone calls after 5 minutes. I read through prior forums which stated that it was an issue with \"Advanced calling\" that was turned on. When I would turn advanced calling off, the phone did not disconnect my calls after 5 minutes while on Mobile data. \n\nHowever, when I was connected to wifi, my phone calls always disconnected after 5 minutes, even if the \"Advanced calling\" feature was turned off.\n\nI have tried to restart my phone, restart on safe mode, and toggle the advanced calling feature on and off. My phone calls always disconnect.\n\nPlease what is the issue here?",

I've tried clearing the phone's storage, resetting app preferences, rebooting into safe mode, and none of that has worked (at first it seems like it did work, but then a few hours later or the next day the screen still sometimes won't light up). I don't believe a factory reset will work since this phone is new and the issue seems to have persisted since I got the phone. I don't think the issue occurs when I turn off do not disturb, but I would like to have the phone consistently light up for calls from contacts when do not disturb is on.",

I used to have Fi, and SMS spam protection was pretty good, but T-Mobile's is useless. They have a short code I can forward spam to, but it involves several steps of swiping and tapping and doesn't seem to do any good anyway.\n\nIIRC Android used to let you block SMS from sources not in your contacts, as well as calls, which is what I really want. This option doesn't seem to exist anymore. The closest I can get is to leave Do Not Disturb on all the time, but the configuration to block non-contacts in SMS is confusing and sometimes my phone doesn't ring at all in DND mode, even is the text is from a contact.",

For example :- in the phone app, if I want to search for 'varun US', I need to type the entire name 'varunUS' in the keypad for that contact to show up, but when I use the search bar at the top, the contact shows up as soon as I type 'var'.\nI have attached 3 photos for reference. In the first pic, the contact doesn't show up even after I type 'varun'. In the second pic it shows up after I type 'varunUS'. In the third pic it shows up after I type only 'var' in the search bar.\nThis issue never happened on any of my old Android phones, is this a setting or something?",

This phone alerts me of nothing. No text notifications, and even more odd no phone notifications.\n\nThe phone doesn't even alert me in any way when I have a phone call coming in. I'm using pushbullet, so if I'm at my computer I will get an alert there, but I have no way to answer it. I've checked the notification settings. Everything is on, but greyed out. Also checked message notifications, everything seems fine there. Again, will see the notifications through pushbullet.\n\nLet me be clear with this, when receiving a call there is no alert what-so-ever. No sound, no bubble, nothing visible on the phone app. If I try to make a call during an incoming call, it will say I must answer the incoming call first. But, again, there is no way to do that. When I miss the call there is no missed call notification. I can make calls just fine.\n\nWhat could be going on with my phone? Google searching doesn't seem to help, it's always about how to turn on notifications, but as far as I can see they are already turned on.",

Also, during a conversation, if you call and put it to your ear, and immediately remove it, the screen will work. However, in some conversations, the screen may not turn on until the other person finishes the conversation. Reboot done! Full reset is done. There IS no case or screen protection.

I hate it when the other person I am taking to has to repeatedly say hello to because they cannot hear me. It's just demotivating. I really like the pixel phones I have the 2 and the 3, and both suffer from the same problem. My s7 edge is slightly better, I think it has a better baseline for the amp gain. This issue just drives me nuts. This is issue is not just with selected calls but all calls. So please I beg you to do 1 of 2 things or both. Either: include a feature in the next feature update for the pixel 2 and 3 such that the microphone gain can be adjusted the same way that the call volume can be adjusted.

I have done so, many times without any problem and everything worked perfectly before.\n\nNow, I am having the following problem - when I first insert my GSM sim card, it works fine, I can make phone calls, send/receive messages and etc. But, as soon as I connect to the Internet, the phone says that the Sim card isn't supported and asks me to contact Verizon.\n\nThe phone is definitely unlocked, because it reads my sim without the Internet. Furthermore, Verizon has a policy, when after 60 days, they automatically unlock phones and 60 days has already passed.\n\nSo, I am quite sure that it is a Google problem (when I received the device, it had Android 10, I updated it to Android 11 and I still have the same problem). After a factory reset, the phone again reads the sim and again does not recognize it after I turn on the Internet.\n\nCan someone help'?\n\nJust in case, here is the video demonstration of the problem - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR6bVrYVXqk",

I've been using this this since my Galaxy S2 days!\nHowever, on the Pixel 5, it does not show my contacts birthday calendar. I've tried unsetting and resetting the calendars to display etc. no joy. All other calendars show/hide as expected.\nI then installed \"Event Flow Calendar\" widget, and this has exactly the same problem. Will not display my contact's birthdays.\nThe Google widget works ok however.\n\nI looked back on my previous phone (Huawei Mate P20), and the birthdays still show just fine on both of these widgets.\nI thought it may be a pixel launcher issue, so I tried it using Nova launcher, and still no joy.\n\nI'm thinking this may be an android 11 problem for these apps.\nIts a shame if it is, as I dont think Neat Calendar is developed any more.\n\nJust wondering if anyone else having a similar issue with these (or indeed other) 3rd party calendar agenda types of widget for contact's birthdays.\n\nCheers",

At this point I've contacted T-Mobile they updated my SIMs card as they said it was quite old they thought that might help it did not. I contacted T-Mobile once again they factory reset the phone. The problem still persist. My phone is just 1-year-old. The warranty ran out in July I still owe on it very frustrated please help.",

The person who initiates the call gets \"timed out no response\". It doesn't matter who calls who. It's ONLY in the pixel 3 xl. As we have another phone on verizon (motorola) which works perfectly fine with both pixels. We can call other people with non pixel phones with no issues. We contacted google support and they had us uninstall and reinstall apps, reset settings, start in safe mode and none of that worked. If we try to call each other the call ends at exactly 30 seconds with the same error message \"timed out no response\". We've had these phones for over 2 years and never had this issue until the past 3 days. And it's odd that it's both phones at the same time but they work perfectly fine if we don't call each other. Anyone else experience this? Any help would be appreciated.",

    "content": "Several times a day, my Pixel 3a will drop all network connection. This is both WiFi and 4G. There are no indicators on the phone that there is a connectivity issue. I cannot access the internet, send/receive texts or make/receive phone calls.\n\nI turn off / on WiFi on the phone, restart my router, force the phone to try to search for a network provider. I have wiped my network connection settings several times. The only way to reconnect to WiFi and 4G services is to restart my phone. I haven't tried starting in safe mode as a restart clears the issue and I'm not sure what value that would add. I haven't done a full factory reset of my phone either.\n\nThis has only started since the security update at the beginning of November. My partner has a Pixel 3XL and is noticing the same issue.\n\nIs there a known bug in the latest security release that affects internet/network access? What else can I try to fix this?",

    "content": "Anyone having lots of problems with proximity sensor during calls? \nI think it is because they didn't arrange the hardware correctly in this phone. The speaker is under the display, so you can't rest your ear at the top of the phone like with every other phone on earth, you have to put your ear like a quarter of the way down the screen, and I think doing so makes it harder for the proximity sensor to detect that its on my ear. After the call the screen doesn't turn back on to hang up, and when I press the power button to turn it on, usually several settings are changed, e.g. the wifi is off, the hotspot is on, and the settings menu is open.",

My Telco provider claims this is because my phone does not support VoLTE and Wifi calling.\n\nIndeed, officially my Telco provider only sports iPhones and several models from Samsung and Huawei; not Pixels (which, I have to add, cannot be bought in Belgium; I ordered mine in Germany).\n\nWhen I put my sim in my wife's iPhone, VoLTE indeed gets enabled but Wifi calling does not (which does work through her Telco provider which is different from mine).\n\nThe above - as far as VoLTE is concerned; we cannot draw any conclusions for Wifi calling - makes me wonder:  does a Telco provider know what phone you're using and can they enable features based on the phone you're using?\nOR\nDo I need any Telco specific firmware and/or config on my Pixel in order for VoLTE to work? And if so, what would I need to request from my Telco provider in order for that firmware and/or config to make it onto my phone?\n\nThanks a lot in advance for anyone who can provide any clues!\n\nRen\u00e9",

However, it's the same person I'm already talking to. So I got a call from my wife, and was getting notice that another call was coming through, but it was from her. When I ended the first call, I wasn't able to swipe down to cancel the \"second call\" or swipe up to \"answer it\". I had to restart the phone to get back to the main screen and do anything other than continue to swipe uselessly.\n\nHas anyone else had this problem, and/or is there a fix for it?

    "title": "Nothing But Problems With Google Pixel 5 - Did I Get A Lemon, Or Is This Normal?",
    "content": "First, I had tremendous amount of problems transferring my old data from a Pixel 3 to the new Pixel 5 with a USB cable. As best I can tell, it simply cannot be done when you want your phone to be a work phone because Google is really pushing hard on the separation of \"personal\" apps and \"work\" apps or \"work\" profiles. The only way I was able to get the phone working as a work phone (that is, registered with a work email account) was to do a factory reset and manually install every app I ever had. Huge pain.\n\nSecond, I cannot tell when someone is calling me. No matter what I do with the settings, I get no ring, no vibration, and only a notification later that someone called. I've tried every setting I can find, and I cannot receive calls. I can only make outbound calls. This is totally unacceptable, obviously.\n\nThird, my reception is absolutely terrible. I know it's not me or the environment I'm in because I used my Pixel 3 just hours ago in the exact same locations and it was fine. But I've had half a dozen dropped calls with the Pixel 5, and three people have told me the sound quality is terrible and much of my call was broken up and unintelligible during the call. I'm a professional, and to not have a solid, working phone is just ridiculous. \n\nWhat can I do to fix these problems? Is the Google Pixel 5 just a crap phone, or did I get a lemon?",

    "content": "Hi there,\n\nI'm having issues with my WiFi calling engaging, and staying engaged.\n\nI am fully provisioned for WiFi calling from my carrier, everything on their end seems to be working without issues.\n\nWhat occurs is that when I get onto a stable WiFi network, like at home, my phone will not automatically connect with WiFi calling. I will often have to reset my phone to get it to engage. When it is engaged, it will usually just stay this way for a few minutes to hours. It will randomly disconnect. At that point I will have to reset my phone again to get WiFi Calling to engage.\n\nWhen WiFi calling is engaged, I can make calls without issue, I do not get dropped calls. The issue is not with dropped calls when using WiFi calling but with getting WiFi calling to actually connect and stay connected.\n\nOf note, when I'm in Airplane mode with just WiFi on, then the connection to WiFi Calling remains stable, without random disconnects.\n\nI'm not sure why this is happening. I've factory reset several times, deleted apps, my carrier has reset my WiFi profile multiple times, nothing seems to make things work as they should (my wife's iPhone does not have this issue).\n\nThis happens on various WiFi networks, not just at home.\n\nOf note, my Pixel 3 did the same thing. I was never able to get WiFi calling work properly as the above issues occurred.\n\nIs there any advice you can offer?\n\nThanks",

The problem comes when I want to make a call, the phone changes automatically from LTE network to HSPA+ network (sometimes only HSPA) and the call is not over LTE. In my local carrier I have voice over LTE (VoLTE) but since I am not able to enable it by calling *#*#4636#*#* and go to the \"Phone information\" tab I am not able to turn it on by myself. My question is, Should Google enable it in order to make this work or this is something to do with my carrier? \n  To be clear, when I was in the US, I used Google Fi and had VoLTE calls (it showed the HD message) and also Calls over Wi-Fi and many more features and in my country I can't have VoLTE.\n  I will post a link to the screenshot to show you what I am talking about.\n  https://photos.app.goo.gl/wj1RtCkpbtktooR89\n  Thank you so much for your help.",

    "content": "I have no mobile data available on my phone to make a call. My phone states I am in airplane mode, but I'm not. This is a pixel phone issue, not a Google Fi issue, but the Pixel support team continues to transfer me to Fi. I have spent over 4 hours now troubleshooting with the representatives just to be disappointed. Their upper tier support team actually made things worse. I can't make or receive calls from WiFi. Their service team refuses to treat this as a priority. I use my phone for work and cannot do my job. I am seven months pregnant and can't even dial my doctor or 911 if there is an emergency. This is outrageous. \n\nI have filed an FCC complaint, and am fully prepared to file a small claims suit to remedy the damages this company has caused me in my career, the time they have wasted, for the lack of service I pay for but am not provided, and for all the energy I have devoted to resolving this issue.\n\nThe customer service is awful. All I keep getting are canned responses. I'm severely disappointed with Google Fi and Pixel support. I had a situation today where I had to call my midwife and I couldn't use my phone. My husband was away so I had to go next door to ask to use my neighbors phone to call.  As I stated prior, this poses a risk to my health and safety, as well as my baby's. \n\nI need a reliable phone and service, hence why I pay for a plan through a mobile provider and have a phone which is supposedly covered by a warranty. I am not getting the service I am paying for, nor am I getting the warranty I was promised. It seems that no one within the company cares enough to resolve this issue. No one even cares enough to communicate when this will be resolved. I do understand things happen, but the communication and follow through is what counts when things do happen. Google has shown the company does not value communication or follow through. \n\nHas anyone had any luck with getting anyone to assist with issues they have caused? If so, what have you done to get their attention?",

It appears this has now been fixed by the rollout of \"Chat features from Google provided by Jibe Mobile\". \n\nHowever this has left the Visual Voicemail in limbo as Telstra is saying that as they are no longer supported by Google to provide the RCS from their end, they can't offer visual voicemail anymore.\n\nFollowing Google's own support articles, the settings to turn it on are simply not showing.\n\nIs there anyone out there that has had any solution here?",

There is no way to know whether I have a voicemail without manually calling in.\n\nPer old posts, I've checked the blocked numbers list, turned various settings like visual voicemail on and off, made sure notifications/alerts are on, contacted Xfinity cell carrier, cleared phone cache, nothing has helped. It's been like this for something like six months since I've had the phone which I purchased new and for retail price. I ended up just putting a message on saying voicemail doesn't work on this phone, because it's such a pain, but I really need voicemail notification now (really, I'd like visual voicemail, which is the only thing I miss from having an iPhone, and it was advertised as a feature of this phone).\n\nDoes this phone actually come with the voicemail notification feature or do I have to buy a new phone? And, honestly, I see other people saying this issue is happening on Pixel 4s too so while I like Pixel I'm not sure I could go Google again when the most important features of a PHONE aren't working.\n\nThanks for advice.",

    "title": "Pathetic Customer Service from Pixel Help Center India",
    "content": "This is about a Pixel Help Center Case ID [8-5776000030912], I have been very disappointed by the quality of customer service by pixel help center in India. I have raised a complaint about by Google Pixel 3XL device on OCT 22nd, 2020, and paid the inspection charges. My phone pickup doesn\u2019t happen even after payment and multiple calls to Pixel Help Center, sad part is Pixel Help Center asked me to contact FedEx regarding this, FedEx was not ready to share any information with me as I was not the requestor for this pickup. I had to go back to Pixel Help Center get the tracking number from them and then contact FedEx to pick up my package. If you guys cannot coordinate with your pickup and carrier and ask the customers to do it, that\u2019s not good customer service.\nAfter the phone has reached the service center, I received an email with details about what is wrong with the phone and estimated charges for replacing the parts which, It did not contain any information about the warranty on the new parts nor any confirmation on the problem has been fixed on my phone. After calling the Pixel Help Center, I was told that the phone would go through an all-round quality check and all the issues would be taken care of, I was excited that the phone would be repaired but when I received my phone, I was shocked to see that the problem I mentioned was not fixed, instead, they just changed the display and charging port, which was never a problem. Instead looking at what the customer has reported Pixel Help Center has just lamely changed the display and charging port on the phone. I reached out to Pixel help again on November 9th, 2020, and reported that the was not fixed, Pixel Help Center said they would escalate the case and get this resolved ASAP.\nI have reported this on November 9th 2020 and today is November 17th, 2020, there has been no help, I ended up paying money for repairs and still get the faulty phone. I have been calling, chatting with Pixel Help Center every day. These are all the Case IDs for my interactions with Pixel Help Center.\nCase ID [2-0146000031317]\nCase ID [8-5776000030912]\nCase ID [8-2136000031232]\nCase ID [9-4674000031187]\nCase ID:[0-4658000030982]\nI was made false promises that escalation team would get in touch with me. When requested for a call back from manager or supervisor a promise was made but the calls never happen.  Pixel Help Center has poor coordination with its service partner B2X India. Upon continuous calling and chatting, I was told that B2X service center was unable to reproduce the problem and I was asked to send a video of the issue, which I did. If the service center is not able to reproduce the issue why did they change parts on my phone, shouldn\u2019t Pixel Help Center call me to ask more details about the issue, instead of just changing parts on my phone. I feel cheated that Pixel Help Center is interested in collecting money from customers and doesn\u2019t pay attention to customer\u2019s issues. I feel bad for using Google Products and I am very disappointed with the kind of service you guys provide.   I hope writing to you would escalate the issue and get this fixed sooner.\n\nFeedback to Pixel Help Center India.\nKeep only one thread open to interact with customers, multiple threads may be easier for your internal tracking but makes your customer\u2019s life hard.\nAfter you receive a phone for repair and diagnose it, call the customer, explain to him what you see, talk to him about the warranty of new parts, them let them decide what they want to do with their phone.\nFor us customers, the person on phone, or their supervisor or manager or escalation team or your service center B2X is all one entity - Pixel Help Center. If you guys are not able to coordinate among yourself, you are making customer life hard and Google experience painful. Don't ask customers to check with FedEx as you did with me. \n\nI would wait for 48 hours after I send this email and then file a complaint with Consumer Forum India so that no other customer should this. Thank you for your time in reading this. Hope Google cares for its customers.",

    "content": "(Using a Pixel 4A)\n\n1. Ever since the update to Android 11, I've found that my auto-rotate function only operates about 60% of the time. Chrome and YouTube seem to be the primary ones affected, but I've had issues with Telegram, regular Messages, Facebook, Twitter...major apps that, one would think wouldn't be negatively affected to this extent by an upgrade. The app also rotates and will get stuck, and not rotate back. Usually it just refuses to rotate. Anyone else run into this issue?\n\n2. WiFi Calling - I was quite perplexed when my phone calls would \"randomly\" drop after 40-50 minutes, almost without fail. In doing a little reading, it turns out this could be an issue with the phone switching back and forth from WiFi to mobile network calling, and not being able to maintain the phone call when that happens. Has this happened to anyone else before? It's utterly maddening, though fixed since I turned off WiFi calling (turned on, it appears, by default).",

I would like to see the icon on the screen telling me there's new messages, but not have it constantly vibrate.\n\nI've upgraded to Android 11 recently, re-started the phone, uninstalled Whatsapp and reinstalled, cleared the cache, updated settings within the app and on my Notifications settings. I don't want to switch Vibrate off completely as I don't use a ringtone, I rely on vibrate for incoming calls.\n\nWhat seems to be happening is when I change Notification settings from Alert > Silent, they seem to automatically change back to Alert as soon as a new message comes in.\n\nI've noticed this issue only with Whatsapp, all other apps behave accordingly. I read that phone settings override apps so please heeeeelp!\n\nThank you in advance for any tips, I will try them all!",

    "content": "Since the Pixel 3a upgraded to Android 11, on phone calls the Android Notifications screen keeps inserting itself/hiding my phone call in progress screen. This happens a lot when I am making my way through a phone tree, needing to access the screen to touch numbers on the keypad etc. but also while I am on hold or just on an ongoing call. At first I didn't even know what to do to get rid of the screen display of notifications hiding my phone call screen but then found I have to swipe up to get rid of it. How can I prevent general Notifications display from interrupting my phone calls? (I just submitted this to Google under Send feedback on my Pixel 3a) \n\nPS a  lot of these are notifications I don't even want but cannot swipe away, for example from my security program, which won't let me remove a notice about VPN not being turned on.",

First, it's 3pm CST and support says its open until 11:50pm but can't get support because it says close with a greyed out icon.  When I can get through, I start a chat but can't continue them because of these issues where the keyboard stops inputting into the chat box.  I ask for call back and nobody calls me back.  Finally in a chat someone gave me the direct number for pixel support and when you call that number is says support staff are working from home and support is closed. \n\nSeveral years ago we had a similar issue with a test phone and Google lost a sale of 135 phones due similar dumb issues.  So yeah - with this test, Google has failed miserable again.  Our businesses are not going to refresh our phones to pixels.\n\nIt amazing how Google repeated seems to shoot themselves in the foot over easily preventable items.",

    "title": "Availability of Pixel 4a",
    "content": "Hi,\nI've been trying to buy this phone ever since it released in India. The only platform which sells this device is Flipkart. On the first day it released, the stock got over within the first 30 minutes. After that I patiently waited for more than a week for it to be back on sale. I have never experienced such a wait for such an anticipated phone. After that, one day, at 4 in the morning, the phone came back in stock but then every pincode that I typed, it wasn't getting delivered. When I contacted Flipkart about this issue, they said that it depended solely on the seller and that they had absolutely no idea about what to do. These calls went on for several days without any use. If I could've predicted that this was going to be the situation with the Google Pixel 4a, I would've never set my mind on buying it. When a phone, sold by Google, comes into the market, there must be sufficient availability of the product and adequate response from the seller's and retailer's side, since it's expected that there will many customers. But this has been a very disappointing experience overall and it makes me look at the phone in a doubtful way. I just would like to put forth a question to you, should I wait for someone to own up to their fault and fix this issue or should I move on to another phone. Moving on will be an easy step for me as well as other customers but, it will surely leave a bad mark on the side of Google and Flipkart. Please consider this request.\nThank you,\nSteen Mariya Paul",

    "title": "Help Restoring SMS From Cloud Backup",
    "content": "Hello everyone. This is a bit of a long story, so stay with me. I own a Google Pixel (original, what ever the first version was). On it there are two gmail accounts. The primary one is a .edu hosted by gmail (I'll call it account 1), and the secondary is a personal gmail account (account 2). Prior to doing a factory reset to try to fix a camera issue. I did a backup to Google Drive, and made sure that SMS and all other data was selected for backup. This backed up to Account 1.\n\nI performed the reset and during bootup, went through the process of telling the phone to restore my settings and data from the backup. The phone restores everything (pictures, contacts, voicemails, etc) except for text messages. I tried this process multiple times. In addition, I tried removing, and reapplying Account 1. I repeated the process using the data from Account 2 just to be sure.\n\nOne of the puzzling parts is that when I log into Google Drive through Account 1, and go to the drop down menu in the upper left, there is no \"backup\" category to select. However, when I log into Google Drive with Account 2, I can select \"backup\" at which point I am given a message to the effect of saying that Account 2 is not the backup location, and then can click a link that says \"switch account.\" When I click this link, I can then see the backed up data, but find that, upon hitting \"back,\" I am still logged into Account 2, and have not actually switched accounts.\n\nFor multiple reasons, I purchased a Pixel 5, and when booting it up for the first time, set the phone to restore data and settings from the backup. Once again, I get the same results: everything restores except for text messages. In fact, the whole situation is identical, regardless of device. I have tried accessing the backup through SMS Backup+ and SMS Backup and Restore. Backup+ at least behaves like it is restoring the backup (although I don't know what it's accessing) but does not restore anything. Backup and Restore is unable to locate the backup file on Google Drive (even though I have set it to access all files, not just files that it has created); and when I browse Google Drive manually through Backup and Restore, I cannot find the backup file.\n\nIt's there. I can see it from multiple devices (phone, laptop, PC), I just can't restore it. Anyone have suggestions?",

I'm able to receive calls but screen is completely black. \n\nI'm unable to unlock my phone. It is a completely stock non-rooted device. Even the bootloader is intact. There is no modifications that has been done. \n\nFortunately, USB debugging was on so I could connect the phone to my laptop and use basic ADB commands to reboot. Although I still got black screen. I even tried entering into recovery mode but there also I got a blank screen. \n\nMy phone has not got any physical screen damage nor was it knocked against any surface. I charged my phone to 100% and removed it from the charger (official charger that came in the box). Kept it on the table and clicked install on the official October 2020 security patch.\n\nI used vysor to mirror the screen on my laptop. I even tried to view the screen on vysor and it is coming out distorted. It's seeming impossible to unlock the phone. When I placed a call on the phone, the call UI displayed  distorted in vysor. Very big chunky UI.\n\nI'm feeling very panicky as it is a very costly device and I was already taking extra care of it. All I did was install an official system update and this happened. \n\nPlease help me.",

The \"ID WiFi Calling\" text normally viewable when you swipe down from the top is no longer visible. \n\nLooking at these forums, it may have been caused by the last security update?\n\nI've tried:\nairplane mode, wifi on (says I need to connect to a network)\nrebooting\nresetting network settings\nturning wifi calling on and off\nand lots of variations of the above\n\nNo matter what I do, the phone only connects on the (very poor) mobile signal in the house.  Wifi calling was the primary reason I bought the pixel 4, and it worked fine until about a month ago, not at all now.  It's annoying as I use an iphone for work and wifi calling is always rock solid with that.  Any help gratefully accepted.",

    "content": "I sent the below text to google already, but I am looking for help.   RMA and chat ID numbers have been struck out.  \n\nI purchased a Google Pixel 4 for my wife in November of 2019.   Last month the phone began randomly rebooting frequently.  We made sure it had the latest software updates on it and the issue did not get better, so we tried a factory reset of the phone.  It still did not improve.   On Monday 10/26/2020, The phone screen went black, and then started flashing green.   It will not reboot, or do anything other than flash green when pressing the power button.   \n\nI requested a call from Google support on 10/26/2020.  Unfortunately, I do not have a transcription number for that call since I believed the issue was going to be fixed promptly.  After describing my issue, I was advised to take the phone to ubreakifix.  I took the phone to ubreakifix on 10/27/2020.  After looking at the phone, ubreakifix apparently entered a google rma of XXXXXXX.   ubreakifix advised that they were unable to repair the phone and recommended that I recontact Google to have the phone sent in for a replacement.   I contacted Google support via the chat feature the evening of 10/27/2020.  That chat ID is   XXXXXXX.  I was on the chat line for 1 hour and 44 minutes with no resolution.   \n\nToday, 10/28/2020 I rechecked the warranty information on the pixel, and when I did so I noticed that an RMA had already been authorized.  However, I had no email or other documentation describing what to do with the RMA.   SO I contacted Google support via phone again on 10/28/2020.   This call transcript number is XXXXXXXX.  While on the phone, I was informed that the RMA had been entered with the issue of a cracked screen on the phone.   This is not correct.  There is no crack whatsoever on the phone, and the issue is as I described earlier in this email.   The person I was talking to for support today said they were unable to resolve my issue and I would have to wait an entire day to receive a call back to see if the phone can be fixed.\n\nI find this absolutely crazy.   I have had to RMA a few items in the past with other companies, and I have never been treated like this.   Customer service was always prompt, and I received a RMA authorization within a day.   I have no idea why Google, one of the  largest companies in tech has such horrible customer service.   \n\nMy wife needs a phone.   Our son has autism, and she has to make and receive calls and texts every day regarding his treatment and therapy.   Because I am receiving no help whatsoever from Google, I have had to purchase another phone for my wife just to make sure our son is receiving the care he needs.",

I have Do Not Disturb set to ring for contacts and it has been working well since that feature came out but after the update to Android 11 it will no longer ring with a built in ring tone. If I add my own ring tone and set that either as default or to an individual contact it will ring for everyone or that one number accordingly. If I turn off Do Not Disturb everything makes noise as it should but I dont want this, I want to filter my calls so only contacts ring. I am not interesting in any solutions which involve 3rd party apps or something else. My Sounds > Do Not Disturb settings allow contacts to interrupt (under people), alarms & other interruptions are all on, and advanced > display options for hidden notifications are custom and all unchecked. For now I have an a custom ring tone set as default but I think this is a bug and wanted someone to see it, but the chat support is not available. Thanks1",

I balked, since the screen was not broken when I sent it in, and the cost seemed excessive for a warranty repair. Google sent it back, unrepaired. Now that I have unpacked it, it appears significantly more damaged than when I sent it in. There are scratches around the edge of the screen, scratches under the screen (they must have taken the screen off) and of course the screen is cracked in several places. It really doesn't even look like my phone. Is there anything I can do about this? I feel like I've been treated unfairly and the return process was a disaster.

    "content": "update***  I even tried just doing away with a lock screen and set it so I dont have a pin and the pixel wired headset still doesn't call the google assistant when the screen is displaying the clock.  I long press the middle button and nothing happens. If I take the phone out of my pocket swipe up so my phone is on then I can long press and the assistant appears.   I give up. If anyone knows of a phone and a wired headset that can just send a text while the phone is locked or the screen is off please let me know. I'm done with the pixels.  I ride a bicycle and this is pretty much the only thing I use a phone for.  I don't need to deal with pulling my bicycle off to the side every time someone sends me a text just so I can respond. \n\nMy assistant doesn't work on the lock screen. I am using the forums to walk through a solution but every \"community expert's\" advice is wrong.  The people who reply actually use the correct steps which is very helpful. This is so frustrating it reminds me of when I used to own an iphone and wanted to change one little thing and had to spend hours only to hit a dead end bc they lock everything down which was the reason I switched to android.  The ironic thing is when I used the iphone assistant to text it was amazing and worked 100% of the time with no lag.  Here I am with pixel 3 and a pixel 4a and can no longer use a simple feature like that.  All I want to do is click my middle WIRED headset button so the google assistant appears and I can say \"text so and so\".  \n Have you confirmed that the \"Allow responses while phone is locked\" option is enabled? You can find this at Settings > Apps & notifications > Assistant > See all Assistant settings > Assistant (tab) > Pixel USB-C earbuds > Allow responses while phone is locked.\n I found this in one of the forums but when I go to settings, apps, assistant, see all assistant settings then there is NO assistant (tab) there is a long list of every single option except assistant tab. I just need to find where I can click allow responses while phone is locked for Pixel USB C earbuds because I have followed the other 97 steps just so I can try to send a hands free voice text while my phone is locked. This is ridiculous.  I have already clicked turned on locked screen personal results and I have already turned on allow wired headset request with device locked and the button to call google assistant still doesnt work on lockscreen. It immediately works if I take the phone out of my pocket unlock the phone and then press it but by then what is the use of having a button to call google assistant if I have to go through all of the steps manually on the phone anyway.  \n \nHere is what I see when I follow the instructions above.\nHey google sensitivity\nAssignable reminders\nAssistant voice (I checked this it just lets me pick if I want a British Assistant)\nBasic Info\nCalendar\nContinued Conversation\nExplore\nFace Match\nFamily Bell\nFinances\nFood Preferences\nGeneral\nGetting Around\nHome Control\nLanguages\nMusic\nNews\nNotes and Lists\nNotifications\nPayments\nPersonalization\nPodcasts\nPurchases\nRadio\nReminders\nReservations\nRoutines\nShopping List\nShortcuts\nSnapshot\nVideos and Photos\nVoice and Video Calls\nVoice Match\nWeather\nYour data in the Assistant\nYour People\nYour places",

    "content": "Hello!\n\nWhen I receive notifications, the vibration that goes with them is so strong that it feels like something is loose inside my Pixel 4a. It even sounds a bit like the speaker is crackling, but I've tested listening to some songs and taking calls through the external speakers and they sound fine, great even! I've also tested the various notification sounds and those don't trigger the vibration motor and they sound fine too, so I'm wondering if others have noticed this as well? And if it's a characteristic of the phone and just a too strong vibration motor? Or if my phone is defective and I should contact Google for a replacement?\n\nThanks!",

If \"yes,\" can anyone give me step-by-step instructions on how to do this on a Pixel 4a?\n\nI was able to find instructions on how to do this on earlier Pixel versions. None of them apply to a 4a. On the earlier versions the instructions were to add the Outlook account as an Exchange account. This is not possible on a 4a; when I enter my email address in the Add Account dialog it refuses to let me add my Outlook account as an Exchange account and forces me to choose Outlook/Hotmail. This option does not sync Contacts and Calendar.\n\nI can install the Outlook mobile app, and it works. I have syncing turned on both inside the Outlook app and for the phone. But the Outlook Contacts and Calendar are not synced.\n\nI'm a little surprised this is so difficult to figure out.

As in, if I picked up my phone, the lock screen would show my recent notifications and once unlocked, if you swipe down you see your notifications.  Also, if someone called my phone would ring and display an \"answer phone call\" screen.  \n\nAbout 6 days ago the phone stopped doing any of those things. It's as if my watch is auto dismissing everything?  No notifications show up in notification list.  My phone calls don't make the phone ring.  All that happens is my watch vibrates and says \"you're receiving a call\" and asks if I want to answer it.  The only way to answer a call now is with my watch!\n\nI have confirmed that my notification settings are normal, my phone volume is not off.  Vibrate is not off.",

    "content": "I have contacted customer service twice regarding an in warranty replacement...Case ID are 3-6195000030445 and 9-8143000030471. Each time I have been told after being on hold and in conversation each time for more that 30 to 40 min, that they cannot do an advanced exchange. We have to send the defective phone back and then they will send a replacement to us which can take up to 5 to 10 business day for the whole process. This is the only phone that we have and currently due to covid and working from home, its the only phone used for official business calls. My sister works for the VA and they are in constant contact with dr. offices to process claims for our VA. Not having this phone for 5 to 10 business day is not acceptable since that is her source of income. She is also disabled herself therefore I have been taking care of this issue for her. Expecting her to be without a phone is not only going to cost her job but in case of an emergency she will also not have any way to call 911. This is the worst customer service that I have ever experienced in my life. We will definitely never buy a google product again.",

In the last few months it started randomly losing mobile data, it displays \"no SIM card detected - Emergency calls only\" which is weird because I have no SIM card at all - that's the whole point of the eSIM. Restarting the phone usually solves the problem, but lately it has become much more prevalent and it's maddening, because I lose data while driving and navigating, or when I try to pay for something in a shop. It's completely random; sometimes it's faulty as soon as I turn it on, sometimes it runs fine for a day. I tried contacting Google Fi support, but everything seems fine on their end. I tried hard rebooting (by long pressing the power button), resetting network settings, even a full factory reset (not importing all my old apps and settings!) and none of it worked. Restarting in safe mode does provide mobile data, but I don't know how long because I can't properly use my apps there. It's driving me crazy, and I just can't find a solution. Please help!",

The only \"fix\" I've figured out thus far is to use the pull down bar on the top of the screen and toggle my wifi on and off. Why that fixes the issue and allows the sound to come through, I'm not sure, but I hope this helps the Google crew figure out this odd bug.",

This is despite various previous communications to Google Support to either extend or halt the deduction until they either send me a label or just simply provide the address and information needed for to write my own. Again, during a pandemic, I have been wrongfully deducted $900 due to lack/horrible of customer support from Google.  This has deterred me from buying any future Google products - period!

I have upgraded to everything made available by Google & updated the apps on play store but nothing really helps.. The enjoy of the phone as Pixel has diminished and today sound output devices on the phone are not giving out any sound. I can't play videod, music\u2026 worst part is I can't take calls, if I do, it freezes and turns off but it's never fixed, for two days now, the same thing has been happening over and over and I've ran out of options.

    "content": "I use my Pixel 4 XL for work, taking 20+ calls every day. After the most recent update to Android OS (V11) I noticed that my call volume resets to 100% at the start of every call.\n\nThe interesting behavior is that it remembers my previous volume setting as indicated by the volume slider that shows up after adjusting the volume, which is showing 50%. But despite showing a setting of 50%, it is very clearly setting the volume at 100%. When I attempt to adjust it down, the actual call volume AND volume slider shown cuts to 33%~ as if it was already at the 50% it was showing, and putting it back to 50% puts the actual call volume back at 50% as indicated by the volume slider.\n\nI wear a headset that is connected through an adapter (USB-C to 3.5mm headphone jack) that might have something to do with this issue. It was working fine before the OS update though so I'm hoping there wasn't an issue installed with the update.\n\nAs far as I'm aware, I have no apps that have direct control over volume settings.",

(Other devices are connected with no problem, and I took the phone to other locations where Wi-Fi is available and the same problem occurred.)\nMultiple contacts with Google support led to a reset of my Wi-Fi and mobile connections, which unfortunately cut me off entirely from Google Fi and thus rendered my phone unworkable for calls/texts/mobile data via the network.  More contacts with Google support have led to repeated suggestions to do the same things which have not resolved the issue.\nOne suggestion was to to a factory reset, which I'm willing to do, but I'm concerned at the step that says to make sure you're connected to the internet.  Obviously I am not, since that prompted my service contact in the first place. \nThus, my basic question: Can I do a factory reset if my phone is not not currently able to connect to an otherwise available Wi-Fi signal.?\nI cannot believe how many repeated contacts I've had with Google support that have led me nowhere.  I've used both chat and email--no consistency and no resolution.",

I know how to change the notification sounds, so no I don't need advice on how to do that; but selecting \"Default\" or going through my ringtones and picking one of them is not what I am looking for.\n\nOn Pie, apps like Snapchat, Facebook, Messenger, etc all had the option for \"App Provided Sounds\", which meant they each defaulted to their own unique (and embedded) sounds (like Facebook's iconic \"pop\" sound).\n\nIs the lack of this feature from 10 intentional?  Is it a bug?  Or am I just missing the right steps to accomplish this?\n\nI do love this phone, but it is frustrating not being able to identify what the notification without having to look at the phone each time.\n\nNO THIS IS NOT A DUPLICATE, there is another similar thread, but it is LOCKED without a Solution - which is useless if you actually want resolution to this issue.",

This is not consistent - sometimes a call or text will have an audible notification, but a majority of the time the phone only vibrates with no sound. Several other notifications seem to have similar behavior, but those are so few and far between it's difficult to say with certainty. I've rebooted, cycled from silent/DND/audible several times.",

    "content": "My ReSound LiNX Quattro hearing aids connect fine.  Tthey were the only android supported when I purchased back in Jan, that is why I bought them.  My audiologists told me that ReSound had a 6month exclusive agreement with Google and I can see that there are now more supported HAs.  I was hoping in that time period Android support would improve but does not appear so.\n\nI am having two really annoying issues.\n1-when connected I do not get alerts.  sometimes I will get the last nanosecond of an alert in my hearings aids OR the hearing aids will go momentarily quiet.  I'm guessing that the alert is getting issued before the connection can be completed.  When I disconnect the HAs the alerts come thru loud and clear.  Most of the time I will not get ring tone for an incoming call and for an outgoing call will not hear anything until the connection is made with the person or their VM.\n2-When my car is connected (via BT) the sound is inconsistent.  Sometimes it will come thru the HAs and sometimes it will go thru the car spkr.  Calls as well.  The result is that I have to manually disconnect the HAs for the sound/calls to come thru the car.  You would think there would be a setting to automatically do this, ie, why would I want sound to come thru the HAs in the car especially when an incoming call does NOT turn off an media sound to the car.  When I use Android Auto (via USB/BT) the issue is the same.\n\nI just tried google support - totally worthless.  Had me forget all BT devices and dropped off the chat before I could reply.  \n\nI think these issues just reflect very limited support for HAs.  So disappointing.  I am not an Apple person but can tell from my wife's phone there are much more support options.\n\nIs there a forum where we can lobby Goggle for better support?",

When I edit the email, it shows up as John's, but as soon as I exit, it still shows my email under the \"email\" header.\n\nI suspect this has something to do with the fact that my old phone included a \"Me\" contact which had all of my info, and somehow gave this info to John when I transferred. Even if I delete John's contact and recreate the contact from scratch, it shows my profile picture and email as soon as I save. What can I do about this?",

I am running Android 10, latest August security patch.  I have factory reset the phone--no good.  I have turned the phone off, pulled the sim card, waited 5 minutes, replaced the sim card turned phone on to no avail.  I have reset all app settings, all network settings.  Nothing so far has worked.  Again, I can receive calls all day long.  But when I make a call it hangs up immediately.\n\nThank You in advance for any advice.",

I try calling again, and in 3rd or sometimes in 4th attempt, it works fine. Throughout the day, I face this issue with 70% of calls. Strange thing is, this issue is faced only while making a normal call (i.e. over a cellular network carrier) and no such issue has ever been faced while talking over whatsapp call. \nPlease help in solving my problem.",

If I were to get a dual sim phone\u2026 I\u2019m thinking of getting the new Google Pixel 4a\u2026. I was thinking that I could use the e-sim for the carrier in the US, and the actual sim for the carrier in the other country. So my question, if I am outside of the US, is it possible to place the e-sim so it only receives calls and messages via wifi calling? That way, it doesn\u2019t charge my US carrier for any international calls, and I am still able to receive US calls and text messages while away when I have wifi available? With that being said... still have the International sim working so I can also continue receiving calls from that country?",

All should be well. However, they don't work when I get calls.\n\nI discovered that all ringtones selected from the ones that came with the phone are converted to .ogg files after selecting and appear in the folder Android/media/com.google.android.soundpicker/Ringtones with the form sound_picker_track_239.ogg (with different numbers for different ringtones). However, custom ones that I add are not converted to .ogg files and put there. I have tried .mp3, .wav, and even .ogg files. They continue to show up in the My Sounds category in the Ringtones picker, but the phone isn't converting them to a usable .ogg file and placing them in the soundpicker folder. \n\nOne of the ringtones I tried was downloaded from the web several years ago and used since then on other phones. When that one wouldn't work, I found the same one from another source and downloaded and tried it, but that file wouldn't work either.\n\nSo something is keeping Pixel from converting these custom files to .ogg format and placing them in the appropriate folder. Any ideas why or what I might do to force it to work?",

When I try to ring out the phone says \"dialling\" for about 10 seconds (excellent mobile reception) then suddenly it shows zero bars (little x in the reception icon up the top) and the call disconnects. I haven't been able to receive calls either.\n\nHowever the weird thing is I can send and receive texts (I've been getting texts saying that I've got new voicemail). \n\nAlso mobile data is working fine.\n\nI contacted my provider and they confirmed that my sim was working correctly. I have reset network settings, restarted my device in safe mode, updated, even signed up for beta android 11 (and updated OS). I also tried an alternative dialling app.\n\n...So I done a factory reset. Still no help.",

For example it will say calling xxx-xxx-xxxx number in my headset but it never dials.\n\nIf I take the phone off the stand Google Assistant works properly even if it's locked.\n\nIf I unlock the phone while on the stand and use the Assistant it works perfectly.\n\nIf I use the wake words for the assistant it unlocks the phone on the stand and works perfectly.  (Problem with this is that I have other devices in the room and they always pick up my commands instead of the phone.  I tested by muting the other devices.)\n\nIf I use a non Pixel wireless charging stand it works perfectly when the phone is locked.\n\nSo its something specific about the Pixel stand.\n\nThis is annoying because when I want to make calls with my headset using the assistant while the phone is charging, I have to first unlock it prior to using the assistant.",

I want to call them.\n I say\" Hey Google, Call Kitty\". \nWhich instead of proceeding to call the person in my phone, decided to call: www.kitty.com customer service and sales department ....for feline consumer products. \n\nYes this happened and the customer rep was equally as surprised as I was. \n\nI've never shopped there, been in their website and I reckon my phone shouldn't have that service. But since it happened exactly like that, I've since disabled voice calling. And I of course double checked that the number did not exist in any of my several contact list. I.e. Google contacts, Android, Gmail, previous devices (Motorola phones mostly) also take note it did not happen on wifi but 3g/4g whatever G were up to this week.

Also while in driving mode, my audio apps will constantly be turning themselves off ( and on, but less frequently) and the Google Assistant will consistently interrupt asking what I want. Also before I went into Safe Mode my home screen wouldn't even come up. Google assistant was the only thing that would show up when I swiped my screen or used the lower screen back arrow. I had to restart my phone to get my home screen to appear. I was in an online chat with Pixel Hardware team and they were the ones that recommended I observe my phone for 30 minutes in Safe Mode. It seems as if the driving mode is mucking up the phone. Is there any way to disable this?",

Tried the following methods but no joy so far:\n\n- Clearing cache and user data didn't help\n- Uninstalling/Reinstalling updates for the Phone app didn't help\n- Placed the sim card into my old phone and there were no issues in making and receiving calls\n- Placed another overseas sim card into my Pixel 3a XL and there were no issues in making and receiving phone calls under the 4G network and under roaming too\n- Even when I magically end up being able to make or receive a phone call under the LTE network (which is like once out of every 10 attempts), the quality remains very poor and mobile data connection completely drops out\n- Mobile data connection and signal strength remains fine when not making/receiving phone calls\n- No network faults reports by the network operator in Hong Kong\n\nTrying to avoid a complete factory reset so would really appreciate any solutions that might help!",

I know where my microphones are. I have cleaned the C area with soft cloth. I have a screen protector (Gorilla Glass) and phone case (just for back, Spigen). I have not taken those off. I have called people back for better connection. I use headphones and sometimes they are very helpful for callers and sometimes not. I have cleared Chrome cache, closed tabs both in chrome and those open on phone, cleared phone cache.\n\nI have read the Gottabemobile discussion and do not find that any of the common problems apply in my situation.

    "title": "Notifications Auto-Silencing after 1 ring (Alarms, Timers, Phone Calls)",
    "content": "I'm incredibly frustrated with my Pixel 3.\n\nFor the past few weeks my notifications from my Google Clock and Phone apps have been broken. I've noticed the following behaviors:\n\nAlarms always automatically snooze themselves the first time they trigger. They sometimes work normally after the first snooze, other times they automatically snooze again.\nPhone calls have about a 50% chance of ringing normally, otherwise they only ring once before they silence themselves. The incoming call isn't declined, but the ring is absent\nTimers automatically stop themselves after an initial sounding, maybe 1s before they automatically turn themselves off.\n\nI've seen other users post about these issues here:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/gracvu/google_pixel_4xl_rings_once_then_goes_silent/\nhttps://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/13803902?hl=en\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/5g5ucp/disappearing_ring_and_alarm_volume_problem/\n\nI've tried clearing the app's cache and storage, clearing all app data (essentially factoring resetting every app on my device via the device settings menu), and playing with my notifications and do not disturb settings. Nothing seems to have worked. After clearing my Clock app's storage I did actually notice the problem go away for the next alarm, but then it returned the very next time after.\n\nNot sure what changed but none of the suggestions i've seen on this forum for similar issues have resolved this one. It's starting to get hard to live with.",

If this is the audio Call Screen is trying to transcribe, there\u2019s no question why it\u2019s struggling.\n\nHas anyone else encountered this problem? Are there any settings I can tweak to improve the audio quality? Is this a known limitation of the feature or the Pixel 2XL?

The issue appears to be with the Phone app however because the number type is mis labeled in my recent calls as well.\n\nThe issue is that for at least two of my contacts their number shows as \"mobile\" in my contacts app.  However when I try to make the call using Google assistant it tells me \"I don't have a mobile number for [Name Here]\".  When I open the phone app the mobile number is displayed as \"Other\" which is why the assistant isn't able to find it.  When I go into the contacts app there is no number listed as other for the contacts and the number that is showing up as \"other\" in the phone app is clearly labeled as the \"mobile\" in the contacts app.\n\nIs this a known issue?  If not, what is the resolution?  Thanks in advance .",

First, under security, the Google Play system update is stuck to 1 Feb, 2020, if I try to update it, 2 things happen: either it updates to 1 May, 2020, but after 10 seconds phones automatically restarts and reverts to the previous 1 Feb version, OR it downloads the current update but it cannot restart phone and I get an error message as follows: cannot update at this moment, please try again later.\n\nThis is the screenshot with the Google Play system update error.\n\n\n\nAll this wouldn't be a problem, as everything seems to work ok, play store updates apps & everything, but I came across this:\n\n2. Adaptive brightness, screen turning off during calls when I hold the phone to my ear, squeeze for assistant, tap to wake screen, flip to shh and tapping on the always on display have all stopped working. Tried testing these functions under safe mode, but only squeeze for assistant works.\n\nI also tried another complete wipe of the phone, clearing app settings, clearing cache for apps such as assistant, Google, Play Store and what not, but with no success.\n\nI read the forums up and down but nothing seems to work.\n\nDoes anyone else have this issue?",

    "content": "I have two google accounts on my phone and as a result, I've ended up with duplicate and useless contacts on my phone list. (The contacts app works very well [as it allows viewing contacts from individual accounts];  but the phone app merges all the disparate account contacts into one giant mess.) This isn't ideal.\n\nI have tried removing one account, turning off sync, adding the account back, turning on airplane mode, turning sync back on and then turning off sync for contacts. But this does not work because the contacts are synced immediately when the account is added. Evidently there is no getting around this.\n\nI have also tried clearing the cache and data for both the phone and contacts list. But this does not remove the synced contact data either.\n\nThe only effective solutions I've found are either, removing one of the google accounts or deleting contacts from one or the other account. Neither of these are good solutions.\n\ntl;dr: How can I get the phone app to only display contacts from one google account (on a phone with two accounts signed in)?",

Reinstalled all of these applications. I have removed my accounts from my phone. I have re updated Google and Google Play Services and nothing has worked. Now I'm unable to add my account back in to my phone and can't open many of my apps. Apparently there is no tech support line to call right now??? On top of that my voicemail has not been working properly with constant \"can't connect to voicemail\" error messages in the Phone app and several calls with Verizon have left me with no solution but to switch to Voxist which has worked okay. My Google Assistant also frequently fails to respond or hear voice commands...I've had nothing but problems and have had this phone for less than a year. I'm beyond frustrated but was denied a warranty replacement last time I called about these issues.",

    "content": "I bought my pixel 3a one month ago and everything was working great, but 10 days ago the phone started hanging up on calls. I can make calls, I have no issue with that but when someone calls me, I accept the call and it automatically hangs up (i don't even get a chance to say hi), it's so frustrating. I already tried restarting the phone but nothing changes. The software is up to date so i don't get what could be the reason. Nothing changed 10 days ago... i do answer correctly the calls.",

    "title": "HOW MANY MONTHS TO REPLACE HOT AS F PHONE. IT'S GOING ON 7 K THANKS",
    "content": "Why does google continue to disappoint?\n\nPixel 3 - people couldn't hear me well on calls. It's a phone that was known for not doing the one thing it's designed to do: be a phone.\n\nPixel 4 - got mine Dec 2. It started running hot as hell, especially when copy pasting in to the Google search bar. It would freeze and crash, I would copy paste again into the Google search bar and it would freeze and crash, then we got hot as hell, then say \"Google keeps stopping\" crash, then I could paste. This happened every time without fail. At minimum google as a company has one main function, that is to search. Now the phone is just hot all the damn time. Half the screen is slightly blue, it flickers on chats, this is all good stuff. I'm using the cases on your guys'website. When I take off the case the phone is so slick it just slides off, off of anything, doesn't matter. Voice texting went to trash REAL fast. Thanks. This phone is too hot to hold and voice texting doesn't work. (You guys sent a replacement btw after 6 months and it didn't stay on, I had to send it back. You guys signed for the return on Monday, it's Friday...why am I the one checking in on the status of the new replacement? The specialist has to wait for me to notify them before they investigate?)\n\nSINCE IM HERE:\n\nGoogle maps: There also should be away to turn off those road rage inducing traffic notifications. I KNOW it thinks it is the fastest route, it better be that's the default program in the app. I KNOW there's traffic, I KNOW how long it takes. I LOOKED it up before I said to start navigation. I can SEE the traffic. That's what the red bits on the map is for. Why do I need 3 announcements once I start?! Shut it! It is SO loud and SO jarring, waiting for turn by turn navigation then \"THERE'S A SLOW DOWN AHEAD\" yeah I am in real life too! I see the traffic. I live in Los Angeles, every few minutes is THERE'S A SLOW DOWN AHEAD, yeah bud we know that. This is not defcon 3 scenario stop distracting me while I drive to tell wtf I should be SEEING when I drive. Doesn't this contribute to the problem of people not paying attention to the road when they are driving because they expect technology to do it for them? Waze lets us turn off those alerts and keep the turn by turn only, you guys own Waze, figure it out please. \n\nNotification volume: Why did the ability to reduce the volume of specific notifications go away when you guys \"simplified\" the sound bar over a year ago? Everything is either one set of sounds is way too quiet and the other is LOUD, it actually hurts my ears, but we can't change it anymore. The navigation \"soft\" voice is ridiculously loud compared to any other sound operating at the time of use in my phone or the buds, this also used to be a stand alone volume option. \n\nPixel Buds: I'm not super thrilled with the pixel buds (they completely fell apart, the silicone outside pulled away and the mesh fell out. The notifications sounds are deafening, it doesn't read my texts when I ask it too after it tells me there's a new one). I just got the pixel buds 2 to replace my torn apart ones and they are comically staticky. The audio remixes on it's own. Sudden echo on a podcast, awesome \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffd\n\nGoogle podcasts app: how do you go from a usable very basic feature that already exists in play music and then make a worse stand alone app??? \n\nMini: I'm so glad I got this for free because I only use it to tell me the weather and set timers. Google assistant is not learning as promised. The home mini (everyday asking the exact same sequence of questions \"what's the weather\" > \"will it rain\" > \"what's the humidity\" > \"YES\" I've had this since launch and it has yet to figure out I want the whole weather report, nor can I make it a default). Also my assistant devices do not work well together. The devices still fight over which one will answer my question, sometimes the answer is read out loud when I'm looking right at my phone but when I'm in car mode, driving, or not touching a device on purpose with the screen locked it'll give me the \"here's a webpage\"  response, great cool thanks. I wasn't looking at my phone on purpose, now I have to look at it. When I ask a question to look up, maybe as simple as webpage I do want to see or an address, it's read out loud what the hell y'all?\n\nGoogle photos: Selecting multiple photos is tedious as hell. Come on. Building a collage is not flexible. Editing a photo in phone takes unnecessary hurdles, I should just click the photo, click edit and have ALL the edit options right there.\n\nWear OS: Also fights with the other assistants. Deleting inaccurate work out logs not possible. It freezes alot, crashes, overheats, all on par with the slick, impressive, google pixel 4. \n\n-I can import information from sheets to my calendar but not my calendar to sheets?\n\n-Why can't I limit which devices people have control over in my home network? I want to let my guests use the cast without also having control over my home mini speaker that is in my room. \n\nWho are your focus groups? Do they want to unify their lives with google because the current (lack) of inter-connectivity in the whole google world of apps and devices sure as heck doesn't feel like it. What on earth is happening over there? I'm giving up my data for this? At least make my life easier if you're going to collect data, put that collection to use. Run a test group of normal google users. People who rely on these things working to literally do their job, this is an investment for occupation, life management, not for just having shiny gadgets. Make them, make sense. This is costing us a lot of money for you guys to be so chronically disappointing. \n\nYour rep who keeps telling me everything will be fine, and the phone isn't that hot, it's not that bad so I sent ya'll a video of me using a thermometer on my phone showing it's 109F TO THE TOUCH...no thank you. \n\nAlso get a damn phone number. It hurts to hold my phone, so thanks for keeping this whole experience very physically painful.\n\nShout out to Andy G, the only rep who felt my pain of how stupid this whole experience has been. Too bad they're not a specialist so they can't help me \ud83d\ude43",

The person I am texting will get the text instantly even though it only says \"sent\" on my end and not \"delivered\" or \"read.\" After a couple of minutes my text will update to an SMS text that is light blue on my end, and the other person gets a duplicate.

    "content": "Hi everyone, \n\nThe issue I have is that, just recently, (in the past week) when I try and use the USB-C headphones (or regular headphones with the USB-C > 3.5mm jack adapter) my Pixel 3 won't recognise that the headphones are plugged in, and continues to play audio through the phone speaker (this applies to audio playback in all the apps I've tried and phone calls too).\n\nI've read a LOT of other posts here on this topic, but the solutions all seem to suggest that it's caused by either, fluff/lint in the USB-C socket (I have carefully cleaned the socket out), or suggest booting into safe mode as a fix (the problem persists in safe mode).  So none of these have worked for me.\n\nThe socket seems fine - I have had it plugged into my computer to transfer files across without any issues whatsoever, and the phone charges without issues. The headphones and dongle all work as they should in my partner's Pixel 3XL.\n\nTo add to my frustrations, the issue seems to be intermittent.  At one point when I plugged the headphones in BEFORE trying to make a call they worked, only to drop out mid way through the call, and then refuse to reconnect. I haven't been able to get them to work again.\n\nI also randomly get the USB-C android system notification popping up from time to time, prompting you to select how you would like to use the USB-C connection, as though the phone had just been connected to a device.\n\nI'm fairly technical, and my feeling is that this is a software issue, does anyone have any ideas?  I'm contemplating a factory reset at this point.\n\nThanks in advance for any input.\nG",

I cannot hang up since the screen continuously stays black and I can not exit this black screen in any way. Hence I always have to wait for the other person to hang up, and if I get voicemail I cannot hang up or type in any keys and I just have to wait it out. This is getting very annoying.\n\nI thought potentially my screen protector was to blame and that's why I haven't posted anything in this help center until now. However today I took my screen protector off and the proximity sensor still doesn't seem to work.\n\nI have tried everything, from rebooting my phone, seeing if it works in safe mode, cleaning my phone. Nothing seems to work. I downloaded AndroSensor and the value of my proximity sensor is always 0, which should only happen when my face is close by.\n\nHow can I fix this issue? Thanks in advance.",

    "content": "I've faced the problem of Telegram incoming calls in Do Not Disturb mode. The problem is when I turn 'override DND' on for Telegram incoming calls, there is no call sound. And when I have missed call, override DND becomes disable.\n\nTo reproduce this bug you need:\n1. Enable DND mode;\n2. Turn 'override DND' on for Telegram incoming calls in Android notification settings;\n3. Call yourself from someone else's phone (there will be no sound - this is the bug);\n4. Check Telegram incoming calls in Android notification settings (there will be disabled 'override DND mode' - this is the bug).\n\nHere's the video I recorded to demonstrate you this bug - https://photos.app.goo.gl/nToCKJ8zzquuzLcw8.\n\nDoes someone else faced this bug? Is that Telegram bug or Android DND mode? Can it be fixed?\n\nP.S. Sorry for my grammar mistakes, I keep learning. :)",

    "title": "Can Pixel (3a) play music stored on USB C flash drive?",
    "content": "I'm thinking about getting a Pixel 3a to use with Google Fi.  Fi to save money.  I don't stream music or videos now on another phone with other providers and generally use the phone for the apps and to check email rather than as a phone to make calls. \n\nI also play music, in the car and other times. I know Pixels have no SD card slot. I know I can put the files in internal storage, but that is for other things like data and apps too. I know I can stream from the cloud, but if I'm not on wifi as would sometimes be the case I'm using data and the meter is running.  I know I can store it anywhere and move files back and forth as I feel like listening to one thing or another, but that takes time.  I can play random files, select certain artists, songs, albums or some premade playlists etc with a music app. \n\nI haven't gotten a straight answer on if you can play music with an app on a USB flash drive.\n\nI know there are some flash drives that are quite compact.  I could probably leave them plugged in all the time and they would only protrude a little.  That would almost be like a SD card slot. \n\nHowever, if I do that, I don't have the USB C port, like would be nice to plug it in to a charger when in the car playing music. I'm thinking something like a compact USB C drive with a pass through port.  Maybe something made specifically to fit flush on a Pixel would be nice.\n\nI see no such thing in the Google store.\n\nI'm also trying to learn  how well this forum works.\n\ni did see one post where someone asked if you can store music on a USB C drive, someone else answered yes, they tried it.  The discussion was closed.  No further comments.\n\nWell of course you can store files on a flash drive.  I'm sure you can transfer them to.  The question isn't clear, nor is the answer.",

I went through all the troubleshooting with Google Fi support via calls, emails, and chat, including safe mode, vibration apps, every setting possible. They determined it must be a hardware issue, so I paid my insurance deductible and received another phone.\n\nNot a week later, same thing happened to second phone. I was either convinced there was a hardware flaw, or more likely a software issue. I didn't want to pay for another replacement phone, so I have just dealt with no vibration for three months.\n\nToday, I was pushed a phone update, and voila the phone vibrates for the first time in 3 months....I'm sharing this in case it is helpful to others who ran into this vibration issue, and to the community in case it helps pinpoint why the failure was occurring in the first place.",

I only have a month until I have no internet connection and I need this phone 24/7 so I suppose in the month I will try to find a fix. I think I'll try another ROM as well, since obviously the software Google produces doesn't accommodate all their hardware.",

    "content": "Pixel 2XL shows zero bars reception on 3G (4G is fine) since November OTA update. \n\nNo change following December update. Google Support replaced the device in January which worked fine for one week until catch-up November OTA reduced 3G reception again to zero bars. All other functions appear OK (except for dropped and missed calls). \n\nOn \"3G preferred\" setting phone connects, shows applicable number of bars (signal strength) for location but reverts to zero within 1 or 2 seconds & remains at zero bars \"hunting\" continually for a better signal. If it finds another cell, it connects as above then reverts almost immediately to zero bars. Cell Info app confirms both initial connection strength & the reversion to zero. \n   Google Support has offered to replace the device (again) but it seems highly unlikely given the sequence of events that a replacement device will fix this.\n\nHas anyone else encountered this?\n\nI have requested escalation for this issue; the response from Google Support say it has been forwarded but there's been no feedback from software support to them.  \n\nFor info:\nAndroid 10 latest security & devices fixes have been applied \nNetwork settings reset\nVarious SIMs tested no difference\nHTC 10, Samsung S7 tested with this SIM all work fine\nAP settings confirmed (& 4G works fine)",

Long pressing the contact brings up a menu to either copy number or edit number before calling. \n\nEssentially it seems that the only way to edit or view contacts is to scroll through to the entry you want. Using search only allows you to contact the contact, not view the entry. \n\nAm I missing something?",

I called my service provider and they said that voicemails are saved in the phone so they don't have any way to recover them. My phone does not have the option of retrieving deleted voicemails. I have found a couple of software applications that can do data recovery, but they require you to root your phone and I don't want to do that. Is there anything else I can do?

Have tried with two SIMs from different operators with identical results. These SIMs work flawlessly on other devices. Have restored factory settings, reset network settings and tried safe mode and hard reset number of times without effect. Have also experimented network settings behind *#*#4636#*#* without effect on functionality. Only difference is that if I restrict network only to for example GSM or LTE, other devide calling this Pixel gets fail response faster. If I understand terminology correct, Pixel in question is \"global unlocked\". Anyway a device without operator or geographic restrictions/bindings.\nI think problem came on \"slowly\", sometimes calls were successful and sometimes not, but now it is 100 % fail. I also experienced random mobile data and SMS problems on the same time this call issue arised but they seem to be past now.

On the other hand my parents are also on my account, who both have Samsung's and are having zero issues of any kind.  \n\nI have tried everything that's listed out there on the inter-web to try an resolve the issue.  APN settings, app settings, other mobile data settings, hard reboots, network reset, sim card pull, etc.....  I also tried putting my sim into a factory reset pixel 2, and still have the same result.  Only thing I have not tried yet is a total factory reset.  Tech support is non-existent at TW, which I have called 6 times now.  All other network settings are fine too, phone calls, texts, mms, and wifi have zero issues.\n\nAny comments, ideas, links for help would be awesome.  Thanks!",

    "content": "Hi, \n\nI have a brand new Pixel 3a phone (used it for two weeks now). And within the first two days of using it, it started overheating when the hotspot was on or when I was using WhatsApp Video and shutting down randomly. Zoom is impossible to do on the device, and it'll shut down within 5 minutes unless I have an iceblock on the back of my phone. Mind you, I am closing all apps running in the background and only connected to the data network of my provider. It started glitching during WhatsApp voice calls, sometimes turning the screen black (with not heat notification) and a frozen interface (all black). The only way I can get around this is to hold down the power button for at least 7 seconds to turn it off and on again.\n\nEach day I use it, the issue is growing more frequent and worse. It has been updated to the latest specs and it has plenty of storage space. I also have killed apps that I thought could be an issue, but every day when I try to use it for video calls, voice calls via the internet, or have it working as a hotspot it crashes miserably. \n\nSince it is a brand new phone, I think it may be an issue with the hardware.\n\nBest,\nAllison",

    "title": "Disable Contacts sync does not work",
    "content": "I have found that with my Pixel 4XL (or maybe it's Android 10) disabling Contacts syncing NO LONGER WORKS! With my older Pixel 2 it did work, and I would manually trigger a Contacts or Calendar sync when I wanted to. I have checked and double-checked all the settings (see below)... but it still syncs without me triggering a sync.\nThe settings I make are as follows ... Via Settings -> Accounts At the bottom of the main accounts page, there is a toggle named \"Automatically sync data\" with the text \"Let apps sync data automatically\". If this \"Automatically sync data\" toggle is ON and you then select your GMail account, and press the \"Account sync\" button, you are able to edit the(Google) apps you don't want to auto-sync (i.e. turn sync OFF). I do this (I switch all Google apps to off), and return to my GMail account page. I then see \"Sync OFF for all items\" in grey text under the \"Account Sync\" button (my upper case for OFF above). I then go back up to a higher level .. that is back to the main accounts page. The toggle \"Automatically sync data\" is still ON of course, and the grey text under it says \"Let apps sync data automatically\". I don't want this to happen, so I now set this \"Automatically sync data\" toggle to OFF. Here's the problem: after making this last change (i.e. \"Automatically sync data\" toggle to OFF), when I select my GMail account again, I now see \"Sync ON for all items\" in grey text under the \"Account sync\" button(my upper case for ON above)!! This is completely contradictory! How can it be that after first disabling auto-sync on all the Google apps and then switching off \"Automatically sync data\" Google signals \"Sync on for all items\" ?!?\nAnd here's the bigger problem: the above message is correct. Because if I leave the settings as above the Contacts does indeed continue periodically auto-syncing. (I know this because if I delete one of my contacts in the Google Contacts app in the cloud after a short period the same contacts on my phone disappear too! The \"short period\" can be anything from 3 to 30 hours).\nI have tried removing my Google account and adding it again, but without success. It seems to me that this is either (a) a bug in the \"Automatically sync data\" implementation .. OR .. (b) a deliberate implementation to either check data or mislead users.\nI have also tried all sorts of variations and checked Google account settings in the cloud too (not much there!), all to no avail. It seems I cannot now disable auto-syncing of Contacts ... If somebody thinks I'm missing something help would be appreciated?",

    "content": "When I make calls on my Pixel 3 the phone does not reliably lock as it should.  The proximity sensor works a little bit, but often allows the screen to be active while I'm talking on the phone.  My ear and cheek hit the screen and cause havoc.  It will open all sorts of stuff up, and the most frequent problem is that it hits the mute button causing me to cut out to the other caller.\n\nI have seen other posts about the screen staying locked, but this is the opposite problem.\n\nHere is what I have tried.\n- I thought it was a hardware issue but this is my THIRD replacement phone and all three have had the issue.  I have NEVER had this issue with any other cell phone and previously had a Pixel 2 with no issue.  I don't have a weird shaped face, but I'll admit to having larger than average ears.\n\n- I have tried resetting the proximity sensor, adjusting the sensitivity, and even installed 3rd party apps that adjust the proximity sensor.  This didn't work.\n\n- I booted in safe mode and the issue still happened.\n\n- I have tried moving to the beta phone app to see if the new version in beta fixes it.  It did not.\n\n- I have installed every patch as soon as it's out and am currently on the latest January release.\n\n- On my third replacement phone I didn't transfer anything over in case an app was causing the problem.  The issue still happened using the phone straight out of the box with nothing added to it.\n\nI am at a loss.  I'd like to keep the phone but at this point I'm thinking it won't be fixed and I need to return it.  Any ideas out there?",

    "content": "First, let me say that I understand how to access the four volume sliders for Media Volume, Call Volume, Ring Volume and Alarm Volume, and I understand that in current versions of Android, \"Ring Volume\" controls volume for both incoming call rings and notifications.  I also understand that many people have complaints about that coupling, and have adapted settings on the DND feature as workarounds for their issues.\n\nIn my case though, DND customization won't help.  I do want to be able to hear my ringer and notification sounds at all times.  Currently, I'm very happy with the volume when the phone is in my pocket, sitting next to me, on the other side of the room ... wherever.  It's fine, it's great, it's set at a little over 1/3.\n\nBUT ... when I'm ON a call and have the phone against my ear, the notification alerts come in at SUCH a high volume that I'm constantly yanking the phone away from my head and yelping in pain.  Sometimes a series of e-mails or messages will come through while I'm on a call, and my ears are literally left ringing afterwards.  This is going to cause long-term damage.\n\nI do need to be able to have audible alerts while I'm on a call -- no, I don't want to use DND to completely silence them, and no, I don't want my phone constantly vibrating while I'm on a call.\n\nThere are tons of volume control apps out there, but I haven't found any that will help me.  Does anyone know of an app that will let me customize in-call notification volume without also changing the standard notification volume for when I'm NOT on a call?\n\nAppreciate any tips or suggestions!

Another thing, I'm getting cellular data speed very slow. I think, there is a problem in sending & receiving cellular data. When I'm using wifi, messenger calls are clear. So, there is no device problem. I hope you will inform me what to do",

    "title": "How do I fix \"Pixel is Starting\" message that's stuck on screen?",
    "content": "Hope all reading are healthy and safe...\n\nPixel 3 on verizon still on Pie (9) with PQ3A.190801.002 build, which I believe is from August 2019. \n\nOne morning the other day turned phone on and stuck with a \"Pixel is starting\" message.  I can access settings and receive calls, when connected to BT in car can make calls too.  Cannot receive messages though receive \"You have new messages\" notifications, got an alert about a VM that I was able to access.\n\nI realize I can likely do a Factory Reset to fix THOUGH I do not want to go down that path without giving it a go trying to at the very least pull some data off the phone (texts, photos, videos). Yes, everything *should* be backed up...\n\nI tried connecting to computer to see if could recognize as drive and transfer files onto computer (Pixel and MTP USB drivers would not install- tried on two laptops running Win7). I know I should probably be updating to Android 10 and am fine doing so, but would like to recover files first. \n\n I posted some potential solutions below and am curious if there is anything I should attempt to do before/instead of possibly going with one of the 2 below.  \n\nThanks SO much in advance,\nMatt\n\nPossible easier solution: \nFrom _Ra1n_ on xda forums\n\"I couldn't fix the \"Pixel is starting...\" issue. Factory Flashing (after removing -w) QQ1A.191205.008 resulted resulted in being stuck at the \"G\" screen. I flashed the QQ1A.200105.002 factory image (again with -w removed) and was left in the same \"Pixel is starting...\" state.\n\nHere is where things get interesting:\n\nOver adb I launched the Settings app:\nCode:\nadb shell am start -a android.settings.SETTINGS\nNext, I went into \"Security,\" which prompted for my PIN, and then removed the screen lock. After doing this, I was able to get into /sdcard in the ADB shell, something that was not possible before.\n\nBack in the settings app, I enabled USB File Transfer and copied all my files & photos off. I was also able to launch apps from within the apps list in Settings. This let me export settings/data from other apps that allowed it. \n\nSo it seems that entering your PIN in the Settings app also unlocks the phone!\n\nPossible more complicated solution:\nFrom sic0048 on XDA forums\n\"Is you bootloader unlocked? If so, you can flash the factory image and remove the \"-w\" command as suggested above, but if your bootloader is not unlocked this will not be an option. If you are on a locked bootloader, you can sideload an OTA image (which really is a full factory image). This will not wipe your phone or do a factory reset. It will however replace your OS with a clean version. Hopefully that fixes the issue. If not, then you will have to do a factory reset in order to \"clean out\" the problem.\"",

I have been unable to get calls over Wi-Fi to function on my Pixel 2, which should natively support it. \nI have contacted the Google Fi support team and worked through the following troubleshooting:\nConfirm the OS is updated\nConfirm Messenger, Phone, Carrier Services, and Hangouts are updated\nConfirm the Wi-Fi connection is functional by using the web browser\nMaking calls over Wi-Fi while Airplane Mode is enabled\nAt this point, a technician was able to do a remote Opt-in for Wi-Fi that allowed me to make/recieve calls for approxemately 36 hours. When I was unable to make calls again, I worked through the previous troubleshooting in addition to:\nRestarting the phone in Safe Mode and attempting calls\nRestoring the phone to Factory Settings\nInstalling Hangouts Dialer (no longer supported) to make calls.\nWith Hangouts Dialer, I was able to make calls through that app, but no through the phone app. I was not able to recieve calls. After installing Hangouts Dialer we worked through all of the above troubleshooting steps through Safe Mode, as well as uninstalling and reinstalling Hangouts with no success.\n\nI was then advised to post my problem in the Hangouts Help community as well as here, and that a technician would be with me in a few minutes.",

The only offer I have to fix the phone will take 5-10 business days. Normally I'd be happy to wait, but I'm an ICU physician and working with critically ill COVID patients. I use my telephone at work to communicate, and missing phone calls from colleagues/nurses is not an option-even more so now. I don't know how to get in touch with someone who can expedite a phone replacement. Any thoughts?\nThanks,\nMike",

Interestingly, if I restart the phone or inactivate/reactivate the eSIM, the eSIM will work (ie. be able to receive calls) until I use the physical SIM again to make or receive a call - after that the eSIM will not be able to receive calls until I repeat the restart or inactivate/reactivate it.

    "content": "In the past week I've noticed an issue getting progressively worse with time to the point that my microphone won't work during a call.  I will have to switch over to speakerphone to use my phone.\n\nI've noticed that during both non-speakerphone and speakerphone calls that applying gentle pressure to the screen produces a clicking/crackling sound that can be heard on the receiving individual's end.  When in a non-speakerphone call, this clicking/crackling can also be heard through the earpiece.  \n\nThe phone was taken to a ubreakifix and they replaced all 3 of the microphones, however, the issue still persists.  They reached out to their help desk and to Google.  They were informed that the phone will have to be sent back to Google for repair or replacement as they will not let ubreakifix replace the motherboard for whatever crazy reason?  \n\nThis is very disconcerting as I won't have a phone for who knows how long.  I'm worried the OG Pixel microphone issues are coming back to haunt some of us.",

    "content": "Hello..\nI am the user of Google Pixel 3XL using Indonesian networking provider called XL since December 2019. Everything operated well during this three months. Suddenly on 22 March 2020, when I turned on my Pixel, its screen kept on and no response at all whenever I tried to press it. Then, I took off the SIM card from the tray and restarting the phone.\n\nSince that time, although I have already inserted my XL SIM Card to the tray as usual, my phone display always says \"No SIM Card, Emergency Calls Only\". On the SIM Status, it is said Not Available. I tried to insert the other SIM Card from the other Indonesian networking provider called Telkomsel, but the result is still the same, the SIM Status is Not Available. I reported to my carrier (XL Center). They replaced the old SIM card to the new one. I tried again and the result is still same.\n\nI inserted both of the SIM Card (XL and Telkomsel) to another phones and they work well. Why it cannot operate on my Google Pixel 3XL?\n\nPlease help me with the solution.\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\nThanks.\n\n\nRegards\n\nFeli",

With the developer of Z-Push I found out that this is a general Pixel problem (or Unix problem).\n\nI respect google and the Android coders it's not against you. I have just invested again several hours of searching and trying. A few facts about this case. I also thank you for any help and ideas and of course maybe a bugfix?\n\nFacts:\nI see birthday later than: 01.01.1970\nI don't see any birthday befor 01.01.1970\nI use the latest Android version for Pixel 3\nI use the default Android Exchange API\nI don't use any 3 party apps concerning calender and e-mail and I have never installed one\nThis problem is not seen on IOS\nIt's 22.03.2020 and I work in a software company as a software project manager and this issue can't be real at this date. Unix has been developped for more than 50 years and we still have baby bugs.\nI have googled this issue and it's not new.\nInstall an extra app is not a solution.\nIf Unix can't handle that then google has to fix that in Android",

    "content": "For at least two or three months I have been having problems with the Pixel Launcher on my P4 XL 128 GB.  The notifications are very delayed but only sometimes (more often then not though).  The prime examples of this are as follows:\n\n1) YouTube Music - When I have been listening to music and I swipe up to close the app YouTube Music still appears in the notification drawer for up to 10 seconds after the app has been closed.  \n2)  Phone Calls - After I end a phone call it will still appear in the notification drawer for up to 10 seconds afterward as if the call is still in progress even after the call has ended and the phone app has been closed.\n\nLast night a new issue also appeared.  I swiped down my notification drawer and all the items were blank (see picture).  I have already tried a factory reset and the issue still persists.  I tried booting into safe mode and it didn't do it, then I booted back into regular mode and it didn't do it either, but after a day or so it is back to doing the same thing again.  This is not a memory issue and the only apps running in the background are Reddit and the Ring app.\n\nThis is extremely annoying.  Any advice would be greatly appreciated.  The device has the latest March 2020 update applied.",

I have First Time Callers and Private/Hidden numbers set to Ring.  However, the phone still automatically screens all first time calls (even though I have that option set to ring).  It seems to be the \"Possibly Faked Numbers\" option that is causing that -- if I turn that off, first time calls do ring.  But if I turn that back on, all first time calls get screened.\n\nI opened a chat session with Pixel Support, and they told me this is normal because a first time caller is considered a possibly fake number....I'm not sure I buy that explanation.  Why would call screen have a separate option on how to handle first time callers if first time callers are caught by the \"Possibly Faked Numbers\" category?  Has anyone else had this same experience?  I want to screen Spam and Possibly Faked Numbers, but I don't want to screen all first time callers.  That doesn't seem to be possible.  I'm hoping someone else has experienced this and maybe found a setting to fix it.",

    "content": "Just got my first Pixel, a used Pixel 3 from the US that I'm using in Canada.\n\nI long ago moved to a full SIP solution for my voice calls, and like to use the native Android SIP client, which was previously working in my Essential PH-1.\n\nPixel SIP calls work fine over Wifi, and the signalling works fine over Mobile Data (i.e. incoming/outgoing calls will ring), but the moment that someone picks up the phone and the call attempts to establish a bearer (i.e. voice connection), the call immediately drops.\n\nI've done pretty much everything I can think of... wiped the phone and installed a new image, reset network settings, but the problem remains.\n\nThe one thing I think might be happening is that the phone might be somehow locked to not allow VoIP traffic over mobile data, which I know is a thing. Is there anyway to check that setting from the phone?  It wasn't a problem with the PH-1, so I don't think it's a network setting, unless it's a restriction that the PH-1 somehow avoided. It could also be something specific to the Pixel's APN handling, in case that's generally a problem?\n\nAny suggestions appreciated!",

After four weeks of working with my carrier at multiple levels they have determined that my phone is cutting off the country codes. I'm assuming the problem is Messages as my phone calls go through when originating from the same contacts. To make it even more fun, last week Messages decided to drop the 04 prefix that indicates a mobile phone and I am no longer able to text my teenager on her Australian cell phone. My version of Messages is well past the update that was supposed to fix this issue.",

However, the next time I enable DND, it forgets my exceptions and reverts to the default behaviors of allow calls \"From anyone\" and reverts messages to \"Don't allow messages from anyone.\"\n\nThis directly contradicts what I'm trying to accomplish with the exceptions rules in that I *always* want calls and texts to come through from starred contacts during DND, so I'm wondering if the reversal of my exceptions is considered a feature that most users want, because it's just an annoyance for me to have to check the same exceptions every time I enable DND as well as being potentially dangerous if I forget to check to see if my exceptions have been reverted and miss a text by a starred contact that I explicitly wanted to be allowed through.\n\nI experienced this on my Pixel 2XL and was surprised it still appeared on my brand new 4XL with latest patches.\n\nI posted this on issue tracker as well as searching here and didn't find others posting the exact problem I'm experiencing so that made me wonder if this behavior or reverting to defaults is by design.",

It is quite annoying and I don't want to manually re-add them in by looking through my texts and then inferring which contact it is.  \n\nAny help would be appreciated.

    "content": "All of my incoming calls are going straight to voicemail as if my phone is off when it's not. Do Not Disturb is not on and I've reset my phone as well as resetting network settings. This has been going on for a couple of weeks now and I didn't realize it until I checked my voicemail and had over 20 messages! I contacted my carrier and everything was fine on their end. I can make calls and send/receive text messages. When I go to the phone app settings and go to calls and then additional settings it tells me there is a network or SIM card error. I've taken the SIM out and re-inserted it and the issue remains. However, I did notice 3 scratches going down my SIM card and wondered if that could be the issue? But why would I be able to do other things?",

Calls were never interrupted.\n\nSince two weeks now, I have a Pixel 4 XL, and under the same circumstances calls abort all the time after 5-10 mins. It doesn't matter who I call (fixed or mobile network), or who calls me. It is definitely my VoWiFi.\n\nFor me it's hard to believe it's a network-side issue (with network I mean operator network), but I believe it must be an instability in the implementation of the Pixel 4 XL's VoWiFi client.\n\nAnyone else having this? Any recommendations how to track this down?\n\nMany thanks in advance for any help.\n\nKr,\n\nRalf",

    "title": "Quality / Call Issues - other side cant hear me for the first 2-3 seconds",
    "content": "Hey everyone,\nI'd appreciate some help with this issue, because the Google Support team has not helped at all unfortunately:\n\nThe issue:\nEvery time I make a call or receive one - in the first few seconds of the call the other party/side can't hear me. I say \"Hey\", but they can't hear me. They say \"Hello?\", and I reply \"Hey!\", and only then we can start the conversation.\n\nThe Google Support solution:\nI was told to try and turn on the phone in Safe Mode. Once I did, the issue seemed to have been resolved.\nThe CSR said this is probably due to an App that I have installed that's causing this, however - there is no way of knowing which. I have so many that it doesnt make sense to uninstall one-by-one and check if that helped or not.\n\nMy Solution (didn't work)\nFactory Reset. Very annoying, as its a pain in the A**. I had to make sure that once I log in to my google account after the Reset - it doesnt re-install the apps automatically. I did some test calls and it seems to have worked for a while. so I thought the issue was fixed, so I installed all my important apps when I needed them.\n\nAfter a while, I started experiencing the old issue again and again. No idea which app is causing it (if an app is even to blame, that is), or if it is and issue with the software of hardware. This SHOULD NOT HAPPEN in any case. Why does Google approve apps to its Google Play Store if they are (in theory) not compatible with the Google Phones or OS? \n\nI had the Nexus 6P before that and had call issues that were never resolved. I had hoped replacing it with the Pixel 3 would do the trick but it didnt. I am very frustrated and really like the Google phones, but I might not have a choice but to switch to and iPhone...  :(\n\nPlease prevent me from switching to and iPhone by helping my find a solution....\nThanks a lot in advance :)\nOri",

My wife also had a pixel 3a and has the same issues. We've had the phones about a month now. I've been in contact with the support team multiple times and my carrier multiple times. No one can seem to fix the problem. The only progress I've made is that my carrier said this is a known issue with the pixel 3a. I've left feedback twice and no response and also emailed the app help with no response. Very frustrating spending almost $1000 on these 2 new phones and not have them work correctly.",

    "title": "Pixel 2xl emitting full volume, constant white noise from mic at random?",
    "content": "As the title states, I woke up to a full volume, white noise sound (think old tube television \"snow\" static) coming from the microphone (bottom) of my Pixel 2xl at around 3 am. I'm not 100% sure it's the mic, but holding my hand near the base of my phone seemed to intensify the sound, reflecting the awfulness up towards my half-brained, sensitive ears at 3 in the morning. The phone was locked, and didn't indicate that anything or notifications were occurring on the lock screen.  Unlocking the device didn't stop the sound, and the device volume was already at the minimum (do not disturb mode, lowest/min volume). Quick pressing the volume keys, akin to an attempt at silencing an incoming call didn't work either. I finally did manage to get the sound to shut off after fumbling around in my alarm settings. I toggled all of my alarms off, then back on, then off again. The sound ceased once the last alarm was toggled off. At this point, I left all alarms in the OFF position then went back to sleep.  \n\nAt 7 am, the white noise sound returned, and ironically so, since my alarms were off and I have work in the morning.  I repeated the same steps of toggling alarms; on-off, then ending in the off position. \"I'm getting the hang of this right!?...\" The peculiar thing is that the problem worsened, and seemed to return in intervals of about 5 to 10 minutes (behavior was similar to the snooze functionality but without the alarm interface) as I got ready for work. At this point, I powered my phone off then back on, and thus since the noise hasn't recurred.  \n\nI've tried turning on all sounds, having friends call my phone, send texts, etc., and everything seems to be operating normally for now. I have yet to try setting more alarms to reproduce what might be triggering the noise, I'll report back if I find more results. Never the less, it's been unnerving to think that this might happen during a meeting, or when I least expect it.  Kind of like a crank is slowly winding on a jack in the box. \n\nHelp appreciated.\n\n\nPixel 2xl config at the time of the incident:\nDo not disturb mode on\nNo incoming calls\nNotifications muted\nAlarms set for 7:00 and 7:30 am \"on\" toggle position",

Has anyone else come across this before? I have had this phone almost a year but has just started. Thanks",

My business involves remote conference calls / meetings etc. and it's extremely frustrating being disconnected while something important is being discussed.\n\nAt some random points during the call, the mute/unmute buttons become \"stuck\" (can't unmute at all), and the call disconnects, the Google logo shows up on a black background for a few seconds, and the phone is back on the launcher / home page within seconds. It's not a complete restart, whatever that is, given how quickly it \"resets\". I'm not sure what's causing this but is there any way to undo the last update? Whatever it is, I can't afford to keep being disconnected from my meetings.\n\nThanks!",

This only happens a couple of times a week and while it is annoying I wouldn't have contacted Google over it.\n\nThe more infuriating problem that started happening a week ago is that all media and call sounds (YouTube, Spotify, Calls, any other apps) stopped working. The only sound my phone is able to produce is via alarms. (Headphones do work normally).\n\nI have tried rebooting, safe-mode rebooting, clear cache and other suggestions but nothing works.\n\nWhat's most upsetting is that Google Support in Japan is not responding to my inquiries (I am a resident in Japan). I have send at least five phone call requests and submitted a text feedback.\n\nIf this issue is not solvable I would like to request a refund or phone replacement, but I have no idea how since Google Japan is not answering me.\n\nI hope someone here is able to help me out. Help is much appreciated.",

Is there an app to do this (or an Android way to do it)?\n\nIt used to work on Android 8.1 and earlier: \nAndroid 8.1 and earlier had a feature that went along with \"Do not Disturb\" called \"priority only allows\" and it is described in the \"Do not disturb\" help pages.  This allowed you to allow apps through the do not disturb sound barrier. However I am on a newer version of Android and I can no longer use this feature. \nThis was a whitelisting feature I would like on the latest version of Android. \n\nit's been a few years and I am fed up with having to choose between being distracted all day and missing important messages and phone calls. \n\nSpecific problems: \n1. Do not disturb blocks my Google Play music songs.. I can choose to \"allow media sounds\" but I have to choose between allowing ALL sounds and NO sounds at all. \nI would like my music to play but I would not like web-pages with popup videos I am viewing to blare out at max volume in a quiet office. \nDo not Disturb in its modern form blocks either \"all messaging app notifications\" or \"no messaging app notifications.\" \nWhat if I want to receive notifications for the (text) \"messages\" app but not facebook messenger and whatsapp?\n(Messages is for business, whatsapp is for family and friends). \nI am aware that you can manage sounds for notifications in the App settings, but I have 141 apps on my phone (and am deleting a bunch now so that I don't have to manage their sounds). I cannot go through each one and disable notification sounds one by one and modify them, especially because each app has a different notification options menu. \nCan the default for all new apps be changed to \"no notification sounds!!??\" - How? \n Is there any way to manage a whitelist instead of a blacklist?",

    "title": "How do I contact Google for technical support for my Pixel XL.Appreciate your help.",
    "content": "Recently, I purchased a used pixel XL, that was officially certified refurbished. When installing and personalizing my pixel XL via my carrier, there was a problem getting the MMS downloads in my messages. When I clicked the blue icon with a downward arrow  to access a download, it would act as though it was 'working on retrieving' it (actively circling w/I icon) and failed to retrieve the download. The active circling within the icon continued endlessly without any results. I literally had to close page to get it to stop. My carrier said that the SMS is working properly but whenever we try to download MMS it was unsuccessful. I must have called five different times to get help on how to correct the problem and no one could figure out how to make it work. My previous phone, Samsung Galaxy 7 edge, was stolen so I had no way of transferring my contacts, photos, etc from that phone on to my pixel XL. Fortunately I had backed up everything onto Google so I could restore all my info in case my Galaxy 7 edge was ever lost or stolen. When it came to retrieving all that info, some of it was not retrieved. I originally had 173 + contacts and only about 70 we're actually retrieved. Things just got more screwed up from there. For some reason they had me sync my partners contacts in with mine (that's a long story) but basically what happened is all of his contacts were deleted, I guess during the syncing, and that's when I lost over a hundred of my contacts as well. So here I sit after 5 calls for technical support from my carrier and I am left with a partial list of my contacts, my partner's contacts are nowhere to be found along with the rest of my contacts and it's still can't download MMS messages. My phone still processes SMS texting in message without any problems. Finally the last few people I spoke to told me I needed to contact Google to correct the problem. I don't know how to contact Google, technical support and I'm at the point that I'm overthinking everything and very little makes any sense right now. I think that's called burnout and I've only had this phone a week.\nI'm hoping to at least get a phone number for Google technical support. Ideally there might be a miracle worker out there who can guide me through the process of locating the problem correcting those things that need fixin and retrieving all of the lost contacts not to mention photos, etc plus a large amount of journaling & lots of otther notes. \nCan anyone out there help out...I'd be grateful for just a Google # & delighted if they could guide me in fixing anything. I was so excited to get a Pixel.\nI've got the time and patience to try this again with someone out there in 'answer land'.\nThanks for reading my hugely lengthy message. \u270c\ufe0f",

    "content": "Hello my Google Pixel 4 has stopped making ringtone sound and notification sounds, and some days ago started to make weird sounds while recording, like a low buzzing noise. The ringtone and notification issue has been going on for maybe two weeks where it happened while I was watching a youtube video. The sound of the video suddenly cut off for a little bit making weird noises and got back to normal. But after that I don't get notifications or calls, missing the whole purpose of having a phone- that it rings. It also stopped vibrating with calls so I have no idea when someone calls me. It is quite frustrating. \n\nWhat I have tried to fix it:\n- Checked do not disturb, no it is not on- I have turned up the volume.\n- Changed ringtone or notification sound, no it did not work they don't even preview. But I can play media sounds.\n- Turned off and on my phone\n- Factory reset\n- Safe mode\n\nI do get notification sounds if I am playing media sounds and it overlaps, but the ringing does not do that.\n\nI bought my phone around 7th December.",

For example my wife's name is Karolina. There are two identical Karolina contacts. If I click on the top one and then try to edit it, I get the message \"Failed to open editor\". When I click on the second Karolina contact, I can edit it and everything. And if I delete the first, uneditable Karolina contact, it deletes both contacts.\nThis same thing applies to a few of my contacts and usually ones that I communicate more often with.\nI also noticed a contact that used to be named Pesho, but then a few months ago I changed the name to something else. Right now there are two Pesho contacts in the Google Phone -> Contacts tab. There is no Pesho contact in the Google Contacts app.\nAny ideas on how to clear this mess?",

    "content": "Since the unnecessary \"overhaul\" of the Do Not Disturb feature some months ago, I have been unable to find a way to completely silence my pixel 2 phone. Specifically, incoming calls through WhatsApp always make the phone ring NO MATTER what. Based on some research, it seems WhatsApp classifies incoming whatsapp calls as \"High priority notifications\" and that causes those notifications to override DND.\n\nIf anyone is aware of a setting/feature that I may be missing that would resolve this issue, please provide some information. If not, this seems to be a classic example of over-engineering by Google (similar to their messaging platforms saga). I don't blame WhatsApp for this issue since DND is (or should be) a system level setting and individual apps should not be able to override that, otherwise it defeats the whole purpose.",

    "title": "Pixel 2XL buggy since Android 10 update. Camera, Photos, Google Play apps",
    "content": "I've been having problems with my phone (Google Pixel 2XL) since I updated to Android 10 this morning.. It took a long time to install, but that wasn't the problem.\n\nMy problem is that the Camera app doesn't save my photos anymore. The \"last taken\" photo is a grey picture and every time I tried to snap a photo, I'll get a \"Processing HDR+\" notification and then nothing; the photo wasn't saved. When I tried to take a screenshot, it fails to save as well. \n\nWhen I open up my Photos app this morning, it initially showed my old photos and when I tried to delete anything, it turned white but wouldn't delete. So I did \"Free up space\" and deleted all the photos in my phone, so it's now empty. After clearing cache and storage for the Photos app, I was prompted to choose my settings and log into my Google account again, then it proceeds to \"Getting your photos...\" before crashing 2 minutes later.\n\nAfter searching Google's support forums, XDA and reddit, I tried clearing cache and storage (Camera, Photos, and Play Store app), force stopping the app, rebooting the phone in safe mode and rebooting normally again (probably did this more than 10 times), tried updating my apps in safe mode and normal mode but my Play Store kept crashing before any updates could be downloaded or installed. I then saw a few people fix their problems by allowing all permissions for the apps, so I did the same but to no avail. \n\nThe only thing I've yet to try was a full factory reset, but I'm hoping I wouldn't need to do that as I've read that other users tried resetting and their issues are still not fixed. I'm thinking that's gonna have to be my last resort, as I did not do a full backup of my phone before the Android 10 update.\n\nI can use my phone for regular apps like Whatsapp, Facebook, Instagram and still make phone calls, but I can't use the camera or check my photos.. Surprisingly, I am able to take photos from the Whatsapp app and send those photos as messages, but I can't attach anything from my gallery. I do use my phone for games as well, most will work albeit a little laggy, but some will freeze completely and would not register any touches or taps; just freeze for a solid minute before crashing. \n\nTaking photos is what I bought the Pixel phone for and I can't use that right now which is a real shame as the camera on this phone is really good. Is there a way for me to downgrade back to Pie to get the functions back? The ideal situation would be to fix my problem while keeping Android 10 but I'm desperate.",

    "content": "Hi,\n\nI have a 1st generation Google Pixel. I have been having problems with the phone for months now. I can't make or receive calls. When I receive a call, I answer and then the phone freezes and I have to restart the device by holding the power button long enough. Sometimes I answer it and it just returns me to the call menu (I don't know what its called, the menu when you receive a call where you can accept or reject the call). Sometimes it does successfully accept the call but there is no sound. And very rarely I accept it and I can hear the other person but the sound cuts like 20 seconds into the call. Same problems when I try to make a call as well. And not just with the Phone app, same problems occur when trying to use WhatsApp call. I have tried disabling some services, tried deleting the updates for the Phone app, tried deleting some apps and then all apps, tried Safe Mode, Factory Reset with my apps restored and Factory Reset with none of my apps/settings restored. None of it worked so far (after all that I am convinced this is a hardware issue, not a software issue). The screen is cracked on the top left corner (I don't know if its related). I would like to know, which part of the phone needs to be changed/repaired, which hardware component is the cause of this problem? I love this phone, and if this problem is fixed I want to keep using it. Since I live in Turkey, I cannot send it abroad for replacement because the tax I would pay for the replacement device is just unbelievably high. And since Google left the Turkish market I have no place to go in Turkey as well. If you could tell me what is the problem, what needs changing, which parts are the cause, if you could tell me the solution I might get it fixed through a 3rd party repair shop, and keep using this awesome phone.\n\nThanks in advance.",

The problem I have with this is when I receive the call and I reach in my pocket to pull out my phone, often my finger will touch the screen and send input, which has caused unintended actions, such as accidentally answering a call before I even get my phone out, accidentally using the screen call feature, or accidentally denying the call.\n\nI believe the Pixel 3a must have a sensor on the front of it, so I think it should be able to use this to determine if it's in a pocket, or face down on something, etc, like for the do not disturb feature.\n\nThe solution that I'm looking for is to receive the call or text, but the phone not respond to any screen interaction as long as the sensor believes the phone is in my pocket, then when I retrieve the phone from my pocket, I can then interact with the screen.\n\nI am not interested in any third party apps to solve this issue, as I do not trust apps.  That is correct, I use smartphones and I've only ever used probably less than 10 apps from specific developers that I trust.\n\nThanks in advance for any help provided!",

    "content": "If I answer a call with the phone in my pocket using my BT headset the screen will often awaken (unknowingly) in my pocket and screen presses become possible occasionally resulting in muting the call or ending it (from inside my pocket). Should the proximity sensor not disable this as the phone is covered ? The sensor works fine using the earpiece. I don't think its a hardware issue, more of a software logic problem.",

    "content": "Hi,\n\nI bought my phone Pixel XL pre owned by someone else around June 2018. It was working all fine and it functioned as a very normal phone ever after about a month I wasn't able make calls like the others cant hear what I'm saying (no mic) etc. I'll soft reset the the phone (volume up+power ) and it would come back to normal and slowly eventually all my audio had stopped. Like my headphone jack wouldnt work and then the speakers wouldn't work I can't make calls it'll tell me the phone stopped working and then system ui has stopped working and so on. I can't record audio while taking videos it would say another app is using the mic. I have been having a very hard time with this. And I'm not the only one the other people who have experienced the same problems are either from 2017 or earlier who got the problem as soon as they bought them so sent it back and got new ones I didn't buy it from a shop literally a dude I met on dubais Craigslist ( Dubizzle) \nTried telling him about the problem he had no idea and told me stfu (literally stfu). Then I tried resetting it a lot of times doesnt help and then gave it to a shop they didn't know what the problem was. And I am based out of Dubai. We don't have Google repair centres here, other people had got free motherboard replacement as that was what the issue was. Please Google I beg you I love my phone and I can't afford to get another phone and move on I want you people to figure this out and get my phone fixed. And nothing can be done through these threads and forums I seriously need attention from Google. Please contact me. Thank you. Anybody who can help?. Please and thank you",

    "content": "Hi\n\nAnyone experiencing continued problems with voice calls?\n\nSo the problem i'm getting is that when i'm using the phone in my office (and many other locations too) people can't hear me.  They complain that i'm either too quiet or in a tunnel, so i have to find a decent spot, don't move and shout to be heard.\n\nBut's it's not the network.  Am also having to use an old Samsung Galaxy S5 and it's as clear as anything, no issues.\n\nI had a situation yesterday when a customer couldn't hear me on a normal voice call and we had to switch to a WhatsApp call, which was totally clear.\n\nAnd it's not a one off Pixel 3 phone either.  Been in touch with support, who are all very friendly and help out but all i end up is going through various steps like updating the phone, go into safe mode and then reset the phone.  Still with no solution in site.\n\nAnd so i've followed the next step of sending it back to them and getting a replacement.  Three times!  So i've had four Pixel 3s with exactly the same problem.\n\nAnd today's offer by the support team, who promised to \"look at all the options available once we've gone through the process\", is to yet again offer another replacement.\n\nI'm not sure when this will get resolved, if ever.  10 phones?  15 phones?  Or perhaps wait until it goes out of warranty and then it's not a Google problem any more.\n\nBeen told that as i bought it through a retailer, nothing else can be done.  Of course something else can be done (they make a few billion profits don't they?!?!) but that's the standard line i'm being fed.\n\nI'm really not sure anyone can help but here goes a post anyway!\n\nCheers\n\nNigel",

    "content": "Hi all, \n\nstarted having sound issues with my pixel recently (I have had it around 6/7 months). Had issues last week when my mum tried to call and I couldn\u2019t hear her although other calls were fine so put that down to signal issues (although now not so sure). I noticed today when on instagram I was not hearing any sound from the videos.got family members to call me and I could hear my ringtone but could not hear them speak. I tried playing Netflix and Spotify and also no sound at all. \n\nLooked online and tried a few things - turned off blue tooth, put onto safe mode, hard reset, disabled google play app. One person suggested cleaning the earphone slot and I tried that and it then seemed to wrk and was able to make a call! But three hours later... no sound again! (Although I do hear my phone ring and sound when headphones are plugged in)\n\nI\u2019ve noticed lots of posts online where others have had the same issue and I wondered if anyone else has any other suggestions?\nI have switched it off for the night and will try again in the morning.\n\nI am beginning to feel VERY fed up with this phone - I had issues after having it for about a month where it would switch off in my pocket and I would need to do a hard reset to switch it back on. I took it to EE where I got it and it was sent off for a repair after I read this was a very common fault with the phone but they sent it back to me and told me it was water damage which I didn\u2019t believe (they didn\u2019t even open the phone). The problem seemed to go away - I think it may have been a software issue. \n\nCompletely unreliable phone - great to use but all these problems are NOT worth it. I use it at work (I work at a field centre) and need it when I am the oncall supervisor overnight when children and students are staying on site. Very frustrated with google and EE.\n\nThank you for any help - any suggestions appreciated!",

    "title": "Google does not honor Pixel warranty",
    "content": "I purchased a Google Pixel 2xl on eBay, and then the camera stopped working (the main reason I bought the phone). I contacted Google who confirmed that my phone was originally bought from Google Fi and was still under warranty, and therefore eligible for replacement. Google transferred ownership of the phone from the original owner to me in their computer system, which is required to process a replacement. They requested my proof of purchase, which I provided. However, since filing my warranty claim 38 days ago, Google has refused to send me a replacement phone. \n\nI have been transferred continuously from their tier 1 support to tier 2 and tier 3 support, all who will not give me a valid reason why they will not send me a replacement. Most recently, I have been told by two different tier 2 support representatives that Google will not issue a replacement because my phone was bought on eBay. However, I have confirmed with 7 Google phone representatives and 6 Google chat representatives that a Pixel phone that was originally bought from Google Fi and then resold on eBay retains its warranty. According to Google policy, reselling a Pixel phone on eBay that was originally purchased from Google does not void its warranty. Still, Google is denying my warranty claim for this reason, which is a violation of my warranty, Google policy, and my rights as a consumer.\n\nRecently my IMEI was mysteriously blacklisted, and I could not use my phone for one week, whereas it had no such problem in the 6+ months I had owned it. Since Google is the original seller and service provider of my phone, they are the only company that could blacklist my IMEI. After contacting Google, my IMEI was suddenly and mysteriously removed from the blacklist. Google has confirmed that my phone is not blacklisted, and that my phone has not been reported lost or stolen. But Google has not said they were responsible for the blacklist, even though they are the only company capable of this.\n\nI have spent upwards of 25 hours working on this matter, on the phone with Google support and corresponding with them by email. On two occasions I called Google Home and the representative was attempting to transfer my call to Google Fi, but Google Fi declined my transferred call. They refused to speak to me two times, with two different representatives. Recently I have experienced my support calls and chats suddenly disconnecting without explanation, something that has never happened before. Something strange is going on at Google support, and it seems the support representatives are acting manipulatively and dishonestly.\n\nI am simply trying to get my phone replaced due to a hardware malfunction, which is covered under warranty. I am the owner of the phone in Google's computer system, I have provided Google my proof of purchase, and my phone has not been reported lost or stolen. There is no reason for Google to deny my warranty claim. However, I have been manipulated and misinformed by Google support staff, given conflicting information, ensnared in endless bureaucratic delays and excuses, and had my IMEI temporarily blacklisted. This is the worst experience I've had with any consumer product in my life.\n\nI seem to have exhausted all my options to pursue this matter with Google support. What should I do next?\n\n(Attached are screenshots of emails from two different Google support representatives denying my replacement because my phone was purchased on eBay. I have also attached a screenshot of an email from Google confirming that my IMEI is not blacklisted, and my phone has not been reported lost or stolen.)",

    "content": "My pixel device was manufactured in Oct 2016. Once i face the issue, I had contacted the Google support and they had collected device from me and sent to the Service factory. Got response from service factory that device is working fine and again after 2 days same issue occurred. \n\nSent back the device to service factory through authorised support team and got back device mentioning that no issue was observed. Again faced the issue next day and sent back the device to factory. Now the technician is coming back telling that there is an issue with Motherboard and it needs to be changed and it will cost me around 20k.\n\nI had tried SAFE MODE, Factory reset. Issue was persistent in both the modes. Got some blogs where in USA, Google had replaced/repaired the devices with this issue.\n\nhttps://www.greenbot.com/article/3179145/google-responds-to-pixel-microphone-issues-with-official-replacement-program.html\n\nHope this replacement policy is supported in other parts of the world where people have bought Pixel phones. Not sure whether to go about for the motherboard change. Would be helpful if Google takes proper action not only in USA but for all the phones manufactured and issue reported. Please let me know how can i take up this issue - pay the 20k amount or could contact teams from Google.\n\nGoogle support team is not so helpful to check the issue occurrence and how to deal with its customer. Customer support was not upto mark which everyone expects to be in.",

    "title": "My 1st Gen Pixel XL reading no SIM card now?",
    "content": "I purchased a second-hand 1st gen Google Pixel XL 'Really Blue' (such a beautiful phone btw) about 1.5mo ago and everything was working 100% when I purchased it. I was primarily going to use this phone simply because of the camera, which 1000% better than my Note 8 daily driver. However, after a week of reminiscing of when I owned the smaller Google Pixel in the same color. The UI, the quality, honestly the overall everything of the phone is just so pure and far more enjoyable than any phone I have used to date. This meant going back and forth between using my Note 8 and the Pixel XL as my daily drivers, which meant I would be able to use the phone for calls, text messaging, and data. All of that worked good and fine up until about 2 weeks ago now. It is tragic to say the least, but it is far worse: now I cannot use the phone period anymore since having the issue aforementioned as my title.\n\nI have literally tried everything under the Sun for troubleshooting, even going as far to unlock the bootloader, flash previous versions of Pie and I went as far as flashing 8.1 Oreo. I figured it was a software issue hence why I went that far and the reason I went that far is because the other day, I inserted my Verizon SIM from my Note 8 and I say the service icon in the status bar show up for a split second, and then disappear as soon as it popped up. So, something is sort of working, but not. It could be hardware; it could also just simply be software. Oh, no water/moisture damage and I have not dropped it since I had it. The previous owner did, but again, it worked fine even so.\n\nAgain, I purchased this second-hand as a private sale, not through my carrier. Going to them would be futile in essence simply because Verizon enjoys making their customers jump through hoops. I digress... I have referred to XDA and Google Search in an attempt to find someone with the same issues I am having and then I stumbled across the Pixel Community Hub (this wonderful place) and found that my issue is apparently a big issue. I am posting another thread simply because I was not satisfied with the answers I was reading. I am looking for a somewhat more advanced answer I guess, if I can even get one. I am considering to root my device and see if that helps and try to dig through system phone/modem apps and sort out the issue (if even possible). Honestly, the SIM reader could just be broken, but this was a last chance effort before I give up 100%.",

    "content": "MMS (such as photos) sent to the number that's set up as my default for data and phone calls get sent as a group message with the person sending the MMS/photo, my default number, and my *other* SIM number.\n\nFor example, if I'm texting with someone on my default number and they send a photo, the photo appears in a different group thread between the three numbers mentioned above. SMS continue to go to the original thread.\n\nMy setup: Optus on my virtual SIM as default data and voice; Google Fi on my physical SIM as my secondary number. I regularly use both to text. MMS sent to my Fi number don't seem to have this issue.\n\n(One thing I mean to try (but haven't yet) is whether turning off the \"receive MMS\" advanced option for my secondary Fi number will solve the issue on the main Optus line. With that off, I won't be able to send or receive MMS on my secondary line at all, but at least it will narrow down the problem if correct. I will update this thread as relevant -- would appreciate any advice on the meantime.)",

I have worked long and hard with Google support on this trying to understand why.  Google is stumped.  Is anyone else unable to access the new Automatic Call Screening feature on their pixel 4 phone? At this point I am going to have to do an FDR apparently and if that doesn't result in it appearing then I guess the phone is defective.    if anyone has any insight before i factory reset (which won't fix the issue i'm sure), i appreciate it.  I am guessing a phone replacement will be coming down the line if this isn't resolved.",

If VoLTE doesn't work, does that mean I can't make regular phone calls?  \n\nBasically, I'm not too knowledgeable when it comes to the tech sides of phones.

    "content": "Latest update (December 7, 2019 update) broke the phone app, specifically I cannot use dialpad only while in a call. I confirm this issue is isolated to the latest update of this app, because when I factory reset the phone app the dialpad is able to appear again while in a call. \n\nTo describe the issue in detail: During a call, the icon to toggle the dialpad is there, but tapping on it just highlights the dialpad icon and the actual dialpad never shows up. For example, this means I can't key in an extension or the passcode to access my voicemail while in the call. Other google phone users have reported the same experience under recent reviews for this app on the play store, presumably after having updated to the latest version of the phone app.\n\nI'm on a Pixel 2 running Android 8.1.0. The issue could be limited to this version of Android, but phone users who are stuck with Android Oreo, e.g. Nexus 6P users, would have no recourse to fix this unless they are able to factory reset the app.",

I was travelling and had SO MUCH trouble with my phone. \n\nThe phone screen would randomly go fuzzy (see image attached) and i would have to wait till it dies for it to restart and work. When it does start working, it becomes super slow and freezes. I have contacted google while abroad and they made me go through all the steps to reset phone and even tried factory reset. This did not help and so they told me I needed to be back in USA to get my phone replaced.\n\nI have warrantly on my phone so they should replace it as it seems there is some internal issue with the phone itself but I have contacted Google support more than 5 times now and they are just stalling. The first few times, i was told they have an issue to place the replacement order and they will contact me in 24 hrs which they did not.  Once I contacted them again, they put the order in and i even recieved a confirmation email but a few minutes later i got another email that they cancelled my order. \n\nI have since contacted them many times and the only response i get is that it has been escalated to a manager and that they have a bug issue in their system. It has been over a week now... I have asked for a time frame and if  this effects just my order specifically or is a global issue but they have not provided me any info. \n\nThey have not even gotten back to me, theres no fix, and my phone is so buggy that I am missing calls etc. At this point, I feel like Google is just waiting for my warranty to be over so they dont need to replace my phone. This is the worst experience ever....\n\n\nAnyone else facing similar issues?",

Even with no bars of wireless and the same powerful, fast, WiFi connection I just installed 10 over, there is no indication that Verizon WiFi Calling is the active connection.

    "content": "I have first gen pixel buds, and they constantly give me 2 problems. \n\nProblem 1) I can put the buds on, and they're connected to my phone, and I'm watching a YouTube video or something. Then I receive a phone call, and as soon as I answer the phone call the pixel buds disconnect from my phone and I have to reconnect them mid-call. It's gotten to the point where whenever anyone calls me they immediately know to wait a few minutes for me to reconnect my pixel buds\n\nProblem 2) the buds don't have a good connection with the case anymore. When I put the buds back in the case, it doesn't always register that they're in the case, the green light doesn't go on, and as a result, my phone will connect and disconnect to the buds several times even though the buds are put away and stored. \n\na) What can I do to eliminate these problems?\nb) Have these problems been addressed in the next gen pixel buds?",

So, for example, when stuck in a major traffic jam, I can't telephone my destination to let them know that I'll be late.\n\nSo\u2026\n\nHow can I make calls and open apps (such as Waze) hands-free while driving?\n\nThanks",

The app was also reinstalled as per Google help assistant's suggestion\n\n\u2022 The phone has been restarted and everything along with the grills being cleaned to clean off any dust particles.\n\nNOTE: there is a skin that covers the third microphone on the top edge but no audio still if you talk to it.\n\nAny advice?

Without restarting the device, I've force closed the app, cleared the cache, and reopened Messages to no avail usually. I thought maybe it's a certain phone number doing it, but that's a stretch because it ends up impacting almost every single notification coming in (some notifications will take 30 minutes to over four hours to come in) but some will come in no issue. This includes voicemail which is why I thought maybe it had something to do with phone calls since I get spam calls that leave VMs. Those are usually the ones that make me realize I am not getting notifications or if someone hasn't texted me in a while.

During early use, when tips & hints were popping up occasionally, I noticed a blurb that commented on what was expected to be seen in the Recents list. I dismissed it too hastily to grasp what it said.\n\n2. Shortly after, I made calls to 2 back-to-back service providers found in Yelp. Looking at the Recents list a short while later, Recents showed my call to only 1 of those 2 companies. One call wasn't in my list of recent calls. Odd.\n\n3. In the Phone app menu at top right, I found Call History, which shows an exhaustive list of every made/received/missed call (including that 2nd company I'd called earlier).\n\n\nQuestions:\n\na) What algorithm does the phone use to filter/shorten/modify the Recents list relative to the comprehensive Call History list?\n\nb) If a) doesn't provide an obvious answer, *why* is the call history trimmed when displayed in Recents?\n\nc) Can I set my phone to show Call History in place of Recents, as my preference is that the default list should be comprehensive, not filtered?\n\n\nThank you very much,\n-Jason",

Initially, they told me the issue had been escalated and I would receive an email within 24 hours.  I did receive a canned email, which didn't address my issue, and I responded to it.  I have never heard back from that email.  I then proceeded to call google again.  This time I asked for a supervisor.  I was told one would call me back withing 5 minutes.  It never happend.  So I called again.  This time I was told a supervisor would call back the next day.  No one called.  Then yesterday, I chatted with another person, who told me that I would receive an email from a supervisor within two hours (chat  ID 0-6526000028390.)  I have still not received an email.  \n\nUltimately, what I was able to find out (or seemingly find out ) in over 5 hours of calls to google was that the refurbished device that was sent to me was still listed as \"pending return\".  Unfortunatley, no one I've spoken with has any idea of how this will be addressed or when I will receive a functioning phone.

Two weeks later 7 phone calls, I was hung up on once, 15 emails, 1 chat, if I get a response I'm told escalations is on it or that Chris will call me back in 24-48 hours(from whatever time I am calling).\nGoogle is breaking the terms of the Preferred care agreement as of today.\n\nIs there a way I can get someone to help me with this, someone not on the Google Store team?

Not wirelessly, nor through a direct connection with the original charger. It says \"plugged in, can't charge right now\" \n\nI've been trying to reach Google support as of Sunday but the repair center keeps informing me to wait for business hours, but I've checked every hour for the entire day yesterday and at no point was it available for me to chat or request a call. I couldn't even find an email. Their help center is one big runaround and i cant believe its so frustrating to deal with. \n\nI've been hunting the internet feverishly for some sort of help but really, everyone is saying its grounds for a RMA, but i cant even get into any sort of contact with google because they refuse to become available. Not via phone support, not via chat. So im currently stuck with a dead pixel 3 that i cant even get into to send feedback.\n\nSafe mode doesnt work, switching off and charging doesnt work, resetting doesnt work, forgetting connected devices doesnt work. Really nothing has worked.\n\nHere's to hoping for something new and some sort of reaching out from google.\n\nSo this is my last attempt at finding some solution.",

I now want to retask the old Pixel 2 and use it over my local WiFI network as a handset for making SIP calls via a local server; ie no access is needed to the cellular network. This is something I've done several times in the past with previous Google phones, using the regular phone app, but I can't get it to work on the Pixel 2.\n\nWhen I try and place a call, specifying the option in \"Make calls with\" to \"Ask First\", the app asks me to \"Choose SIM for this call\" but both items on the list (the eSim and the SIP account) show as greyed out. Note if I re-enable Google Fi on the phone then both items show as enabled, and I can make the SIP calls, suggesting it's something to do with the eSim.\n\nNote that the phone DOES receive SIP calls, so it is provisioned correctly to the server. Also If I return an incoming SIP call then, the outbound call goes through - presumably because the number to dial is unambiguously a SIP number (number@server.ip).\n\nSo anyone know how to work round this using the standard dialler app? I've tried disabling the eSim. using airplane mode etc., but no luck",

    "content": "About a third of the time, when I receive an incoming call and I answer it there is no sound. The phone screen shows I am connected and it starts timing the length of the call, so it looks like it is working fine. There is no sound. I might hang up 10 seconds later after saying Hello many times. If I immediately call them back then my phone gets stuck on Calling for 10-30 seconds, I usually give up and then try again after a minute.\n\nI would say about 1/3 of the calls I receive have this issue. When I call back the other person they say it just kept ringing, they never heard me answer the phone until my voicemail picked up.\n\nI did have the issue with being stuck on Calling immediately after Android 10 was installed (which I did with an OTA update) and removed My Verizon app which solved the issue when that happened with every single call. I have never reinstalled this app, and have verified it is not installed.\n\nMy phone is the Pixel 2 with Android 10, Oct 6 2019 security patch level. I use Prepaid Verizon as my carrier. I did not have this issue until Android 10 was installed. I do have a Google Voice number that forwards calls to my cell, however at least some of the calls were direct to my cell number and had the same issue.\n\nAny thoughts on what could cause this, does anyone else have this issue?",

I've noticed since we switched that we can both hear every environmental sound and voice when we call each other, as if the noise suppression on the mics isn't working at all. This definitely wasn't the case with our previous Pixels.\n\nWe're on T-Mobile, and WiFi calling is disabled. We both have the same \"Made By Google\" case on our phones, and I've tested the case theory that someone else had posted about the holes not being large enough, and there was no difference.\n\nI'm not sure where the issue lies, but while the clarity of each others voices is vastly improved from our previous phones, the amount of noise we can both hear makes it almost impossible to hear each other at times. \n\nAny thoughts or suggestions would be appreciated!",

On my previous phone (an iPhone 6), even though the phone was on mute, I would still hear the ring tone via my headphones: on the Pixel 3XL, I don't hear the ring tone via headphones so often miss calls. Is there anyway to resolve this? Many thanks",

I'm looking at the calendar on my old phone and the birthdays come up because it's the iPhone contacts and not google.  Is there any way to transfer them?  I have tried syncing contacts birthdays in the calendar app, and I can't seem to find anywhere to do it on the desktop.  They are still showing up on my old phone.  My contacts on my new phone have the birthdays in them, I've checked.  Any help would be great, thanks!!",

Sometimes right at the start of the call, other times after several minutes. Both on incoming and ongoing calls. I looked up the apps that have access to my phone calls, and there are only six (all google apps: Android Auto, Contacts, Google, Google Play Store, Messages, and Phone). I've noticed that when I call using Whatsapp the calls don't hang up. At least not so far. This is extremely annoying and I need to find out what is causing it.",

    "title": "I'd like to thank Google for making Call Screen available to Canadian customers. Some minor issues",
    "content": "Is the feature available on the Pixel 4?  Nice job on Visual Voicemail also.  It should respond with the party you are trying to reach and not the word THEY when I press the \"I'll call you back later\" button.  It also seems to be missing the canned response 'take me off your calling list' and 'is this urgent?'. Is it possible for users to respond with a dynamic custom response?  That would be a nice future enhancement.  Can call screen automatically take the call if inbound caller identification is absent and ask the calling party to identify themselves verbally?  This could apply in the absence of calling name delivery if the calling party's nyx-nnx-xxxx (now npa-nxx-xxxx) is not in the contact list of the recipient or the name was not transmitted by the telco, or was not retrievable through a tcap dip.  I have received spoofed calls using illegal numbers and this can be baked into the logic ... for example ... no area code can have a 9 as a middle digit; no area code can start with a 1 or 0; if an area code has a 1 in the middle digit (n1x) the third digit (x) cannot be a 1; no central office code (the 4th 5th and 6th digit) can be 1xx or x11 or 0xx.  And you will not see telephone numbers such as 416-416-xxxx (were the area code and central office code are identical), or in NYC for example you would never see 212-718-xxxx because 212 is the area code for Manhattan and 718 is the area code for Brooklyn.  n=2-9 x=0-9.  Hope this info helps.  I don't know if ANI delivery still exists but it can be a way of determining if the call is spoofed, but the logic there is kind of fuzzy.  Automatic Nmber Identification and Caller Identification are two different things. ANI is the billing caller ID ... for example a company's ANI and main switchboard number could be (416) UNiversity 2 - 2000 (416-862-2000) but for direct inward dial the PBX would be programmed to transmit 416-862-2134 so that dialable directory number delivery and reverse translation would work.  Note that the first six digits in most cases will be identical.  The cellular industry, and regulatory authorities CRTC and FCC have certainly done a fine job messing up everything that was previously sophisticated ... from a telecommunications standpoint.  There's no way for Google to send a call to the bit bucket unless its servers act as a proxy.  It would also be interesting if the Google phone app could be enhanced to recognize alphabetic mnemonics as they previously existed eons ago.\n\nie  1 800 GOF EDEX\n1 800 FLO WERS\n1 415 PIX EL3A (749-3532)",

I think this arrived with the Pixel 3, so a bit concerning that it's still not available in the UK. Does the feature need some sort of carrier integration which might explain the absence?",

    "content": "Got my Pixel 3 in Feb 2019 and right now it is having issue with speaker and call quality. When I requested for help, google support asked they suggested some troubleshoot and nothing worked for 2 months. After 2 months, they agreed to provide replacement phone. \n   When I ordered replacement phone, it showed as if they are going to provide new phone and they had put $800+ on hold in my card. When I received a mail about replacement phone it showed as refurbished phone. I was requesting to stop the order and even after speaking with google customer support for 4 or 5 times, they proceeded with the order.\n   When I received the replacement refurbished device, i setup everything (took backup etc., spend another 2 to 3 hours of time) and tried calling my friend. As soon as I call, display goes off and my friend couldn't hear what I am speaking and from myside i am barely hearing what he is speaking.\n   Now I had two problems to solve:\n  1) Whether I need to return replacement phone\n  2) Also I am supposed to send the original phone (for which they put $800 on hold). If i don't return on time they deduct the $800 (for the phone currently worth not even $400)\n  I have been dealing with GOOGLE CUSTOMER SUPPORT endlessly and it is going in loop. At one point i am thinking in future not go for PIXEL phones as their customer support SUCKS.\n   THOUGH PHONE IS UNDER 1 YEAR WARRANTY WHY THE HELL I AM SUPPOSED TO GET REFURBISHED PHONE!!!! ON TOP OF IT WHATEVER PHONE THEY SEND IT IS ALSO FAULTY PHONE. I LOST HOPE IN PIXEL PHONES. I STRONGLY FEEL TO GO WITH IPHONE IF POSSIBLE AS ANY PROBLEM HAPPENS THEY IMMEDIATELY REPLACE THE PHONE WITHOUT ANY QUESTIONS AS THEY KNOW WHAT THEY ARE DEALING... :)\nGOOGLE CUSTOMER SUPPORT SUCKS :(\n\nNOT SURE WHAT ALL OTHER THINGS I NEED TO HANDLE WITH THIS POOR GOOGLE CUSTOMER SUPPORT.",

    "title": "Weird connection problems Pixel 3aXL",
    "content": "I am having very difficult to diagnose connection problems with pixel 3aXL running Android 10. Basically, the connection seems to stop working very regularly even if my toolbar icons show me connected at full strength to an LTE network or a known, working WiFi network. Doesn't seem to matter if one of those two connection types is on or off on the phone, nor does it matter how strong the signal is reported by the phone.\n\nIt can happen in many apps but what usually happens is when I try to get some sort of data to the phone, without warning, whatever app it is just spends a long time trying to get the data it needs. In other words, YouTube videos will never start or move forward when this happens.\nWhen I open the MLB app, I can't even get the news page (which is basically a list of headlines). Or, maybe I have that app open and I read a couple of articles then tap to go listen to a game. Suddenly, the list of available audio feeds just doesn't load.\nIf I look at the Google News feed to the left of my main home screen, it's a crap shoot whether or not any article I tap on will actually load. Note: I am clicking on articles from major sites, not the clickbait, algorithm whores. The same can happen if I use the search bar Maybe results come up, maybe they don't and the process bar just stops at maybe  25% loaded.\n\nYou get the idea, but the worst example I can think of was from this weekend when I couldn't find my phone anywhere. I did the Where's My Phone stuff in Google from my laptop and although I got multiple rings before going to voicemail when I called from another phone (indicating it was turned on and ringing somewhere), Google could not connect to the phone to geolocate it for several tries. It also took a few tries to get actually get it to ring it constantly for five minutes. \n\nCurrently, I can't open Messages.Android.com/web on my laptop because it wants me to connect my phone to a network. But it is on a network, both wifi and LTE. I am sitting here at my kitchen table in the middle of Seattle. I have a strong signal.\n\nAny suggestions are welcome. Thanks!",

    "content": "During a phone call I opened the \"Easy Voice Recorder\" app, then clicked the \"Record\" button (at that time I didn't know that this app doesn't support recording phone calls on Android 10), then the app displayed an error message that it couldn't use the microphone, because it's already in use, however it started recording. When I finished my phone call, I clicked \"Stop recording\" button in the app, and immediately screen turned off. From this moment the screen doesn't work. The phone partially works: alarm rings every morning, but it doesn't respond to calls. The touchscreen works, the phone vibrates when I draw a pattern on the locked screen's surface, but the display is off.\nRecovery attempts:\nI tried restarting the phone by holding the Power button. It didn't help.\nI tried to boot it in Safe mode: I press the Power button, then click on the screen (where the OK button of the confirmation dialog should be located), the phone restarted, but it didn't help.\nI restarted the phone to the 'fastboot' mode (Power + Volume Down). The screen is black. I can use 'fastboot' tool via USB, but it's useless, because debug mode is not turned on, and I can't enable it without a picture on the screen.\nFrom the 'fastboot' mode I can go to 'Recovery' mode. The screen is black. I can use ADB tool via USB, but I wasn't able to run Factory reset or switch it to the 'Sideload' mode (which I could use to flash a full-OTA image). I tried different sequences of Up/Down button presses, but ADB returns an error: adb: sideload connection failed: closed\nadb: trying pre-KitKat sideload method...\nadb: pre-KitKat sideload connection failed: closed\nTo understand what's currently displayed on the turned off screen in recovery mode, to help me navigate through its menu, I tried to take a screenshot by ADB tool, using the script that I found on the XDA forum (it loads current image from the frame buffer). It didn't work.\nPhone info:\nAndroid Version: Android 10, with a September's update\nBootloader Version: b1c1-0.2-5672671\nBaseband Version: g845-00048-190722-B-5745561\nSerial Number: 8ACX0____\nIn use: less than 1 year\nPhone is unlocked\nDebug mode is OFF\nI would appreciate any ideas.\nI don't know if I can send it for repair (it's under warranty and is not damaged), because I'm currently in Belarus. Can I send it for repair to the USA or another country?",

And about an hour after it came back, and I put my phone to charge but some time after it stopped again and hasn't worked since. The phone received Android 10 like all other pixel phones, and I highly doubt it's the vibration motor, if not it wouldn't have worked again, just to add to it yesterday I was roaming around in Google and it froze on me a couple of times (maybe a software bug) but then acted normally.

    "content": "After reading the news and on the forums it seems like this update was launched around Sept 3rd 2019. Just a few days after there were many issues with the new Android 10 update and people were scrambling to find issues for this. Any issues relating to camera functions, receiving/making calls and mainly the lag and freezing of many apps in general. \n\nGoogle has not yet found a solution to all this but what bothers me the most is that I got the notification to update to Android 10 about 3 days ago. Yes 3 days ago which makes it on the 19th. Why is Google still releasing a broken software/firmware to ALL their users when the issue is not fixed. My phone was working normally a few days ago and now I can barely use my phone. I don't think I need to begin and summarize just how inconvenient this has made all users that had to be affected by this mess. It seems that the \"My Verizon\" app was a main issue which stopped a lot of phones to work properly but I don't even have that app because I do not use Verizon. I just got off the phone with a google representative and they have informed me that their engineers are working on the issue but there is no ACTUAL date to know when this will be fixed. Considering this whole mess has already been in the works for almost 2 weeks now, I hope they find a fix soon. For the record:\n\n-I have troubleshooted by going to safe mode and the same issues are there\n-I updated all my apps to best of my now \"broken\" phone ability, it just crashes now and I have other updates still pending for 2 days\n\n\nNow I'm forced to go out and buy another phone because otherwise I cannot work properly. I run a business and I'm on the phone everyday speaking with clients from different countries.",

The app worked pretty good on older phones but on my Pixel 3 not so good.  To block calls on your phone Call Control requires that it be the default dialer.  With the integration of contacts and voicemail withing the default Google dialer I want it to be the default which makes call control pretty much worthless.  Is there a call blocker that doesn't require that it be the default dialer that works well on the Pixel 3?  If there is none that will block the call outright, is there an app that will at least identify known spammers as the call comes in so you can disregard the call and then blacklisted yourself?  I was hoping that Verizon's call blocking app would work but when I go out to the store the app doesn't even show up to download and I've been told it doesn't even work with the Pixel 3 that's why it's not available to download from the store.\n\nIf anyone has any idea's or solutions let me know.  Thanks.",

I wish to block calls that are not in my Contacts.  This used to be simple.\nIt appears that API and/or permission/policy changes have made it difficult or impossible for 3rd party devs to implement call blocking features.  \nAndroid's stock black listing feature is worthless.  Yes, I've heard word of contact list based blocking being in beta for Google Phone, but that's missing the point.\nI've noticed increasing numbers of complaints in the play store against the various call blocking apps with words to the effect of \"this used to work and now it doesn't\". \n I'm sick to death of being interrupted by spam calls just so goog can showcase its Call Screening feature.  I don't want to hear these calls AT ALL.  This used to be possible and, I'm pretty sure thx to goog, now it isn't.\nSo..., IS there a call blocking app, that works, that is known to actually block calls not in the Contact list, on an up to date Pixel 3 XL?",

Delays occur when unlocking phone (up the 15 seconds approx) and when making calls using Google Phone app (the app either takes 30 seconds to place/end a call or crashes with an error message altogether). I've uninstalled/reinstalled, ensured apps are updated, deleted all apps I don't use regularly, conducted a backup/factory reset...all today 090919. Still experiencing the same issues. These issues began in the day or so leading up to doing the latest Android update--unknown if related. Zero of the troubleshooting tips provided by Google have helped. Anyone else experiencing this? And any fixes found yet?",

Then a few weekls ago, this freezing increased to 4 or 5 times a day.  The following day it became a permanent problem which allowed me to trouble shoot what was happening.  If my phone was called, it would give a failed signal.  About 20 seconds later, my phone actually rung.  i would answer and there was nothing there and my phone was frozen.  I factory reset the phone but that didnt work.  i changed the sim card and that got it going.  This week it has started again.  Freezing, some delayed calls as before.  Sometimes after restarting previously sent SMS messages are re received.  All other functions of the phone are working.  I'm with Vodafone and they blame the phone.  Looking at having to buy a new phone but looking for ideas before i do.  I have plenty of storage and have the latest version of Android.",

    "content": "Dear All\nI'm trying to get someone's support from Google directly. It is impossible to get in contact with a support from Google as I cannot contact the support from phone directly and after trying 100 times via internet, it always redirect em to some information which is really basics. \nBy the end of 2016 I bought the first Google Pixel XL for USD 1026 in the UK, after having all Nexus devices before. I'm a long standing Android and Google fan since the first Android phone and Nexus.\nAfter 1 1/2 years I got difficulties with Pixel XL. I could hear the other party on the phone, but they could not hear me. It took me almost 6 month finding out what exactly the problem is. After that I read in the internet/newspaper that a large number of owners are affected. Google Pixel XL has sever microphone issue which cannot be fixed via a software update. The device has a hardware problem, the motherboard has be replaced. Google confirmed the problem officially.\nNow I sent my device to teh Repair Center in Germany to be checked and I receive an offer to have the motherboard replaced for USD 381, so In total I would paid USD 1407 for this device. This reply was absolutely disapointing from Google.\n\nThis absolutely not acceptable from a customer view. I was not able to find out the root cause within the 2 years guarantee time. I could not use the phoen even for the first 2 years! Google did not infomed me that my device is impacted.  I do not want to pay for any problems not caused by myself, but solely caused by Google. \n\nI would appreciate your asstance . I would like to get a working phone as soon as possbile. Germany Repair center do not want to help me. They say, I need to adress my issues to Google. They are forwarding me to the internet and there I cannot reach out to Google. There is a class action where the users could file a claim against Google, unfortunately only in the US. \n\nThank you in advance and kind regards,\nV",

    "content": "Hi,\n\nI have a 1st generation Google Pixel. I have been having problems with the phone for months now. I can't make or receive calls. When I receive a call, I answer and then the phone freezes and I have to restart the device by holding the power button long enough. Sometimes I answer it and it just returns me to the call menu (I don't know what its called, the menu when you receive a call where you can accept or reject the call). Sometimes it does successfully accept the call but there is no sound. And very rarely I accept it and I can hear the other person but the sound cuts like 20 seconds into the call. Same problems when I try to make a call as well. And not just with the Phone app, same problems occur when trying to use WhatsApp call. I have tried disabling some services, tried deleting the updates for the Phone app, tried deleting some apps and then all apps, tried Safe Mode, Factory Reset with my apps restored and Factory Reset with none of my apps/settings restored. None of it worked so far. The screen is cracked on the top left corner (I don't know if its related). I would like to know, is this a hardware issue or a software issue? Because (as I live in Turkey), there won't be much I can do in terms of repair if it is a hardware issue. So depending on that I will buy a new phone.\n\nThanks in advance.",

I can use only SIM or only e-SIM. If I have turned on SIM I can accept recieving calls, but I can\u00b4t call them back from e-SIM number and also I dont reciveve SMS and can not send them. Why is that so?\n\nMy 5 years old huawei could do that and new phone for aprox. 850 dollars can not? Or I\u00b4m just stupid and can not figure out how to set settings. \n\nIs there any chance of apliacation or new upgrade of Android which will make working both SIM cards together?\n\nThank you.\nBest,\nVladislav",

I cannot remove the number from Barry's details.\n\nI edited Barry's details (on the desktop) to delete the number.\nOn Android (after refreshing the contacts \u2014 I had to restart the phone!)\nWhen I view Barry's details, it shows his correct number, but also Alice's phone number. When I edit Barry's details, Alice's number is mysteriously absent.\nWhen I search for Alice's number, both Alice and Barry come up in the search results.\nOn the desktop\nWhen I view Barry's details, it shows his correct number, but also the message, \"+44 **** ****** from Gmail\", with two buttons, \"Dismiss\" and \"Add\". Pressing \"Dismiss\" shows a waiting circle for a couple of seconds, but otherwise does nothing; the message remains there.\nCuriously, when I search for Alice's number, unlike on Android, only Alice comes up in the search results.\n\nOn Android, this is confusing other apps such as WhatsApp.\n\nWhat can I do to tell Google that, no, just because Alice's number appears in one of Barry's emails, it doesn't mean that it's Barry's number?\n\nThank you",

I dismissed it but as of today 5 people have said the same thing to me that they hear random beeping every 10 to 20 seconds when they are speaking to me. It is not me accidentally pressing the screen, as it happens also when I use speakerphone. It happens when I am the caller or call receiver and I cannot hear the beeps. Has anyone else come across this before? I have had this phone almost a year but has just started. Thanks\" \nSo my problem is same and It seems no one is actually replying with anything useful. Hoping to grab someones attention and maybe find a solution for this. Tried making calls with iPhone device, Android Device and Landline same problem random loud beeping sounds. Have no idea whats going on and they are definitely not caused by my or theirs apps or notifications.... On the edge to switch to iPhone and as Android only user that says something... I do like Pixels and Google Eco system in general but I will not think twice this time. Enough of this already. Every new phone, software update, Android version update is full of bugs and hidden and later discovered problems. Sometimes we see them before we give you money but sometimes its just so stupid that makes me question my own decisions with Android.... BTW i saw some people are recommending turning off BT or NFC or Safe Mode and then playing inspectors and searching for \"ROUGE\" apps. Are you serious I want to use features that I have bought and I do think that \"Rouge\" apps are not end users problem, IT IS YOUR APP STORE not ours and if there are \"ROUGE\" apps then it is definitely reason to leave this OS behind even with iPhones stupid Notch...",

I received my serviced phone and I still face the same set of problems. I don't know what repair was done by Google support partner. I have sent mail to the pixel escalations team.

I thought it might be something wrong with their devices but I have checked that by myself. The sound quality is really awful indeed. Is like talking with someone using a really old phone. If I try putting myself on speaker - it is even worst. No issues though with video recorded clips.\n\nI went to my carrier provider and have changed the sim card - but it is the same thing. I have almost all the time 4G antenna so I don't think I have issues with that. Via WiFi I have exactly the same issue.\n\nIt is either the soft (but I have done many updates since I have the phone) or the issue is with the microphone itself.\n\nNever dropped the phone, never have tried it under the water. I am using it roughly for about 2.5 months.\n\nOne more bad thing is also that it is purchased from USA but I live in a country out of Google support... \n\nAny advises will be very appreciated.",

    "content": "Hello!\n  I\u2019m using Garmin Fenix 5 with Google Pixel 2 XL.\n  About 2 months ago the watch stopped showing incoming call notifications when screen is off.\nWhen screen is unlocked and on, notifications work as usual.\n \nThere are other users with the same issue. See for example  https://forums.garmin.com/apps-software/mobile-apps-web/f/garmin-connect-mobile-andriod/166634/incoming-calls-not-being-displayed-on-pixel-3 \nWhen we (user with the same issue) uninstall updates of Phone app (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.dialer) and install older version (31.0.241960258) notifications start working as before. But I\u2019m afraid this workaround will not last long.\n I already submitted ticket to Garmin. But I cannot determine if it is Google\u2019s or Garmin\u2019s fault. \n  BTW Sorry for my english.",

    "content": "I travel to Mexico several times a year. Now, even when I'm in the US, with some of my contacts when we are texting sometimes their texts come from their regular US phone number and sometimes their texts come from the same number but with the 044 at the beginning. When I'm in the US and I respond to the ones with the 044 they do not get those messages. There seems to be no rhyme or reason to when it comes from which phone number. \n\nAny ideas on how to fix this?",

I have spoke to customer support who had me try a few things:\nRestart on safe mode\nClear the cache \nClear the network data\nFactory reset \nI even cleared almost all my storage\nToday a different customer support member helped me realize, when he called from the Google computer the ring back would work fine. When I called from my husband's iPhone it only rang once, and when I called from my home land line (Comcast) it worked fine. \n\nIs this an issue with only certain providers? Or maybe when iPhone users call a Google phone? Has anyone else had this problem?",

I don't think it is fair to blame this on 3rd party apps. As far as I know there is no other Andriod phones experiencing the same kind of issues. If there is a compatibility problem than it lays on Google piexl side.\n\nCan I return this phone? It causes me nothing but grief.\n\nThanks",

We had been experiencing intermittent Internet outages while this was going on so I was not able to print the PDF out right away!  Now my email from the Google tech support is gone, as tho the email disappeared or I could have been hacked too!  If you remember AOL back in the day, you could UNSEND messages in email!  I know Google had some sort of brief unsending at one time!  I don't want to be charged for not returning it on time!    \n\nTwo pixels would be great,  with my living room HOME FI project, to string across the living room!  Sorta like the game of telephone, where you put a string, a knot in two styrefoam cups, pull the string tight, &  you can hear the other person!  HA HA HA! \n\nWith all the hacking,  why does Google require us to save pay pal & credit cards in the Gpay which is very unsafe?  If a mobile computer gets lost, stolen or a person gets arrested, & police illegally confiscate a persons mobile computer, then they police have the persons credit card information & pay pal information, account passwords, which are monetary payment methods that can cause financial harm to that person!  The reason I had my credit card account information there was to Pay Google Adwords when I was advertising my youtube channel!  Yes, having the payments saved is convenient!  But I was arrested by the police, & when the police illegally confiscate computer equipment, that can cause harm to a citizen, private and public, that is crossing the line & violates the constitution!  Passwords are intellectual property! Banking & monetary payment are intellectual property!  Our mobile computers become a credit card!  So thru the police, all my history is exposed to the police, including pictures & video!   I am still a fan of the new media & new technology, because more people have a voice to speak out!  Doesn't using the police to obstruct private citizens based on content being made for our online jobs violate the first amendment, since traditional corporate media has done the same thing in their content creation?  I lost my YouTube job, then I lost my computer equipment, because corporate media is threatened by new digital media! Doesn't that attack & hurt a new business model that embraces everyone vs the old way or a one way conversation, telling us what to think!  Where now we have a two way conversation with a lot of disagreements!",

They told me it was \"no replacement phone available at this time\" issue and asked me to wait few more days. Odd since this was a Pixel 2 XL, a very common phone...  Still I waited few more day till the date they gave me. No word. So I called again, waited a long time for them to figure out the issue.  I was told by the customer representative that the warehouse said they received my package but it was \"empty\". WHAT?!? How can this be? Also if this was indeed the case, WHY ON EARTH DID NO ONE FROM GOOGLE CONTACT ME WHEN THEY DISCOVERED THAT THE BOX WAS EMPTY??? They could of investigate the issue right away instead of waiting for more than two weeks to \"begin\" an investigation. Very suspicious... It's easier to believe they simply misplace my phone or someone dropped the ball on this and didn't want the blame or be responsible. It's been a month. The deadline for update was 6/12, which was yesterday. NO SURPRISE. STILL NO WORD FROM ANYONE. Feeling cast aside and very neglected. Wow, so shocked by poor customer support system. I don't blame the customer support as they have be very friendly and supportive. I blame the system or the customer support structure they have. Now what do I do? I am left without a replacement phone for a month...",

    "title": "Anyone else having issues connecting to LTE and receiving MMS messages with Pixel 3 on ATT?",
    "content": "I've had a Pixel 3 on ATT essentially since launch. Everything was working find till about 1 month ago when I started having issues connecting to LTE and receiving MMS messages. \n\nFor the LTE connection, this issue is in initial connection eg after turning off WiFi, or leaving wifi range, or leaving a dead zone (underground garage) the phone has difficulty connecting and shows \"No internet\". Sometimes it reconnects in a few minutes but sometimes it takes 30+ minutes. I havent found any solutions to get it to reconnect quickly: not toggling airplane mode or mobile data on and off, not restarting, not resetting network connections...nothing.\nOnce the phone eventually connects to LTE the data connection works fine and stays stably connected until I either go into a dead zone (eg underground parking lot) or connect to WiFi -- so the trouble really just seems to be with the initial connection.  Also, when the LTE isn't connecting i can still make and receive phone calls without any difficulty.\n\nFor MMS messages, I apparently have been missing missing a bunch of messages and even when i get them they are extremely delayed.  This issue started at the exact same time as the LTE issue, but seems to be independent of the LTE status--it happens whether or not the LTE is connected.  I seem to be able to send MMS messages without issues and send and receive SMS issues without any issues.\n\nBoth of these issues started at the same time. I live in a large urban area with good ATT signal. My wife does not have any of these issues in the same areas on her iPhone. I have found posts on Reddit and the ATT community forums where people describe similar issues. \n\nUnfortunately, both AT&T and Google support have been of little help.\n\nGoogle support asked me to:\n--Install the latest system updates (I was already updated to May and since the problem has been going on for so long I have subsequently installed the June security update)\n--Reset network settings\n--Uninstall updates to a variety of system apps including google connectivity services, pixel launcher, pixel ambient services (I don't remember the complete list anymore but I followed their instructions precisely)\n--Check APN setting with my carrier (were already consistent with recommended settings).\n\nAT&T support:\n--Checked that my IMEI number matched (it already did)\n--Manually re-provisioned my IMEI (I think multiple times now)\n--Re-verified my APN settings again\n--Some AT&T support agents have suggested replacing my SIM while others say this would not help (I haven't done this yet but supposedly they are shipping me a replacement SIM -- but I really don't see how this could be the issue)\n\nBased on Reddit/AT&T community forum posts i have also tried:\n--Disabling developer options\n--Disabling enhanced 4G LTE mode\n--Switching between 3G and LTE (as the preferred network type)\n\nI think at the heart of it neither AT&T nor Google will truly acknowledge this issue -- they both act like I am the only one having this problem even when I point them to the articles, reddit posts and ATT posts. This is extremely disappointing when they have both advertised compatibility between the Pixel 3 and the ATT network.\n\nGoogle has now offered to replace my device under warranty, but of course they only offer a refurbished replacement and its not even clear to me if its a hardware issue -- some people seem to report ongoing issues even after getting replacements.  Has anyone else here experienced the issues that I'm having?  If so, did a replacement solve the issue?  Maybe if enough people report this problem on the google boards we can draw their attention to the issue and get some response (when i point to reddit they say they are not \"able to comment on the content and issues specified on the third party websites\").",

    "title": "Phone freezes when I'm on a call, I can hear the other person talking but they can't hear me.",
    "content": "I bought my Pixel 3 directly from the Google online store on October last year. Ever since I bought the phone it's been acting up when I'm on calls. At some point on a call the phone would freeze. When this happens I can still hear the other person clearly but the other person can't hear me. Apart from that people complain a lot that they can't hear me well on calls. \n\nIt's obviously not the speaker since I have no problem when sending voicenotes on Whatsapp. \n\nLately it's been having another issue. I am not getting any notifications when the phone is on sleep mode. Whenever I turn on the screen I get all the notifications  popping up together (whatsapp messages, Skype, etc).\n\nI live in the Dominican Republic and from what I've been hearing it's a problem with the hardware and I will have to send it to an official store. The problem is that there aren't any Google rep stores in the DR and sending it to the states means paying for the delivery and having no phone for about 10 days. \n\nHope someone can help me out with that. \n\nThanks",

Sure enough, DND was on... \n\nThis morning, phone was working fine, DND was off; then at 9:30am I noticed DND was turned on.  I turned it off.  Then at 9:35am noticed it was turned on again.

    "title": "Phone screen unresponsive and covered in multi-color dots -- only works when pressed hard",
    "content": "A few days ago my phone screen was suddenly covered in the dots (picture attached), and it wasn't responsive to touch. Suddenly happened (no drop, etc.)\n\nAt first, it would go back to normal on its own every now and then. Then a day later, if I gently tapped the phone screen, it would go back to normal. Since then it's gotten worse -- tapping it doesn't do anything, but if I push down relatively hard in the middle of the phone screen, sometimes it will work. For the screen to look normal AND respond to touch now, I have to keep pushing down in the middle of the screen while touching the phone -- although this doesn't guarantee that it will work. \n\nEverything else seems to be working (speaker, alarm, I'm getting calls... just can't turn alarm off or accept calls when the screen is unresponsive...). Please help, thanks!!",

It's sort of a static buzzing/vibrating and renders the front facing camera completely useless, and the person on the other side of the call (in videocalls) can hear it. So I have to flick between the front and rear camera a few times before it stops. Also happens when I'm using the front camera and the phone bumps something.\n\nThis is not my video but this is the issue: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxV6tmbd1Co\n\nFound some answers online that says to contact google for a replacement, so I have requested a callback through the built in support but they never call me back. Anyone knows how to get a hold of them. From Spain.\n\nCheers",

I like that Google Fi has the best coverage but I sometimes need a hotspot and that would make Google Fi unaffordable. If the Pixel would allow me to use the eSim with Google Fi and then toggle to the Nano Sim when I\u2019m going hog wild with Data, then that would be the perfect combination. I can\u2019t get a war answer on this, some people say I could but iId have to manually toggle between SIMs and others say it\u2019s not possible. Does anyone have a clear answer on this? Thanks!!!",

    "content": "I've got both 'Caller id and Spam,' and 'Filter Spam calls' boxes checked in my phone setting and they appear to work. But they only appear to work on numbers that are \"known\" as incoming spam numbers. Makes sense. But seeing as how spammers change their numbers all day every day, I keep getting about 5-7 calls per day that are not known by Google's filters as spam. Meaning, I have to check my phone, and block these numbers every single day. Get's pretty old, pretty fast. And there's no end to how many phone numbers the \"social security scam\" business possesses, in case you haven't noticed. lol. My question is, why isn't there a simple feature within this wonderful built in spam filter to only accept calls from my contact list? Meaning, \"block ALL BUT my contacts.\" This way, if it's someone I don't know, they can simply leave a message and I'll click \"add to contacts\" and all is well. It'd keep me from having to listen to my phone ring several times a day with numbers I already know are spam. And yes, I know I can use a call blocking app to do this, and I did just that with my Samsung Galaxy phone, but in my experience, using a third party call blocking app that lays over your phone just slows everything down and often interferes with other apps, I found. The spam features are a big reason for me switching to Pixel 3XL. And I don't mind being a part of the community that \"fights spam\" but I'd rather not have to report every single call that comes in on my phone. Especially when \"white listing\" your entire contact list seems like such an obviously easy feature to add to this already good built in spam filter. Anyone have any ideas??",

He wanted to test his sons\u2019 abilities. \n\n\nHe called both of them and gave a room to each of them. He said, \u201cYou must fill this room completely with anything you wish. It can be anything! But there should be no space left behind and you should not seek the advice from anyone!\" \n\n\nThe next day the king visited the elder\u2019s son room. The room was completely filled with hay.

The second sonasked his father to get in and closed the door again. There were darkness everywhere and The King shouted at his second son angrily. \n\n\nBut the second son lighted a candle and said, I have filled this room with light!\" \n\n\nNow the King felt very happy and hugged his son proudly.

Same happened while trying to make phone calls too.\n\nAnother funny symptoms:\n- Whatsapp calls don't work\n- Whatsapp audios won't play\n- Audiojack stopped working\n- Mic works randomly\n- System IU crash messages appear from time to time\n\nWhat has already been tried:\n- Rebooting in safe mode doesn't work\n- Reset the device to factory settings (though I reinstalled my apps, contacts and everything back from my Google Backup account, instead of going one by one)\n- Uninstalled Digital Wellbeing updates (cleaned cache, data, and forced to stop)\n- Uninstalled Phone App updates (cleaned cache, data, and Reinstalled it)\n\nToday (5/6/19) latest security update has been installed, yet everything's still much the same.\n\nWhat I have left to try:\n- Downgrading to Oreo\n- Upgrading to Q? (better not I guess)\n\nWhat I can't do:\n- Take it to any store or mail it to Google: since I live in Argentina, I don't have any hard support down here...\n\nAny help is truly appreciated.

Xfinity says they dont support the Pixel 3 as a BYOD and can't help. However, I found that if I change my default phone app to YouMail instead of the standard Android Phone app, calls ring as they should. It appears that the problem is associated with the latest Android Phone app.\n\nHas anyone else had a similar problem? Thanks.",

This happened to me back in August, but the sound eventually returned (not sure how). The correlation to the update was too obvious this time around, and I don't want to have to use my headphones just to answer calls and use my phone with sound on a daily basis. I've tried putting it into safe mode to identify an app that could be to blame, but no dice. I've done a factory reset--nothing. I don't know what to do.",

    "content": "So, I bought a Google pixel 2 that is claimed to be unlocked from amazon. It is refurbished.\n\nWell, long story short, I went to AT&T to get service for the phone. I signed up for their prepaid 8gb plan. The guy set me all up and everything.  But the problem is, the phone will not connect to the network. It says I have no bars,  and when I try to make calls it says to turn off airplane mode, yet airplane mode is not on. \n\nThings I have tried : \n\nTaking the sim out and cleaned it. No fix.\n\nUsing a different sim from a boost phone. This worked, of course it wouldn't let me use the service because my IMEI wasn't on the boost account.  But it read the sim and tried to configure network. So I know it can read sim cards. I did try to put the IMEI on the boost account and it said \"this phone isn't eligable for swap\" or something like that. Hmmm.\n\nI have tired factory resetting. Wiped it clean. Still no luck . \n\nThe att worker said the IMEI and the apn were correct, but I suspect he may have made an error. Because this doesn't make any sense.\n\nI have done *#*#4636*#*# and checked mobile radio on. It didn't change anything. I have also looked at preferred network type and it says unknown.\n\nIf I go into sim status, it says :\n\nNetwork unknown\n\nPhone number on sim unknown\n\nMobile network state disconnected\n\nService state radio off (even though I've checked mobile radio on)\n\nSignal strength 0\n\nMobile voice network type unknown\n\nMobile data network type unknown\n\nRoaming not roaming\n\nEID unknown.\n\n\nThere is also no option in the phone for Wi-Fi calling. \n\nIf I do *#*#4636*#*# I get this info:\n\nSet preferred network type : it gives me dozens of options, but when I restart the phone to apply the change it just goes to unknown.\n\nIf I run a Ping test all 3 categories pass.\n\nSmsc refresh and update both bring up refresh error.\n\nThere is a button that says toggle DNS check and next to it it says 0.0.0.0\n\nCall info refresh rate just goes back to disabled no matter what I set it to.\n\nPlease help me. I'm on my way back to att now to try again. \n\nI am a huge stock Android enthusiast and it is crushing to think that this phone might not work for me.",

Within 29 days of having the phone and service, I still cannot hold onto one single call.  Either the person can't hear me or the call drops altogether.  EVERY SINGLE CALL!  This includes the calls to Google support!!!  I finally gave up yesterday on Fi and switched to Sprint.  And although a tad better, still every call has issues!!!  And, Google made me purchase the phone outright just to be able to switch carriers!  So, I will just continue to ship the phone back to Google every 2 weeks to get a replacement until the 1 year warranty is up.  Everyone online is saying the same thing about this shitty phone!  I hope Google likes me costing them more in warranty returns then the profit they made from my purchase!  I WILL NEVER PURCHASE ANOTHER GOOGLE PRODUCT!!! EVER!!!!  And looking forward to posting negative reviews on every single website I can find!!!",

Sometimes if I turn on speakerphone I can hear them but they cannot hear me. But if I turn it off I cannot hear them and they cannot hear me. Sometimes when a call is coming in the phone freezes and occasionally it will restart. \n\nAdditionally the voice dictation has stopped working.\n\nTried testing phone in safe mode. Same problem with calls.\n\nPhone also occasionally turns off and won't turn back on for a while even if I try to power it back on. Also restarts occasionally.\n\nProblems started 2 weeks ago and are getting progressively worse. Not sure what to do.",

However I am so dissappointed as the brand new pixel is constantly freezing while typing, certain apps don't even work (Snapchat will always say not responding, wait or close the app), the mapping system says I'm places that I'm not, and clicking links from messages almost never works. It also takes forever and a day to load almost anything on both wifi and LTE. is the common to pixels or is it an out of the box manufacturing error? I am an EMT on an ambulance and rely on quick mapping guidance to calls and the freezing problems and slowness have caused huge issues at work.",

    "title": "After waking, apps respond to touch but the screen remains unchanged until app tray is opened.",
    "content": "I'll try to describe this as well as I can. Sometimes after waking the phone, it will show whatever was on screen when the display was turned off, which sounds normal enough so far. But if I touch the screen, the image remains the same while the phone still registers the touch.\n\n(*This bug does not occur when using pattern, pin, or fingerprint lockscreens, but I'm not in many situations where I'm in fear of my phone falling into the hands of someone else. And to be honest, I just hate having the extra step of typing a pin or taking off my winter gloves to use my fingerprint.)\n\nExample:\n\u2022 The screen is on. I open Spotify to play a song, let's say \"Thrasher\" by Neil Young; Spotify starts playing the song, and all of the visuals in the app change to reflect this.\n\n\u2022 I turn the screen off when the the time elapsed reads 0:01, the album artwork is shown, and the app says that \"Thrasher\" is playing.\n\n\u2022 I wake the screen briefly to turn shuffle off: the shuffle button goes from green to grey, the seek bar has moved a bit, the time elapsed now reads 0:05, everything's working normally.\n\n\u2022 I turn the screen off for the second time since opening Spotify.\n\n\u2022After listening to a few songs, I get to one on the playlist I would like to skip, say \"Heart of Gold\" by Neil Young from a different album.\n\n\u2022 I wake the screen for the second time since starting Spotify, and the app still shows the old info: time elapsed of 0:05, the seek bar remains motionless, and the album artwork is for \"Thrasher\" instead of \"Heart of Gold.\" Even if I wait several seconds (as in, over thirty), the issue still persists.\n\n\u2022 I tap the next song button, Spotify advances to the next song, but the display remains exactly the same, \"Thrasher,\" five seconds, etc.\n\n\u2022 I tap the shuffle button, it remains greyed out on the screen, but the next song is indeed from a random spot on the playlist.\n\n\u2022 To fix this, I use the app tray button to switch to a different app or just return to the home screen.\n\n\u2022 After doing that, I switch back to Spotify, and the app now works as intended. The correct song is displayed, the seek bar is moving, the shuffle button lights up / greys out whenever it's tapped. All that stuff.\n\nI've been putting up with this since updating to Android Pie. It's very annoying, and was even dangerous when it used to happen while using Google Maps, although that has thankfully stopped.\n\nI've noticed it happening mostly with Spotify, but it happens in other apps:\n\u2022 the home screen\n\u2022 the Contacts app\n\u2022 Gmail\n\u2022 Keep, by Google\n\u2022 Google Play Music\n\u2022 Google Photos\n\u2022 To-Do, by Microsoft\n\u2022 Libra, a weight tracking app\n\u2022 Facebook\n\u2022 Twitter\n\u2022 Awful, an app used to browse the forums on Something Awful\n\u2022 VLC Media Player\n\u2022 again, Spotify\n\nThese apps just show a black screen until switching from and then back to the app\n\u2022 Freecell, by mobilityware, while running in portrait or landscape display\n\u2022 Noten Riichi Mahjong, while running in landscape\n\nApps in which the bug does not seem to occur:\n\u2022 the text messaging app\n\u2022 the Clock app\n\u2022 the Phone app (the recent calls list; I have not tried to recreate the bug during an actual call)\n\u2022 Facebook Messenger\n\u2022 WhatsApp\n\u2022 Podcast Addict\n\u2022 Reddit\n\u2022 YouTube\n\nThe problem seems to occur / not occur regardless of whether the app is third- or first-party. And while my \"sample size\" isn't particularly large, apps seem to be affected more often than not (13 to 8).\n\nI'm normally pretty good at troubleshooting, finding what I need to know through search engines. But the problem is just so... I guess finicky? It's been difficult to describe concisely, so the only results I get are essentially for totally unresponsive screens, a lag-upon-waking bug specific to the Pixel 2 XL, or just phones freezing.\n\nI tried un/reinstalling apps, but it's done nothing to help.\n\nI have not tried a factory reset because I've been hoping that this is a known problem with a less drastic solution. And at this point, I don't know which would be the bigger headache\u2014living with the problem until it somehow fixes itself, or having to lose all of my data.\n\nThank you for reading. I know it was a lot.",

    "content": "I have recently upgraded from Huawei Mate 9 to a Pixel 3 XL.  I did the setup and data transfer between the two phones through the provided transfer cable and everything that could come over did.  The issue I have is that the SMS messages on the Pixel phone have multiple entries from a sender known as Unknown Sender.  When you view the messages, you see that messages from a number of senders have been grouped into this contact - you can see their profile pictures, their contact details when you press the messages info toggle, but they do not get grouped with other messages from the same contact.  All contacts and accounts have transferred successfully to the Pixel.  I tried a message transfer using SMS backup and Restore (has worked on perfectly on multiple android devices) - all the messages are in the generated backup file and they can be viewed in the SMS Backup and Restore app, and can be restored perfectly on my old Android device, but the Unknown Sender shows up again in Android Messages on the Pixel 3XL.   Is there a workaround to this issue?  I tried a) deleting the app data and the cache ; and b) uninstalled updates to the Android Messages App.  The issue did not go away in either case.  Short of resetting the phone and trying again, I don't know what else to do.  There is some app data that does not get backed up by Google and I don't want to lose that data right now.",

This phone was linked to my google voice account. \n\nI have factory re-set the Pixel and installed a new sim from T-Mobile. After adding my gmail to the reset Pixel and then installing Google Voice app, I am now seeing unauthorized outgoing calls again.\n\nAfter re-setting the Pixel and installing a new sim, T-Mobile tech support is saying that this must be a pixel/google voice issue.

When DataSaver is on the other person on the phone cannot hear me but I can hear them fine. When searching I found this post (https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/7odvgg/wifi_calling_issueresolved/dsa4dvu/) saying it is a known issue.\nIs there any way to keep data saver on and also use Wifi calling?\nI made sure that the phone application is allowed to use background data and also unrestricted data usage. I'm not sure what else I can do.\nAny suggestions would be greatly appreciated.\n\n**Note as soon as I disabled Wi-Fi Calling the phone is working normally.\n\nThanks",

I was fine with this because it was going to be covered by the hard plastic anyways. However, after trying to make a phone call, I noticed that the inner case does not have a cutout for the mic beside the USBC port. The other person on the call said that my voice was more muffled. Maybe this was Placebo, but the mic on my Pixel 2 did sound more muffled after I called myself vs a naked phone or my old case. Is the location of the mic beside the USBC port or in the speaker slot? Also, is it normal for Live Cases to not include this mic cutout? There is a cutout for the top mic and I know that the 2XL doesn't have a bottom mic so maybe that's a factor?",

    "content": "Outline of my WORST customer experience\u2026 and it is still in progress. With Google of all companies.\n\n\u2022 January 31\n\u2022 Purchase a brand-new Google Pixel 2XL from Target\n\u2022 That evening I begin setting up all of my apps and notice that there is a pink line running vertically on the right hand of my screen.\n\n\u2022 February 1\n\u2022 I contact Target about the screen issue. They inform me that my phone what the last one in their store and that they recommended I work with Google to get a replacement.\n\u2022 I contact Google support for assistance. They say they will send me a replacement after I send mine in via RMA. This process takes FIVE TO TEN BUSINESS DAYS. So no phone that whole time. I agree and plan to send out on the following Monday (February 4). \n\n\u2022 February 2\n\u2022 I reach out to the Google rep who helped me to find out if there was anything he could do to help make this a better experience for me, such as expediting the processes.\n\n\u2022 February 3\n\u2022 A different rep writes back not about anything in my February 2 email, but reassuring me that the refurbished phones are of good quality.\n\u2022 This seriously concerns me as I believed I should not be getting a refurbished phone to replace my brand new one. I send an email stating that.\n\n\u2022 February 4\n\u2022 Upon not hearing back from Google, I reach out again via phone and reached a different rep, Cali. Over the phone, she was great and agreed that I should not be receiving a refurbished phone to replace my brand new one. She was unable to take care of the issue herself, so she escalated my new case to Google product specialists, saying they would follow-up in 1-2 business days. She also promised to provide me a daily status update.\n\n\u2022 February 5\n\u2022 I send Cali an email, requesting an update since I hadn\u2019t heard anything yet that day as promised.\n\u2022 Didn\u2019t get a response.\n\u2022 I contact them via phone (Reps through this are always random and they are not able to do anything to help other than post a note in the case for Cali to get back to me). So I ask them to put a note in for me to get an update.\n\n\u2022 February 6\n\u2022 I reach out to Cali again for an update via email.\n\u2022 Cali calls me in the evening with a solution from the Google product specialists that would require me to return my phone to Target, purchase a new phone on the Google Store, take out the Google financing (credit card), and wind up spending more than I did through target. That is even with the discount they were willing to give. Cali and I both agree that this solution isn\u2019t reasonable. She requests that I send her my Target receipts and she would take them to the product specialists to press for a different solution. She said that we should have a solution by end of day on the 7th. I send her everything.\n\u2022 I get another email from that rep from February 3 wanting to reassure me about a refurbished device again.\n\n\u2022 February 7\n\u2022 I reach out to Cali for a status update via email as she told me she was going to be out the 8th and 9th. I didn\u2019t want this going on much longer.\n\u2022 I don\u2019t hear back\n\u2022 I reach out via phone for a random rep again and asked them to put a note in the case.\n\u2022 I tweet about this experience and Google reaches out and ensures me that someone would be reaching out to help me that day. No one ever calls.\n\n\u2022 February 8\n\u2022 I reach out again for a status update via email. I requested she contact me via phone.\n\u2022 Cali responds via email that evening stating that she escalated this to the product specialists again and to wait 1-2 business days for a response\u2026. AGAIN.\n\u2022 I respond via email, asking Cali to call.\n\u2022 No phone call.\n\u2022 I reach out via phone for a random rep again and asked them to put a note in the case.\n\n\u2022 February 12\n\u2022 I reach out again for a status update via email.\n\u2022 Cali responds via email that due to the delay in response she has provided me a credit to my account for Google Store. I look and this is nowhere to be found.\n\u2022 I ask Cali via email how this credit works since I cant find it.\n\u2022 I reach out to customer service via phone after Cali doesn\u2019t respond and they bounce me around to a few different reps and discover that the credit has not been added to my account like Cali stated.\n\n\u2022 February 13\n\u2022 Cali reaches out via email for my address so they can send me a new phone. WOOHOO\u2026 finally, but I have no idea what is going on. Like, what do I do when it arrives, still don\u2019t know how to get the balance on my Google account as promised, do I take my phone back to target or send to Google, etc.\n\u2022 I send her my address and a request for her to give me a call to talk through what is going on.\n\u2022 Upon not hearing back, I reach out via phone for a random rep again and asked them to put a note in the case.\n\n\u2022 February 14\n\u2022 Cali reaches out just after midnight via email, asking when would be a good time for her to contact me.\n\u2022 I reply with several options.\n\u2022 I receive a shipping confirmation that my new phone is on the way.\n\u2022 I send a few follow-up emails to confirm she is calling.\n\u2022 I never hear from her.\n\u2022 Instead of trying to call for a rando rep again who cant do anything to help, I reach out via chat. Same result. No help. They even tried saying they could confirm Cali was going to call me. We are near midnight and still no call.\n\nSo after 14 days (several hours of emailing and phone calls), I am getting a new phone. But have no clue what is going on other than it is being shipped to me. What I have learned is that Google doesn\u2019t give their customer service associates enough authority to provide a timely and helpful experience to their customers. Either I talk to Cali who has to submit escalation requests to a different department that takes a couple days for a response or I talk to a rando rep who doesn\u2019t even have access to my case to do anything themselves either. They aren\u2019t even able to reach out to Cali directly to get her to reach out to me.\n\nI wish I could say my Google experience was great and talk up my phone to others. Not a chance with how things are right now and not sure what Google is able to do to change that.",

    "title": "My pixel 2 XL is with google service centre since more than 1.5 months.. need help",
    "content": "Pathetic customer service in India. Phone is faulty and they refuse to replace it. Phone is with service centre since last 1.5 months. Within 5 months of purchase, had to send phone to service centre twice and a lot of hassles.. \n\nTo give you a background, I am an Indian Chartered Accountant working since the last 14 years with multinational accounting firm and then with a reputed listed company in India. Am giving you the background so that you know this email is not a sham or a means to defraud your company.\n \u00b7         I bought Google Pixel 2XL on July 22, 2018 from a store in Mumbai. Within 2-3 months of using it, I started facing problems in it \u2013 proximity sensor issue, sudden black screen, very bad camera quality, phone suddenly getting muted / on hold while talking, etc. I complained to the customer care. They asked me to perform some trouble shooting steps. I did those but the problems persisted.\n \u00b7         Suddenly one day, the phone shut down and wasn\u2019t restarting. I complained to the customer care again. The Google customer care arranged to take the phone to the service centre (that too after a lot of haggling with them about the timing. Apparently, they did not have enough staff as their staff was on leave!!!!). They took my phone on Nov 12, 2018, diagnosed my phone and returned it to me after a few days saying the mother board has been replaced i.e. it was faulty and so it is replaced now.  This is only within 4 months of use.\n \u00b7         Again after a month in December, I started facing troubles with the phone \u2013 after typing any message or receiving a call, a strange sound started coming from the phone. This happened after SMS, call, whatsapp message. Couldn\u2019t see any video or hear songs on the phone since there was only that strange beep like sound coming from the phone. Coupled with that there was again the proximity sensor issue, bad camera, poor voice quality. I was pretty upset with this and I called the customer care again. They again asked me to follow some trouble shooting steps. I did this but the problem wasn\u2019t resolved. So they said they will arrange for a pick up of the phone. The person who came to collect my phone again performed some mandatory checking (which took an hour or so) while I was in my office. Since they again said that the staff was on leave and therefore they couldn\u2019t come to collect the phone at my convenient time, I had to call the person in office and spend more than an hour in his trouble shooting procedures. He told me my phone is fine now and therefore I need not give it to the service centre.\n \u00b7         Immediately again in a few days, I started facing same problems with the phone. Totally frustrated, I called the service centre again. The person who came to pick the phone again performed some trouble shooting steps (which again took almost an hour). He took my phone on December 29, 2018. I asked him to put in a request for refund because I was totally frustrated with the phone.\n \u00b7         I am haggling with the service centre since then. My phone is with the service centre since December 29 i.e. more than 1.5 months. I have written to them various times and called them as well. After a lot of emails and calls which I made, the customer care told me that there is no refund policy. .  I requested for a replacement phone since this phone is causing a lot of problems. I asked for a replacement as it is a right of a customer to get a properly functional phone after paying a hefty price for the phone. The service centre personnel do not respond to emails till the time they are sent repeated reminders. Some even gave frivolous reasons such as they were on leave since few days!!! Really!! Isnt there a handover takeover?? If a Google personnel is on leave, then would the customer have to wait till he or she returns?? Google customer care personnel promised me over the call that I will get a resolution on the problem by a particular day; but there would be no email or call from them on that day! Are they are shirking from talking to a disgruntled customer?\n \u00b7         The customer care personnel told me that in India, they wouldn\u2019t replace phones while in US, they have the policy of replacing phones if the phone is faulty!! This is ridiculous. Why such a discrimination against INDIANS???\n In a nutshell, My experience with the product was bad but my experience with the customer care personnels was worse. I am still struggling to get a replacement phone. It actually seems that no one in Google cares about its customers. If B2X is managing the service here, doesn\u2019t Google have a check and balance on them? Or is it that Google itsef doesn\u2019t care for Indian customers?? If that\u2019s so, why should an Indian customer buy a Google product? There are many other products available in the market which have great customer service. Please don\u2019t make a customer so disgruntled that he stops using your product completely.. Isnt Google concerned about its reputation and brand image here?? My phone is with the service centre since 1.5 months now and no one in the service centre is bothered to check with me about this.. Is this CUSTOMER SERVICE??? Really?? This interaction with the service centre has caused a lot of mental harassment for me. All I ask Google parent company to do now is give me refund of my money OR a new replacement phone. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a big ASK from a customer who has paid hefty price for your product.. I hope a company like yours wont be so indifferent about a customer\u2019s problems with the phone and leave the Indian service to some third party operator.",

    "content": "Okay. So i'm hoping the quality of life stuff i'm experiencing with the pixel buds comes down to me just not understanding how they work. I currently am using the pixel buds paired with a pixel 3 XL.\nI'm wondering how people use them first of all, since for me it feels like they just hinder my ability to use my phone. Are you supposed to just leave them in your ears for the entire day? I find the pixel buds quite comfortable, but i don't think i can keep them in my ears the entire day. However, if i take them out and place them on a desk or something beside me while i'm doing some work, they stay on and I find I miss notifications of text messages or emails and such. Also, when i go to put them back into my ears to use, the touch sensitive right ear bud just starts turning on music or prematurely answering calls before i'm ready. I read there was now a way to turn them off by tapping the right earbud 3 times, but when i do that, and take them out of my ears, they seem to have been turned on again by the act of me touching them to get them out of my ears.\nSo how do you guys use these things? i feel like they should be easier to use than this. I love the sound quality and the buds are quite comfortable to me, but i find myself frustrated by the usage.",

The only way get it to work again is by restarting my phone, then run a proximity sensor fix on the phone and then it will be work fine.  It may last a week, 2 weeks, 2 days, just until decides to quit.  I have had this problem for months and have been looking for a solution.

My phone no longer wakes up without crashing (meaning I can't answer calls, etc.)  I've tried all troubleshooting given by Google support and now am in an endless loop with support.   They said they would send me a shipping label to return my defective phone, however daily I get the same questions back from them (which I promptly answer)...but no shipping label.  I know they are getting my emails by the context of their replies, but they've made no effort just to extract the information they are asking for from the previous emails.  \n\nI'm at my wits end with the poor customer service I've received from Sam, Sierra, Trish, and Adrien.  Each correspondence is a variant of a form letter and they never an act to help me.  Is there a real person at Google that can get me a shipping label so I can return my phone that stopped working properly before it was even 2 months old?",

After ending that call, the sound continued until I reset my phone.\n\nThe second time, when I had taken my phone out of my pocket, it began playing loudly again. I tried turning it down, but again no effect. I opted to restart it, which fixed the issue for the time being.\n\nBoth times this has happened, I was home and the phone was on vibrate (my default \"ringtone\"). I bought the Pixel 2 from Google and put a Verizon wireless chip card in. I have a formerly Google Fi phone number that I used internationally this last summer that is now my family Google Voice number after cancelling the Fi subscription stateside and I have my original Google Voice number that is tied to my work account. I've opened Hangouts and Voice with these other accounts to check for any missed calls, and there is no indication that there were any. The differing times the sounds went off and my alarm settings make me want to rule out it being alarm-related.\n\nAny ideas or suggestions?",

    "content": "As of 15th December I have almost no sound from my device. Below are the instances that I can/can't hear sound.\n\nI CAN hear sound when:\n - I can hear my ringtone when someone calls me\n - I can hear someone when I switch to speakerphone (they can hear me through the mic both on speaker phone and normal earpiece mode)\n - I can listen to music via earphones plugged in using 3mm cable (though my inline buttons are not working - not sure if this is related)\n\nI CAN'T hear any sound when:\n- I answer the call and listen using the default speaker at my ear\n- I play media via spotify, Instagram, YouTube etc\n\nThe weird thing is, in the sound settings which break the levels into media, call, ring and alarm volume, only the ring and alarm volumes make a noise when adjusting the sliders. The media and call volumes do not make any sound.\n\nAlso, if I try to set a new ringtone for my phone or alarm sound, I can hear the demo noises. However, if I try to set the ringtone for notifications I cannot hear any of the demos.\n\nWhat is going on? Hopefully someone can shed some light on the matter and the sound may follow ;)",

It randomly sets allow calls to anyone instead of none with repeat callers on. It randomly sets allow messages to \"from anyone.\" It does these all at once, not one by one, arbitrarily after an inconsistent about of time had passed. \n\nI find myself long pressing the quick setting in the drop down menu to make sure the settings haven't been reset often, find that they usually are fine and cease to check until it happens again.

Today phone worked fine until present issue happened. Phone is unusable - phone calls can reach me, but I can\u2019t see my contact names (only the phone number).",

    "content": "Okay. So this summer I had the motherboard issue where my phone would crash whenever I would try and use the microphone (phone app, third party app, whatever). I brought it in and google fixed everything for free. Hooray. It's been working smoothly since. Until today? Today I started having very similar issues. My phone is basically unusable outside of safe mode-- I get a \"system UI/processes system\" not responding notification. When I boot into safe mode, things... Kind of work? But I am unable to make or receive calls still, and when I try my phone stops working again. There was a brief moment where I was able to make a call (less than 5 minutes) and it worked. But then shortly after it wouldn't, even after another boot. The only thing I haven't done is a factory reset, which... I'd kind of like to avoid? I don't want to lose all of my texts and have to redownload contacts/photos/etc. I already had to do all of that just a few months ago. Any help would be appreciated.",

    "content": "Hello. I have an issue with my Pxl 2 XL. The thing is that I have weird buzz sound over the normal sound from my top speaker when listening any audio or making calls. It happened to me yesterday. I tried to clear my phone to the stock after a bit forum searching, but this solved the problem for an hour or two. Then I tried to push the speaker grill a bit into the body, as many people suggested. That fixed the problem, but yet again, for a short period. I also found that this problem is connected to the speaker grill, because when I push it, the intension of this sound is changing (and also disappeare sometimes). Now I don't know what I should do with that. I bought this one about a week or two before, so I don't know what could've been done.",

I have spoken to EE (my current network provider) Level 2 support, Samsung and even Google to see if they can help and they have all drawn a blank (I have done factory resets switching voicemail on/off on my account and many other things) and I am now stuck so would appreciate it if anyone in this group can help...\n  Whenever I get a voicemail, I get a notification come through to inform me of a message. When however I try to click the notification and/or dial voicemail holding number 1 on the keypad I just get an error message back stating no voicemail number set. I therefore can't get to my voicemail without manually dialing the voicemail number each and every time which is a pain.\n  If I go into the phone app settings and go to the voicemail settings menu the voicemail number shows \"not set\". If I click that to change it, it does open a menu to type the correct number in however when I do and click enter it just sits there with a spinning wheel until it times out and goes back to not set again. Either that or the phone app crashes.\n  I have done a side by side check to my wife's Samsung phone and have noticed that also in the voicemail settings I appear to be missing a setting. On my wife's phone there is a setting called \"Service Provider\" which is set to \"Ans Phone\". On my phone that doesn't exist at all not even to view.\n  The only obvious difference between our phones is that I am on an e-SIM and she is on a physical SIM however I was on a physical SIM when I first got the phone and still had this issue.\n  Anyone got any ideas?",

    "title": "Galaxy Fold - the future in the move",
    "content": "It needed some waiting but I could really touch Galaxy Fold at the IFA, where I was invited as a Community representative.\nSeeing Fold is not just that. Although Samsung's hall was full of interesting devices, from 8K TVs, to tablets, laptop, watches to smart washing machines and refrigerators, Fold was the only one about a half-hour queue. Samsung had it well picked up, the queue was organized and lined with attractions like Note10 etc.\n    Galaxy Fold stage\n20 minut more...\nAfter the necessary waiting the moment came and I could play for almost 15 minutes with the Samsung Galaxy Fold , the first really usable flexible phone in the world (not quite desirable competition attempts we would rather not remind much )\n  At the stand I was taken by a very nice gentleman who was willing to help me with recording a video and responded without any effort for marketing speach . He explained what and how; openly showed what Samsung has changed since the first release and did not rush at me. I could really play as long as I wanted.\n  When you take Fold, you feel like you are holding an old buttons phone. The device is very narrow for today's conditions, but strong and heavy: after all, they are actually two phones in one.\nOn the front side there is a display that is lined with thin frames from the left and right, but there is a lot of space from the upper and lower side. Even if the display is  not limited and the device can be used without restriction even in the closed state, future owners will probably only receive calls and read SMS. Already when I was writing I felt that there was little space.\nOn the back side is a camera, on the sides of the volume buttons, Bixby / power and a fingerprint reader.\nThe body is silver (I do not know if there will be other variations) and incredibly catches imprints. There should be a case available, unfortunately they didn't have it at the stand.\n  I think the description of a closed phone is enough, let's go open it! Maybe there is someone who can do it with one hand, but I'm not. Opening and closing is not difficult, but it requires both hands.\nThe device is stably held in both open and closed condition. The opening and closing process is smooth. After opening, the phone is locked in the opened state. The display shows the image even when opening or closing, there is a smaller transition at the break, but it does not matter at all, because in the semi-open state nobody will operate the phone.\n  A very common question is how much the break in the middle of the display matters. It is clear to me that there will be people who will mind the principle, but with the aim of maximum objectivity I say that the break is easy to find, but it does not matter at all. There were a lot of sharp light sources at IFA, but even in this very challenging environment, browsing over the net or viewing photos was absolutely without distracting sensations.\nIf you swipe your finger across the center of the screen, there is a break again, but it is a slight soft feeling, no hitch.\nYou just know about the break, but you don't mind.\n  The transition between a closed and an open phone is no hitch. You don't have to wait until the big screen comes up, because it starts up at the beginning of the opening and that is immediate.\n  I had no practice in controlling the environment, so the Samsung master showed me how to easily run three applications on the internal screen, it was really a lot of wow!\n    What to say in conclusion? It is not easy. My technically oriented heart was on the brink of a heart attack when I could play with such an advanced device. If you're an enthusiast, you can start saving money, Fold will sell in mid-September in Germany for 2100 \u20ac. If you are a hater, you will definitely find something negative on Fold , like the price.\nFor me, it's the first generation of a revolutionary device and I think Samsung has made it as far as possible and if you're a target audience, start saving money. I'm starting \n    Beautiful\nWhat's inside?\nWhat's inside?\nWhat's inside?\nComparing to S10+\nLet's go!\nA community article\nIt works also partialy closed\nA selfie\nA selfie with a closed Fold\nClosed Fold\n  So what has changed from the release? First of all, the cover film on the display was stretched all the way under the edge (1) so that no one can think of removing it. Furthermore, the hinge (2) has been modified so that dust cannot penetrate through the gap and the openings on the back (3,4) that allow the bend to be reduced, again due to possible dust penetration, which could then enter the fine hinge mechanism.\n    SAMSUNG Galaxy Z Fold3 5G 512 Black | Galaxy Z Flip\nGalaxy Buds | Galaxy Buds+ | Galaxy Buds Pro",

I have never had a cracked screen before. And my phone is less than 2 months old (I bought it on March 13). I have a screen protector on it and keep it in an Otterbox. This crack started in mid-April  and month after I bought it. The crack was so tiny - less than an 1/8 of and inch - I thought it was a scratch on my screen protector at first.  It took two more weeks for me to realize that the screen had cracked. Now the crack stretches across my screen and my phone is doing weird things like dropping calls.  I should not have to replace the screen an eight-week-old phone. Samsung should do a recall and replace all S21 screens with a stronger screen for free.",

I think my problem would be solved if I could select certain Wi-Fi networks on which the phone would always use Wi-Fi Calling by default, whatever the signal strength at the beginning of the call. One of these would of course be my own home network. I don't see a way of setting this up at the moment.\nI realise this may be something for Android to implement.

If you sell defective product you should take it back that the craziest thing I've ever heard, (SideBar) don't go to att they have terrible customer service and they will as they did me stick you with the defective product you purchased from them)\n(Long Story) \nSamsung sent me thru the wringer I had sent them the phone the \"first\" time for repair. They replaced some parts sent it back that process took about to weeks. My phone arrives... ok im getting hype now bcus my new phone, yayyyy right!? Wrong it still had the Google maps issue which was locking the screen interface and making it jump so I couldn't push any thing 9n the screen, but the swipe home screen button worked at the bottom. I called back like theres the same issue with the phone. I had to send it back again they've had my phone for the past 20 days, gave me the run around for 20 days and now thankfully I'm getting a refund bcus they didn't have any S21 Ultras in stock to exchange it. But now its gonna take another 20 days for them to send me the check for the phone so I paid for a phone that I've used for maybe two full weeks out of the month and a half that I've owned it. Hell samsung has used my phone more than me! A whopping 54 days almost two months its gonna take just to be able to buy a new phone then wait for it to be shipped! I so happy with Samsung right now I could go to iPhone! Ugh I hate them so much right now for this entire situation and what was suppose to be a great experience had truly been hell in my ear in the experience of about 40 phone calls over this time Samsung owes me a check dammit I spent hours on the phone with them to get this figured out my job pays me hourly and this was a job I need my check asap!",

I received my S21 but was disappointed to find a week after that calls weren't connecting and people on the other end could not hear me. By this time I had already sent my trade in phone to them and the trade in process was completed. I called up Samsung to ask for a replacement to which they said I would need to send my faulty phone back to them. I said I wanted a replacement first as I'd be without a phone but they said they couldn't do that but guaranteed me that I would receive a replacement within 7-10 working days. My faulty phone was collected by DHL on 14th May, I called on Monday 24th May to chase up where my replacement phone and customer service said they have raised a log with logistics to find out what is going on and to give them 24hrs, I waited until Wednesday to get back in touch and they said same again, to wait 24 hrs as the only way to get in touch with logistics was through email. I waited and called today only to be told that they can't provide me with a replacement phone as their system had changed in May. I am now left with no phone, they are saying they will only give me market value of my trade in phone (s8) which is completely unacceptable as I have traded it in with them for the value of \u00a3250 which to me is a sale. I have asked them why they can't provide me with a replacement they say they do not have this process. They haven't given me a refund yet. I have asked for full price of the s21 to be refunded so I can go buy another but they can't guarantee me that eitherm absolutely diabolical. And to top it off, the manager I spoke to had the cheek of saying I would have to return the Harmon Larson speaker that I got free with the phone! Such disgusting and appalling behaviour from a billion dollar company. Apparently refunds are processed by logistics? Why? And why hey can't send me out a replacement is beyond me!

When I go to return the \u2018SIM2 missed call\u2019, my phone dials out using SIM1 \u2013 frustrating. This can be changed in options where if an outgoing call is placed it asks which SIM you want to use for the call \u2013 pointless. My OnePlus 7 Pro would intelligently select the SIM \u2013 so a missed call on SIM2 would be dialled out via SIM2 automatically, a missed call on SIM1 would be dialled out via SIM1 and you also have the option of changing which SIM dials out should you choose to do so.\nNone of these features are available on the S21 Ultra.

    "content": "I purchased my Galaxy Note 20 towards the end of November,2020. I setup the phone, updated Android to its latest release (1-Nov-2020) and started exploring various features. Everything looked good until I put it on speakerphone during a Whatsapp call. The caller mentioned that she keeps hearing an echo. Sometimes it's a repeat of what the caller says and other times it's random static sounds. I then tested various scenarios to isolate the issue. \nThe issue happens especially with third-party apps such as Whatsapp/DUO and when using the speakerphone. Very rarely,  it happens with regular voice calls too. And the echo intensifies when the phone is held in hand or close to the body. The device has three microphones but the one on the bottom seems to be culprit. When I block it with hand, the echo disappears. But of course, the caller doesn't hear my voice too. \nI returned the device and got a replacement but the same issue happened on the second device too. \nThat's when I did further research and realized that it must be a software issue rather than a hardware issue. Based on other stories, looks like the latest Android update caused the issue. \nHope Samsung quickly releases a patch for this. It's a disgrace that a device that beats competitors in most aspects doesn't get its basics right. ",

There was no signs of damage to the package or that it had been tampered with in any way!\n  We've had 2 disconnected live chats, 3 disconnected phone calls, one terrible live chat and one terrible phone call with Samsung.

    "title": "Major network issues on Note 20 ultra with T-mobile network and Cellspot",
    "content": "I live at the edge of T-mobile coverage on a hill. T-mobile provided me an LTE cell spot for years which worked fine with my Note 8 for the last 2.5 years. I bought my Note 20 ultra on September 6. Everything was fine for about a month.\nThen, as of last week, around October 11, I started having major issues with phone calls and texts.\n  1) inability to make phone calls from the cell network\nNo matter how many times I try, calls don't go through.\nThis happens when connected to the cell network. I dial the number and it just doesn't go through or terminate. The same happens if I redial, no matter how many times.\n  If I enable Wifi calling, calls do go out, at least.  However, there is frequently silence of 2-3 seconds that make it very difficult to have a conversation, especially when my air conditioner comes on. This is despite being less than 10ft from the wireless AC access point, and being connected at a Wifi rate of 866 Mbps, with the backend Internet connection being Comcast gigabit.\n  2)  inability to send texts when connected to either LTE or Wifi network\nI use Signal with the confirmation on. Texts just hang forever when I send them. Recipients do not get them. Sometimes the texts will go out an hour later. Sometimes they result in an error.\nThe behavior with receiving texts is similar.\n  3) as instructed by a t-mobile tech, after after rebooting my phone, and being located 6ft from my cellspot, it shows 4G or 4G LTE signal, and an \"X\" next to it, ie. zero bars. I can't make any calls, send/receive any texts, or use any data.\n  4) a reset of all the network settings on the phone did not fix the problem.\n  5) t-mobile did a \"refresh SIM\" on their end. It did not fix the problems.\n  6) If I power off the cell spot, all the problems go away in my home office. This is what I did for the last week while waiting for a replacement cell spot. But I then have only 0.4 Mbps speed even on the 5G network. In other spots in my home, I have zero cell network signal at all. I am in a 4600 sq ft home. T-mobile send me a new replacement cellspot. I just got it yesterday. All the lights on it are green. Unfortunately, all the problems described above are also back on my phone once the cellspot is on. The cellspot is supposed to improve cell signal, but in fact completely kills it for me instead with my phone !\n  At this point, I'm completely stuck with using my Ooma voice over IP phone to make phone calls. Without it, I would be completely SOL with making calls. I cannot reliably send or receive texts, since Ooma doesn't offer that service.\n  It is too late for me to return my Note 20 Ultra to the store. And I have already sold my Note 8.\n  My husband also has a Note 20 ultra, bought from Costco the same day as mine, and isn't experiencing the same problems, though he is not home most of the time.\n  It seems there is something wrong between my own Note 20 ultra and the cellspot. But I don't know what it could be.\nI'm really at my wits' end.\n  Can anyone shed some light on fixing the problem ? Obviously I have been working with T-mobile techs on the phone on this, but they haven't been able to fix it. I'm going to post this to the T-mobile support forum as well.\n   ",

I can't get calls or messages when I don't have signal.\n  Things I've tried:\n1. Different Sim card\n2. Reset network settings\n3. Restart phone \n4. Factory reset phone\n5. I even sent my phone to Samsung for inspection. But they were useless. They said the device operates within manufacture specifications. They would not change the phone\n6. Changed setting from 5g to 4g\n7. Tried to update prl but there is no option\n8. Tried a different service provider\n  I have seen a couple of people with the same issue but it's not as wide spread. Please help me\n ",

    "content": "The cursor also jumps up 4 or 5 lines when I am using the microphone just like it did with my LG v30, so it has to be a Google issue. \nIt repeated 3 lines of text 15 times with just one stroke making a correction.\nMy screen FREEZES way too often.\nI still have problems copying and pasting just like I did with my old smartphone so it has to be a Google issue.\nIt keeps  initial capping multiple words in the middle of sentences that I am forever having to go back and make lowercase, but that initial capping in the middle of sentences was also on my last smartphone which makes me think this one is a Google problem. I finally had to turn off Auto Captitalize Because it was so frequent in every sentence. Now, it will not captitalize the beginning of sentences!\nWhy don't they ever have past tense words ending in \"ed\" as options?\nIt regularly types 8 instead of ate and own instead of on when I use the microphone.\nThe 1st mention of a dictated sentence always have a space in front of it instead of the prior sentence having a period and a space after it? So when I am dictating a new paragraph, I am always having to go back and get rid of the space.\nI use the microphone for most of what I do instead of typing and it doesn't type over 50% of what I say. So between having to repeat what I say sometimes three or four times and correcting words that shouldn't have been capitalized and backspacing to remove spaces shouldn't be there, and always having to correct wrong wordst typed using microphone or inserting multiple words that I didn't say, it is a total waste of my time.\nIt does not seem to recognize basic punctuation, like using commas and periods! I am for ever having to go back and delete the words to replace them with punctuation.\nWhen I click to highlight something, the highlighter jumps way UP the page instead of staying on the word I clicked, so I am forever having to go way way up to page to retrieve it and bring it back down to where I wanted to go -- where I clicked instead of up.\nIt doesn't add a space after a word when I start typing a word and then click on a pop-up of that word. And if I don't catch it and add the space myself then all the words run together.\nWhen I go to correct a typo and it pops up with the correct spelling, it repeats it without removing the other part of the word. So it has to be erased. And, sometimes when I click to accept a pop-up spelling of a word, it erases the next word so I have to retype it.\nWhen I use the microphone, it very commonly types multiple words multiple times that I am forever having to erase.\nWORST OF ALL, is their Contacts app - white shoulders with a yellow head and an orange background.  When I bought the phone and had everything transferred, the contacts seem to have been saved to the Phone. After making multiple calls, Samsung was able to get my contacts transferred to Google. But all the groups I set up are still on the Phone but not in  Google where I backup my Contacts to. And to make it worse, Verizon convinced me to try to add my contacts to Verizon Cloud which was even worse.  I don't know if everyone else has it in this app but there appears to be something called Linked Contacts at the bottom of every contact. One for the Verizon, 1 for Google and 1 for Verizon.  Best some of them are in there, 4, 5, 6 or 7 times.  Multiples for each or some.  And if I try and delete one of the Linked Accounts, it adds it as a permanent contact that cannot be deleted. And if I try and delete one of the linked accounts come it adds it is a permanent contact that cannot be deleted! [ See there, it repeated a sentence and it typed come instead of a comma!] And the # of total Contacts and on Gmail and Vz are all different.  And for some strange reason, not all contacts save to \"My contacts\" which may be the reason why the numbers don't match between the three places where contacts are backed up to. \nTHIS PHONE HAS BEEN A NIGHTMARE. When I post this, I will probably think of something I missed.",

I upgraded from my S9 which occasionally was hot during charging and heavg usage whereas the S20 is getting really hot from normal usage like phone calls or using the phone for longer than 10 mimutes and no where near the heavy usage the S9 went through. Any ideas anyone?? Thanks in advance.",

    "content": "I live in a weak signal area and wifi calling will not stay on because I am getting 1 bar on 4G which means I get calls dropped or the phone wont connect sometimes (Samsung S20). Coming across from Apple I find this very annoying as Iphone would always default to wifi calling when at home giving perfect call clarity. Looking at the phone it is always switching between wifi calling and 4G. I can get it to stay on wifi calling if I set 2g/3g as my preferred option, but I really shouldnt have to do that. Any ideas ?, and no it doesnt need a reset or cache clear or reset network connections. My wife has also purchased the same phone and it also does it at home and on her work wifi. I repeat Iphone ALWAYS stayed on wifi calling when in range regardless of 4g signal strength",

    "title": "One UI 3 has completely ruined Messenger notifications",
    "content": "So I recently upgraded from the S8+ to the Samsung S20 FE and everything is really great except this new ONE UI 3. Which has apparently just dropped the ball with this entire \"conversation\" system its rolled out. \nWhat I mean is that ONE UI 3 is now catching all notifications and presenting them differently than intended by the app developers. \nExample 1. \n                    The left picture is what Messenger wants to show you when someone is calling you. The Right picture is what happens when One UI 3 Grabs that notification and wraps it up in its own toast notification. I say wrap because the left image can still be found here. If you tap on the notification in the right picture anywhere other than the answer or decline buttons it actually opens up the same call screen as the left image. \nThis is a frustrating issue. I have missed a couple calls when my phone is on but on silent and I set it down when the screen is still on. The big change in the entire screen was a nice way to get my attention. Heck even the first time I got a call I was messing with notification sounds and wasn't sure why the Facebook messenger ringtone was playing. I thought I pressed it by accident. Then I looked up and saw the tiny notification saying I was receiving A phone call. \nThis isnt even the most frustrating issue with this new system though. \nTHE NEW BUBBLES SUCK.. like.. let me give you that one more time. THEY SUCK IN EVERY CONCIEVABLE WAY. \nFirst the center placement wasn't needed. If you want to be able to place them in the center.. whatever that's fine. But the old messenger chat head system was WAY BETTER. Having the empty white section to close all of them was also nice but that is now gone. The chat heads.... excuse me .. \"Bubbles\" are too small. They need to be about 25% bigger. Honestly there is no reason for them to be smaller. Its not like we are trying to watch a youtube video behind the chat head.\nA lot of this is preference. I get that. Some people are like \"Messenger sucks noob get a real messenger.. ah-hyuck!\" Well my grandmother who is over 80 uses it and my mother, and my son, and basically my entire family. They all have facebook and it was a really convenient way to communicate with them easily which is faster and feels more connected than generic texting.\nSo I have my reasons for sticking with messenger but the biggest issue with this new bubble system is not a preference to the new toast wrapping and bubble head sizes.. The biggest issue is that the bubble system has its own set of notifications. For example. \nI open a Bubble Head or whatever for a conversation with my GF\nI then close the bubble by dragging it to the bottom.\nI then open messenger later and send her a message NOT in a bubble\nShe replies. \nNow if you are following along.. I am actually in the conversation window right? I can see her little \"Im typing something\" indicator and everything. The message pops up. AND... a handy toast notification pops up telling me what she said too. You know... incase I couldnt read what she said in the actual conversation and needed that extra notification. SARCASM OVER\nThis is complete trash. Why would I need a notification for a conversation that I am currently looking at? The reason this is happening is because the bubbles think you are not looking at them despite the fact that you closed them.  Tapping on the notification brings you right into the conversation you were already in but doesnt clear the notification because its waiting for you to look at the bubble version of the conversation. You literally have to either swipe it off or reopen the bubble notification to clear it off.\nIm really at a loss to understand how samsung dropped the ball so hard on this conversation system. It wasnt needed. Honestly its just extra fluff like the bixby button that people threw a fit over that no one used for bixby and everyone remapped to something else. \nI have tried to fix these issues but they cant be fixed. I downloaded over 20 older versions of messenger and managed to get the old chat heads back but then it wouldnt let me send images in the older versions which is just dumb it literally fixed every other issue except the first one about the calling notification but no images so i had to switch back. . So im literally waiting for samsung to fix or remove their stupid conversation system or for messenger to come out with an update to find a workaround to samsungs failure. Upgrading a phone used to be fun. This was ust disappointing.  ",

    "content": "Hello, there! Before 2 weeks I bought a brand new Galaxy S20+ (the red one). Since the beginning I am having problems with my phone. My calls keep dropping. I try to dial and I hear a calling signal, but the call drops after 4 seconds. The receiver never received my call. I tried with my husband, two phones near each other-same story, the other phone never rings. I must restart my phone, my network settings, my flight mode, or to force down the phone app in system applications. I can make a call only after I do some of these things. After an hour or so everything repeats again. I can not receive calls too. They are going directly to my voice mail. After restart everything is fine for another 1 hour. My phone is updated to the last framework, i tried both sim slots, hard reset, soft reset, network reset- nothing changes. It is so frustrating. Why have I paid ~1000\u20ac for a phone that I can not even use?! My sim card works perfectly fine in other phones. ",

I thought I'd love a pair of those buds for work and its only 10 pound more a month than a sim only with loads more data. Seemed like a no brainer- a free pair of these buds I want plus I'll get a brand new phone and the phones are really good.\n\nLong story short I was told I'd have to register as a member on samsung members after 30 days of purchase but as the promotion was ending that Week.\n\nI asked on the phone to o2 who said they had no control over the promotion so best speak to samsung and I called them.\n\nI was advised to wait the month itl be OK as the promotion was advertised on o2 and you bought within the time frame!\n So if you wait 1 month then the member benefit option will be available for to register for your free galaxy buds.\n\nI thought great so 1 month later samsung customer service was right the benifit section is accessible, although nowt t says I'm to late to register!.\n\nBut it's OK I think very!. Ivve called and I've emailed and they said wait the month.\n\nThe first customer service agent from samsung told shed hang up the phone one 10 mins I as I was been aggressive I quickly assured her politely I think it's my accent and I'm very polite I didnt say to her but she was extremely rude maybe even just wanting me of call as I am correct but they seed.to have no way to fix. \n\nRegardless after multiple calls to both party's ive been told tough luck. The last few samsung guys tried their best as in spike to a manager. \n\nJust warning to people thinking of buying you won't get.your buds.. This was my 3rd 24 month contract with samsung & popball will be the last. \n\nIs there anything I can do to maybe still get these as it was advertised and the sole purpose of purchasing. Any help be appreciated guys",

    "content": "Hi\nI received my new s20fe a couple of weeks ago, purchased from mobile phones direct.\n  I woke up one morning to discover the lcd screen had completely broken whilst charging overnight. The colours were flickering as if the phone had been jumped on. Strange thing is that the phone has not been dropped or bumped in any way, in fact I treated this phone like a baby since I had it with the added protection of a 360 case. \n  The phone itself has no bumps scratches or cracks on the outside of the phone but when holding it up to the lights there is a small internal crack beside the camera. Since receiving my phone I have noticed it has got very hot whilst charging and making calls. I immediately reported the screen fault to samsung and was told to return the phone to the retailer and they should exchange as I was within 30 days.\n  Mobike phones direct have inspected the phone (so they say) and have said the fault is the customers. I'm absolutely devastated by this as I have not caused this damage. Either its been caused by heat or there was a crack upon delivery of the phone. How  can a phone work perfectly before you sleep and be broken in the morning without even a crack on the outside.\n  I plan to ask samsung for a second opinion as I have absolutely nothing to hide. I'm just really worried that nobody will take ownership of the fault and I will be left with the bill. I haven't found samsung much help up to now, they don't want to know about it!\n  Does anyone have any advice please?",

    "content": "DO NOT BUY SAMSUNG S20 FE........\n I recently bought Samsung Galaxy S20 FE from Samsung dealers in India. And since then my life has turned upside down. The phone is advertised with primary feature of 120Hz Amoled super smooth display.\nThe phone switches to 60 Hz with couple of minutes of usage. The main reason why I bought this phone was 120Hz refresh rate and that feature disappears with 2 mins of normal usage. The phone heats up so much near the rear camera and from earpiece module that it hurts my ears while making calls (It is already winter season here, so the ambient temperature is already low. God knows what will happen in summers). The charging goes super slow when this happens.\nAll this happens when I am normally using my phone (NOT GAMING). I went to Samsung service centre and when I tried explaining the issue, the technician asked me what is 120 Hz???? I was shell shocked to hear that from a samsung certified engineer. Since then my phone is lying in service centre with no resolution. I have travelled over 200 miles back and forth to service centre in last 7 days as I stay far from service centre.\n @SAMSUNG, can you please explain what was my fault in paying INR 45000 to you? Why am I paying a premium and still suffering? \n SAMSUNG few details for you -\nMy phone is in  India service centre with following job id - 4313740738.",

Our engineers will have had to fix this for you, as our policy requires us to send your phone back to you in an out of the box state.\n  Now they're saying it won't be repaired and isn't covered?

    "title": "Incredibly Bad Samsung Support Experience - Is this normal?",
    "content": "Heya Samsung Community, I don't know what I'm hoping to get from posting this but I'm at a bit of a loss. \n  I got a Note 10+ 5g the moment it was released and honestly it's the best phone I've ever had. It's incredibly well made device. \n  Unfortunately for me I was assaulted in the street at the end of August. In the attack they broke my nose and my phone. \n  I booked an appointment with the Kings Cross support centre, turned up, and in short was told to leave as they wouldn't help me fix the phone (they said it was due to covid). I can't help but feel it's because of how I looked with the black eye and broken nose - they were really rude and I was really polite. \n  I managed to get through to online support who booked a courier to collect the phone and would organise the repair. That came like clockwork, I packed my little phone up into the box, and off it went. \n  I got some calls at all hours of the day during the next few days, asking me to pay them money to repair the phone. At first I thought it was a scam as they were calling at times like 10pm on a Sunday, and couldn't verify anything, but eventually I just paid it as I care more about getting my phone back than the money. \n  I waited patiently for a while before starting to get worried. I checked the status of my repair online and it says it was repaired and delivered - but it wasn't. I haven't received the phone back. I reached out to support and they told me to call the service centre. The service centre told me to call DPD. DPD told me to contact Samsung. \n  I now have had to report it stolen by Samsung with the police - which feels a bit silly. I can't believe it's taken more time to get my phone fixed (and returned) than for my nose to heal! \n    Anyway the question I have if there is any, is this typical of Samsung support? I can't really believe a company that makes such good devices can have such an incredibly bad support experience. I probably will not get another phone from them as even if I hate the Apple devices they know how to handle this side of things, and I just don't trust Samsung anymore. ",

When mobile data is disconnected, I'm going to SIM card manager and observe, that mobile data is used on SIM 2 (Google Fi), which is disabled. To fix that, I need to swich it back to my local card. It happens ~2 times a day.\n Another strange thing that might be related is when I'm enabling SIM 2 (Google Fi) card, my mobile data is automatically switched to SIM2, while Calls and SMS are left on SIM1. I've shoot a gif to show how it looks like: https://i.imgur.com/svaUR3O.gifv\n So, my assumption is next: phone having SIM 1 enabled and SIM 2 disabled sometimes `pinging` SIM 2 to check whether it works or not.

I would be so grateful if anyone could give me some advice on this.\nDear Sir / Madam,\nI am writing to you to raise an issue about: Electrical Products\nThe issue that I have experienced was: My phone became faulty\nI reported it to vodaphone on the 15th. They tried troubleshooting but couldn't fix it so said I had to contact Samsung who was responsible for the warranty.\nSamsung couldn't fix it remotely either and said it had to be sent off for a maximum of 7 days.\nDay 7 was on 23/01/21 so I checked with repair centre and they said it was still being inspected and I may have to wait 14 working days, essentially 3 weeks.\nI complained to Samsung. The call handler said they weren't regulated by any consumer bodies, he would not transfer me to someone more senior with authority.\nI asked how to complain formally and he said he would log it, it would be reviewed internally and that the outcome would not change and I wouldn't be kept informed.\nI then received an email from the repair centre to inform that I had caused the fault. They said it was burnt inside due to microwave exposure.  They would not accept that this was an impossibility and said the decision was final. They requested \u00a3339 to repair it. I asked them 5 days ago to return it to me so I could have it inspected independently as I do not accept liability. They still have not returned my phone.\n.\nThis meant that I am 4 months into a 2 year contract without the handset I purchased.\nI have spent around 20 hours in communication trying to resolve this with Samsung, AO and vodaphone. \nIt has caused me so much unnecessary anxiety and distress.\nI am a nurse so i am at work everyday but not able to be in contact with my 3 children.\nMy mom, who is vulnerable can't contact me.\nI am the point of contact for my 95 year old neighbour and if she fell and pressed her pendant it goes to my mobile and now this wouldn't be possible.\nI can't access emails which I use for all of my accounting and most of my correspondence.\nMy phone has now been returned and I have contacted 3 independent repairers and they all said if my phone had been exposed to the microwave it wouldn't switch on at all and I wouldn't have been able to make calls at all. All three could not believe what Samsung have said. \nI look forward to your prompt response on this matter. As recommended by Trading Standards, I would like to keep a complete record of my case, so please reply to this email address.\nYours faithfully,\nLeona Tasab",

(I am currently connected to the same router on my Lenovo Yoga laptop without issue - I get a very fast connection (50 down/15 up)\nI also have a voxi sim with mobile data which worked very well in my Moto G4, decent connection and 4G in my house where I am now.\nThe S10 has a bevy of specific connection issues\nWiFi:\nInstagram and youtube apps work flawlessly\nInternet browsers are useless : sometimes they manage to load a google result but generally return an error about the connection being interrupted or disconnected other websites (clicked through google results) always \"time out\" in this way - (I've tried samsung internet, Chrome, Firefox, Firefox Focus) \nBeyondPod has managed to update and download podcast feeds but was a bit flakey.\nSpotify wont load the start page\nWhats app often uses mobile data instead of wifi  as it says my wifi is not working. but sometimes it doesnt say this.\ngoogle play works fine to download apps and updates\nthe Pintrest app works fine.\nwhatsapp sends and recieves messages fine.\ngoogle photos loads photos in a blink\n  On Mobile data:\nYoutube and instagram apps work totally fine.\nPinterest is not really working,\nChrome will connect to googe results and google images fine but wont load other web pages. \nOther browsers are much more flakey even at loading goggle results - gernerally they wont.\nwhatsapp sends and recieves messages fine\n  Network connection\nCalls go through fine and when calling I have 4 bars of connection - at other times I have 1 bar.\nText messages go through fine\nOther apps report network issues (I'm not sure if these are to do with the mobile network or internet usage or what)-\nI cannot register Signal on my phone as it either ownt connect to the network or their web based \"human check\" times out -\nI cant register with bixby as it says (after spinning its wheel for a long while) it cannot access my network to check my account\n  Things I have tried (mostly multiple times):\nrestarting the phone\nresetting the network settings\ndisconnecting the wifi, forgetting the network, restarting\nassigining static ip\nAssiging a static mac address\nUsing wifi without the sim\nUsing mobile data with the wifi turned off\nclearing my DNS (airplane mode on and off, and using Chrome://)\nprobably some other things I've forgotten.\nCould it be a antivirus issue? - I havent installed one but the phone has some kind of build in McAffee security that I cant see how to turn off.\nI just dont understand it - its driving me crazy TBH\n   ",

    "content": "Hi, I bought a Samsung s10e from eBay end of last July. It was my first time buying a phone from there as i already had reservations about it. The phone was wrapped and everything and from my same network provider apparently. I had no issue with my phone but almost a year to the date this message showed up and I could not call or text out or receive incoming calls or texts as well as use my mobile data. My signal is usually at 4/5 bars still. I initially thought it had something to do with when I updated my phone, i noticed it took a lot longer than usual and when I checked it, it was extremely hot as it was plugged in. When it turned back on the message was there. After, charging my phone for a while would result in it getting very hot so I would take it off charge and put it back on. I contacted Three and they tried lots of other troubleshooting then said it was blacklisted. It got unblocked after I provided the IMEI but within a few days it happened again. I contacted eBay as Three recommended and said this happens all the time, eBay will help out. They were extremely unhelpful, citing sellers privacy, which is ridiculous as they could be complicit in selling stolen phones?! because it was after 90 days they didn't care. After back and forth calls to Three they then told me my phone wasn't blacklisted. They sent me a new SIM, I've just put it in and same issue \"SIM 1 not allowed\". I bought from ebay to save money on a long term expensive contract due to not having the finances to afford one, i just feel really let down and don't know who to contact to see if this is resolvable. /:\nDoes anyone have any advice? It couldn't have happened at a worser time, i live in am extremely high covid case area, we are on alert that we could be the first town within the UK to go back into full lock down, the only information I was getting were through texts, no other house hold member recieves any. On top of that I have very high risk, vulnerable family members who can only use phone as a contact option.",

    "title": "S10e what have I bought?",
    "content": "I recently purchased an S10e. This is the first time I've owned an android or Samsung  phone. I was drawn to the phone due to its expandable memory and thumb print sensor as I don't really like the face recognition of the iphone 11.  (although this phone has this feature too).  I use the phone for work and need to open it flat on a desk. \n Apart from the usual drama of changing from an iphone to a Samsung, there are a few things I'm totally confused about. \n 1. When I open  an app to look at the messages , even when I haven't read them, the unread badge from the homescreen disappears. So when I finish work I've no idea what unread messages I have. \nThis is the most basic of features and my Google searches bring up either apps that claim to do it but don't or it's just how the operating system works. \n 2. The raise/ lift to wake doesn't work properly. What is the angle set to? \n 3. The Bixby button is a joke underneath the volume controls. I know you can set it to different things but if I try to double click the volume while the phone is in my pocket it will open something by accident. \n 4. The thumb/ fingerprint scanner is too high. When I use it I'm constantly clicking the volume buttons too. \n 5. The headphones are a joke. (The sales person actually made a point of how good the headphones were,( but I couldn't try them out in store) ...They are now in the bin. \n 6. Answering calls. After 3 missed calls I realised you don't press the answer call button to actually answer the call , you swipe it. Can I change this? \n 7. The samsung memory card I have installed randomly stops working and needs to be \" sorted out\" ie synced/ formatted whatever. \n Can anyone help an any of these subjects before I video myself setting fire to this phone and dancing on its ashes? \n(Shame I can't video it on this phone, the camera's awesome) \n  ",

Why is this \"security\" weaker than that of every previous biometric secured phone they have offered? Are they looking into this and testing this? Can they offer any reassurances? Can they do anything to address this?\nCamera - seriously below par performance, imaages are trashed by noise and compression. This is not a hardware issue, it is software. Google camera removes most if not all of this noise when used (can only be done on Snapdragon devices) so please, sort out the camera app\nCamera - night mode, please do something Samsung as the competition are laying waste to your camera in this regard, you *used* to be the market leader, what happened?\nCamera - unable to turn off HDR - tried and tested multiple times/ways. HDR is still being applied whether this is turned on or off\nCamera - we need to be able to change the resolution and not just the aspect ratio, this even works on my wifes S9 with android pie\nCamera - pro mode for video - please reinstate this, why was this even removed?\nNotifications - this is huge - please, pelase, PLEASE can Samsung please enhance the GUI or AOD to utilise the camera cutout to act as a notification light. We all know there is no LED anymore to tell us if we have missed calls/messages/emails etc but this is absilutely huge in 2019 to have a phone that does not let the user know if they have items that they need to attend to on their phone, especially when it is seemingly a stupidly easy fix for Samsung to implement. Just look at what has been done by (granted, horrible) 3rd parties in the app store. PLEASE!\nNotifications - please also use this as a charging light. Basically, just replicate the functionality of the LED on every single previous Samsung phone but use the camera cutout instead, i mean, these are low power OLED after all\nGeneral OS - it seems quite apparent that this was very rushed and there are aspects of the skin/os that reflect that. This needs sorted\nFeel free to add to this list.\n Above all, we need some transparency and communication from Samsung about all of the above as they are making a mockery of their 2019 flagships.\n Head in the sand is not going to cut it right now guys.\n Are any of the ambassadors in communication with Samsung and if not, how do we feed this back to them?",

To be able to save a manual set filter and instantly go to that preset filter you made for the perfect moment  that calls to be shot in the right lighting or something a bit more to make it pop in your own original way). To get the filter you honestly want you have to eye ball the slider till you get the right setting but by then the subject of your photo.. . Might have changed a few things \n The base filters and the ones you can download are horrible cause they feel and look like gimmicks and trash style filters for selfies nothing Real for actual moment to properly capture  in a scenery. \n  The ones that come with it now are horrible and they removed another filter EVERGREEN. Before this update even pro mode had set filters that came helpful.  Now we got this trash slider that makes it honestly less user friendly. When you want to use pro mode but now I can't get the right lighting like the filter evergreen oor any filter with that greenish movie film vibe to it.\n What they should've done is to let us choose what we want to do.  Not force a unnecessary change.  Keep the manual filter in the advance part but keep the  Preset set filters that we can use on the fly during pro mode a instantaneously. Just like how the base photo mode is. \n This update ruined more than just the camera stuff .. It ruined my experience with the phone. Functions that used to love isn't here anymore.  Just feels like it was a bit more of a step back on the software than anything.\n  Wonder who they were catering too more.... Us or their wallet ",

The screen fingerprint unlock animation continued to remain after unlock for about 2-3 seconds\n2. I was unable to restart or turn off phone - after clicking on Power off, a user needs to tap again to power off. No action was being performed. The phone would then begin to power off after 15 seconds\n3. Further more there are several bugs when answering calls - I couldn't pick up a call, when I did answer it, I couldn't hear anything. I tried to call back but the result was the same. Overall the phone needed several restarts after the last update. . . \nOverall, the phone started doing everything at a lag - while listening to music if I increased the volume through the physical buttons, the volume would increase after 5 secs.\n I hope they fix it soon.

Cleared memory cache and data from the call app\n3. Speaker phone activated upon receipt of a call which is not ideal\n4. Started phone in safe mode to see if an app is conflicting with the settings, no joy\n5. Taken SIM card out and rubbed the gold chip\n6. Checked update on settings and latest version is in use\n7. Tested microphone in defualt voice recorder app, also tested a voice message in WhatsApp, all works fine\n8. Factory reset phone, no joy and a waste of time\n\nAfter trying all this the receiver still makes a clicking/static sound\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated, maybe I am missing something, it doesn't seem to be a hardware issue? \n\nMany thanks \ud83d\ude0a\n\n#galaxynote9 #calling #calls #note9 #troubleshooting ",

However, this time I cannot even find that option on my current Note 9 run by Android 8.1.0 & Samsung Experience 9.5.  I have tried every possible fix including getting rid of all suspected apps but all my efforts went in vain.

    "content": "Hello folks,\n  I purchase the Galaxy Note 9 and its the first phone, that grinds my gears because it isn't possible to have a normal call via speaker. Previously I used 5 years long a BlackBerry Priv, that already lacks of the hardware due 3gb Ram and low processor for my usage.\nWhen I use the speaker-mode in a normal phonecall, than it has to be silent so people can hear me. Also it is important, that I am close to the phone like 1meter. If I get further away, the phone cuts my voice often out, so the other person doesn't hear the one or other word I say.Also, if I drive in my car and have my phone in the carholder (phone to head is less than 1meter away) people have the same issue, since the noise of the car cuts my voice out too. And I already shout like a maniac to prevent the cut-outs.\nAnother example: I am having a call, switching to speaker, was my hands (typical in corona-time) and the phone is on the sink, then - while water is running - it cuts me out because it tries to cut out the water. When water stops, it seems fine.\nI figured out, that it is a software-forced noise-reduction that comes in when I call. Sadly this is the most-worse noise-reduction I ever heard of.\nAlso important to know: I can use the preinstalled voice-recorder or also do whatsapp-notes. Everything works perfect. I can even move 10 meters away and you can still hear me.\nI already got a few calls with Samsung and the techincal-section. They reproduced the setting and agreed, that this problem is there and that it is the intelligent noise reduction (their words). The person also tried to explain me, that in case of having such call is, that I use a Samsung-watch to take the call to a watch. Sadly there is no switch to turn off the noise-reduction. Seriously I can just say: WTF?\nI also write a criticism to Samsung and they told me, that they are sorry i am not fully happy with the phone and that they tell it to the section in korea, but they cannot promise they fix it. \n  So is this now the \"flagship-experience\" we get for so much money? I have a old phone hear at home with cables. Even there it works fine with turning on speaker. This is a joke.\nNow I am thinking if I get the phone back where I bought it. What you guys say? Can I expect any help there?\n ",

    "content": "I am having the most peculiar problem with my Samsung Note 9 running One UI 2.5.\nI cannot pinpoint as to when this started occurring but i am having major issues with Wi-Fi calling on the device. I am on the three network and on my home Wi-Fi network sometimes it switches over to Wi-Fi calling however not always (I presume this is dependent on cellular signal strength). The issue arises however when i am at work.\nI work in a basement in a large commercial office building and the building has 3x networks (2 of which are password protected and 1 which is free access). When in the basement i have no cellular signal whatsoever however my phone is still showing 4x bars. It will not however connect to Wi-Fi calling under any circumstances (it is set to switched on).\nThe Wi-Fi network definitely supports Wi-Fi calling as I have a Note 10 device as my work phone running on EE connected to exactly the same network and is connected to Wi-Fi calling. I have also inserted the EE sim into my Note 9 and it then connects to Wi-Fi calling so it doesn't appear to be a device issue. I have also put the Three sim into the Note 10 however as i presume the device is locked to EE it will not connect to a cellular network to test this the other way round.\nI have spoken to both Samsung and Three who both are not able to resolve this. Three have even sent out a new sim just incase and this has not worked. I have also spoken to the person who manages the Wi-Fi networks at work and he has looked into this and cant see any block or reason why it wouldn't be working so am at a total loss.\n  If anyone can help it would be greatly appreciated as is causing major issues for me when i cant receive any calls during the day whilst at work.

I have Notify During Calls turned on because I want to hear a beep or get a vibration during a call when a notification comes through.\nHowever, this doesn't seem to be working. The notifications come through but no audible beep or vibration.\nI reached out to Samsung on live chat through Samsung Members who igave me the simple way out (do a factory reset or get a replacement. Like seriously WTF?!). I told him in no uncertain terms that that wasn't going to happen because the replacement phone is going to have the exact same problem and the factory reset isn't going to do anything to remedy the problem because the phone had been doing that from day 1.\nSo then I called Samsung Support and the guy was a lot more helpful. He used remote assistance to check settings and cleared data from the phone app. He then sent me a text message (Textra app) to test whilst I was on the call to him. Weirdly, there was a beep, but no vibration. Then he changed to stock Message app instead of Textra and now there was a vibration but no beep! Lol\nSo his buddy in the office also has a Note 9 and he tested on his phone. Same problem! Phew! It's not just my phone. Meanwhile I was getting other notifications from Twitter and WhatsApp, and there is no sound OR vibration. So he's scratching his head thinking this is weird. So he sends his friend a WhatsApp message too to test, and lo and behold he too doesn't get any audible sound or vibration either.\nSo basically this functionality is not working and I would like to know if others are having the same issue. If you are, I would strongly suggest that you contact Samsung Support and make them aware. They can then work on a software update to fix this.\n ",

It is a little bit hard to resolve some problems on Samsung warranty. That was the first time I needed to use the warranty.

Also, when I swapped the SIM card in this phone with the SIM card in another phone, the other phone could use my SIM card to send and receive calls and texts, but my phone failed to use the foreign SIM card to do the same. Thus, I suspect something besides the SIM card is at fault.\n  What I've tried: I've tried most of the suggestions found on this page: https://thedroidguy.com/how-to-fix-the-samsung-galaxy-a10e-cant-send-text-messages-issue-1108156 :\nVerify that your area has a good network signal: The other phone could send and receive texts and calls, so this isn't the issue.\nPerform a soft reset: Did not fix the issue.\nCheck your SIM card: see reasoning above.\nClear the cache and data of your messaging app: Clearing the cache didn't work, and I'd rather not clear the data except as a last resort, because, I assume, that will delete all my conversation histories.\nCheck if the problem continues in safe mode: It does.\nReset the network settings: Did not fix the issue.\nWipe the cache partition of your phone: Did not fix the issue.\nPerform a factory reset: I didn't try this one, as I'd rather not use it except as a last resort.\nMore details: When I open Settings, go to \"About phone\", then \"Status\", and finally \"SIM card status\", I see some possibly-relevant information:\nNetwork: Verizon Wireless\nMobile network state: Unknown\nService state: Out of service\nIMS registration status: Not registered\nSignal strength: -113 dBm 0 asu\nMobile voice network type: LTE\nMobile data network type: LTE\nRoaming: Not roaming\nThe three bolded items seems like they might be important. Also, I'm confused by the \"Not roaming\" item, since when I go to \"Settings\" > \"'Connections\" > \"Mobile networks\", I see that I have \"Data roaming\" turned on.\n  More additional details: I'm pretty sure the update that caused this issue was \"System Update 4\", made available on 30 June 2020, as described on this page: https://www.verizon.com/support/samsung-galaxy-a10e-update/. I remember delaying the installation of the update a few times, which explains why I only installed it a few days ago (but I feel like I only delayed it for maybe a week, which doesn't quite line up, so maybe I'm wrong about which update it is). However, I see that System Update 4 is described as introducing \"Focus Mode\", which I didn't have before the update and which I do have now, which suggests that I'm right about this one being the culprit after all.\n  What else can I try to fix the issue?",

The 4G Internet and masseges works just fine, but when I am trying to call someone or other people call me, there are no ringtone, just silence, and it doesn't connect. I\u2018ve already tried hard reset, switching sim cards, tried all kinds of APN settings.

While using Ukrainian sim cards there are no VoLTE option available in the settings at all, so still no way to make/receive calls (changing network to 2G/3G doesn't make any changes).

In particular, if I stop using the phone and leave it on standby for approx 1-2 mins, the phone stops recieveing any data related messages (e.g. emails, whatsapp, ebay).   If I start using the phone again, I have to go into the relevant apps (email, whatsapp, etc) in order for all messages to come through.  It is as if the background data automatically stops / goes \"to sleep\" for all apps if I don't use the phone for a couple of minutes and then I have to go and open the relevant app for it to syncronise with its server and \"wake up\" again.  This only afects apps that rely on data. Phone calls and SMS text messages are not affected. I've checked the phone's data related settings, including Data Saver (whcih is \"off\"), Auto Sync data (which is on for all accounts), and I can't resolve the issue. I've also asked my internet provider for a new sim card and used it, but it made no difference. This is very frustrating because it means that in practice I have to keep checking my phone to see if I have received any messages.  Any suggestions/ideeas would be much appreciated!",

I've come to find out that since I gave it to her, she cannot receive any calls.  She can call out.  She can send/receive texts from everybody.  The house landline can call her.  The rest of us get a please check number and try again.  I went to AT&T store and they spent an hour with me, even changed out her SIM card.  They ended up escalating the issue (tried everything).  I got home and being tech support myself, I swapped her SIM card for mine, and put hers in my Pixel.  I could call her number/my phone, she could call my number/her phone.  No one else could call her number (so in my opinion, that takes the phone out of the equation).  I swapped the cards back to their respective phones and now I could call her!!  So the landline can call, I can call.  Dad, and several staff cannot.  Come to find out, they all (4 of them) have iPhones, 3 are on AT&T, one is on Sprint.  I also asked my other kids to call her as they don't have iPhones, and alas, they cannot, so that's not it.  I spent over and hour yesterday and another hour today with AT&T chat and escalated tech support.  They truly have no idea.  Her phone has been factory reset 4 times now, she essentially has NO apps on it as I haven't set it up again.  No calls are blocked, all numbers are in her list/contacts.  I am truly at a loss and so is AT&T.  I've looked all over the internet, I've tried everything; cleared network cache, reset 3x, checked all settings.  Any suggestions from here?  AT&T could also call her but the call got rejected because it was from an unknown number.  Thank you. ",

According to the description, it lets you put your phone next to your ear when somebody's contact information or text history is displayed to call them.\nAlthough this is a cool feature in theory, it seems likely to be the cause of my unintentional calls, probably due to the phone confusing the side of my leg with  my ear.

Then they spent the next 40 minutes installing the things you didn't want and didn't ask for (my S9 pie upgrade was 40-45 minutes).\nYou'd be at the dealer raising h***, right? You'd demand your money back or sue BMW, right?\nSo, why is Samsung able to do the same thing to my personal property, my phone, and people still buy their products? \n\nIssues since this Pie update:\n- Action button/menu item locations. Don't see why these needed to change. I build muscle memory to work faster. Moving things around makes me work slower and have to relearn petty things, as well as make mistakes that add work. How does that make any sense?\n- Touch sensitivity. It now takes multiple taps or swipes to get an action recognized. No screen protector. Never a problem before the update. Why did this need to change?\n- Adaptive brightness. It doesn't work, and it didn't need to be changed. Can't use the phone in bed without manually lowering brightness, can't grab it quick to change songs while driving at night without it lighting up the entire interior of the car. Again, why break what was working great?  \n- Text message app banner. Literally half the texct app display is grey, with the word \"Messages.\" Why was this added? Why would you add ANYTHING that adds even a microeffort to your app's usability? I can't find a way to eliminate it. I open the app 300 times a day. I get it. I opened the messaging app. I don't need to see the word every time I want to grab a conversation quick.\nPlease don't replace my CONTENT with your excessive label. \n- Always-on Notification icons. Again, didn't need to change. The unobtrusive white or grey envelope is now blood red, full charge icon green.\nCoupled with adaptive brightness, if I bump it in the night, its like I woke a demon that stares at me with 2 red eyes and a green ear. This was needed because...?   \n- Contacts colors. There is nothing purposeful or aesthetic about this change. Not necessary and should be configurable. I'm an adult. I don't look at contacts to be entertained by colors, nor do I need a magical rainbow flowing by as I scroll. I ditched MS Outlook for Android because this was annoying and childish. Why force me to the same nonsensical junk?\nAgain, more content please, less arts and crafts. \n- Notification listing. The buttons are rearranged, at least for gmail. Delete and reply were swapped, so muscle memory, which still kicks in after over a week, has me hitting reply, which means I open the app, thus all that mailbox notifications are removed from the panel and I have to take a dozen extra steps to clean out messages.\nThis change was necessary to force upon me because...?\n- Performance. It now has arbitrary hang ups. Like it's trying to call the mothership and can't, but everything else has to wait until it fails at that. As I write this post, I'm watching my S9 sitting on my desk s l o w l y attempt to open my gmail app. Just a white screen with a red banner as it tries to get it's stuff together and show me my mail list after tapping the new mail notification. Yesterday, standing in line at a store, I attempted to call my wife and make sure my list was right...but ended up not bothering because the phone took so incredibly long to respond when I hit the phone app icon. And nothing else worked while it contemplated my request...it was effectively a brick. Good thing I don't use the phone to pay, I'd have every customer behind me irate. But imagine if people depended on their phone to make phone calls? This phone is 4 months old, and it now performs worse than my 3 year old S7 did before I upgraded.\nGMail app still hasn't opened. I gave up. I would reboot, but I'm afraid it will arbitrarily update again. \n- Display animations. I don't need a window shrinking up and down or across my screen. Ditch the cartoons. Open and close my apps faster. Or stop talking about cpu speed if you're going to waste it. Make it so fast I don't notice a delay from touch to open. Hit that goal, then you can give up some cpu cycles to make them look magical. I got rid of my iPhone because I am an adult and a professional that uses a tool, not a toy or life manager.  \n- Recently used. Why. Why. Why. The tops of every recent app used to be identifiable in one single button press. Now I get a full shot of the app. Sometimes I don't want the last app so visible, like when sitting next to someone in a meeting and I have confidential messages or gallery pics in recently used, etc. This is a massive step backwards in efficiency and privacy.\n- Notification panel. Can't get rid of \"Accessibility: 2 functions...\" no matter how many times I go in and confirm, yes, I want those features enabled. I do not want my notification panel full of useless clutter. This line will not clear, and touching it just changes it's detail. I'm not sure something could be intentionally engineered to be more pointless or useless.\n- Settings pull down. I can deal with this, but don't like it. I'm impressed that this upgrade managed to make something seem more chaotic by making it all look the same. It's like there was once a drawer in my kitchen for every item, and I knew where every drawer was. Then Samsung or Google came along and smashed all my drawers, and dumped the contents of every drawer into a really ugly box. Now I have to hunt around the box whenever I need something. I almost wish that's really hat happened to I could have some recourse against it...\n\n- Forced upgrade. I had delayed the install over an over, then had to reboot in the middle of the day while out of office because mail stopped flowing. This killed my productivity for a while because I didn't realize a simple phone reboot meant it would be a brick for a 45 minute upgrade.\n Look, I've gone through interface updates that scramble things up and I have to learn to live with it, but enough is enough. These companies are getting away with extreme consumer abuse by removing an opt-out. There are so many changes here that are utterly useless; they don't even IMPROVE the interface appearance, they just clutter and disorganize it. I'm not even bothering to list the icon changes that seem to look less and less intelligent with every iteration; that's just more developer arts and crafts I have to live with being graffiti'd on my stuff.\nIt severely interferes with my functionality when I have to retrain my unthinking muscle-memory actions every few months, and for no decent reason. It's not like I bought a new phone; I just woke up one morning and everything was different. For no reason. And you're telling me I can't undo it. \nWho's phone is it, then?\n  Someone please explain to me why I am required to take updates that change operations and features that I don't want changed, on a device I purchased and was under the impression I own and control.

And its unfair of us to expect great customer service as Samsung is extremely busy and has a million other things to deal with not just the Samsung Galaxy S9/+\n Many on the other thread think that making phone calls is a primary function and shouldn't need to be fixed down the line and many also feel that Samsung customer service has been appalling. They feel as I do that the continual denial from customer service and technical support of the problem and the lack of communication with us has been truly dreadful even if they have a million other things to deal with.\n I feel that a flagship phone costing close to \u00a3900 should make phone calls just like every other phone I've had thus far straight out of the box\n So I have asked the question in a video today\n Please feel free to comment and give it the thumbs up if you are unhappy and feel right to complain or thumbs down if you think we are \"Beta testing early adopters\" and should be much more patient with the phone and customer service?\n Do you think that Samsung have let us down YES or NO?

The result is that if I don't talk very close to the phone others can't hear me at all, hear cut offs, or a very muffled/metallic voice. I also tested this myself.\nI tried testing the microphones on the audio loopback interface dialing *#0283# and selecting the two microphones to hear me back talking. They seem to both work as intended, but it's clear from there that the phone is always using RCV_1stMic (what looks like the microphone with noise cancellation used when talking with the phone close to the ears), and never switches to SPK_2ndMic (what looks like the microphone with the far field pickup). I'm pretty sure that the OS should switch automatically between the two depending on whether or not the speakers or on. I can't really find any option to set a \"default\" microphone or anything, and I'm not sure there should really be one at all.\nAt least, it doesn't look like an hardware problem to warrant return, but I'm a bit concerned that this might be something for which I need to wait for an OS update -- which might just never happen.\nAnyone else experienced this issue?",

I wont be able to hold phone calls, record voice, record videos with sound or anything that needs sound input. When this happens the headphone jack will also stop working. Any playing sound will come through the loud speaker not any connected earphones. I thought it was the earphones so i put them on other devices and they work and these are original 3.5mm Samsung earphones that came in the box with the phone. I plugged in 3 other earphones that work and still no sound came to these earphones.\nAt this point the only way to temporarily fix the problem is to restart the phone. After restarting the phone the device will work normally for not more than 1 hour then the problem starts again.\nThere is no dirt in the headphone jack or microphone hole. No water or dust has entered neither has the phone fallen down.\nI returned the phone to the supplier as it was still under warranty and got a new one, the new one worked normally for 2 or 3 days and the problem started again.\nI have reported the problem to samsung via the members app 4 times and all they give me are the same troubleshooting steps that solve nothing. I have factory reset the phone 2 times it will work for a few hours then start again.\nThis is clearly a software problem because it goes away after a restart and i have realized there are other Galaxy A71 users in other communities globally facing the same issues\n ",

Camera and mic still working on the 5 yr old tablet, but not on my 1yr old phone...\n\nPlease help me, thank you!\nEdit: Now trying safemode as a measure... no more mic at phonecalls either..",

Caller gets a voice message from the network \"the person you are trying to call is on another line\" (I'm not, I only have one line) and the call diverts to voicemail. First thing I know of it is when I get a notification I've got a voicemail waiting if they leave a message. This is intermittent, sometimes it rings, sometimes it doesn't. I've looked at all the ringer and call divert settings I can find, they all sem to be set correctly. Network signal is quite poor in my house, so often the phone is using wi-fi calling and switches between that and cell network regularly ... could that be the problem? And is this likely to be a phone issue, SIM card issue, or network (Three)? I've tried numerous test calls, and have restarted my phone. Option of trying the SIM card in another phone isn't practical because of the intermittent nature of the fault, not to mention I don't have another phone. Any ideas gratefully received, thanks.",

However, Samsung's Emergency Mode feature is flawed because pressing the power button 3 times doesn't automatically turn on Emergency Mode. I have to do that separately by holding down the power button and then selecting it. \nI recently tested this feature and, rather than turning on immediately, there was a loading bar which took over a minute to reach 100% before I could use the feature and access the Emergency Alarm.\nA minute is far too long to wait in the event of an attack where I might need a quick and easy way to get the attention of anyone nearby.\nThe feature would be far more fit for purpose if, as well as sending an emergency SOS message to my emergency contacts with my location, photos and an audio clip, hitting the power button 3 times also calls 999 and sounds an alarm.\nAs a suggestion, you could mitigate any accidental usage by programming it so that pressing the power button 3 times activates Emergency SOS Messaging, 4 times activates the Emergency Alarm, and 5 times calls 999.\nSuch updates would be a far quicker and more efficient way of calling for help in the event of an emergency.

One of the very nasty things about cell phones as you can't return them to the store once you buy them, a cute lil' Mafia thing, no? Anyway I got the horrible little phone home, turned on Wi-Fi calling and ... it doesn't work! I tried the trick where you turn on airplane mode and it wouldn't let me place calls over the Wi-Fi network. The  thing doesn't actually let you choose whether you're going to use the Wi-Fi network or your mobile network,which is assinine. Instead, it automatically chooses between them, which means it automatically switches to the really terrible mobile network with half of one bar which constantly drops calls every time it reads that it's there, which is always. I selected prefer Wi-Fi network, and it had no effect whatsoever. I cant turn off my mobile network, but I tried to trick it into turning it off since you're not allowed to do that on these stupid phones, by manually  forcing 2g or something, and THEN it won't let me make a Wi-Fi call until I have a mobile network, which defeats the whole purpose of the Wi-Fi call function. At this point I have installed a really sketchy little piece of software called \"Wi-Fi calling\", turedn it on, forced it to choose the 2g network,turned on my Wi-Fi calling in the regular phone, turned off mobile data, and turned on my Wi-Fi. This elevates my phone from half of one bars to maybe one bar. I can't call any place where I have to wait in line or the thing hangs up. I can't make an important phone call or the thing hangs up. People try to call me and the phone only rings half the time. This is bull*****. When will it be fixed? Why is it so stupidly designed? I saw that the Samsung phones that are much more expensive than mine have exactly the same problem. This is the only reason I bought this phone... The one and only reason. Come on guys ...",

    "content": "I have looked through posts but was unable to find a relevant entry. Apologies if this has previously been reported.\n  I am in United States on the Sprint network and my Galaxy A50 received the Android 10 and One UI 2.0 update three weeks ago. Ever since the update, my device has experienced issues with data connectivity (3G&4G). Phone calls worked fine.\n  At work, I go in and out of old brick buildings in an area that does not have more than about 3-4 bars of service outside, and occasionally my service would drop completely or switch from 4G to 3G. Once this happened, the phone may show a connection to a 4G or 3G network, but data connectivity was down (webpages would not load, feeds would not refresh, emails would not load, etc.). The only way to restore any mobile network connection was by completely rebooting the device. I went back and forth with Sprint customer care and Samsung technical support and nothing would resolve the issue. I ended up getting a new Galaxy A50 from my local Sprint store and my phone worked for a couple of days until the Android 10 update was installed. At this point I was convinced that the update is what was causing my issues. Thankfully, Sprint ordered me a new A50 with Android 9 and I was able to disable system updates per this post by Je655: https://eu.community.samsung.com/bgros26334/board/message?board.id=uk-galaxy&message.id=20754#M20754 My phone has now been working perfectly for the last five days.

Initially I set up SIM card 1 for calls and texts, and SIM card 2 for mobile data. This was working without a problem. Now I changed country, and I would like to use SIM card 1 for mobile data as well. This was working initially, however at a certain point, without telling me, mobile data was reset to SIM card 2 again. I didn't realize it and was continuing to use the phone, which will lead to a rather hefty bill at the end of the month. I can change to SIM card 1 again, but it alway seems to revert to SiM card 2 at a certain point. I couldn't make out the pattern when it happens, so I always need to check.\n  Did anyone experience a similar issue? Maybe an idea what I could be doing wrong? Any help would be much appreciated.

After about a month of use, I started to notice that when I turn on the phone, it asks me to enter the SIM card code, because the SIM card is unlocked. A day, sometimes, it happens 15 times, sometimes none. Sometimes I can walk on day 3, everything is Ok, but sometimes it happens every 5-25 minutes. I asked the seller - what to do, he said he would test the phone for a couple of days. As often happens - when the testing took place everything was fine.\nI know that the test was as follows - the phone was placed on the table and the tester turns it on a couple of times. Everything worked. The phone was returned to me as perfectly normal. Brought home, the same day the trouble started again. \nReally throw this phone out? I am sorry for the money I have invested, but incoming calls are important to me, because my business depends on them.\nMaybe someone has an idea what the problem is?

For example, my email is set to make a sound but not vibrate. When phone sound is on, this works perfectly. However, when the phone is set to vibrate (for calls), my email notifications also vibrate.\n In the volume settings (when phone set to vibrate) I can see the notifications setting is set to vibrate but this is greyed out so can't be changed. If I turn ringtone sound on, the notifications slider becomes active and can be set to 0. If I then set the ringtone to vibrate, the notifications slider sets itself to vibrate and become inactive.\n I'm using the stock email app but this isn't limited to email - also happens with Whatsapp and a few others I've noticed. Basically any app that has notifications enabled.\n Bit of a weird one and sorry if I've missed something obvious. I can remember having the issue previously but can't remember if I fixed it or it fixed itself...\n Thanks!",

However, this is not the case.\nThe back story:\nI added a local business number to my contacts so that I could send them a photo of something business related through WhatsApp rather than MMS (my WhatsApp profile image is not of me, and I have this; too, set to 'share with my contacts only).\nThe owner of this local business (who's main contact number is a mobile number) has made comments about my profile image. Nothing nasty, but it's set me on edge.\nWhy this is a problem\nI save contacts to my phonebook so that I can call them quickly if needed (in case of a business) or so I know who's calling, in the case of suspected spammy or unwanted calls.\nI would rather these people couldn't see my profile photo. It's a benign photo, there's nothing 'saucy' about it in any way, but I just don't think it's necessary for everyone in my phonebook to see it.\nSURELY, as Samsung claim [taken from the article \"What is Profile Sharing\" last updated October 1st 2020] :\n\"Profile Sharing will let you share your profile picture and tagline with your friends and family to keep them up to date. You get to choose what information you share and who you share it with.\nYou have complete control over who sees what information - your photo and tagline are only shared with people who already have your phone number\"\nThis should mean that there's a way to actually be in complete control over who can and cannot see my profile.\nI know that you can set up contact groups, so how can I set up my profile sharing to only share with \"your friends and family\" as stated?\n Thank you in advance",

    "title": "Your Signal Drops Out More & More ? Read This",
    "content": "During the last 15 years, have you noticed that when speaking on your mobile phone to someone, your signal drops and you lose connection more and more over the last 15 years ?\nYou constantly have to call back the person you were speaking to and its happening more often and is most annoying. \nYou may often blame your mobile device, when in fact 90 percent of the time it is NOT your device.\n\nLet me explain.\nIt is ALL the mobile networks, NOT your device.\n\nIt does not matter if it is an analogue or a digital transmitter or repeater mast, the fact is, our phones send and receive more and more digital data and more phone calls are made by more new customers over the last 15 years.\n\nThis is where the mobile networks have a problem.\n\nIn the early days, there were millions less mobile users and data transmission was a fraction of what we use today.\nWhich meant that there were far less phone network masts and repeaters located all over the UK.\nThe masts and repeaters on every network were placed further apart from the next mast and the output wattage back then, was transmitting at a much higher wattage on each mast and each repeater, which meant a more reliable phone call with hardly any phone signal drops in mid conversation as compared to now.\n\nBut as millions of new customers on all networks have joined and use smartphones that use more and more data, this means that all the networks need to install more and more masts and repeaters to handle the huge capacity of data and phone calls.\n\nNow this is the problem, \nCross transmission interference and unstable connections.\n\nAn example of what I mean,\n\nIf network transmitters and repeaters are located far apart from each other, for example two miles apart, then the network providers can transmit the output wattage to maximum capacity without any issues and your phone will work with minimal drop of signal.\n\nBut as millions of more mobile users join and more data as well as more phone calls are used, the networks need to place far more masts and repeaters to handle the capacity.\n\nThe problem is this, the more masts and repeaters are installed, the closer they are going to be to each other, which means instead of masts being rwo miles apart from each other for example and transmitting at maximum wattage.\nIf the masts are closer together for example, half a mile apart from each other, if the same wattage output of the transmitter and repeaters are used, then the closer they are placed, there will be frequency interference and more and more problems.\nSo the only solution is to have more repeaters and transmitters closer to each other, is to reduce the output wattage of each network transmitter and repeater so there is no cross interference.\n\nThis is what is happening but the downside is, we all now have to suffer from more and more signal and phone call drop outs.\n\nSo it is not you phone, it is mostly your network provider.\n\nAnother tip,\n\nIf it continues, switch of your phone, leave it switched off, then move a mile and a half or two miles away and then switch on your phone.\nIt will force your mobile device to do a fresh scan for the nearest repeater and mast in that area and it must be a mast and repeater that was not the one you was using in an area that was causing the drop outs.\nThen once your phone has locked on to the nearest new found mast and repeater it should work better, then you can return back to where you originally was and there will be an improvement in less dropouts and less signal loss issues.\n\nRemember to always switch of your phone for two minutes at least once every 24 hours to improve performance and refresh all phone connections.",

Clicking the home button does not do anything. Clicking the power button not once but actually 2 or 3 times shows the phone display. A little reseach shows that checking the dialer settings and going to the App Info to configure settings solves this for most people HOWEVER my dailer does not show up under All Apps in App Info. Weird.\n  Issue #2: When the device display is turned off, clicking the power button once turns on the two navigation button backlight and nothing else happens.

I was given assurances which were broken and I am no further forward in recovering the \u00a375. 00 which was wrongly debited from my Credit card.\n  What I can tell you is that on 3rd November I spoke to and exchanged an email with a member of staff called \u2018Pinky\u2019 who stated my refund had been approved and the money would be refunded within 3 \u2013 5 days.\n  I have contacted Samsung on a number of occasions since with the issue still not resolved. I have kept a file of all my email correspondence and diary of calls made to your organisation which I am happy to provide as evidence\n  Today 24th November 2020 I spoke to a female called \u2018Sophie\u2019 who is UK based, unlike every other person I have spoken to.\n  I should clarify that is in no way a racist reference but more toward the fact the nuance of language and intonation can be lost when speak to people of different nationalities.\nIn brief Sophie explained that although she worked in Customer service the side of the business I was dealing with was based in Manilla. I explained what I had been through , she stated she understood my dis satisfaction, adding that she had during our call spoken to someone in Manilla and was assured a manager from that side of the operation would call me back this afternoon.\n  During our conversation Sophie did say that as a \u2018Gesture\u2019 of goodwill she could authorise the issuing of a gift card to me in the sum of \u00a340.00, I explained that did not get near what I saw as an adequate , what I would call \u2018Compensation\u2019 for the time, effort, energy and stress this has all caused me.\n  The situation continues!",

Several phonecalls and various departments have led to the conclusion there is something odd on the backend.\n  I've also tried some rudimentary fixes myself such as loging in from a different IP address, resetting my password, clearing the cache and saved assets from my browser and trying a completely different browser and device to access the page but sadly they have not yielded any significant results.\n  Any help on this would be greatly appreciated as I would like access to my account as this is the final year of my S10 contract and I want to make an informed decision on my next purchase but to do this I need the existing contract details",

My first time to switch to a Samsung device and I am utterly disappointed, to be honest. I went to Samsung technical service after having several calls and email cases opened with them; all  their replies would be useless just redirecting me to go to the technical service or open another case from their website. From the service shop the unique solution given was to either pay 350\u20ac to repair the screen or to leave the shop mocking at me as there was no guarantee of the screen. Very much pissed off after this bad experience, payed 800\u20ac and in less than 2 weeks asking me 350\u20ac to repair a screen which cracked without me doing anything. I can only feel that I got ripped off and won't ever rely on Samsung because of such a poor support. Hope this can be considered at some point as I could not find any other way of how to express my disappointment. Thanks, David",

    "content": "Yesterday after 2 years of owning the S8 I got my first international phishing calls. Multiple of them, all with different numbers. I didn't have the need until then, but so I thought I'd block the country where those calls came from. At my surprise I only saw an option on the phone to block an explicit number, but not a range of numbers. Standard wildcard doesn't seem to work, i. e. +261, nor +261*, nor 00261*, nor 00261, etc\n After an hour of googling I found some answers and workarounds. But for a phone that cost me $800 I definitely don't do workarounds like allowing only whitelisted numbers. That's not an option on a business level.\n I see that other android phones have an option to use \"starts with\" and what not for blocking, but not the S8.\n Does anyone know a solution to the problem, i. e. how to block entire countries? Is there an update to the phone app which supports filters? How and where from can I get it? 3rd party apps aren't an option either. Because if Samsung is serious about not having this trivial and most necessary feature of blocking a filter range - which would use up like 10 lines of codes - then I'm done with Samsung. Having my life not disturbed by unwanted calls is a Quality of Life thing. I rather switch the brand if that's not possible, because this would only show that there's no support for a phone you spent a lot of money on.",

I've been trying to set the new one up to match the settings I had in my previous one, and I've pretty much got everything except the dual clock on the lock screen. \n I bought the first phone back in my home country so when I moved abroad it automatically set the roaming/dual clock to appear on my lock screen display, which I found super useful. But now that I've started setting this phone up in what's technically my \"roaming\" timezone it perceives that as my \"home\" timezone no matter what I do! \nI've tried the Settings > Lock screen and security > Information and FaceWidgets > Roaming Clock route and used that to set up my home timezone but when I lock my phone it still only shows me my current timezone! I don't use Always On Display but that did give me the option for a dual/world clock and there was no way for me to switch my \"home\" country. Tried enabling that anyway, but still no dual clock on my home screen.\n Is there any way for me to set this up the way I'd like it to without downloading third-party apps?

    "title": "Bring the contacts app into the 21st Century",
    "content": "This is a feedback to Samsung for improvement to the contacts app. Sorry if it's in the wrong place, if so, please forward.\n  Handling of contacts hasn't really changed since mobile phones were invented. Even then, they were based largely on the Rolodex system. Over the years, I have written many databases to handle contacts and feel I call talk with a little expertise on how to really sharpen up the Samsung Contacts app.\n  The biggest problem is that you cannot distinguish between a contact and the organizations to which they belong. For example, a friend of mine who is in my phone as a contact has personal contact details, work contact details, they run a sailing club and I have all of those contact details. They also belong to other organizations for which there is no room in the contact details area. I have several contacts in my phone that also work at the same place and several contacts that also belong to the same sailing club. When somone calls me from his work or from the sailing club, very often the wrong name appears on my phone. This is a problem when I call people by the wrong name when I answer the call. An even bigger problem is when I am trying to find my history of calls with a person or a company. Also, when I change the details of the work or sailing club, I have to update it on all contacts.\n  The solution would be to differentiate between individual contacts, such as people, and group contacts such as clubs and companies. Then allow an individual contact to \"associate\" with a group contact so that the group details appear in the individual contact details. Updating details of a group contact would automatically be reflected in the group contact's details for each associated individual contact. In the group contact information, there should be a list of all individual contacts associated with that group.\n  When the group contact number calls me, I would have a list of my individual contacts at that company appear on the screen. Either before answering or on completion of the call, I would select the correct individual contact that I spoke to or \"Group Contact Name\" if the call was not from one of my listed individual contacts. I should then be able to find that call in the history of that group contact and also the history of that individual contact, if one was selected. When I want to dial a group contact for which I have individual contacts, I should get presented with a list of those individual contacts and \"Group Contact Name\" if I choose to call the group instead of my listed individual contact. The call gets logged to the group contact and to the individual contact, if one was selected. This should be the same for emails i.e. if I send an email to a \"work\" email address it gets logged to the individual and the group contact histories. However, Iif I send an email to a \"personal\" email address, it only gets logged to the individual contact history.\n  The second biggest problem is that you can't associate one contact with another without linking the contacts. It would be beneficial within a contact's details to have a list of \"wife\", \"son\", \"boss\" etc that are contacts in their own right, but can be easily accessed from the original contact's details.\n  I think opening the contacts system to a radical overhaul in this way will give Samsung a distinct commercial advantage over the competition and will show that, once again, Samsung is leading the pack.",

I have used it with a Thailand carrier for months. I recently moved to Japan for work, and brought my phone with me thinking I could be using it with a Japanese carrier sim card.\n Last week I have made a contract with a Japanese carrier (AU), and when I put their SIM card in my phone, the 4G works, but I cannot make nor receive any phone calls. Instead of the carrier's name on the top left of my screen, I get \"Emergency calls only\"\n The shop staff have tried many things, among other modifying the APN settings, etc., all of this with the help of their technical support, and they could not find a solution.\n Does someone have a solution for this? I have been looking online, and saw some people suggesting using a SIM card for a certain amount of time while making a phone call (5 minutes or so), but I am not sure how I could do that since the Japanese SIM card does not allow me to make phone calls, and my Thai SIM card does not work anymore since I have stopped my contract there.\n Any help would be appreciated.\nThank you very much.",

I'm not sure if it's because of the oreo update, but I have only noticed it more recently over the last few weeks. \nMy earpiece is making a very fast clicking sound, like it's clicking 3x per second. I first noticed it when I was on calls, but now realise it's constant! You can't really hear it unless you put your ear to the phone, but I'm sure this isn't normal. So I was wondering if any one else has a similar problem/fix?\nI can stop it from constantly clicking if I turn the WiFi off, but this isn't practical as we all require WiFi these days!\nI have seen a couple of random threads online with similar issues but with no replies or reasons as to why its happening. \nAny help would be greatly appreciated  thanks!!

    "content": "Hi everyone,\n I purchased my Samsung Galaxy A3 (2017) in October 2017 from an InterDiscount shop in Geneva, Switzerland. I was informed at the point of purchase that there was a region lock (European SIM only) and that by calling/receiving 5 minutes worth of calls it would become unlocked and I should be able to use any SIM card with the phone.\n Fast forward 4 month later, I'm back in Singapore and I've left Europe permanently. My Singapore SIM card wouldn't work and at first I thought the region lock hadn't been removed (even though I was sure I'd hit 5 minutes worth calls) -- the live chat staff from the Samsung Members app then told me that no, it wasn't the region lock -- my phone had a network lock to a network called 'AUT'.\n Here the confusion comes -- the only two SIM cards I've used this phone on are MUCHO (Swiss) and Three (UK); the very first Samsung live chat staff I contacted informed me that AUT was a New Zealand network but I couldn't find any information on it at all. It was strange anyway that it would be locked to a New Zealand network since the phone was meant to be European SIM only and the phone was purchased in a sealed box with the European SIM only sticker.\n Perhaps a moderator or others could help with this -- anyone knows a network called AUT? Or does anyone have a solution to this network lock at all, it would be highly appreciated. It's just so frustrating because this phone was purchased in the first place because my previous phone was stolen, and now I've only used this phone for 4 months to realize that I can't use it anymore since I'm not going back to Europe any time soon.",

I get brief communications with varying members of varying Samsung departments. However, no single Samsung employee has offered themselves as a Point-Of-Contact or a Supervisor as I have requested, many, many times. I can only suspect,  It's simply become a game of evasion by Samsung. I am forced after making many, many phone calls to seek legal assistance as I have little other option, due to my phone not being returned to me. See below, the details of this theft. My almost new Samsung Galaxy S8 had an issue with the rear camera auto focus sticking when initiating the camera. (To unlock the stuck lens, you had to physically bang the phone against something, this would unjamb the focusing apparatus and allow clear photo's to be taken).\nI complained to Samsung. They said they would send a UPS box out. A box arrived at my house whilst I was at work. I was informed that my phone would be wiped and that I might do it, before sending it in for security purposes.\nIt took me a few days to make notes of all the accounts, data and apps I had on my phone. Some of them (BitCoin related) cannot be simply backed up to the cloud.\nI packaged the phone up with the assistance of witnesses and even put extra tape on the UPS box. We dropped the package off at a UPS Access point on Monday 29th of January 2018. Since then, I have tracked the package arriving at the Samsung service center. It arrived there the following day. The Samsung service rep, via Facebook had informed me that the turnaround time would be between 7-10 days. I called after 7 days to see what the status of my phone was? I was informed that they didn't know, as they couldn't find my phone. I was told to call Samsung service department. They said the phone had been lost. I was communicated with Samsung's Facebook messenger people. They claimed the Samsung S8, WAS at the Service Center. I've been in touch with varying bodies at Samsung several times now, over this last 14 days. And no one at Samsung seems to have a real clue as to what the status of my phone is? I just get empty platitudes and appeasement. BUT NO PHONE!!! It seems like they are passing the hot potato issue back and forth between departments, until I am forced to accept that Samsung stole my \u00a3800 phone, and I'm going to have to buy a new phone.

This has been happening on 2 different devices since my first replacement. There is no dust blocking the microphones. I believe the noise reduction processing in the configuration is too aggressive and there should be an option in the settings to reduce this effect globally across the phone.

I already cried. Truly, I'm just so done with everything. And when I asked for a feedback link. Alli sent me here. This isn't what I meant but whatever. I'll tell my story once more.\nSo this morning I woke up and decided to check my phone. While I was reading something, my screen went black and never turned on again. I restarted it at least 5 times before using my old tablet to chat with the \"Experts\" and \"Care Pros\". They kept asking me to restarted it. And every time I was like, \"what now?\" We got disconnected and a new Expert come and tell me to restart it again. Until I got someone who said I have two options: Send it in and have it repaired or go to one of their repair shops and get it repaired same day.\nI choose same day, of course. I need my phone. I'm currently job hunting and I'm getting called in for interviews. Anyways, I go to where they sent me and the guy tells me that they can't fix it because I had the limited edition gold color.\nSo I come back home. I get back on my tablet and chat with them again. It was a nightmare. They started asking me to restart it again and I'm like, No, no. I tried that. Then ask if I would like to go a repair shop to get it fixed. Even though I had already stated that I had just come back from the repair shop.\nSo then the Care Pro said I had to send it in and it would take 9-11 BUSINESS days for me to get it back. So I took out my calendar and counted. If I mailed it out by tomorrow. I would get it back by August 12th. I asked, \"If I was supposed to go more than two weeks without a phone?\" And he legit wrote: \"Yes! Are you okay with that?\"\nI said no. And told me I would have to call customer service for them to help me and not to worry they would give me a Ticket ID so I wouldn't have to explain everything again. And when I told him that I couldn't call because my phone wasn't working and I live alone...Guess what happened? \nYeah, it got disconnected and a new person was there to help me. I had to give all my info again. I told the new person to give me a Ticket ID and phone number to customer service so I could use my neighbor's phone to call because I just couldn't type anymore. I was done. It was around 3PM and I had been chatting with so many different people since 10AM.\nSo I use my neighbor's phone to call. I spend ten minutes telling the automated voice system that I want to talk to a real person and it keeps telling me that they have a great chat service that I can use instead. So when I finally got a real person on the phone. She asked for all information and I was like: \"No, no. I have a ticket ID. I don't want to explain anymore.\" I give it to her. She put me on hold so she could get the information and read through it. When she got back to me, she said \"I see here that your screen went black and it hasn't work since. Have you tried restarting it?\"\nWhen I tell you that I started crying out of frustration I mean mean it. They did not send all my concerns in the ticket note. So I once again had to explain everything. So she told me that I would have to send it in since the repair shop couldn't do it. And yes, it could take 9 to 11 business days. Maybe even longer sometimes.\nAfter crying some more, I asked if that was really all she could do because I really needed my phone for job hunting. She was very sympathetic and said she would transfer me to a supervisor. She put me on hold for ten minutes and then came back and said no supervisor was available. That if I wanted, I could hang up and a supervisor would call me back when they were available. I said sure. I gave my neighbor back the phone and she told me she would knock on my door when they called. She lives right across the hall. Waited two hours, my neighbor knocked but only to tell me that they hadn't call. She said she would knock again if they did call. They never did call back.\nSo I went on the dreaded Facebook and decided to message support from there. It was just the same thing. If the repair shop couldn't do it. I would have to send it in. I would get it back in 9 to 11 business days.\nSo I have no phone until at least August 12th. There is nothing they can do about it. And I don't even have my old phone because I used it as a trade in. I shall never buy Samsung products again.\nI honestly don't know what to do. How will I job hunt? If someone calls me for an interview, I won't know. I've spent all day dealing with this. I was so upset at the end, I called poor Alli, customer support on FB, a horrible person. Sorry, Alli. I had a long day and you were the last person I spoke to. At least I didn't curse. I did call your job stupid though. Sorry.\nDude. Being poor **bleep**. I really can't afford a new phone right now. Idk. Sorry for the rant.\nTL;DR: My phone broke. I cried all day. And now I hate Samsung. Also, I called Alli a horrible person and said her job was stupid. I know it's not her fault.",

My cell when someone calls me goes straight to VM making it seem as though I turned my phone off...I unfortunately had t mobile for years years ago and hated it, it sucked then and now, I begged my fiance NOT to get service through them but he figured things would be better after all that was YEARS ago, so here we are yet again and I'm stuck with t mobile until we have the $ being I've been outta work n traveling alot, things are tight to switch service providers.  Its beyond deceptive to sell an amazing network, cost friendly  and great coverage yet not provide exactly that. Should say great service in LARGE cities only and avoid going inside buildings lol. Thats sad!!! You guys rip ppl off bad I have a 45$ monthly plan yet pay 95 with no explanation, nobody seems to have any answers or solutions.

    "content": "I don't know why my previous post was deleted, but here it is again.\nI was a loyal fan of Samsung products, from appliances to cell phones. \nAs I always do when they release a new phone, I placed my preorder on Jan/21. The phones was working fine until this last Sunday 07/11 when I noticed my phone had no signal or was switching from Full to none,zero,nada. \nI went to ATT, purchased a new SIM card and nothing. Put my wife's SIM card on my phone and it didn't work, put mine on hers and it worked. \nDid a network reset and nothing. Performed a Factory reset and nothing. same issues.\nNext day, I decided to call Samsung and it was when my nightmare started. Talking to a Samsung \"expert\" care+, they suggested that I speak with Samsung Premium Care since I pay for the service. By afternoon my replacement was approved free of charge.  Around 7pm i got an email from Samsung Premium Care asking to contact customer service. I did and I was informed that they didn't have a replacement for my variant (S21 ultra 5G 521GB) or have been receiving this model from Samsung. They informed that the replacement could take 5~15 business days to arrive or could never arrive and they suggested that I contact Samsung to check for other options. I did, I called again Samsung Care+ and i was informed that I could take to a service repair center an get my phone fixed. I went to a UbreakIfix near home, after 3 hours I was informed that some parts were replaced and it didn't work, my phone was a no fix. Called Samsung again and again I was informed that I should try another UbreakIfix location. Well, I did, drove 50 minutes, waited 5 hours and the results were the same. The technician even brought me inside their lab, showed my phone open with all the new parts plugged into a PC and told me my phone was a NO FIX. They gave me a ticket number and mentioned that I should call Samsung my provide with the ticket number. \nSo, I called again, and again they said they couldn't do nothing but offer to send my repair to their Samsung repair center where (words used by Samsung agent) - Were our engineers are better trained  and could fix your phone- and wait 15 DAYS + 4 DAYS FOR SHIPPING or I should try again with Samsung Premium Care.\nWHY? Why would you do that with your customers Samsung? Why would you waste my time sending me to 02 UbreakIfix  \"if you think\" your engineers are better trained than the ones from your list of \"authorized\" repair centers? Why it has to be so difficult and time consuming with you?\nIt has been 6 days and around 5H33M on calls  going back and forth between Samsung Care Pro, Samsung Premium care and UbreakIfix and here I'm no phone working, no solution for my problem.\nI used to see a lot customers complaining about Samsung customer service and I always was like... Nah, this is not true... but now I see it is. \nA problem that any other company would resolve is hours or days, Samsung is turning into a nightmare. My phone is under warrant, I pay for a insurance from Samsung that does nothing besides charge my card every month and here I am.\nIs that fair? \nI look forward for help and resolution to my problem before seeking help from a consumer protection agency or other assistance.\n  ",

But, when I reach the neighborhood exit calls drop consistently.\n\nIssue #4 Messages will fail to send or fail to load with strong signal noted on phone.

The lower speaker had it own issues with volume.\n\nI never did fid why the volume fluctuate from call to call. It still has issues intermittently.\n\nThe reason i titled this post \"A right handed phone\" is because I wanted to get community feedback on this issue..\n\nWhen I hold the S21 to my right ear the sound level is at a normal level. When I switch to the other ear the volume drops drastically. Has anyone else noticed this?\n\nComparing how the S21 is built vs S9 , the speaker on the S21 is on top right edge of phone vs the top mid front facing for the S9. When I hold to my left ear the speaker lay in scapha or above the helix of the ear.\n\nAnytime I want to multi-task on a phone call and use my dominant hand for something else I have adjust the phone to an uncomfortable position. \n\nYou can't fix my phone but Samsung please reevaluate the speaker position for your next generation.

    "content": "Hey guys, I need some help with getting my Verizon Visual Voicemail back & hoping someone out here can help me out!\nTo begin with, it worked fine up until an update in February, ever since then it has not! I naturally turned to Verizon for help & after about 30 minutes of this & that & this & that along with many redundant questions, they gave up & blamed it on Samsung! Verizon stated that Samsung would have to write \"a patch\" to repair this problem! So I get online with Samsung Tech Support, and when I told them about the Verizon comment made against Samsung, she simply said \"well thats good to know\", as if she were going to do something about it! Shortly afterward she sent me some sort of instructions to clear the cache memory on my phone, needless to say it did not work and meantime I still have no voice mail and I'm still being billed for it monthly of course!\nMy phone is a brand new S21 Ultra 5G, and it was not cheap to say the least! There are also multiple other problems with this expensive thing but I'm gonna tackle one at a time I guess so if anyone has any advice other than to burn this phone I'd be very happy to try it out!\nPlease help!!!\nThanks in advance!!!",

I was hoping I can post about this here because my problem involves a Smart TV; I assume that those belong in the Smart Home category? Perhaps I should have asked this in the Samsung Apps/Services? -shrugs-\nAnyways, here is our issue:\nWhen casting a phone's screen (Galaxy) to a Samsung Tizen Smart TV using SmartThings and/or Chromecast causes the Galaxy phone to be unable to send or receive calls. Multi-tasking with anything else on the phone while casting media to the TV seems to be working fine - e.g. texting works & notifications pop-up on the phone even while casting media via youtube, SmartThings (Screen Mirroring) or Google Home.\nSo what is going on here? I went through most of the settings and did a little light google searching but was unable to fix this issue. I mean, like, shouldn't phone calls work while casting? I was pretty certain that there would be a notification popup on the phone/TV when receiving a call - especially if you can't talk on the phone while casting, but apparently I was wrong?\nI could have sworn that my iPhone (brother got it for me don't ask lol it's actually a decent phone ... but that's a whole different story that we just won't get into :D) was able to send and receive phone calls when casting ... or it would at least give me a notification so I know.\nAnyways, what am I doing wrong?\nAny advice on how to troubleshoot this?\nAssume I'm not a complete newbie and have done the more basic things already.\nEither way, any help is appreciated for the simple fact that time was taken to read/reply, :).\nA few things:\n- The phone can send and receive calls when it is not casting.\n- The devices in question include both Samsung devices: Samsung's Galaxy & Tizen Smart TV.\n If it turns out that this is something that is well known and phones simply are not able to send/receive calls while casting to another device then ... well... dang.\nI just assumed that such a possibility is incredibly unlikely in this day and age ... but I do always say assuming can be dangerous... \ud83d\ude1e",

    "content": "I have 3 phones with T-Mobile and have switched to Verizon.  The Verizon sim cards worked with the 2 phones but didn't work for the Samsung Note 20.  The message I received was that my phone was locked - the network lock status is locked. When I attempted to go to the settings to do a \"permanent unlock\" then the next message was \"Couldn't unlock your phone.  Your phone isn't eligible to be unlocked.  Reason code: 132\".  I have made multiple calls to T-Mobile only to have them say that since I bought the phone from Samsung, then Samsung needs to unlock the phone.  I have made multiple calls to Samsung and they tell me that they have no access to the phone sim card and they can't unlock the phone.  Samsung then tells me that I have to go back to T-Mobile to have them unlock my phone.  I have been trying to resolve this issue for more than 8 hours. This experience has been exhausting and unprofessional.  My research on the internet was that there have been numerous requests/questions regarding this issue and the only answer that has been documented is to \"pay\" a 3rd party company to unlock the phone.  If a third-party company can do that then why can't T-mobile.....the company that owns the sim card and could in fact unlock the phone from its network?  Or if Samsung is selling these so-called unlocked phones then there needs to be a message to T-mobile customers that this situation exists so that customers can make an informed decision if they want to buy a phone and endure the run-around that exists between Samsung and T-mobile.  All I want is to have my phone unlocked.  Will someone please provide a fix to this problem.",

I talked to t-mobile about it for weeks and they updated my sim card twice without fixing the issue. I finally got Samsung to send me a new phone because I figured it was a defective device. I booted up the new phone without restoring any data or changing any settings.  Just threw my sim card in and started calling it with my wife's phone. Calls went through every time no problem.  Then I got a notification that there was a system update to do so I installed the latest update. I tried calling it again after the update and now no calls are going through! So basically,  the August update turned my $1300 \"phone\" into an expensive toy that can't do basic phone functions.

Accessibility menu also includes Live Caption.\nThis a quote from an article(phonearena.com) dated 4/26/20:\"\nThose with a hearing problem will be able to read captions for a phone call\n In the latest Developer Preview for Android 11, XDA examined version 2.13.302920511 of Device Personalization Services, the app that is home to the Live Caption feature. There, it found strings of code that included comments like \"Enable Live Caption over this phone call.\" This is a pretty good clue telling us that Live Captions will be available for use with phone calls in Android 11. When Live Caption is used on a call, all of the participants of that call will be notified via audio that their conversation is being transcribed into captions. The message will say, \"Hi, the person you\u2019re about to speak with has call captions turned on. They\u2019ll see captions of what you say to help them listen along.\"\n My Samsung 20 OS has Android 11 installed however Live Caption does not work with live phone conversations.  This is something that is really important for hearing impaired and deaf community.   I have seen this feature work on competitors' phones but I really like Samsung phones and would hate to switch.  There are folks with same issue and again really important that Samsung does everything possible to address the needs of hearing impaired and deaf community.\nDoes anyone know if this feature can be made available on my S20?

It got to were it was dropping calls, would not connect to my car and other issues. It took me being on the phone with tech support through my carrier and it hanging up on him 20 times in ten mins to get a replacement cause Samsung wouldn't help. Not I have had the replacement a few months and it is starting to have some of the same issues. Samsung told me to take it to best buys in my area. The closest one is 45 mins away I get there and they don't work on Samsung phones... wasted trip. I called Samsung as soon as I left the store and the support guy I talked only told me I had to take it to a service center. My phone is my business I can't be without a phone but was told that is the only thing they can do. I asked to talk to a supervisor who had to call me back. He blamed most of my phone issues on the carrier. Told me to try a different texting apps for the issues I was having with my apps closing out and keyboard disappearing while typing. And reset my settings for apps randomly opening. Not my phone is slower and my keyboard is having issues responding on anything I am doing on my phone. I will I could get a refund cause the s20's .

I can access the visual vm native app if i search for it in my phone apps. The issue is that the vms are not being and have not been transcribed since I got this phone, and over 2 different carriers. Neither carrier was able to resolve the issue. (they are both verizon network carriers, however). But I have seen others even on AT&T netowork carriers having the same issue (other networks as well).

To make positively sure,  I talked with an agent who assured me it was \"100% compatible \".   I bought the phone (from a friend) who bought 2, with cash after being talked into one for himself as well as his girl. He didn't think it was worth the $1,500 he spent and sold it to me after a month.  (Verizon has a policy of locking all devices they sell for 60 days.  ) I went to a Sprint store not knowing this,  where they put in the new sim and I got the pop up telling me it's locked.  So, my friend had to call verizon and fill out a request for early unlock.  He got the email 2 days later saying it was approved and the phones unlocked.  I had the sim on me,  powered off the phone,  put in the sim, got signal bars,  then 3g lit up,  after 5-10 seconds it grayed out and I had no data.  I checked the calls and texts both worked.  Except mms. Called sprint who \"refreshed\" . No go.  Its still running Verizon firmware. But I've Been on with techs and agents,  but.  Can't use dialer codes,  and can't update prl or profile.

He added the apn manually to which I lost everything.  No calls.  Texts.  Data.  (I had to rush before close) so.  I switched service back to my broken screen note 10+ (which shows 5 Apns.

    "content": "I\u2019ve been pretty loyal fan of Samsung products across the board from appliance to Cell phones. Always upgrading to the latest top tier phone most every year. I\u2019ve pushed the Samsung products many years ago when I worked in retail because I believe Samsung provides solid products.\nHowever, this past year or so has pushed me to believe I need to seek products from another company.\n  About a year or so back, had a had a watch2 active that the back literally just fell off. No other issue. Sent in for warranty and was told it had water damage and warranty void because of it. I know it was never exposed to water and it wasn\u2019t possible. So ended up buying the watch3 which was irritating.\nFast forward a few month, I damaged my phone and needed to file a claim with Samsung Care/Asurion. The online form wouldn\u2019t allow me to file. I had to call in. I was told at the time they had no replacement available at the time and they would contact me when a replacement was available. So I continued down the road waiting for a call with a damaged phone. Note: online claim site never did et me see the status of the claim and I\u2019m generally too busy to spend an hour on the for a status update.\nAfter 4-5 months, I tried to follow up as I\u2019d yet to hear back from them. When I called, I was told I had to start a new claim. So I did.  Again, I was told no replacements were available. They did offer to substitute a Galaxy Z Fold2 with reduced memory as a replacement. Seemed like an pretty exchange overall, so agreed to it. After more than two weeks of Samsung Care/Asurion repetitively dropping the ball on next steps, Requesting affidavits  I finally received a replacement.\nOpened the box and it was an s20 ultra.  Ok, it was the replacement that should have happened in the first place, but would have been nice if they told me what phone they were sending before I ordered the cases and accessories to go with it and eating the return costs.\nThis past Saturday, I dropped my phone and cracked the display and white bar on screen making phone difficult to was. Immediately not looking forward to dealing with Samsung Care/Asurian.\nI jump online to file a claim and shocker, the online form wouldn\u2019t allow me to file. I had to call in. Again, they added additional steps on affidavit to verify identity again. This time, they would me to provide proof I was a Samsung Care subscriber. For me, did seem like bit of a moment. Samsung care/Asurion should have those records. Then started a 4 hour loop of calling Samsung that would forward me to Asurion, that would forward me to Samsung and back. I did attempt to keep an Asurion rep on the line to get Samsung and Asurion to talk directly to each other. When told they didn\u2019t have the abilities to support conferencing, I asked to have her hold on and I\u2019ll conference Samsung in on my phone. The rep just forward my call to Samsung and disconnected from the call. Another moment.\nAfter a few more back and forth calls, figured out Samsung Care still had my old IMEI from the phone I returned in the last claim as the phone covered, not the replacement they sent me by Asurion. Samsung says they have no options to correct, another whiskey t*ngo foxtrot. So now Samsung, Samsung Care, and Asurion  are all throwing there hands and I\u2019m sitting holding a broken phone that I can\u2019t get replaced through the program I\u2019ve been paying for.\nNow I\u2019m contemplating a compete ecosystem change. I do like Samsung products, but it\u2019s hard to stand behind products that their manufacture will not stand behind. I realize most of this is on the part of Samsung Care/Asurion. But from my perspective, Samsung\u2019s monkey, Samsung\u2019s Circus. Samsung selected this trading partner and it\u2019s an extension of their brand.  \nDon\u2019t like the idea of spending 3-4k on new phones, watches, and tablets this month to exit the Samsung ecosystem. But running out of options and patience.",

I call back. A guy undoes Safe Mode. Says someone will call me back. It's 8 pm no call back. So many calls to them and Verizon. Both want me to just buy a new phone when 14 months I paid cash for it. Un freakinging believable.\nSo done with Samsung everything and will put it all over social media and my employer",

I bought two of your products this year and your phone, my phone the A51 won't share the phone with the Samsung S6 lite. Tablet.  I just need them to give me a fair break since I was deceived when buying the A51. No one disclosed the fact that this phone had one major defect.  I had to wait to find out.  And they won't do a D**n thing about it.  Their is still time for you to do the right thing WHICH IS NOT SYMPATHY AND LIP SERVICE.   I need a decent phone a little better than the A51.  I was so happy with the camera until I got their tablet and found out something was terribly wrong.  Somebody **bleep** up not adding that simple share feature to this phone.  The only phone is the entire line that won't connect with it's own tablets.  This is my last attempt to ask you to help me not have to pay a lot of money for another phone when I just bought this one and the tablet.  I've had it.\nSomeone told me to contact E commerce dept.  That wen't nowhere quick.  Lots of sympathy and not one person offered a one time lower price on the A42 or A52 to solve our shared problem.\nThese folks at e commerce only told me what was on their website for phones. They didn't offer any help getting into a phone that will share the phone with my tablet. Just quoted full price on things. No help with my situation at all. All the calls I've made getting no where leaving me very disappointed. Considering the situation if it were my company, I would have worked a deal out so my customer was happy and had a new phone that was equivalent to the A51 they bought and the new phone worked with the Samsung tablet. But no, no offer to step out of the regular lanes and do whats right. And I'm left with a tablet that can't call, text, use messenger, maps and directions program, whats app, and others. If Samsung won't help me I really have no option but some kind of litigation. I can't just eat this and go away. This isn't right or fair. Anyone of these people if they were put in my position would feel the same and demand a fair resolution. Wish it didn't have to go this way. It was their choice, not mine.",

Also, when the state is \"on\" in this screen, the QS Airplane mode icon is in a half-blue state.\n4.

The notification is from the phone app (not from the voicemail app). I can't dismiss it. The most I can do is snooze the notification so that it comes back every 2 hours.\nHours of troubleshooting with Sprint lead to no resolution. Days of troubleshooting with Samsung lead to a temporary fix. Resetting app preferences makes the notification go away until I restart my phone, then it comes back. Which is less than ideal, as I have to reset all of my notification tones and app permissions every single time I reboot my phone. It's making me want to switch away from Samsung for the first time in a long time.\nTheir only other solution is to do a factory reset, but I don't believe that will really fix the problem because it came with a recent update...and I don't want to risk losing any of my photos or files or app progress during a factory reset.\nSince this problem started with a system update, there has to be a fix in a future update, right?",

The swipe down screen now simply says \"T-Mobile* instead of \"Wifi Calling T-Mobile\" like it previously did. Also, when in airplane mode, turning wifi back on only, I am not able to place a call thru the phone app. I can place a call thru Google Voice app which uses Wifi Calling. This proves wifi calling is not actually working thru the phone app. I also just noticed that calls force the phone back to 4G {with no wifi on}, indicating VoLTE is also not working as it used to (and the settings option for VoLTE shows it is on). - Please help and Samsung, please fix this! Thank you.",

During calls the proximity sensor  turns off the display to prevent keypad presses, but after sometime the display turns on again and keypad is pressed which makes calls very uncomfortable. The proximity sensor sometimes does not turn off the display even. I tried lots of things with your  @samsungSupport team on the Twitter and unfotunately we were unable to solve the problem. They suggested me to share my problem here also. \n  I am testing my proximity sensor with the code *#77692# and it works perfect. Thats why I think that the problem is not a hardware problem. The problem is probably related to a bug in the calling software.\n  One of my friends has also bought the same phone and he has faced the same problem. I recorded a video with my phone and his phone. During calling both phones display is not truning off, but during testing  mode they work perfect.\n  Probably we need and update to solve this problem. Otherwise this phone is a disaster, because you cannot use the phone for the basic function which is calling.\n  I hope you will solve our problems. If needed I can send the video which I recorded with the two brand new Galaxy A70's. The video clearly shows the problem during calls, and it cleraly shows the proximity sensor does its work during testing.",

It's been a while since I got one of these, so perhaps I'm wrong about not getting an option to block the phone number. But even if I am able to block that phone number, and it is indeed a \"Robo\" call, they will simply call from a different phone number. Apparently marketeers who use this technique have 100's, even 1000's of number that they can use to call from. \nIn the analog world using landline phones, a feature called \"Nomorobo\" has been implemented.

    "title": "WiFi calling does not work after Auto-Restart",
    "content": "Can you please forward this to the Samsung Cell Phone Galaxy Engineer for action\nI am reporting a bug that needs to be corrected with the next Samung Update please. The problem occurs on 2 different Samsung devices one device is my wife\u2019s and one device ismine. This problem occurs despite doing a hard reset on the devices. Let me explain the problem that occurs on both devices. My Wife own a Samsung Galaxy S10+ and I own a Samsung Galaxy Note 10+ (both unlocked and are both are not branded to any cellular carrier)\n Let me explain to you and please read this very very carefully so you can understand clearly the issue at-hand:\n We do not have good cellular coverage indoors at our home, therefore we must use Voice Over WiFi feature known in the Samsung device as: Wi-Fi Calling and the feature is turned ON on both of our devices and the WiFi Calling PREFERENCE is set to Wi-Fi PREFERRED on both devices.  While we are at home, indoors, we communicate with our phone calls via the WiFi Calling feature on both of our devices as our Wi-Fi  Internet is provided by Spectrum Internet Company. The WiFi internet from Spectrum Internet Company is working perfectly fine and all ports on the WiFi router are open and there is no issue with the WiFi Internet nor WiFi router.\n Keep paying attention please. Both of our devices features are set to: AUTO RESTART AT SET TIMES (toggled ON). We have this feature to \u201cAUTO RESTART DEVICE AT SET TIMES\u201d toggled ON on both devices at 3 AM (while we are asleep, so devices auto restart at 3 AM while we are asleep.)\n Keep paying attention please here. Both of our devices also have:  SCREEN LOCK TYPE set to PIN, which means when our devices reboot or sreen locks after 5 minutes (set to lock after 5 min on our devices), in order to unlock the screen on our devices and use the device and use the apps and be able to call, the end-user (me and my wife) must enter a PIN (which we have set) to unlock our devices\u2019 screen and have access to all apps on our devices etc... In fact, when we restart our devices during the daytime, with the SCREEN LOCK TYPE set to PIN on both of our devices, after this restart, the System UI (User Interface) screen message populates on both of our devices stating: \u201cPHONE RESTARTED. UNLOCK YOUR PHONE to GET APP NOTIFICATIONS.\u201d And as soon as we enter the set PIN, devices\u2019 screen unlocks and we now have access to the devices\u2019 apps and able to use device and call via Phone App via Wi-Fi calling (if we are at home) etc...\n Here is the issue at-hand. Please keep reading carefully.\n Because both of  our devices are set to \u201cAUTO RESTART AT SET TIMES\u201d at 3 AM, we are asleep and we can not unlock our devices\u2019 screen, with our set PIN, until we wake up at around 6AM in the morning. What is happening with both of our devices is: the WiFi calling does not work upon that auto-restart at 3 AM therefore any calls coming in at 3 AM, and after 3 AM, go directly to voice mail and are missed. In fact, when we wake up at 6 AM and see that our devices auto-restarted at 3 AM same nite, and despite our entering the PIN to unlock the screen on our devices, the WiFi Calling feature remains not connected and we are still unable to make calls. What we must do, after devices auto restart at 3 am, is we must enter PIN to unlock screen and then RESTART our devices again (or put our devices in the AirPlane Mode for 30 seconds and then toggle airplane mode OFF) to be able to call and use Phone App on our devices. In Summary: After device auto restarts at 3 AMhave and stays auto restarted without end-user entering PIN to unlock screen for device to finish restart, the WiFI calling feature no longer active and end-user without cellular coverage indoors (like me and my wife) will not be able to  get or make phone calls. HOWEVER: If the device auto-restarts at 3 AM and end user immediately PIN to unlock screen, the auto restart will complete and WiFi Calling will work. Please understand the auto-restart does not turn off the wifi calling feature, as the WiFi calling feature remains toggled ON after auto-restart. The WiFi calling featureto work requires the end-user with PIN set to unlock screen, must unlock screen to have WiFi calling work indoors without cellular coverage. If end-user does not enter PIN to unlock screen after auto-restart of the device, the WiFi calling is not available until end-user enters screen unlock PIN for the phone to complete the restart process and only then the WiFi calling feature will work.\n I contacted our cellular carrier and I was told that all our WiFI calling features are turned ON on their end and I contacted my WiFi Internet Carrier and was told no ports are blocked.\n In fact, my WiFI calling works perfectly during the day. The issue happens ONLY after auto-restart at night with the PIN set unlock screen. Unless PIN is entered at night immediately after auto-restart of the device, the WiFI calling feature will NOT work and all calls at night after auto-restart will be missed.\n I think Samsung mustissue an update after Samsung corrects the program to code for the WiFI calling feature to continue to work WITHOUT end-user entering screen unlock PIN after AUTO-RESTART.\nBy the way, all phones are uptodate with updates.\n Please let me know if you need any additional information",

I called the Samsung customer service a numerous times for 1 month trying to get my S-Pen back.  It only costs about $20 for a new S-Pen but why should I pay for someone else's mistake.  I trusted the Samsung name brand so I called to get my\n3 year old S-Pen back.  I've called many other company's customer services but I've never felt so helpless.  \nToday, I received a phone call from the customer service team.  The rep said according to the repair center record, they only received the phone & the sim card tray, and she asked me if I have a photo of the phone and the S-Pen before I package it and the item description of shipping label.  I said no and I used the shipping label Samsung provided so I had no itemized description. (Do I have list every single component of the phone on the label).  The rep said that she could not help because I had no proof and the warranty expired.  Where is your proof that the service center did not receive the S-Pen?  Show me a video of unboxing and repair!  You rushed to trust your repair center's claim and you did not bother to believe my claim.  My time is so much more valuable than $20 and yet I spent so much time making phone calls.  I'm writing this not because I'm dying get my 3-year old S-Pen back to save $20 but you made me a liar.  Shame on You.  I guess it is really a time to hop on the iPhone train.",

Then when it came time to be on-call, I toggled it Off for Turn On Now and also Turn On As Scheduled. It is toggled Off under Settings> Notifications. Yet, every night I randomly wake up and check my phone, and Do Not Disturb is On. This is a big problem for me. I checked Special Access and the only items toggled On are One UI Home and Secure Folder, but they are grayed out. There is a little statement with them that says \"This app must be turned on here while it is Turned On in Notifications access\". I went to Notifications access and toggled Off Secure Folder. It gave a warning about losing access. I went back to DND access and tried to toggle off Secure Folder. It gives a warning that rules for DND will be deleted. I select Ok, but the Secure Folder remains toggled On. I went to Apps>Secure Folder and there is no toggle at all calling out Secure Folder. Calendar, Contacts, Phone and Storage are toggled On and grayed out, saying Enforced by policy. Under All Permissions for Secure folder, all the way at the bottom it says \"access Do Not Disturb\"but there is no toggle. So it seems one cannot turn off DND access for Secure Folder. I have also set DND with a schedule of 1 minute on only 1 day of the week, and then turned it Off again just see if it is following the schedule set there even when Off. It did not follow that. It just turns on at night at 10pm, I will turn it off, go to sleep, and when I wake at for example 3am, it is back On again. Please help. ",

Could the reason its not available be because I didn't set it up before installing the android 11 update? If I factory reset/ hard reset my device back to the way it was when it came out of the box will I be able to possibly set it up then and install the android updates after? I don't want to have to reset my phone but it's the only thing I can think of to try. It's 2021 and I don't want to have to go back in time an have call my voicemail just to check it. Samsung visual voicemail worked perfect on my galaxy s9 with the same carrier. I thought getting a newer model phone was an upgrade but so far it's been a complete downgrade. No visual voicemail, no edge lighting settings wish I would have just kept my galaxy s9. This is the error code I receive when I sent a link from my s9 to my s10e for the samsung visual voicemail,\nThe content is not available on phone anymore, to report this issue go to settings/ help and enter the code (com.samsung.vvm.se2290:9901:133cb28bc011). When I go to settings/ help and enter the code it says no results found so that's pointless. Any ideas before I reset my phone?",

    "title": "WiFi Calling does not work after Auto Restart",
    "content": "Can you please forward this to the Samsung Cell Phone Galaxy Engineer for action\nI am reporting a bug that needs to be corrected with the next Samung Update please. The problem occurs on 2 different Samsung devices one device is my wife\u2019s and one device ismine. This problem occurs despite doing a hard reset on the devices. Let me explain the problem that occurs on both devices. My Wife own a Samsung Galaxy S10+ and I own a Samsung Galaxy Note 10+ (both unlocked and are both are not branded to any cellular carrier)\n Let me explain to you and please read this very very carefully so you can understand clearly the issue at-hand:\n We do not have good cellular coverage indoors at our home, therefore we must use Voice Over WiFi feature known in the Samsung device as: Wi-Fi Calling and the feature is turned ON on both of our devices and the WiFi Calling PREFERENCE is set to Wi-Fi PREFERRED on both devices. While we are at home, indoors, we communicate with our phone calls via the WiFi Calling feature on both of our devices as our Wi-Fi Internet is provided by Spectrum Internet Company. The WiFi internet from Spectrum Internet Company is working perfectly fine and all ports on the WiFi router are open and there is no issue with the WiFi Internet nor WiFi router.\n Keep paying attention please. Both of our devices features are set to: AUTO RESTART AT SET TIMES (toggled ON). We have this feature to \u201cAUTO RESTART DEVICE AT SET TIMES\u201d toggled ON on both devices at 3 AM (while we are asleep, so devices auto restart at 3 AM while we are asleep.)\n Keep paying attention please here. Both of our devices also have: SCREEN LOCK TYPE set to PIN, which means when our devices reboot or sreen locks after 5 minutes (set to lock after 5 min on our devices), in order to unlock the screen on our devices and use the device and use the apps and be able to call, the end-user (me and my wife) must enter a PIN (which we have set) to unlock our devices\u2019 screen and have access to all apps on our devices etc... In fact, when we restart our devices during the daytime, with the SCREEN LOCK TYPE set to PIN on both of our devices, after this restart, the System UI (User Interface) screen message populates on both of our devices stating: \u201cPHONE RESTARTED. UNLOCK YOUR PHONE to GET APP NOTIFICATIONS.\u201d And as soon as we enter the set PIN, devices\u2019 screen unlocks and we now have access to the devices\u2019 apps and able to use device and call via Phone App via Wi-Fi calling (if we are at home) etc...\n Here is the issue at-hand. Please keep reading carefully.\n Because both of our devices are set to \u201cAUTO RESTART AT SET TIMES\u201d at 3 AM, we are asleep and we can not unlock our devices\u2019 screen, with our set PIN, until we wake up at around 6AM in the morning. What is happening with both of our devices is: the WiFi calling does not work upon that auto-restart at 3 AM therefore any calls coming in at 3 AM, and after 3 AM, go directly to voice mail and are missed. In fact, when we wake up at 6 AM and see that our devices auto-restarted at 3 AM same nite, and despite our entering the PIN to unlock the screen on our devices, the WiFi Calling feature remains not connected and we are still unable to make calls. What we must do, after devices auto restart at 3 am, is we must enter PIN to unlock screen and then RESTART our devices again (or put our devices in the AirPlane Mode for 30 seconds and then toggle airplane mode OFF) to be able to call and use Phone App on our devices. In Summary: After device auto restarts at 3 AMhave and stays auto restarted without end-user entering PIN to unlock screen for device to finish restart, the WiFI calling feature no longer active and end-user without cellular coverage indoors (like me and my wife) will not be able to get or make phone calls. HOWEVER: If the device auto-restarts at 3 AM and end user immediately PIN to unlock screen, the auto restart will complete and WiFi Calling will work. Please understand the auto-restart does not turn off the wifi calling feature, as the WiFi calling feature remains toggled ON after auto-restart. The WiFi calling featureto work requires the end-user with PIN set to unlock screen, must unlock screen to have WiFi calling work indoors without cellular coverage. If end-user does not enter PIN to unlock screen after auto-restart of the device, the WiFi calling is not available until end-user enters screen unlock PIN for the phone to complete the restart process and only then the WiFi calling feature will work.\n I contacted our cellular carrier and I was told that all our WiFI calling features are turned ON on their end and I contacted my WiFi Internet Carrier and was told no ports are blocked.\n In fact, my WiFI calling works perfectly during the day. The issue happens ONLY after auto-restart at night with the PIN set unlock screen. Unless PIN is entered at night immediately after auto-restart of the device, the WiFI calling feature will NOT work and all calls at night after auto-restart will be missed.\n I think Samsung mustissue an update after Samsung corrects the program to code for the WiFI calling feature to continue to work WITHOUT end-user entering screen unlock PIN after AUTO-RESTART.\nBy the way, all phones are uptodate with updates.\n Please let me know if you need any additional information.\n My IMEI 359187100373994 and my wife\u2019s IMEI 352689104952282\n Thank you,\nRoman Greenspan.\nRomanGreenspan@yahoo.com",

I have the Galaxy S10+ (2019).\n When I play music from Spotify (for e.g. only, as the issue is across all apps), the music usually continues to play after the screen goes to sleep and the phone locks. However, over the past few months I've noticed on some occasions that, when the screen goes to sleep, the connection with Spotify seems to be very temperamental as the audio becomes very patchy, it will completely stop playing, then randomly continue the music after some time, then cut off again, etc. When it does cut off, if I double-tap the screen to wake it up, the music will continue again as normal straight away.\n Also, when the phone is awake, songs don't play very smoothly. It feels like there might be a lot of background processes happening on the device which causes the music to very slightly skip/pause/flicker a bit. I've noticed the same kind of flickering during voice calls over data (WhatsApp/fb messenger, etc).\n I'm wondering if anyone might have any troubleshooting tips for me?\n Many thanks in advance!",

I would like a way to remove these from my home and app screen. I have two pages on my home screen and one page for my app screen. I don't need dots to tell me where I am. Especially my app screen which is only one page but it still shows me that I'm on the one and only page. \n For the do not disturb issue, I found that 2 updates ago it was actually fixed. But then the last 2 update pushes broke it again. I use do not disturb during class and when I'm at something important where I want my phone to be completely silent (Dr appt, etc). This includes my media sound. FYI I play with my phone while I'm sitting and waiting for the professor to arrive, not during class time. I don't understand why do not disturb now allows media sound to come through while it is on. Phone calls are silenced but media sound somehow gets through and isn't affected by do not disturb.

Bixby Voice will auto-launch itself, youtube videos will pause or skip to another video without me touching anything. Calls will get dropped when speaking through headphones. Static sounds can be heard sometimes. I've switched headphones and the problem still occurs. This problem only happens when heaphones are plugged in. I've tried cleaning out the jack with a blower, switching headphones, etc. The problem still exists. The sound coming from heaphones is fine. It's the phone itself that starts glitching when headphones are plugged in. \n\nAny thoughts? ",
