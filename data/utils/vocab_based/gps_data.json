It appears to be either a consistent hardware issue between the 2 phones or a software issue when the phone is moving faster than 15 MPH while using GPS\n\nI have been testing this issue 5-6 times a week and using every step i could think of, I cant get any help from google so I\u2019m hoping someone can assist or has had a similar issue,\n\nI have also documented that the phone struggles to regain GPS signal and when doing so it over heats, sometimes to the point of being dangerous to hold.

Finished all settings and apps as usual, then enrolled Android Q beta, OTAed from latest Pie build of 20190305. \n\nFirst I noticed that auto rotation and Active edge is not working, so I downloaded Sensor Lab and Phone Test from play store and run a test. As you can see from attached screenshots, the result of these two apps along with GPS status' sensor test shows that accelerometer, gyroscope, compass and step counter are not working. \n\nMy first thought is it's a bug in Q beta because before installing OTA everything worked as expected. Then I did a hard reset via recovery, downloaded latest Pie factory image (190305) and flash-all. However this operation did not help. Those sensors are still dead.\n\nI had several Nexus/Pixel devices, tried many beta images and 3rd party ROMs but this issue is new to me. Since I'm in mainland China it's difficult to just call customer service and get a new handset. Looking for help here.\n\nP.S Base on my experience as a software developer I tend to believe it's not a hardware issue, but is it possible that I really need to get a new phone since the bug made some permanent damage?\n\n\nThanks a lot.",

    "content": "Since 3.5 weeks ago, my GPS dot suddenly started drifting around the map (sometimes up to a mile away) when driving OR simply just sitting at home, using Google Maps.\n\nI can easily reproduce the issue by just sitting at home and trying to navigate somewhere on Google Maps, and watching the dot jump around.\n\nAside from Factory Data Reset, I've actually replaced the phone with not one, but two like-new refurbished phones. I am still experiencing the same exact issue.\n\nI've double-checked enabling all location services/accuracy (I always have them enabled in general). Tried the usual \"turn it off and turn it on again\" of course.\nOne phone I tried testing with the Android 10 update. The other phone (that I currently have), I *did not* update to Android 10. Both phones have the same issue.\nI've tried clearing Google Maps data/cache\nUsed a GPS repair app to clear GPS cache/recalibrate it.\nReplaced the SIM card with a brand new card (twice)\nMy wife has a Google Pixel of the exact same model (Pixel 1) as me, but a different network (she is on AT&T, I am on Verizon) and has no problems at all. So I don't think it's our environment (walls, vehicle) causing problems.\nAlso, this problem only started happening recently, after working fine for 2 years.\n\nTo summarize:\nPhone 1 - Google Pixel - Android 10 - Verizon - GPS drifts (after working fine for 2 years), bought in 2018\nPhone 2 - Google Pixel - Android 10 - Verizon - GPS drifts, \"like-new\" refurbished by Asurion in 2020\nPhone 3 - Google Pixel - Android 9 - Verizon - GPS drifts, \"like-new\" refurbished by Asurion in 2020\nPhone 4 - Google Pixel - Android 10 - AT&T - GPS works fine, bought in 2018\nEdit:\n\nAlso tested swapping the SIM cards in Phone 3 and Phone 4. After swapping the SIM cards, Phone 4 reproduced the issue and Phone 3 worked perfectly.\n\nVerizon insists the issue isn't on their end (I contacted technical support).\n\nIs there anything else I can do?",

I really wish you could do this for Google Fit. \nMy question: I did notice that if you \"track\" a workout, the mileage becomes extremely accurate.  I'm wondering if I did this on enough occasions, that google would eventually learn my average stride length and remember? once it's accurate enough, then it could just use the accelerometer and not GPS for mileage -- like a Fitbit.\nnote: I'm not trying to keep track of accurate steps / mileage all day long. I don't even wear my Fitbit all day. I just bring it on walks to see how far I went. but it's getting old and I'd like the phone to be a good replacement.",

    "content": "Hi guys, \nI'm still facing a weird bug regarding my location. When my phone is not able to receive GPS signal, my location will \"jump\" to a specific location that I've \"mocked\" to back in June. When I'm outside where GPS signal is strong, my GPS sensors will pick up my current location again. I know this via my Google Location History.\n\nI noticed this behavior when I first updated to Qbeta3. Back then the problem was overshadowed by the issue with corrupted \"persist\" folder (which caused the all the sensors to stop working) so I didn't point this out. I thought this issue is solved so I never bothered to check my location history until now.\n\nThe weirdest part is, this jump to specific location is observable even without setting up to my google account after I performed factory reset, which makes me believe that it is stored somewhere in the device, probably within data that survives full wipe such as persist folder.\n\nThe question is: What can I do to stop this behavior? and if possible, how do I delete this GPS data of this specific location from my phone?\n\nI appreciate Google's support teams in the past in helping me on various issues, but I'd consider myself as advanced user, so help from more knowledgeable person is welcome.",

    "content": "Hi All \n\nI'm user of a Pixel 2 and Pixel 4. \n\nI noticed that the Pixel 4 is very accurate (regarding the compass direction) in Europe old towns (like in Barcelona old quarters with very narrow streets).\n\nThis is the first phone that gives me a good accuracy here (at least so far). \nCompass is always 80-100% pointing in the right direction.\n\nI decided to compare Pixel 2 vs Pixel 4 and I noticed the following:\n\nWhen opening \"GPSTest\" app in the Pixel 2, only 1 default GALILEO Satellite appears. And then the phone basically stays with 1-2 satellites, but it struggles to find them. \n\nWhen opening \"GPSTest\" app in Pixel 4, more than 4-5 GALILEO Satellites appear right after launching the app. And then a few more might appear, but that probably is not that required.\n\nAnd finally: I also noticed that if I put Pixel 4 close to my Pixel 2 while the app is open, the Pixel 2 start to catch a lot of more galileo sattelites (Like if the Pixel 4 was enhancing the Pixel 2) --> Anyway, this last case,is weird, but I tried it two times only, maybe I need to try it more times, to confirm is not a placebo. (But the Pixel 2 didn't seem to catch lot of european sattelites by its own, without the Pixel 4 doing the same).\n\nNow my main question about all this topic is: \n\nIs it possible to add more gallileo sattelites to the Pixel 2 configuration? Perhaps this improves the bad the GPS accuracy in some european places? \nI think the Pixel 2 is missing some sattelites in some config file. Could be possible to increase the initial satellite count from 0/29 to 0/37 like the Pixel 4? \n\nI'm just trying to know if it's possible to improve the GPS accuracy in Europe with the Pixel 2. \n\nHere we have some screenshots. \n\n\nPixel 2 (when app starts, only 1 European satellite - so 0/29 instead 0/37): \n\n\nPixel 2 (after putting Pixel 4 and Pixel 2 using GPS together, or at least, after letting Pixel 2 use the GPS for some time): \n\n\nPixel 4 after opening the app (0/37): \n\n\n\nThanks\nSebastian",

Today I went on a 7.9km outdoor run, but Google Fit reported it as 9.85km. Double checking by measuring distance on Google Maps shows the length of my route at 7.9km. It will record time and steps accurately and will plot the run on the map accurately, but the distance (and therefore my pace) is way off. It seems to roughly report 1km for every 800m. \n\nI have all permissions for Fit (Location, Physical Activity, Storage) set to Allow (or Allow all the time). My run is outdoors with clear skies for the GPS, I wear my phone on my arm strap, and my route is a long street run (i.e. not laps of a small track). I am running Android 10 (QP1A.190711.020).\n\nThe problem roughly began around the time of upgrade to Android 10 a few weeks ago, but I can't be certain if it was exactly at that time. Fit used to track distances accurately in the past and this has not previously been an issue.\n\nAny advice appreciated!",

But, It will happen again.\n\nDoes someone have such a problem with Pixel 3 XL?\n\nEven If I did not have any third party application, I will get the issue. \n\nI don't use \"active edge\" and \"find my device\" and Wi-Fi client and GPS(usually off). Also, I have several Google account on Android. Those use physical token.\n\nAccording to Google Pixel support, It will happen when there is not secure condition. And, They did not tell me enough about the case. But, I just keep putting it on Pixel Stand or laying it down on my desk or holding it to walk or keeping it into my pocket. If It's true that not secure condition, We need to know what is root cause by log or message. what is not secure condition, insecure or unsecure.\n\nKindly give me advice. It's troublesome to face the issue even it's not a big impact. But, It depends on the occasion and more.",

I did test out another app today and seemed to have the exact same mileage as MapMyWalk (although I did not try it while running).

If anyone out there knows a permanent solution to this issue, please help.",

Backup stops functioning, I get Google Play Services errors keep popping up and also GPS doesn't work at all. \n\nMy browser and all my other apps with internet connection will work fine still so it's not an issue with the network.\n\nBoth instances of this, have happened whilst I've been playing the Pok\u00e9mon Go game. (Therefore is most likely the cause). \n\nThe only way I've discovered of fixing it, is to factory reset my phone. \n\nDoes anyone know why would this game would be causing this to happen? My partner uses an S9 and has no such issues.\n\nAny help would be amazing. Thank you.",

This phone restarts at least 10+ more times a day. Sometimes it will restart itself 4 or more times in a row. Off, on, off,on....I have been desperately trying to get a replacement from Samsung. I have done all the trouble shooting that I was told to do. I have done a factory reset. This is a work phone, and I have lost many, many work opportunities, due to my unstable phone. I have been in the middle of a conversation with a client, hoping to land the job that they are offering, and my phone will restart. Very unprofessional. My phone will restart while using GPS, it will restart while using one of my work apps, and then I need to go back in and re-enter all the information again. I have been told several times by Samsung, I contact them almost every other day, to send it in and they will look at it. That is not an option, I need my phone for work. This is not a personal phone. And I do not feel I should have to go out and buy another phone, to use while I send mine in to see if they can repair it. My other option is to drive over 2 hours one way, to the closest Samsung Tech, and have them look at it. That is really not an option, since I would have to take a day off work to do this. I think with this many complaints, that Samsung would want to stand behind their products and not get a bad reputation. If I had purchased this through my cellular company, they would have given me a replacement on the spot. But I purchased this straight through Samsung, and they act like it is the consumers fault that their phones are having these restarting issues. If this was an Apple phone, Apple would have sent a replacement over night. So, my question to this community, has anyone had luck with getting a replacement with out having to jump through hoops? And if so, do you have issue with the new phone that you were sent? ",

Turning off hotspot 2.0\n3. Turning off 5 Ghz\n4. Turning off 2.4 Ghz and only run on the 5 Ghz\n5. Every change included restarting router and phones!\n6. Turning on GPS, turning off GPS\n7. Turning on Mobile Data, turning off Mobile data\n8. Downloaded package sniffers to see what the heck the phone was up to!\n9. Run with static IP for the phones, turned off static IP for phones\nand probably a few more things I cannot even remember as I write to you right now.\n  Funny thing though. I have devices that use 2.4 Ghz and/or 5 Ghz, but they have no problems. We got iPhones and iPads in the household, they got no problems. But the durned Samsung GS9/9+ just doesn't want to wifi.\nWhen it turns on, it shows exclamation mark, as soon as I have done any of the things described further up, it shows wifi without exclamation mark. Give it 2 minutes and the wifi still shows as running, but all connection is lost and then it only turns on a few seconds to then break connection.\nI have been in contact with Samsung who gave up on me...\nI have tried to solve the problem on my own by checking out other routers and how they solved the problem, issue is...\nThe problem is Samsung, the way you have programmed the drivers to deal with the wifi.\nThe answering time from the phone is too slow. Those who created opensource software for the routers stated, that the only way to keep the connection with the Samsung phone, was by allowing the reply of the handshake with the phone to last forever, otherwise it would drop again...\n  Please fix this issue Samsung, this is on you!",

Aside from the fact that this is annoyingly frequent it does appear to have fixed the Smartlock Trusted Placed bug that resulted in the phone remaining unlocked when taken several miles away from a Trusted Place. However there now appears to be a different problem, which is that the phone often remains locked even when within the trusted place. Some tests that I have conducted suggest that this is because there is no sensible range within which distance from a Trusted Place the phone will remain unlocked. On experiencing problems I have added a new [sic] Trusted Place, despite being in what a human would consider to be the same physical location, and found that it differs from one previously set by perhaps 0.1 or 0.2 of a second of arc in one or both directions. The different positions may be caused by GPS satellite positions and would not ordinarily be a concern, but  . . .\n There doesn't seem to be a way of specifying a range and so I would expect a sensible default value of a few tens or low hundreds of metres to have been set. This isn't happening and so the facility is again virtually useless. Am I missing something? If not could someone please try and fix this, since given that I can't apparently use the fingerprint recognition I need Smart Lock to work.\n Thanks.\n ",

    "content": "My new S20 has very slow and unreliable GPS lock issues.  Google Maps & Waze frequently show my location 1-2 miles away even outdoors in clear conditions.  GPS games also show the incorrect location or jump around frequently.  Sometimes a reboot fixes the issue temporarily but eventually it returns.  I didn't have this issue with the S10, this is really a terrible bug to have in a new flagship phone!  Is there an incoming fix or information on this problem?\n Update on 3/15/2020: \nI chatted with a Samsung support person via the chat option on the website.  They had me calibrate my GPS from the Edge menu.  Note that on my phone I first had to enable the edge menu.  Once enabled swipe left to bring out the menu, and most importantly go to the little dots in the lower left and swipe again to get the \"second level\" edge menu (or second page).  Poor UI but it's there- a second page that has \"Calibarate\" Tally Counter, Flashlight, Surface level and Ruler.  Choose Calibrate and move phone in a figure 8 to calibrate.  I will retest out in the field and report back.\nNote that on some carriers (not verizon) you can enter *#0*#, then tap Sensor, then Selftest under magnetic sensor and ensure it says \"Pass\".  Fingers crossed!\n Update 3/18- none of the solutions in this thread has worked reliably for me.  If you google \"galaxy s20 gps issue\" you'll see growing coverage of this issue so hopefully it will get a solution soon.\n Update 3/29- I received a system update a few days ago (G981U1UEU1ATCH/G981U1OYM1ATCH/G981U1UEU1ATCH)  but unfortunately the problem is still\noccuring and not fixed. \nUpdate 5/10- It's working much better now, some sort of update must have been pushed and in conjuction with keeping 5G off I'm finding GPS pretty reliable now so am closing this issue.  Hopefully it will get fine tuned and even better.\n Update 9/15/2020- I see many people are having this issue again so am unmarking it as solved.  I am not experiencing the issue anymore but others are.\n ",

OKay at first i understand maybe it might be the procedure though CS suggestions doesnt make sense .secondly i went to I-CITY MALL SHAH ALAM and told them i already when to sunway piramid , they just clear cache ,ram all the basic things which a customer can do by it self .I City samsung service centre i told them it can be digitizer problem .  They say sir we need check need video prove , or else we need to format the phone .. me like come on again !!!!!!!! for  warranty  sake i  agree to format and i need back up data . after format i came to collect on  the same day ,upon handover the mobile phone to me it were working fine ,thought that might be the issue but after that issue reoccur again .but this time i record the problem using my friend and see to the  Customer SErvice .. and they agree to change the screen .but they say dont have the parts because its new model in  the market , thats not acceptable !! MY QUESTION IS ;\n  why flagship phone  or customer always gets treated faster compare  A series buyer \nis that because  S  series and NOTED  SERIES  PRICE RANGE AROUND 4000 TO 5000 RANGE. lets say if that is  SAmsung S20 ultra got problem  will they say no spare parts or what. NO way !! because its price range u cant tell this to customer because the price range !! elite customers  !!. IF SAMSUNG comes out with new mobile phone   why not never sent the spare parts to all over service centre !! we dont have parts reason is not  acceptable at all !!!! because to claim warranty its not easy because need find time ,parking at mall  find the shop and wait for the  Q  and now we cant sit need stand outside (but that i understand due to situation) because my job require phone for gps ,email while travelling i cant be stalled without handphone. please do improvise the service  SLA , flow and lastly please treat all series phone owners the same when it comes warranty parts replacement everyone is pAYING THEIR HARD EARNED  MONEY !!!! .. we buy because we trust on your specs ,advertisment and so on ...",
