It will reconnect me to Data on T-Mobile, but it eventually disconnects again. It will stay connected for anywhere between 2-12 hours. It is annoying to reconnect to my work and home Wi-Fi several times a day as well as my Bluetooth devices.\n\nHas anyone found a long term solution to this. Would a new SIM card do the trick?\n\nThank you!",

    "title": "Pixel 4a (5G) screen black, phone still works - how to cast to TV so you can still use your phone",
    "content": "My pixel 4a (5G) developed purple color bleed, which was the death knell for the screen. The purple spread rapidly and the screen turned almost completely to black within 48 hours. The phone itself still worked and the screen still responded to my touches normally, I just couldn't tell what I was pressing. Once my replacement phone arrived, I wanted to copy the data from my old phone to my new phone and I had to figure out how to mirror the screen form the dead phone to another screen so I could see what I was doing. It was incredibly tedious, but doable.  How I did it:\n\nI took screenshots of the menu screens needed to get my old phone to \"cast\" to a device that I already had setup to accept casting, so that I could touch my dead screen in the approximate right places to turn on casting. You phone will look different than mine depending on what devices you have set up, etc so the most important thing is to know how to connect a USB-C cable from the phone to the computer so you can retrieve screenshots you take on your dead phone (screenshots still worked on the dead phone). After connecting the USB-C cable, you'll hear a little beep to let you know that your phone is connected. First swipe down from the top on the dead screen to bring the top menu. Underneath the top menu will be the USB notification, you'll want to touch this notification. Keep in mind that if your phone pushes you notifications frequently, these other notifications will be higher up on the screen than the USB notification, so clear them all away by swiping them to the right so only the USB notification is underneath the top menu. When you have successfully touched the USB notification, the next menu that comes up asks what you want to do with the USB cable. From the area labeled 'Use USB for,' select \"file transfer/Android Auto.\" You should then be able to open your phone's internal files from your computer and view the screenshots on your computer. \n\nOnce you have this capability, then you can go to settings (wherever that is on your phone). In the settings menu (screenshot 1), select 'connected devices'. At the bottom of the 'Connected Devices' menu (after whatever bluetooth devices you have previously connected to your phone), select 'Connection Preferences.' From the 'Connection Preferences' menu (screenshot 2), select \"Cast\" --> select which device you want to cast to (this will be different on your phone than mine based on what devices you can cast to, so I did not screenshot this). Once you have selected the device to cast to, a screen will come up that asks if you want to to \"Start casting or recording?\" (screenshot 5). Select 'Start now.' You will then be able to manipulate the dead phone using the screen that it is casting to as a reference. \n\nHope this helps some people!",

It does not mount as a portable device like other smartphones do. I have no access to anything on it at all.\n\nWorse: I am a developer working on an app which I would like to run on a Pixel 5. I have installed the latest Google adb driver on my PC and have put my Pixel into Developer mode,  but because the phone does not properly connect I cannot debug or otherwise test my software using it.\n\nAnd to add insult to injury, the blasted phone doesn't consistently communcate with my smartwatch. This is a Bluetooth connection that all too often fails.\n\nI am almost ready to ditch this phone and go back to the Samsung phones that have worked so consistently and well with my Android Auto and my Android Studio development system. I am, however, hoping that someone can tell me how to make this thing work the way it is supposed to.\n\nDoes anyone have any idea how to get this phone to communicate properly with USB connections???",

I suppose I could try a factory reset after I've made sure everything's backed up but the device is only a couple of weeks in my hands. My last phone was a OnePlus 3T which I've had for nearly 5 years. I used to have pocket mode switched on with that device & no issues. That is not available on this device. It's the randomness of things I don't like & it's stopped me from taking advantage of some of the new features in V11 (OnePlus was 9 + their mods - which were modest).",

Let me correct that. It will play maybe 5% on the left.\n\nHere is a screen recorded example of what happens https://imgur.com/gallery/fGOvESY \n\nIn that video I am playing over the built in speaker. When I used Bluetooth headphones all the audio is the right headphone. When I connect to my car, same thing. When I plug in and connect to my wife's brand new car and play via USB-C Android auto, all the audio goes to the right side speakers. Attempting to move the balance to the left side only results in the audio fading away.\n\nI initially thought the problem happened when I transfered the music from my plex server to my laptop so I could organize it. But after checking all the tracks I checked had no issues with balance and played fully on both or either channels.\n\nI did some googling, saw some people had some success with doing a factory reset. But before that I tried asking Google for help. Went through three levels of support before they eventually hung up on me.\n\nDid the factory reset, and still have the problem. Decided to download a track from my phone back to my laptop to see if maybe in the transfer/sync the file got altered. Nope. Plays perfectly on the laptop. \n\nThe issue occurs in three different Bluetooth headphones and two cars. It happens with youtube, YouTube music, VLC, and media monkey.\n\nWeirdly, it doesn't happen with downloaded podcasts on podcast addict.\n\nOK. That's everything I've tried to troubleshoot and figure out how and where this is happening.\n\nAny help is welcomed. Thank you.",

    "content": "Hi there!\n\nI recently bought the Pixel 5 and have noticed that the volume on my wired earphones is incredibly low. I thought it was a dongle issue and ordered a USB-C DAC and switched to my Bluetooth earphones while I wait for it to arrive but even with BT earphones the sound is just barely audible and drowns out completely the moment there is even mild background noise. I see no appreciable increase in volume after going from 50% on the volume rocker through 100. \n\nAnyone facing similar issues? How can I work around this? As it stands, I don't think I'll be continue enjoying this device if there's no way to fix the volume.",

    "content": "I have a pixel 3 phone.   It stopped pairing with my fitbit charge 2 about a year ago.  I thought it was Fitbit issue as my fitbit is 4 years+ old and the face is cracked.  I now sync via my desktop with a dongle in a USB port.  From that point I did not notice any issues until I bought Pixel buds and because the Pixel buds are a new product I thought the audio issues I were having were on the Buds side and I worked with google on that.  What takes the cake though is I bought a new to me used car with android auto.  I paired up my phone and it worked great for about 50 mins into our road trip to texas from wisconsin.  It kept disconnecting and I was getting super frustrated and was blaming the car and the cables I used to connect.  Until I had my wife connect her phone a pixel 3a.  No issues with her phone the whole rest of the trip. \n\nI reset all network settings, I put my phone in safe mode and still have issues.   confirming that my bluetooth is defective.  After two + years of owning the pixel 3 I assume my only option is to get a new phone which is disappointing as I was hoping to make it 3 years with my phone before I get a new one.  I guess the real reason why I am posting this is to warn others that it may not be the things your trying to pair with but it might be your phone.",

After that though, while all devices are connected and working properly, my pixel 5 is behaving oddly.\n\n- Does not show up in devices lists in the google home app. Overall, looks like a lot of connected devices are not showing up in the list (like smart plugs and cameras) even though they are working fine.\n- Does not seem to connect to the wifi point even when inches away and hence shows poor/fair wifi connection --> ends up buffering or not streaming content due to poor network\n\nSo far, I have done the following:\n1) Reset network/bluetooth/wireless settings on the phone\n2) Restarted my entire network\n\nThoughts and ideas on how to troubleshoot?",

I find this to be true for the following headsets: Aftershokz Opencomm, Jabra Evolve 75, Jabra Elite 85t.\nThis only happens when using the multipoint connection and one of those connections is the Pixel 4XL.

    "content": "The first day after the April Android 11 update, my phone worked fine and like normal.\n\nThe next day after leaving it charging throughout the night, my phone has decided to stop working well/normally. \n\nThe screen doesn't open with swiping, only the power button. It also doesn't display the time or notifications while the phone is put down and not touched.\n\nWhile I'm using the phone, I can swipe down once to see the \"notifications screen\" but I can't swipe down again for the quick settings panel. \n\nWhile on the \"notifications screen\",  it doesn't display any notifications at all, even though I know there should be one because the phone still makes the notification sound.\n\nThe quick settings that I can access (wifi, bluetooth, etc), I can toggle on/off, but I can't access them as usual (tap and hold for a couple seconds).\n\nMy wifi works fine, but the top bar says that I don't have any service. When I'm not connected to a wifi network, I can't access any internet, but I can make a call and send a text, but I don't know if I can receive either. I've checked my phone service account, and things seem normal from that end.\n\nSome apps are being weird as well.\n\nI noticed an app missing, and when I went to get it again from the Play Store, it won't download. It just says that downloading the app is 'pending'. It's been saying this for over 20 minutes, and I am connected to a wifi network.\n\nWhen my alarm goes off, I snooze it, then do something else with my phone, the alarm going off overlays whatever I'm doing.\n\nI'm not sure how to fix anything, but it's all rather frustrating.",

    "content": "So for some reason this only happens when I am connected to the Bluetooth in my car. I do not have the same issue when I'm using a Bluetooth speaker or headphones. The problem is that I will be playing music on Spotify and then I might open YouTube or a Snap or play an audio message from a friend, only when I switch apps, my phone will be playing the sound but the sound doesn't play through my speakers. Sometimes it works no problem, I will press play on something and it will just play with no issues. Other times it will not play any sound except for the last few seconds of a message or snap (and usually only when I am closing it out of frustration). \n\n Sometimes I'll try disconnecting and reconnecting to the Bluetooth in my car and sometimes it works but it usually doesn't. It seems to be particularly problematic with Facebook Messenger audio messages. I do have more luck when I disconnect and reconnect and then play YouTube videos (and no I'm not watching music videos while I drive lol, there are just some songs I can only find on YouTube).\n\nI don't think it's the Bluetooth in my car because I never had this issue with my previous phone (Galaxy Note 9). I could switch apps no problem and the sound from whatever app was active would play over my speakers just fine.",

    "title": "Low audio levels when using the headphone jack. Pixel 4a 5g & 3a",
    "content": "Hi there,\nHave a pixel 4a 5g. I have an issue with using the headphone jack (Bluetooth seems unaffected for this issue). When I first plug in a device like headphones or an auxiliary cable, the volume is really low (lower than usual at that specific level, even at max system volume). It sounds muffled and not loud enough. This happens to all audio coming out of the device and does not seem related to a specific app. The issue is there while using Spotify, google maps, YouTube etc.\n\nTo fix it I disconnect the device, wait for a couple seconds then plug it back in. Sometimes doing this 4-6 times to fix the issue or not at all. A restart usually does not fix the issue. Neither does booting into safe mode or a factory reset.\n\nI have the same issue on my pixel 3a as well. The issue was not there while running android version 10 on the pixel 3a which I am not able to test on the pixel 4a 5g. This also happens when I loaded android 12 DP2 on the pixel 3a.\n\nOne of the reasons I chose this phone over the pixel 5 was because of the headphone but there are constant bugs. Does anyone else have this issue or any solutions?",

I added both layouts on the physical keyboard settings, but when I try to type on text field, can't switch the layout. I tried shortcuts as Control+Space, Shift+Space, Control+Shift, Alt+Shift and so on. I also installed Microsoft swift keyboard, but result is the same. When the virtual keyboard is showing, when I press the shortcut for layout change, it switches only on the screen. But on the physical keyboard it remains english US. What can i do?\nThanks in advance.",

DND has permission for my stared contacts to be able to message or call, yet my phone never chimes or vibrates when it's on and those people try to contact me. For my alarm routine I'm trying to make it so it tells the weather for the day, then plays one of my playlists from YouTube music app. I had no issues with either of these topics on my last phone which is a Pixel 2. I also find the Bluetooth extremely slow to discover devices, connect to new ones, and it won't discover my Bluetooth ear phones even though other devices not previously connected to them have no issues finding them.\n\nAny help is greatly appreciated as I'm regretting buying this phone since I'm sick of having to troubleshoot it.",

    "content": "The wifi function on my wife's Pixel 3 turns off randomly, ie, the 'Use Wi-fi' toggle button turns off. When we turn it back to 'on' wifi does not in fact turn on. Exiting out and going back to the Wi-fi area confirms that the toggle button is back in the 'off' position. \n\nHer phone has the latest Android version 11 installed. We have tried restarting the phone, and restarting in safe mode. We have also 'reset wi-fi mobile and bluetooth' settings. None of these steps work. Nevertheless, if we persist at turning the phone off and on then eventually wi-fi can be turned on. But the problem will occur again before too long, and without warning, so that my wife uses a lot of mobile data before she realises the problem has occurred. \n\nAnother thing that happens when we are working with the wi-fi function (as we try to troubleshoot this problem) is the phone sometimes displays an error message 'UI System isn't responding', and we have to click 'close app' to return back to the previous screen and continue using the phone. \n\nMy Pixel 3a is fine, and we have no connectivity problems. The issue is definitely with the phone, hardware or software. I have read online about this problem, and other users have found that a factory reset does not help, so I am loathed to try this due to the inconvenience involved. Some people have speculated that it may be a hardware issue. The phone is less than one year old (purchased in May 2020). \n\nAny help would be appreciated.",

( Google play music no longer exists)\n2: reset your phone....nope.\n3: turn off and reset your WiFi...to fix a Bluetooth issue???\nThey did not listen to what I said, are reading from a script and a very old and out of date one, and when I pointed out the issues with what they were saying, they just said send your phone in to your warranty provider, during the Corona, I am to be without my phone for weeks, and with Brexit and fact Google have NO repair centres in UK stall, I might never get it back.\nGoogle support sucks.\nAm hoping boffins and wise people here may know where I can change settings.\nNever had this issue on previous phone ( not Google).\nHelpful ideas welcomed.",

That's not something that happens automatically or just after connecting, and doesn't happen all the time. Some days it's while driving to work, some while driving back home... Some days he has no issues at all. \nIt's more of a bother than a real problem, as he mostly just listens music, but sometimes in Spotify, but sometimes it happens while on a call, too. And driving on the Autobahn is really not the time to be exiting recovery mode and entering your PIN again xD \nI literally found nothing like this on Google, has any of you had something like that? \n\nBest regards,\nCarlos \n\nP.S.: He really doesn't want to go through all the trouble of reseting his phone and, having that issue, I'm not sure either whether just copying it to a new one or backing it up and restoring it afterwards would solve it.",

Its behaviour is one of the following:\n1 Headphones connect including headphones telling me connected. But when you check under Bluetooth devices, the device is greyed out and connecting. Eventually says \"Problems connecting. Turn the device off and back on.\"\n2. Headphones connect including headphones telling me connected. I click the button to play music and it comes out of the phone. If you look under Bluetooth devices the headphones appear connected, with no issues reported, but you can't switch from phone speaker to headset.\n\nTurning the headset off and back on does not resolve the issue. Opening the device in Bluetooth settings and clicking \"Disconnect\" then \"Reconnect\" most of the time solves the issue. Other times I need to restart the phone entirely.\n\nOther Bluetooth devices I own seem to connect more reliably especially after the last Android update.",

However, the Authenticator app is now wiped clean and I cannot get any codes to log into my social media. \nI've followed all the steps online- go to the google account, follow to security, 2-factor, and there should be a section for the Authenticator where I can set it up. However, when I get to the 2 factor section, all that appears are my security keys and the options to install more of them. \nI have also tried: - uninstalling and reinstalling the app - just adding the social media accounts again (no can do) -trying to get into accounts without codes (you have to send a special message to facebook etc.)\nTo summarize: I use Google Authenticator to provide 2 factor authentication for social media log in. I am now logged out of my social media accounts and unable to log back in because the Authenticator has not transferred to the new phone, and cannot provide me any codes.",

    "content": "About 2 months ago my vibration stopped working. I would restart my phone and then it would start working again. Then one day it stopped vibrating all together. This was annoying but an issue I could deal with since my phone was no longer under warranty. \nThen a few weeks ago, after I updated my phone, I noticed that randomly, throughout the day, my phone would disconnect from wifi and Bluetooth. I could not reconnect till after I restarted my phone.\nA little over a week ago I tried a factory reset and my phone would then continually crash and I would get a System UI failure message before I could even unlock my phone. After restarting in safe mode it stopped continually crashing but I'm still getting a System UI error message and then my phone disconnects from everything. I'm also finding that now when I restart my phone it does not always fix the problem. \n\nI saw a few others were having similar problems but have not yet seen a solution that has worked for me. My last resort is trying to do a rollback to a previous update but I'm not confident in how to do that. So I will take any suggestions.\n\n\nI was hoping to not get a new phone yet, this one is not even 1 1/2 years old yet (and it was bought new). I also loved having a Google phone and would like to continue having google phones, but i don't love that I'm having problems right after my year warranty is up and seem to be having problems finding someone able to help me.",

When I select a picture in files, I'm never given the choice to send the file via Bluetooth. I am given the option for nearby but Windows 10 can only do nearby with other Windows 10 computers. I turned off nearby and still don't have the option to transfer files via Bluetooth. I've rebooted my phone - no luck. I see the laptop in devices but cannot connect to it via my phone (see picture) although they are paired. I have the most recent Android version (see picture). Bluetooth is turned on on my laptop and you can see they are paired (see picture).\n\nWhat am I doing wrong. Thanks so much for helping this novice!\n\n(I couldn't attach more than 3 pictures - sorry)",

Connect a Bluetooth device from the settings menu.\" Again, this is happening while music is playing though my phone on the car speakers. \n\"No items to be displayed, since this Bluetooth audio is not capable of title display.\" This occurred AFTER I tried forgetting the phone from my car and the car from my phone and reconnecting. \n  \"Bluetooth audio is not possible with this device.\" This happens when I try to pause the music using touchscreen.\n \nI have ran into similar problems on at least one other car (2015 Honda Civic). This is not an issuer with my old phone (Samsun Galaxy S7) or my Fianc\u00e9's phone (iPhone 11) on the Subaru. Which leads me to believe this is an issue with the phone itself.  Furthermore, I do not have any issue with the audio itself. There is no skipping or cutting out with the audio. This issue is exclusively with the controls. \n\nI have exhausted most of troubleshooting capabilities. Mainly, unpairing the devices, restarting the phone, etc. And I have not found any similar issues online. ",

    "content": "Last night I dropped my phone about 5ft. It has a case but landed on the screen. Upon picking it up I kept getting System UI errors until I finally managed to restart it. The system UI errors have persisted but not as often. \n\nThe big problem I'm having now is I cannot turn on my wifi/bluetooth/mobile hotspot along with the phone being clunky and slow now. It'll make the attempt to connect then instantly drop. I'm still able to use network data. Soft reset/safe mode/software updates did not work and I'm hesitant to do a factory reset because of the wifi not working. I'm overseas for the foreseeable so I don't have access to UbreakIfix. Most of the locals have never done anything with a Pixel either and don't want to risk it.\n\nI'm guessing something is wrong with the motherboard or a loose connection inside. Without connecting to a hotspot in the meantime is there anyway I can tether my network connection to my tablet or another phone? \n\nI've also heard of applying pressure to the corner right above the power button but it hasn't changed anything. Or is there anyway I'd be able to use my Surface Go 2 with Google Fi? Any help or ideas are greatly appreciated.",

Where as other devices see 12-14 the pixel 3a sees only 2-3.\n\nI'm not sure I can roll back my device and definitely do not want to as permissions have changed so much in Android 11 that you HAVE to use a new device to ensure it works. \n\nPlease Please fix the issue.\n\nThanks Tim",

    "content": "I've been trying, unsuccessfully, to connect my Pixel 3 to my new Schwinn IC4 stationary bike via Bluetooth.\n\nThe phone finds the bike, which appears when I select, \"Pair a new device\"\n\nThe bike's bluetooth symbol lights when I select it and the phone reads, \"Pairing...\" \n\nBut then it just spins and ultimately times out. It did work one time, amidst dozens of attempts, but doesn't appear in my \"previously connected devices\" list. I have no idea why it worked that one time, and didn't before or after.\n\nThe other bluetooth device that came with the device - a pulse reader - connects perfectly, so at this point I am at a loss.\n\nIdeas anyone?",

I mostly use YouTube Music on Bluetooth in my car and that's for short runs with only one or two tracks playing most of the time. It doesn't happen very often but usually occurs once daily. Since I don't always keep my phone in the same room I may not hear it do it all the time. Perhaps it happens more than once per day. If I pick up the phone and turn it on with the fingerprint reader it may start playing again continuously.",

I thought it was the Toyota's fault, but my wife's Motorola G7 works like I'd expect--the directions just interrupt the radio on the car speakers.

Multiple times a week is excessive for a phone I still owe $600. Two days after I got the phone, my back glass broke while inside my otter box. Wasn't happy but the phone still worked. I wasn't worried about it. Over a year later phone I started having these issues, and verizon says it's because of the back glass. I think we all know the back glass has nothing to do with it considering there is multiple forums ranging over a year, talking about the same issues. I'm sure they all have broken rear glasses. In my lifestyle, my phone needs to work 100%. I don't have the option of paying partial values for it, so I'm not willing to accept partial performance on it. Trying to reach tech support via email or phone has been the hardest. Nobody ever picks up the phone. Trying to google, where to contact google, hasnt been easy. I would like answers. I want to know what google is going to do about my phone. This phone is almost worthless. I don't want to do a factory reset because I would lose so much. I do not want to delete everything on my phone to make it work. I have never had to do it before, so I don't want to it now. The Google Pixel 3 XL is a failed phone. Thousands of people are suffering because of it. Google needs to own it. For the price we all paid for this phone, google owes all of us.",

In addition, it does not seem to be a problem with my wifi router because every device that is not a Pixel 3a can connect to the wifi without any issues.\n\nThanks for your time and help.",

Whenever I ask Google to play a song, the Bluetooth functions of the device in connected to no longer respond.\n\nTo give an example:\nI'm in my car, I open Spotify and play a song manually - no issues everything's fine.\nThen I'll use the voice control button on the car (or I'll say \"hey Google\") to activate Google assistant and give a voice command \"play X on Spotify\"\nAssistant will play the song but now I can no longer skip or pause tracks. This problem persists until I restart Spotify.\nThe same issue happens when connected to a bluetooth speaker\n\nI've already contacted Spotify and tried everything such as clean reinstall, changing permissions and changing settings to absolutely no joy.\nI tried using SIRI on an iPhone and it worked perfectly so have narrowed it down to an assistant problem.\n\nAny advice?\nThanks in advance",

I also don't see any audio controls to control playback but the audio comes through the car just fine. My wife has the same device and hers was not updated yet so I tried to connect her phone the same way and everything worked just right. So I think something on the December update broke my phone's connectivity or visibility to my car. Need help trying to figure this out.

My phone kept crashing every single time I tried to boot it up. I later discovered that the only way to make my phone work was to keep airplane mode on. Whenever it is turned off, it instantly crashes again. Even in safe mode, if Airplane Mode goes off, so does the phone. I tried removing my SIM card to see if that was the issue, but the issue still occured. I have cleared storage, cleared caches, removed apps, force stopped all my apps, tried changing network settings, looked for system updates, tried disabling features such as location, bluetooth, NFC, wifi, etc. and yet the issue still prevails. Is a factory reset my only option? I'd rather not have to go through with the process.\n\n-Aaron",

    "content": "Hello Pixel Community,\n\nI received my first Pixel 4a 5G last week Tuesday.    Love the device, however the Bluetooth simply does not connect to anything.    Went thru the troubleshooting steps with support of factory reset.  Same problem.\nThus,  I was sent a new RMA replacement.     I just finished setting the device up... Lo and Behold,  SAME problem.   Does not connect to my car Bluetooth,  doesn't connect to my Sous Vide, Soundbar, nVidia Shield.    \n\nWhat's interesting, is my car doesn't see the device, but then displays the Bluetooth MAC of the phone,  then fails when connecting.   My phone DOES NOT see the Bluetooth name of my car.   However,  my phone does see Bluetooth names of other devices listed above, it simply fails to connect to any of them.\n\nWhip out the old Pixel 2... boom, connects to all devices listed above without issue.\n\nPlease advise.   Is there a bad batch of Pixel 4a 5G's?",

I then tried it in airplane mode, which was fine, and then with data active, which was also fine. The problem only seems to happen when the phone is on Wi-Fi, if that helps with the diagnosis.\n\nI also verified that this works fine on my wife's Pixel 5, so it may just be an issue with my phone itself.",

    "content": "I just moved from my beloved Pixel 2 to a Pixel 4a 5G.  Using the same podcast and music apps (Pocketcasts and YouTube Music) that I've used for at least a year on the Pixel 2 with no issues, I have an inconvenient bug with both apps on the 4a5G.  When the phone has lost its cell signal, then reconnects its signal, the audio will pause.  Please keep in mind that this is downloaded content, not a buffering issue.    \n\nIt's easy enough to press play to get audio going again, but becomes annoying quickly.  I live in a hilly area, so my phone might lose a cell signal briefly a few times on a 5 minute drive to the grocery store.  My hypothesis is that the problem has to do with cell signals.  Just looking at the icons in the status bar, the audio will continue playing when the phone loses its signal, but will pause immediately once a cell signal icon pops up again.  It's as if the phone equates reconnecting to a cell signal to disconnecting from bluetooth (even though the phone's bluetooth connection is stable).  \n\nAny thoughts?  Is this a system/phone bug, or a setting that I'm somehow missing?  Thanks for any and all help!",

If I use pdanet's functionality it works, but my carrier kicks me off after about 20 minutes.  I confirmed with my provider I have tethering and hotspot on my account (AT&T).",

Mine are Bose headphones and hers are Skullbuds Earbuds.  I was watching YouTube and it didn't do it, and then when I was listening to Spotify for a bit it deafened me (luckily I'm a sound engineer and I'm used to loud sounds). My sister had it happen on Pandora.  When I try to turn it down it usually goes right back to max. After a few seconds it will let you turn it down, though.  A few minutes later and it will turn the volume all the way up again! It's very annoying. Today is the first day today I've been updated to the new update, so I'm think that is it. I did see a post about this problem on the Pixel 3 but there was no solution. Also, I'm on mobile so sorry for formatting, spelling errors, etc.",

    "title": "Pixel Stand stopped working (does not detect phone)",
    "content": "Echoing what some other posters are noticing, with a few more details.\n\nAs of this morning, my Pixel 3 stopped working with both of my Pixel Stands.\n\nHere's what I've done so far:\n\n1. I updated settings to forget both stands.\n2. I rebooted my phone.\n3. Confirmed Bluetooth was on.\n4. Removed my case (even though it's an approved Google case).\n5. I unplugged and replugged the stand with the original charger.\n6. I placed my phone back on one of my stands.\n\nHere is what happens:\n\nMost often, nothing. The phone will not pair.\n\nHowever, three times (of about 15 attempts), the phone begins charging briefly and I see the pairing setup launch. But then I get a modal telling me to place the phone on the stand. If I tap okay, the screen clears and the phone stops charging. If I remove the phone and replace it on the stand, the phone stops charging.\n\nNote I've repeated the above for both stands.\n\nNote also that I no longer have an app to manage Pixel settings. I'm pretty sure I didn't use it to pair (when it existed).\n\nThank you!\n\nEDITED WITH ADDITIONAL CONTENT:\n\nTwo quick updates:\n\n1. My Pixel 3 is running Android 11. I updated a couple weeks ago.,\n\n2. My wife has a Pixel 4 running Android 10. Her phone charges fine on her stand and my two stands. My phone does not work on her stand.",

The Honda audio display screen says \"No device connected\" even though it is connected, and will play music from my Pixel despite this message, but the select/track advance buttons on my car no longer change the music and I have to physically choose tracks from the phone.

They had me take off my phone cover to make sure it wasn't that. We adjusted accessibility settings, Bluetooth, etc. Then we tried safe mode and the problem WORSENED in safe mode. It is definitely not a third party app. After I did my own search, I see similar volume issues are known problems with Pixels but is dismissed or ignored by Google. There are plenty of message boards with folks who say a factory reset or device replacement is pointless because the issue eventually recurs. For me, this all started after the last security update on 11/5. I never had problem before.This is clearly a Google software issue and I'm shocked to see years of complaints about this same issue or similar with no fix or acknowledgememt from Google.

Pairing has been canceled for this device\". I receive this message while I never received any code on my phone or car screen!\nSometimes I receive this message: \"Connection cannot be established\". Most of the time when I manually connect from the phone nothing just happen. Phones greys out the link and then back to normal.\nBoth car and phone can see each others in their own bluetooth settings but there is problem somewhere in pairing process.\nI tried all the fixes recommended for the problem and also I contacted Google for this problem. I am sure it is a phone problem not the car as all other phones can connect successfully even the brand new LG Velvet with Android 10.\nGoogle sent me the general troubleshooting email which it is not helpful.

This problem doesn't occur when I'm in my driveway and still connected to my wifi, but when I'm out driving and only connected to cell service, it happens every time. This is a fairly new development, only having started ~1 month ago. Never had any issues with connecting and staying connected to my car before that.",

If I am listening to the podcast app and pause it, when I resume it starts playing the audiobook app. The only way I can get around this is by closing out the audiobook. I love the feature but it is inconvenient if you have to take out the phone and do multiple actions every time you pause and resume. \n\nNot certain if there is a setting or something that I am missing on this.

    "title": "Issues with Pixel 5 Bluetooth playback in car audio",
    "content": "The Bluetooth audio in my car from my Pixel 5 does a strange thing: instead of smooth playback, I get two seconds of silence followed by two seconds of audio, with the audio being sped up like it was catching up from the period of silence. This is constant through any audio stream (Pandora, YouTube, Google Maps navigation, my own music files, etc.), and it only happens through my car's UConnect audio system (regular Bluetooth headphones do not exhibit this issue). My previous Android phones (like the Essential Phone, which was running Android 10) had no issues playing back audio. Are there some Bluetooth settings that need to be adjusted, or would this be a bug requiring a software fix?",

Pairing the phone with the headphones works just fine but when playing any type of music (be it via Spotify, Youtube, etc.) I encounter sound stuttering and connection interruptions. The headphones work flawlessly with any other devices I have tested them with (Macbook, iPhone, Win 10 Device).

I cannot factory reset my phone and have 3 apps on (including Spotify) but the issue is still third party.\n\nIf the update isn't compatible with some of the world's most popular apps, then in my opinion the fault lies is the OS.\n\nI have tried all the work around and it just doesn't work.

    "content": "I've tried different services to make sure it wasn't the apps (spotify and youtube music). It looks like since the past weekend it has been randomly choking and causing the apps to become unresponsive as well as the phone for a few seconds since it won't let me use the fingerprint reader, go back, or restart the song for a second when it freezes up. Bluetooth works fine though. \n\nAlso this issue only appeared after I continued setting up my phones google features and such. The most noticeable setup I did was the emergency contact and car crash detection. Maybe one of the sensors for the detection is not liking the audio cable connection while it's trying to detect so it's causing apps to choke?\n\n\nDid some more testing, kinda. I was sitting at work listening to spotify using my headphones connected by cable and have had no issues. So I'm thinking it is something with location services and car crash detection. Is that just a limitation of Pixel 4a? Should I maybe turn off location features while I drive?",

Even if I choose LTE / 3G / 2G I always have the \"no service\" message and a little cross on my empty network status icon. (I'm not speaking about data). I don't have any 5G sim card.\n\nI already performed 3 factory reset, network setting reset, nothing works. I'm very confused about that.\nAlso when I let my sim card inside and factory reset my phone, it bootloops during the Wifi search step maybe 4 or 5 times before showing me some wifi network. Works well without sim card.\n\nOther network stuff like Wifi and Bluetooth works \"well\".\n\nAny idea ? Do I mess something ?!\nThanks\n\nAndroid version:\n\n\nnetwork picto:",

I first noticed it with my car when the music that was being streamed off of Spotify would pause or mute in the middle of a song and then randomly continue with the song. I then tried to see if it was an issue with my car or my phone, so I decided to try and use my bluetooth speaker for reference. I started watching a YouTube video and the same issue was happening. I tried resetting connections, clearing cache and some other stuff I saw on the internet. I've done pretty much everything except for factory resetting the phone. I really don't want to do that because it is too tedious for me to reinstall everything onto my phone. Can someone please help me?",

It seems worse when Bluetooth is on/active and over time the issue seems more frequent as there could be some sort of memory leak.\n\nThings that help: Restarting the device, turning off Bluetooth.\n\nOn a fresh restart I'm able to multitask between apps without them restarting for a while. As much as I would like to entertain a factory reset I'm not convinced things would improve since multiple reddit post seem to indicate it doesn't matter.

    "content": "I have a pixel 3a, only a couple of months old. I have a weird issue where my phone will suddenly enter driving mode for no obvious reason (and open Android Auto as per my settings). Strangely, it seems to always be when I am in the middle of typing out a text message. And it happens when I am sitting still, in my house (so the phone should certainly not be detecting \"driving\" movement as described here). My settings for turning on Automatic Driving Mode are as follows: \n\nWhen connected to Bluetooth: OFF\nWhen driving is detected: ON\nAsk before turning on driving mode: OFF\nTurn on Bluetooth automatically: ON\nPocket detection: ON\n\nBluetooth trigger is off so can probably rule out that. I do like that Android Auto launches when I start actually driving so I'm not going to disable the feature. Just wondering why the phone would think I am driving when I am sitting on the couch texting.\n\nEdit: the problem seems to have gotten worse and happens more often. Not just texting but typing in other apps. Seems like it might be related to maps or location somehow: once when it happened I was using the Google keep app. It randomly launched android auto, when I swiped from the bottom to get back to previous app, there was an instance of maps in between keep and Android auto. Indicating that maps was used just before Android auto even though I never opened it.\nGoing to try enabling the 'ask before turning on driving mode' setting.",

I was so confused, but then one time, I swipe down the notification bar to see the quick settings, and I saw the Bluetooth illuminated button, turn off, then turn on about a second later. I have since seen it a few times with my eyes. I have factory resetted and even tried deleting apps that I thought could create the issue, but it has not been solved period is very frustrating, when my devices just randomly disconnect and I don't get notifications or it interrupts my music for a short time. Has anyone had this issue or have a fixed to it? Thank you.",

    "title": "Bluetooth/Volume Issues on Pixel 3aXL, Android 11",
    "content": "Prior to the update, when my phone was connected via Bluetooth (speakers, Pixel Buds, etc), I could hit the volume rocker and I had the option to swap audio output, so I could choose whether audio could play via phone speakers, or through the speaker. That option is gone from the little menu, so I have to go into Bluetooth settings, and either disconnect or to select my output and unselect \"media audio\". \n\nHas this feature (selecting audio output from the volume menu) gone away for everyone, or is this a bug? It was super useful before (to listening to voice notes or anything that you wouldn't want played onto the speakers for example), so I don't see why they would remove it. \n\nAlso, a different issue but in the same vein, the volume is also really messed up when playing on any Bluetooth device. Volume goes up 3 notches and is suddenly super loud on the speakers, but won't go up anymore, even though the slider is only at what, 20%? Going up in volume anymore does nothing to increase sound, it sounds as if it's at maximum. So currently it's as if I only have 3 volume levels; very quiet, somewhat quiet, and ear bleedingly loud.\n\nNot sure if my first issue is a bug, but if not, seems a very silly thing for Google to have done. But certain the second issue is a bug, and wondering if there's any fixes or solutions. \n\nThanks for reading. :)",

Just now I am trying to watch a video through I have on my google drive. My headphones are in the other room. Before I could just go into the sound menu and select my phone speaker. Now there is no option. There is no quick menu up top. Nothing. I can only switch my audio output when I have tidal open in the background.\nWhat gives? This is not convenient or useful.\nIs there anyway to switch my audio output without having to go through an app like spotify or tidals quick menu?\n\nThank you",

Sometime I want to switch to the local speakers if I'm showing my wife something. This was easy in android 10 and could be done right from the sound settings. Now I cannot do this. This is really frustrating and a step backwards. Is there a why I can turn off the new audio settings? Where did the old audio output setting go?",

Apologies in advance if someone links me to the answers that I should have found on my own. :)\n\nI dabbled in the beta and always ended up opting out due to crashes when running any Bluetooth connection. This would allow factory reset to the current factory Android 10 image. I was never able to pin down the issue but I suspect it may not occur if I did a complete Hard Reset (delete all data,  start with a pristine image).\n\nI'm now installing the final release an an OTA update. If it fails in similar fashion, can I do a factory reset that clears all data, apps., settings, etc., that will then install the Android 11 image? As a follow-up question, in the event that fails what options may I have to factory reset back to a known stable Android 10 image.",

I often have my phone connected to multiple Bluetooth devices and sometimes want to play audio over my speakers. I used to be able to toggle the volume and then tap to switch output to any source available even when not listening to a music app. For example Dolphin browser audio or audio from a game app etc. Now it seems only to give such an option for music apps.

Notification icons don't appear in the status bar. The only way to know if I've received a notification is if the app has the notification dot next to it. Bluetooth doesn't work. The drop-down settings bar will not drop all the way.\n\nSo basically when I'm not on WiFi I don't have a Smart Phone, I have a very nice camera.",

    "content": "I've tried everything and I can't fix it. When I'm connected to bluetooth with my wireless headphones I have always been able to adjust the headphones own volume using the volume button on my headphones and I could also adjust the bluetooth volume on my phone using my phone's volume buttons, I could adjust each independently and now since I've upgraded to android 11 I can't do that. I have also notice that when I connect my headphones to my phone, I have to shut them off and turn them back on again in order for my phone to acknowledge that my headphones are connected via bluetooth. Also when I am connected to my cars stereo via bluetooth, since the update, the volume slider on my phone doesn't change my musics volume at all. It either turns the music on or off no matter if the volume is in the middle on my phone or if it's all the way up. I can only adjust the volume on my stereo and I want to be able to adjust the volume with my phone sometimes. There are clearly many issues with bluetooth since this update. So to reiterate, I can't adjust volume when connected to bluetooth independently on my phone and headphones and when connected via bluetooth to my cars stereo, turning the volume on my phone up and down does nothing. I have factory reset my phone, I have restarted it, shut the phone down, I have booted in safe mode, I even deleted and readded all my bluetooth devices. I have done everything. And I've done it all multiple times now",

    "content": "I just upgraded from a Pixel 2 to a 4a, and I'm happy with it for the most part. But I keep running into one annoying problem on the 4a that wasn't an issue on the 2.\n\nWhen I leave the house with my Bluetooth ear buds on to walk the dog or go for a run or whatever, I like to use the button on ear buds to trigger Google Assistant to do various things: lock the front door, close the garage door, play some music, etc. This was never a problem with the Pixel 2. However, I am frequently running into an issue on the Pixel 4a where Assistant quickly turns off without responding when launched from Bluetooth. The cause appears to be that launching the newer version of Assistant this way always turns on the screen, and with the phone in my pocket I believe something is touching the screen and canceling the Assistant. I never have an issue when the phone isn't in my pocket. \n\nIs there any sort of setting to tell Assistant to not turn the screen on when launched from Bluetooth? I shouldn't have to take my phone or if my outfit to launch Assistant.",

    "content": "I am having connection issues with the Pixel 4 XL and the August WiFi SmartLock (4th gen). This lock uses both WiFI and Bluetooth to detect your proximity to home for the \"auto unlock\" feature.\n\nThe WiFI connectivity is OK, but the Bluetooth connection is very flaky. August support just offers their standard suggestions to clear the app cache/memory, switch BT off/on, restart the phone, power cycle and recalibrate the lock. This sometimes works for a while and then the BT connectivity begins to fail again.\n\nThere must be others with Pixel 4 and August Smartlock. Has anyone else had this problem and found a solution?",

I've checked the notification log too, but these are not noted. Even reset my phone but to no avail. I finally contacted support and they said it's not a known issue (even though I see evidence of it for Pixels and other Android phones via Google search) and they suggested I return the phone, which I'm doing and I'm hoping I won't find the same issue with the replacement.\n\nI did migrate a backup from a Huawei Mate 9 -- wondering if it could be connected to the China tracking system??? \ud83d\ude21\ud83d\ude02 I'm just frustrated AF. I bought a Pixel because I figured I'd get as close to the native Android as possible and hoped to avoid annoyances I saw on my Huawei. Any insights would be great.",

    "content": "Both my partner and I have had Pixel phones since the original Pixels came out. We recently moved into a new house and we're using the exact same modem/router setup from the old house (Cox). Now, we are not able to open certain 3rd party apps on our phones, which appear frozen but if you wait 1+ minutes, it will load. I have tried all the usual troubleshooting; forced re-start, reset all WiFi/Network/Bluetooth setting, restarting modem/router, system/security updates, speed test (350 down, 48 up) etc. If I turn WiFi off, I have no problems at all. In fact, everything works perfectly on other WiFi's, just not my home WiFI. I have dual band, I have tried both 2.5 and 5 channels with no difference. The Wifi works fine on my other devices, such as home computer, tablets, and TVs. I can't seem to find any answer. Interestingly, I pulled out my original Google Pixel and it has the same issue with latency around 3rd party apps as our 3A's? Could it be the Pixel OS and compatibility issues with my modem/router? And why all of a sudden? Any ideas or support would be awesome, thanks! \n\nModem: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0781VN7W5/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1\n\nRouter: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06X9CPC45/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1",

    "content": "And the drama that is Pixel Buds continues. \n\n1. My Pixel Buds will randomly connect to my phone while still in the case (from another room!) without notice. I'll be in the middle of a call and all of a sudden, the audio is directed to the Pixel Buds.  The case never moves, it's not charging, just randomly makes the connection to the headphones...which are still stored in the case.  \n\n2. On the flip side of this, now I can't get them to disconnect from my phone without turning off Bluetooth entirely. I want to listen to music via the speaker on the phone, but because they're connected to the Pixel Buds, it's sending audio there. I've made sure the headphones are seated properly in the case (the magnet clicks), I've cleaned the charging contacts on both the buds and the case, I even cleaned the entire buds to make sure there wasn't anything preventing them from making contact...and nothing. Eventually, not making the connection in the case is going to be an issue for charging as well. \n\nThis is my second set of Pixel Buds (first one had wires protruding from the bend in the cable) and they've never worked quite right. Anyone have any tips on how to prevent random connections when most inconvenient and then to kill the connection when trying to return to audio via the device?",

The exact same issues are present with my Pixel 4 XL. \n\nThe issue is that sometimes it will connect and start playing music right away as expected. Other times though the audio connection will look like its there however any music will skip for about 2 seconds over the car speakers then it will switch over to outputting sound through the phone speakers. All of the steering wheel controls work fine but the music just won't play over the speakers. I have to end up disconnecting and reconnecting Bluetooth between 1-5 times before it works properly. \n\nThis is very annoying and I was curious if anyone has the same issue or if there are any potential fixes outside of waiting for Google to fix their bluetooth stack again.",

I just don't understand who possibly thought that whenever you come in range of a different device that's turned on that you'd always prefer to switch to it without even being prompted. I would 100% prefer to have to manually select which device I want to connect to so that this stops.  I'm assuming there's no solution yet, but, if there is I'd love to hear it. Thank you.",

    "content": "I recently purchased a Google Pixel 3 XL phone as I needed a newer version of the Android operating system to use the applications required for my job. I was astonished when I realized that I was not even capable of setting up the device. I feel the need to mention that I am not able to use cellular data on this device as it does not have a SIM card in it (I primarily use WI-FI as a substitute for cellular data). I was able to skip the activation portion of the phone's set-up sequence, however, as I was configuring the phone, a message popped up saying that bluetooth was not functioning properly. I ignore it, and moved on to the next step. It asked me for a WI-FI network because I could not use cellular data, but none of them were appearing. It's telling me that there are no WI-FI hotspots in my location, and that both my IP address as well as my MAC address are unavailable. I hope you see my predicament here. I can't use cellular data because I have no service or SIM card & I can't use WI-FI because no networks are appearing. I was told that this was due to my router being misconfigured, but that's literally impossible considering I have 12 other devices that are running perfectly & are connected to it as we speak. It also doesn't make sense that it wouldn't show any of my neighbors' networks if it was truly just mine that was affected. I have spent hours on the community forums & help guides written by Google to no avail. I have tried going into \"safe mode,\" I have tried wiping all data from the device & factory resetting it, and nothing works. I even had an actual Google customer service employee try to tell me that I needed to update my device's operating system... Let me ask you this, genius, how can you expect me to update my device using WI-FI when the whole reason I contacted you was because I couldn't connect to it on said device in the first place? It seems to me that the combination of narcissistic deception & a general lack of common sense has plagued customer support. To make matters worse, I have found dozens of people complaining about issues very similar to mine, yet they have not received any assistance in over a year. PLEASE HELP ME RESOLVE THIS ISSUE!",

    "content": "Google Pixle 4\nAndroid Auto / SiriusXM / Google Music Player (Musicolet)\n\nI have Android Auto in my phone and my Ford F150. When getting back into the truck, plugging my phone into the dash, it often/always defaults to Google Play Music (Musicolet) and albums on my phone, even though I had last been using SiriusXM for music. I now have to cycle through sources (AM1->AM2->FM1->FM2->etc->Sirius1/2/3) to get back to the SiriusXM Station I had on the last time I was in the truck. This is happening despite not having Musicolet on recently.\n\nI connect to a Bluetooth Speaker. Open the SiriusXM App and start a music channel. A song starts playing. Shortly afterward, Google Play Music switches over to music stored in my phone. Open the phone, restart the paused song I was listening to on the SiriusXM App and it works fine. Just like in the truck, this is happening despite not having Musicolet on recently.\n\nAny help would be appreciated.\n\nJohn",

I have done everything including reset my network settings, unpaired and re-paired, changed the audio codec, changed the AVRCP, restart my phone and so on!!!\n\nI read that I should try to enable the A2DP however it is impossible to do with my phone as the phone will restart and the button would be greyed again.\n\nI have other wireless speaker and it can connect and play music flawlessly after pairing it with my Pixel XL. I have no idea why my phone can't play any media through my car Bluetooth. It's extremely frustrating. Please help",

I attach a screenshot instance of this.\n\nThen there have been a few times, like today, when somehow, the phone in my pocket went to airplane mode and I lost the connections to my BT devices through the ST app, ,which just happened to screw up my recording of a new personal speed record!  Annoying!\n\nThe only time I use the ST app on my activities in when I open it to press the LAP or STOP buttons.  I always click the power button to turn the screen off when done.  \n\nSame for the OC app.  After taking a photo, I click the power button to turn the phone off.\n\nBut still, I occasionally will hear the phone being active in my pocket and dialing stuff.\n\nAny ideas why this might be happening and how to fix?\n\nPhone is up-to-date with latest monthly fix download.\n\n-----------------\nThis is an example of my phone somehow becoming active inmy pocket on the lockscreen and trying to type my pin.

The volume decreases and sounds terrible.\n\nSo I go to the 'user' setting and increase the graphics higher to increase sound levels.  It does the total opposite and makes the volume even quieter as if there's a major limiter on the EQ's\n\nNow in my experience when adjusting EQ's, like the Bass, Mid & Trebles, they get louder, just like on DJ Decks. \n\nWhy does the EQ on the phone decrease sound quality and make it sound appalling?\n\nI even downloaded another App and used the EQ settings on that App (had the option to use the app EQ or the phones EQ) and still had the same issue when using both.\n\nAnd I've turned off Absolute Volume which has done sweet F.A. so that's re-enabled. \n\nAny reason why I cannot enjoy music how I want it.  And I'd also like to try and increase the volume too but that sounds limited too. \n\nI can only assume devices now have limiters for health and safety reasons (not like the old days where an MP3 player was actually deafening)\n\nAny idea's how I this can be improved.\n\nI'm also getting the same issue when using Bluetooth in the car with the EQ on and on Soundbars.  Basically anything that connects Bluetooth.\n\nI can't check it out with a jack cable as I don't have the adapter any more as it broke after 5 days of using it.\n\nThank you",

The only way to access the app menu is to swipe up in the middle of the screen from the home screen.\n\nI am also unable to switch between apps by swiping along the bottom of screen.Changing this to 2 button or 3 button does not fix this: the home button simply does not work, but the back and forward buttons do.\n\nAdditionally, the top menu has changed: I used to be able to swipe down, then swipe down again to access an extended menu of options. I can only swipe down once now to toggle wifi, bluetooth, etc., but I can not change the icons that were in this menu like I used to be able to.\n\nDigital Wellbeing has disappeared from my settings.\n\nLastly, dark mode switched off. I can switch it back on, but the setting changed. Previously, my phone remained in dark mode after restart, but now it switches to light mode every restart.\n\nThese are the changes I have noticed so far, but many of my settings, app info, etc. remains intact, making me think it wasn't a factory reset. I am up to date running Android version 10.\n\nCan someone please assist with this? The changes to navigation are severely inhibiting my ability to use the phone. Thanks!",

When I downloaded the app on this device and tried to use the headset, the audio plays through the phone speakers and the headset is unusable. I tried a wired mic headset and then a pair of earbuds and the audio played through the headset but only the phone's mic was picking up my speaking. Could anyone offer support as to why this happened?",

    "content": "I have multiple bluetooth devices in my home for playing music. When I turn on my bluetooth I will manually connect it to the device I want to play music with. But, then my phone will begin to autoconnect to every other bluetooth device in my home which creates numerous issues. Sometimes the music will start playing in the room I am not in. Sometimes it will pause my music. Sometimes it makes it so that my music will not play through any of the multiple devices my phone is connected to. Then, when I manually disconnect every other bluetooth device in my home my phone instantly begins trying to reconnect to those devices repeating the same cycle of bluetooth issues. Am I missing something? How do you manually disconnect a device and prevent it from reconnecting? I'm confused why there is a disconnect button if it doesn't work because the device will reconnect. I do not want to \"forget\" devices because then I have to reconnect a device every single time I want to use it. Is there some way to disable auto connect or is this just a bug?",

The phone itself can advertise with LE Coded on both primary and secondary channels, I don't understand why it won't scan when it's LE Coded on the primary.\n\nOther phones like the One Plus 6 and Samsung S10+ seem to be fine with scanning LE Coded on both primary and secondary channels.\n\n0. Am I doing something wrong? Is there something I can do to force it to scan LE Coded on the primary channel?\n1. Is this the case with all Pixel phones that support LE Coded PHY? I'll have to avoid them if that's the case.\n2. Is this a hardware limitation by the Bluetooth chip?\n3.

Was told to take the phone to UBreakIFix for diagnosis and repairs. Was not expecting a lot of resistance given how widespread the issue was and the lawsuit that followed.\n\nSpent several weeks going to multiple repair locations. Each told me the motherboard needed to fix the problem was no longer available, that Google destroyed the tooling needed to make more parts, and that repairs for all Pixel 1 and 2 devices were no longer available aside from screens. \n\nSpoke again to overseas-based support. Was then essentially told \"Too bad, so sad, you're out of warranty.\" They of course are unaware of the manufacturing defect and class action. I bought the phone through an authorized reseller, and now have a bunch of money in a device that I can't use as a phone unless on Bluetooth or speaker. Assistant works about a third of the time. This is my 6th Nexus or Pixel device, and I pay for Google One storage for what that's worth. \n\nI basically got 15 months of use from this phone because of a defect I didn't cause. I don't care about settlement money, I just want the phone I bought to work. This is round 2 for me after my Nexus 5x developed the charging port issue and required replacement.

    "content": "When using bluetooth on my Pixel 3XL (Android 10) I don't receive Google Messages sound notifications through the phone speaker (but ringtones do come through the phone speaker). The sound notifications for Google Messages come through my headset. The issue is, I don't wear my headset unless I'm on a call. Is there a setting I'm not finding to turn on Google Messages notifications so they can be heard through the phone speaker, so I don't miss notifications when I'm not wearing the headset?",

I know Google created some kind of patch to lessen a \"vibration\" issue people claimed to have but the speakers within the phone have a much lesser output as well. This is disappointing.\n\nAnd let me save you some time, no it's not network settings. It's not the connected device, yes the volume is up at 100% on the phone, yes certain settings have been reset, yes the phone has been tested in safe mode, etc...\n\nI'd like to see how widespread this issue is without the post getting shut down like others complaining of the same issue.",

What is going on?\n\nFor reference, same procedure above using an Xperia XZ2 running Pie and latest Android Auto works perfectly fine - hears commands and plays on car speakers set to bluetooth media.\n\nI have tested Android Auto on the Pixel 3XL on other bluetooth headsets and voice commands work fine, though audio comes through in much poorer quality than the music - maybe that's the age of my bluetooth speakers? Or Pixel 3XL Android Auto is using some other profile?\n\nSo the Pixel 3 is doing something strange via bluetooth and android auto.  Another thread pointed to being able to turn off HD for certain connections in Oreo, but those options aren't in Pie anymore.\n\nJust using the Google Assistant normally via bluetooth outside Android Auto is a bit buggy - it takes two squeezes to get it to listen to me, but when it does hear me it responds via the car speakers.\n\nWhat is going on?\n\nI am not an expert in Bluetooth profiles, but it feels like once you say OK Google it is switching to handsfree profile but the car mic is not active.  These are older bluetooth head units that have separate phone and media profiles.\n\nHow come Sony has figured this out?\n\nIs there an app that lets me control individual bluetooth pairing audio quality?",

This happens most of the time when I unlock my device with my headset on.\n\nThis is not influenced by other apps open on the device, as it still occurs when all other apps are closed. It still occurs when the device is started in safe mode. From what others have said, it still occurs with other Bluetooth headsets and others/myself have demonstrated that this does not occur using the same headset on other devices. This is absolutely an issue with the Google Pixel 3a and probably the 3 and 3XL as well.\n\nA temporary fix would be nice (for my safety and the safety of others), but there really should be a permanent update to address this issue.

I sit in my car a lot in parking lots working and sometimes I try to load an IG story or FB story. Or even play a YouTube video. When I do this it will play about 1 second of the audio then go mute. The display screen on my Jetta is still showing Spotify. I have tried closing Spotify, force stopping it, disconnecting my Bluetooth etc. I have also tried this in my Audi Q5 and have the same issue. I did not have this issue with my Galaxy S9+. Basically it doesn't switch audio between apps. Even has issues with SoundCloud and Bandcamp. Not sure what to do but I'm certain it's an issue with my Pixel 4",

This goes counter to the regulations here in Canada. However, Telus is stating to me that Google provided the phone with restricted functionality. So... is Google DELIBERATELY limiting users of UNLOCKED Pixel 3 phones with access to eSIM functionality?\n\nWho can shed light on this?\n\nThank you.\n\nPS  I have already contacted Pixel support from Google on this matter and they indicated that they did not have information on this but that this forum is the sole manner to escalate this to appropriate experts in Google...",

Spotify said the podcast was still playing as normal, but no sound would play. I reset the phone again and it seemed to fix the problem, but again after 2 minutes of listening to the podcast the same thing happened: a loud pop followed by complete silence. \n\nThe issue is not with the headphones, because I tried switching them out with another pair and it still made the same pop before it stopped working. The issue is not with Spotify, because I have tested this with other apps like Audible and Youtube and the same thing happens. This morning I tried factory resetting the phone but it still isn't working properly. I have tried cleaning the headphone jack with compressed air and contact cleaner but neither has fixed it. Is there anything else I can try or is the headphone jack just plain broken?

I have tried using both 2.4 and 5GHz bands and factory resetting both the phone and system on the car. I have also tried resetting the network settings on the Pixel 3. It is not possible to switch security off as the car forces security to connect.\n\nThe car is able to connect to the internet over an iphone hotspot and my home internet wifi without any issues?\n\nOther devices are able to connect to the internet over the Pixel 3 hotspot with the same configuration.\n\nInternet connection over bluetooth does not appear to work either.\n\nAny ideas? Possible DNS request refusal issue?\n\nThanks",

At the time I was connected to my bluetooth headphones, and my phone kept changing songs on its own every few seconds.

This has happened to me before as I described on: https://productforums.google.com/forum/?utm_medium=email&utm_source=footer#!msg/phone-by-google/bZ1iPiz8DKY/42RpCb8ZDgAJ\n\nBut this time, doing the same things I did then aren't making any difference. I can get into recovery menu/fastboot mode by holding volume up + power. But even going to recovery mode can't be accomplished as I'll be greeted by Google logo and that's when phone will just start restarting over and over again.\n\nI've tried flashing official factory images while in fastboot mode, but without any success as my bootloader is locked. I also attempted to unlock my bootloader with \"fastboot flashing unlock_critical\" and \"fastboot oem unlock\" but to no avail.\n\nIn contact with Google Support via Twitter I was told that I can request a call back on https://support.google.com/pixelphone/contact/community?hl=en but unfortunately I can't do this as I live in Netherlands and Google Pixel 2 XL is not being sold here. Hence I'm left without Google Support with a phone which is completely bricked.\n\nAny suggestions on how I could resolve this problem are most welcome.",

    "title": "Pixel Stand not appearing in Connected Devices on Pixel 3a",
    "content": "I'm trying to connect my Pixel Stand to my Pixel 3a. The thing is, the stand doesn't appear in the list of Connected Devices when I place the phone on it. I put it on without a case. I've tried rotating the phone. Making sure it's balanced. The whole bit as the community suggests. Bluetooth is definitely on; it's connected to my smartwatch and whenever I use my ear buds.\n\nI restarted the phone, even while it sits on the stand. I have only used the equipment that came with the stand. I bought the stand and phone within the past week, so I haven't had much time to do anything to the phone, in my opinion, that could alter (somehow!?) the compatibility with the stand.\n\nMaybe I just have a defective stand. The outlet that I use works fine with anything else I plug into it.\n\nLet's see...what else...oh, right. I made it so nothing else is connected to my phone via bluetooth. Stand still doesn't show up. That's my whole thing: The stand doesn't appear, so I can't even tell you if the phone will charge or not. It doesn't charge, for what it's worth. I would have been cool if the phone didn't \"see\" the stand, but still responded by charging. But, nothing.\n\nLike I said, I just bought the stand, so it won't be a problem returning it. But, I wanted to ask to see if I missed something before I give up.\n\nThanks!",

But this message will keep popping up roughly every 5 seconds until I reset my phone. It will happen randomly sometimes when no apps are open. If I don't click the error message box more boxes will just keep appearing on top. The other issue is then sometimes when I reset the phone it will sometimes take over an hour to come back on.\nThe WiFi issue I am having is where It will lose connection to the WiFi and will no longer be able to find any networks. Even if there are several about on other devices. When I then click on the WiFi to turn it off and then back on it doesn't come back on but just flicks back off. Again the only way to resolve this is by restarting the phone. When I do this all networks are then available again and work perfectly fine for a day or so.\nI have had my phone into the EE repair shop but the issue didn't happen when they were looking at it (it's an intermittent issue) so they sent it back. I have since been back to EE and they suggested speaking to Google direct. I have since taken a video and screen shot of the issues. I will attach the picture.\n\nPhil",

The 1 exception I have found so far is my Ubuntu (18.04)home automation pc(Intel Nuc).  It pairs and connects just fine with it. File transfers work fine in both connections.\n\nRight now the Pixel can't connect more than 1 second to my Nexus 5x, Moto X4 or the Chromebook.\nI believe this is just a software issue, otherwise why would it connect to Ubuntu yet not any of my Google devices?\n\nOne thing I noticed and it might be related : The Pixel accepts Ubuntu as a trusted device but not the chromebook because it can't make the connection.\n\nThanks.",

    "title": "Pixel 3a Bluetooth Audio Problem With Car",
    "content": "My Pixel 3a will stop playing audio in my two Mazda cars with Google Play Music if I leave the car and return in greater than 4 hours, possibly less. It has consistently failed to play audio under those circumstances even though everything works fine if I leave the car for shorter periods of time. The music will then pick up right where it left off from with audio. With longer periods of time the track will show but with no sound. I can change the track on the car system and the phone will reflect the change but again with no sound. I can pause the music and that will also be communicated to the phone as well or vice versa. In other words the phone and the car are connected via bluetooth for everything but audio. This didn't occur with my older Samsung S7 Edge over a five year period with one of my Mazda cars and a 3 year period with another one.\n\nIf I restart the phone the audio will come back. If I force stop the bluetooth system app and hit play again the audio will start but will have drop outs and be of lower quality until I stop and restart bluetooth again. Clearing the cache and data from the music app does not fix the audio.\n\nI have discussed this with Google support and am running the Pixel 3a in safe mode and will check tomorrow to see it the audio works when I restart my car. This might indicate a 3rd party app may be responsible for the problem. Beyond that, I would have to do a factory reset again and have diagnostic work done at an Ifixit store (hardware?).\n\nI am not confident that Mazda would be of much help and doubt the cars are a problem based on my past history with my Samsung phone. I have spent a lot of time isolating this problem and determining the \"fix\" (restart or force stop bluetooth). I have also rebooted the firmware in both cars and could possibly call Mazda and also check for firmware updates for my cars but this as well as using the older Samsung phone are unlikely or impractical solutions as I don't want to keep using an older phone. By the way, I have also unpaired and re paired both cars with the Pixel 3a.\n\nI know having a Pixel 3a and the Mazda cars narrows my chance of someone else having the same problem with the same equipment. I'm hoping someone else has also experienced this problem with either the same or another combination of equipment. So far, I have not found anyone else on this forum with the same problem.",

    "content": "I set up the wifi hotspot on the Pixel 3 to connect my laptop and other devices to the internet through my phone. I had a different Android before the Pixel 3 and did the same thing. When I sit on the train and move through areas with lots of other wifi networks/hotspots, which I will see, because the Pixel 3 will offer to connect to them, the Pixel 3 will change frequencies five six times a minute even between channels from the 5Ghz and 2.4Ghz band. \n\nMy laptop will still show the connection, but the ping to the phone's IP (gateway) will fail. My other device behaves different. It will detect that the connection has failed and cease to show the wifi connected logo in the upper right corner, but none the less lose connection to the internet and have to be manually reconnected. \n\nThis did not happen previously on the same train that I use to commute every day, when using my previous phone.\n\nThere might be other reasons for the loss of connection besides the Pixel quickly changing frequencies. This is only my suspicion, since the connection loss happens when I sit on the train and the train moves through the inner city. And because I see all the channel switches in my log files of my laptop.\n\nI tried changing the preferred frequency. I usually have it set to 5 Ghz preferred, but the Pixel phone will most often still choose 2.4 Ghz. \n\nI also disabled bluetooth and wifi on the phone as well as the Google assisted location service (uses wifi) and wifi and bluetooth location search for apps. All of that does not help. \n\nI would love to force the Pixel to stop changing frequencies or manually set the frequency for the hotspot, but have not found a way to do that. Do you know how to enable that or do you have any other idea? My current workaround is to toggle flight mode on the laptop to reconnect about once a minute.",

    "content": "I have been experiencing this issue with WhatsApp and my Pixel 3 XL device ever since I got it.\nWhen my phone is connected to my car's Bluetooth, and music is playing (from either google play music app or other music apps on my phone) and I want to listen to a voicenote (VN) or video in WhatsApp, when I tap play on the VN, it reduces the volume of the music and plays the VN alongside the music, but I usually can't hear the VN clearly, so I go ahead and pause the music (it makes no difference whether I pause the music from the phone directly or from the car's display) and then go back to WhatsApp and try play the VN again, but a second later it starts playing the music again together with the VN. Back to square one; I can't hear the VN over the music. This keeps happening; I pause the music, restart the VN, but the music starts again too. Even if I force close the whole music app, it often reloads it automatically and starts playing music again, just by tapping play on the VN. This is really annoying and not practical to do, especially when driving (my phone is mounted, I can easily hit the play button on a VN when it comes in without getting distracted from the road, but the go through the whole ordeal just to listen to a VN is not practical while driving).\nHow can we get the music to automatically pause when a VN or video is played in WhatsApp? or at the very least, if I have to manually pause the music, how can we get it to stop automatically playing again when the VN is played?",

    "title": "Google Pixel (all models) Have Very Bad Car Bluetooth Interactivity.",
    "content": "So for quite some time now I've noticed that every car I've driven has never offered me the full range of music playing options on the infotainment screens in the cars. At first, I thought that maybe it was just the cars I was driving at the time not being too great with Bluetooth on Android devices (iPhones seemed to always have this feature in my cars and it made me jealous of my friends a little from time to time). \n\nHowever, 3-4 cars down the line I find myself still stuck with this problem of only having the options of \"Next Song\", \"Previous Song\", \"Pause / Play\", and that's it. I thought the problem would then be that I was using Spotify instead of the phone's built-in music players; so I have switched from Spotify to Google Play Music as I currently use a Pixel 2 XL. This also hasn't fixed the issue though as I am still only given the same options. \n\nBut when two of my friends got in my car I let them connect their phones to cars to play music and oddly enough, they had a lot more features than I ever have with any of my Google phones. Both of my friends were able to shuffle, repeat, browse playlist and queue, and also select other playlists entirely. Those friends have a Samsung and an iPhone, meaning both Android and Apple devices are capable of the technology. It just seems that while I am very impressed with my Google phone so far, they are also very basic in terms of quality of life aspects. \n\nI'm here to ask if anyone knows any workarounds or ways to improve the features that a Pixel gives off as a media player when connected through Bluetooth? \n\nCheers.",

Seems to be a common issue yet no one seems to have an answer most posts go unanswered like this one https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/13585244?hl=en\n\nLast night my phone worked fine. All sounds play. No issues. \n\nThis morning I've noticed no sound from Spotify, YouTube, Instagram or any app for that matter. \n\nWhat is interesting is my phone ringtone plays, and my alarms work. Interestingly my alarm pulls from Spotify. This works fine. \n\nI had my partner call me, I couldn't hear her, but she could hear me fine. \n\nSo what we know is:\n1. No sound from any app (will play using external speakers/headphones)\n2. No message alerts\n3. No system sounds\n4. Sounds from alarms(pulling from Spotify) and ringer \n\nI've tried clearing cache and data from the apps, installing most recent updates, tried restarting phone. And general fiddling with settings. \n\nI have also tried factory reset which did not fix the issue either. \n\nAnyone got any ideas for how I can fix this frustrating issue. \n\nThanks in advance\n\nEdit history:\nEdit 1: I have factory reset the device and the problem persists. \n\nEdit 2: No apps(Spotify, YouTube etc) work with Bluetooth headphones, only wired. Can play music through WiFi speakers no problem.",

I have a 2006 Golf so no Bluetooth capabilities, however I have got a relatively new radio in there. With my iPhone I used to have an official endorsed Apple charger and it would connect from the phone to the radio via usb and charge whilst playing.\n\nWith the Pixel I have tried a couple of chargers (USB-A to USB-C) in order to replicate this but to no avail. Instead I am using an old fashioned AUX cable to create the link.\n\nMy question is this; if I purchase the official Google cable (https://store.google.com/product/usb_c_usb_a_2) what are the chances that it would work? I can't think what would be different that would allow this to work (however it did with the iPhone; unbranded chargers did not work) but I don't want to waste \u00a320 for no reason.\n\nAny help or advice would be welcomed. The radio in the car is a Kenwood KDC-210UI. Interestingly, if I click the 'Android' option via my car stereo, it will pick up random podcasts from the Google Play app, but nothing from Spotify.",

    "content": "Hi\n\nthis question isn't related to Pixel Phone however I hope someone can help me anyway. I am interested in purchasing the Pixel Buds just for the sake of listening to music from my Samsung Gear Sport (Tizen OS) smartwatch. I don't care about any of the bud's special features. I think Bluetooth-wise there shouldn't be a problem since my watch and the buds are 4.2 compatible (AFAIK) however I am worried because my smartwatch runs Tizen and Google states that the buds can only be used with iOS or Android devices.\nCan someone verify that the buds can be used as plain headphones with non iOS - and Android devices?\n\nThanks in advance",

The volume controls and Google Assistant constantly go activate or pop up. \n\nThe Volume constantly self adjusts itself lowering itself to 0% for both media and call volume, the Google assistant constantly pops up without being prompted in any way I can tell. I've deactivated voice, squeeze and headset function from the Assistant Options. Even went as far as just turning Google assistant off on the Pixel. Though that hasn't stopped it from popping up and telling me constantly that Google Assistant can help me. \n\nI tried a volume controller app, that allowed me to lock the volumes in place. However, it still pops the volume menu screen open and attempts to adjust the volume. Although the app prevents the volume from adjusting it does cause any audio I am listening to, to be interrupted. \n\nI've tried removing all third-party apps from my phone,  the problem still persisted. I tried operating in safe mode, and while that prevented the problem. It didn't answer the question of what the issue is, only that it's likely some app causing the problem. \n\nI performed a Factory Reset, and even without any third-party apps downloaded at all. The problem still persisted. I don't know what else to do, Android is updated to the latest patch possible. The only apps on my phone are the ones that come stock with Pixel. And no matter what headset be it wireless or wired. It all leads to the same issue.\n\nAnyone have any ideas on how to help ?",

    "content": "Since the update to 10, almost everytime I connect to my Pioneer head unit with Android auto or Bluetooth, i am having one or more of the below issues. \n\nTroubleshooting so far....\nI have deleted all phone profiles on the pioneer and \"forgot\" device connections for the pioneer in my Pixel and re-established the connections. I have completely reset the pioneer back to factory settings.  I have looked and there are no software and firmware updates for the pioneer.  All the issues still happen.\n\nConnection problems...\n1. My phone connects to the pioneer - then i see a message on the pioneer- \"your device will be disconnected\" - i have two options, \"cancel\" or \"continue\". It doesn't matter which i choose, nothing seems to happen and the phone stays connected.\n\n2. \"Connection Failed\" - my phone will not connect at all, not to bluetooth not to Android auto. But my Pixel shows connections to the pioneer via Bluetooth and WiFi. A reboot of the phone is the only fix i have found this far.\n\n3. Android Auto crashes over and over. Again, a reboot of the phone fixes the issue usually.\n\n4. Android Auto only comes up on my Pixel 3XL and will not connect to the pioneer. I usually turn off WiFi and Bluetooth and thay fixes it sometimes or Android Auto will start crashing. Then A reboot of my phone is required.\n\n5. Trying to connect to bluetooth only I get the message \"Connection Failed\".\n\n6. Dark Mode turns off, and stays off OR dark Mode may turn back on when Android Auto does connect to the Head Unit.\n\nAny help would be appreciated.",

I haven't had this particular issue for a while, and it is most definitely a serious security bug.\n\nToday, I actually had to use my phone in the car (starting a playlist).

    "content": "TL;DR: Phone displays permission request dialog and auto selects an option. I need to manually select these options instead of having them auto selected.\n\nHello all!\n\nIn using my pixel 3a, I have noticed that it will automatically select options in dialog boxes for me. For example, when an app will ask for access or permissions, the phone will select an option without me touching the screen. This happens with almost every pop-up box of that nature. (\"use this app just once or always\" is not affected by this). Also, if the app requests multiple permissions, only the first will be auto-selected.\n\nI've been fine to live with the issue until now, but last night I needed to connect my phone to my laptop with bluetooth, but the phone was autoselecting the \"cancel\" option, and I couldn't tap \"connect\" fast enough. (the permission screen will display for a fraction of a second before an option is selected, so I know it appears but I cannot do anything about it). I assumed it was a setting I enabled when I set up the phone, so I reset all my app settings/permissions, but this has done nothing to help the problem.\n\nI'm generally a pretty tech-savvy person, but this has me clueless. Any ideas, tips, anything would be very helpful. Thanks in advance!\n\n~Andy",

It just goes back to playing what was already playing before the command. \n\nIt will only work if I pick up the phone and turn on the screen. \n\nUntil recently it worked like a charm. \n\nAny ideas? \n\nMike \ud83d\ude0a",

    "title": "Alarm sounds at minimum volume despite maximum volume setting. Rebooting fixes it. Why?",
    "content": "Twice in the last week or so my Pixel 2 alarm has gone off at minimum volume instead of maximum volume (the settings do show maximum volume).  The phone's display shows the alarm is going off but the phone only vibrates a little and emits a very soft beep-beep occasionally.  The first time it happened was for my morning wake-up and Do Not Disturb was set but Settings > Do Not Disturb > Sound & vibration showed \"Muted, but allow alarms and touch sounds\".  I believe I tried setting other alarms and got the same behavior until I rebooted, which restored normal behavior.\n\nIt happened again just a few minutes ago for a 10:30pm alarm.  DnD was not on.  Again I heard only a soft beep-beep periodically along with the alarm playing at minimum volume.  I snoozed the alarm for 10 minutes.  I set another alarm for 10:38 and got the same behavior when it went off--a soft beep-beep and the alarm at minimum volume.  I rebooted the phone.  It was back up by 10:39 and when 10:40 came, the alarm properly sounded.\n\nBluetooth was not on for either of the failures.\n\nAn $800 phone with a manufacturers alarm that doesn't work is pretty disappointing.  My $100 Sanyo Incognito feature phone alarm never, repeat never, failed me in eight years. I guess I need to get it out as a backup.\n\nI've submitted essentially the same info via the Clock app's \"Send Feedback\".\n\nI'm up to date on updates.  Build PQ3A.190801.002.",

    "content": "The USB-C port of my Pixel 2 is very loose - the charger (or headphones via USB-C adapter) barely connect. I have tried 2 official Google Pixel charges, third-party chargers, and Lenovo laptop chargers, but only 1 charger does work, but only have 10 minutes of fiddling and it's very sensitive: touching it once and the connection is lost. Impact:\nNo charging in the car, or connecting the car (as that is vertical)\nExtremely difficult to charge and only with 1 specific charger\nOnly able to use bluetooth headphones\n\nI have tried multiple chargers and cleaning the port (e.g., used the air spray in a can to try to clean it). Dirt seems not to be the issue - I believe it's a hardware problem thus within warranty.\n\nThe problem lies in contacting Google Support: I purchased the Pixel 2 whilst I was still living in the UK, directly via the UK Google Store. I am living in the Netherlands now where the Pixel 2 is not sold in the Google Store. I don't know how to contact Google, I tried:\nVia my Pixel 2, via Settings > Support. There is only a call back option. I have typed a message 3 times now, but not called back (first try was several weeks ago)\nI looked online to any contact possibilities but found none\nI found a phone number of Google Support in the Netherlands (https://support.google.com/store/answer/6178715#contact=1), but the number is invalid and not working\n\nMy question is: How do I contact Google Support to help me with my Pixel 2 issue?\n\nThank you,\nRemco",

I've rebooted the phone multiple times as well. Any assistance would be appreciated.\n\nThanks in advance.",

    "content": "Loyal Google customer since the Nexus 5. \n\nI bought a brand new pixel 3 from Google directly, a few months ago. Since I received it, the thing gets unbearable hot when charging and turns off from over heating. I've dealt with it since I don't use my phone excessively. I don't own many electronics at all, that's why springing for the newest model phone as a birthday present for my self was such a big deal. All of a sudden last week, it stopped detecting my blue tooth devices. \n\nI contacted Google because I had tried everything short of a factory reset and was hoping I wouldn't have too. First I tried the chat. The guy would not help me at all, he stated it was \"required\" for me to provide a picture of my phone. He would not accept the answer \"I can't take a picture of my phone with my phone and it's my only camera \" in fact he just kept repeating himself. I tried calling two separate customer service numbers and both times I was met with the same roadblock. I'm at the point where I'm not willing to jump through hoops.  When I asked to speak to their supervisors, I kid you not, he said \"I would need a picture of the phone to escalate this to a supervisor. Eventually one guy helped me with my Bluetooth connection, had no idea how to fix it and suggested a factory reset, the thing I was trying to avoid. After also not helping me with the over heating problem, he had the audacity to say, \"well, we at least fixed one of your issues, correct?\" They wouldn't even consider looking into my the heating issue. The worse part, I backed my phone and pictures properly, I know I did, and yet the factory reset didn't back up anything that was saved on my phone. I am a rock climber and lost hundreds of dollars of pictures and videos I can't get back. I backed up my phone and each individual picture album. And yet even my messages app has no messages in it from the last two days. This is absurd. The phone came brand new and barely fuctional, yet Google doesn't seem to give a crap. \n\nSince when did Google stop caring about us? I've been a loyal customer since the Nexus 5 and Google fi customer since it's inception. \n\nIt seemed to happen around the time they removed the credo \"do no evil\" and started taking on govt  military contracts. \n\nAt this point, I will not spend another dime on a Google phone. Not worth my money. Now I have a 900 dollar brick. I've never been more upset at customer service in my life.",

I can switch it on, it'll try turning on and then automatically switches off.\n\nIt's been updated to the latest software update and it was working before and after the update. I cleared the cache, I've forced stop the bluetooth and restarted like a Google rep has instructed me. I finally factory reset the phone and it's still not working.\n\nHas anyone else gone through this or seen an issue like this?",

    "content": "I connected my Pixel 3A XL to Google Home via bluetooth and played a radio station. I then had to pause music to take a phone call (approximately 15 minutes). Due to this inactivity, the bluetooth connection was lost, and the phone cannot connect to Google Home anymore via bluetooth. I am now casting my phone to Google Home. The problem with casting is that the volume is low compared to bluetooth. If I want to use bluetooth again, I will have to reboot my Google Home.\n\nSecond annoying thing about Pixel 3A XL is that it does not readily remember all my bluetooth connection, but adds an additional step about the devices with whom I connected my phone. An irritating feature compared to Nexus 6P\n\nThe reason I use bluetooth connection instead of casting is because until Tuesday, i was using my Nexus 6P to listen to music over Google Home. When I was casting Nexus 6P to Google HOme, it kept on disconnecting, and I had to use the bluetooth.",

I am worried since I can't upgrade for a while yet and need my Pixel 1 to keep working fine for a while.\n\nSteps I've taken:\n\n1- Remove and reinstall Fitbit App. \n2- Remove both the Versa and Media button from Bluetooth\n3- Reset Bluetooth and Wifi settings\n4- Wipe phone through factory reset settings\n5- Wipe phone and flash latest factory image via adb\n\nCurrently, my Pixel 1 is on the latest official build but these two Bluetooth LE devices still do not work.",

However, it seems that the similar static issues are making a comeback.\n\nI've already tried deleting my Bluetooth devices from the Pixel and repeating the setup process, as well as just restarting the phone, but it ends up only being fixed on several occasions.\n\nI'm wondering if anyone else with the first gen Pixels are experiencing the same issue.",

Nearly every day, I have a minor issue that requires me to turn off or re-pair or start/ stop a music service to get the pairing to work again.  I can live with that;  however, once a week, a more major problem happens and it ends up taking me 8+ attempts and sometimes waiting 1-2 days to get it sorted out.  During these more major episodes, I end up doing everything posted in the forums, including removing the pairing from the phone and the Bose app to start from scratch.  Often, my phone will see the headphones, attempts to pair, and then fails.  Note that I also posted an issue today with the Bluetooth to my 2011 BMW 3 Series.  I am starting to feel like the common problem is the phone.",

However, ever 30 seconds the entire stereo unit shuts down and restarts, turns back on, reconnects to the phone and 30 seconds later shuts down again. This process just repeats and repeats itself. It only resolves when the Pixel is disconnected from the Bluetooth. I have explored faults with the stereo, but the stereo connects to Iphone and other android phones with no probems, VW have been unable to find any problems also. \n\nThis is leading me to believe its a compatibility issue between the Pixel and stereo, but why? I have never had issues with the pixel and other car stereos. \n\nI have also tried turning off NFC as this was advised but still no joy. \n\nHas anyone got any ideas/help ?",

Not sure if the first time was shortly after an update or not, but my phone updated a couple of days ago and had been running okay. Both times it has happen in the middle of the night. The first time I just happen to wake up and noticed it was dead and stayed up to reset everything. This morning I woke up way late due to my phone has always been my alarm clock for over 10 years now, only to find it did it again and had to do a factory reset. Had to wait 7-10 minutes to go through the initial setup to even text my boss letting him know that I'm going to be late. Very frustrating and now I'm not sure if I can trust it anymore. I've used Google products for a long time, but lately I'm just not sure of the reliability of the products now. I have constant problems with my Chromecast Ultra too. Now I'll lose about an hour of my time installing apps, setting them up, reconnecting to Bluetooth devices (listening to actual radio on my way in to work was frustrating :-P), setting up additional email clients, and etc...

But no sound will come from the headphones.  \n\nThe easiest way to fix the problem is to go to the sound menu and change the \"play media to\" option to \"device\" (at which point I will hear the sound come from the Pixel as if it had kept on playing) and then change it \"play media to\" back to my headphones.  Then things will work perfectly.  \n\nBut if I do something as innocuous as skip to the next track, the problem re-occurs.   This does not happen when I connect the headphones to my PC or my tev.

These things are not put under any extra strain of any kind, just in my jacket pocket connected to my phone and headphones. But literally I have them for about a week and they just stop functioning. \n\nThe first one stopped gradually (this was also the second one I had used as the one that came with my Pixel 2 failed pretty quickly too) and I noticed the connection was loose so I initially just thought it was coming loose in my pocket. But sure enough it failed entirely after a few days. And the next one I bought just stopped dead after a few days of use. \n\nThings to note: PLEASE READ THIS!\n\nThere is no debris or anything compacted in the port. I have had this problem before with other phones and this was one of the first things I checked. I check and clean this port as necessary fairly regularly.\nThe pair of headphones being connected are just a pair of ear-buds with a mic that I bought from Amazon. I've had them since I owned my last phone and had no issues with them before this. \nI have not used any other USB-C adapters other than the Google ones\nNothing else that connects via the USB-C port fails this quickly. Ive been using the cable that came with the phone since I got it and a couple of other USB-C cables and none of them just fail like this.\n\nWhat can I do about this? I cant afford to keep buying these adapters or a pair of bluetooth headphones at this time.",

Let's put it this way they have a key to my front door and I'm the only one should have one. \nHELP PLEASE",

When I try to change it to speakerphone, it will let me click it, but it won't change. I have done a factory reset on my watch, which didn't work. I also deleted and then re-downloaded the phone app on Google, with the help from another person on your support team. There was one instance where I turned on a Bluetooth speaker, while simultaneously on the phone and it connected to my watch. That switched the call's audio output to my speaker, and then I was able to change it to speakerphone. Also, today I was clicking & un-clicking the mute button while on a call. On the phone, it would show that it was changing back and forth from the phone earpiece to speakerphone, but it never actually switched from the phone's earpiece. Just a few minutes ago, I filled out a form to get a call from Google for support. They called back immediately and were in the process of connecting me with someone on the Pixel team to help. After waiting about 2 minutes, the call suddenly dropped. I really want to like this phone, but it has been a beyond frustrating experience.",

I went and bought a USB C to HDMI cable... Seems that's been axed as well. I don't have home internet just phone data for at least the next 4 months while my area is undergoing upgrade works and I really want to cast to any of my TVs . I have a Chromecast that use to be connected to internet when I had it. A DVD and tv with older smart tv capabilities (Mira cast lg tv from about 3 years ago) and was considering a small smart tv with inbuilt Bluetooth and Chromecast but pretty sure neither will work",

When I am watching videos on YouTube and music streaming on my Bluetooth earphones, the problem I am seeing is bluetooth connectivity completely dropping in and out, or glitching for a few seconds, and reconnect after a while. Also the audio keeps skipping and lagging which makes it completely inaudible. The phone is typically in my arm, or in my pocket, just below the headphones bluetooth receiver (so very short distance, no blocking). I hope engineers at Google will fix this as soon as possible with a software update and help me and all the others who are having the same problem.

Galaxy wearables, Samsung UI etc all up to date.\nI have enabled developer options and disabled absolute volume over bluetooth but this has made zero difference. \n\nAnyone else experiencing similar problems?",

At least it is not Smart Lock that is asking for it but my phone when I turn on the screen.\nI have Smart Lock set up to use trusted devices, in other words if my galaxy watch is connected, it should stay unlocked. However it seems that doesn't stay unlocked at all and it is very frustrating.\n  I fully understand that after 4 hours of inactivity you have to use biometrics, and I am also aware that once every 24 hours you have to use biometrics. But what is happening is just so odd. It can ask for biometrics very randomly and sometimes with minutes between unlocks. Recently I started check my status bar to see if it shows bluetooth as connected to either my watch or my car, and it does.\n  I have had this issue with my S10 plus as well, and funny enough only on Android 10.

All they are are Bluetooth Speakers with a microphone for Karaoke where the microphone only works locally with the speakers, not transmit via Bluetooth to the phone. There are other \"Bluetooth\" microphones with an adapter for the phone, which is useless to me since the S20 has no adapter input. It was removed some phone versions ago. Having said that, is there a real Bluetooth Microphone that I can use to transmit my voice through the microphone, via Bluetooth, to my phone so that the audio on my phone recorded videos sound better?\nPlease note that I emphasize, I need the microphone to transmit to the phone via Bluetooth directly without any adapters. Just Bluetooth.\nEDIT: I don't need a headset either. The headsets with microphones seem to work well, but I don't want to wear a headset while creating my videos. I just need a Bluetooth Microphone.

I've been using these without any problems until yesterday. \n\nI plugged my phone into my laptop to transfer an audio recording but the laptop wouldn't hear anything. Since then, my headset microphone is incredibly sensitive and as a result, records any singing etc very loudly. I've tried with Bluetooth headset and the problem is the same. If I make a call using these, the volume is normal, if I try through an app that records, the mic is insanely sensitive. I did a factory reset and the problem persists. Why on earth is there no microphone volume or sensitivity option? Is driving me mad.

It's not noticeable at first, but when the song progresses, it makes little cracks, and it fast fowards the music like a second many times, and this is very annoying. It's doing this only with music apps playing from the memory, not from youtube and stuff...\nThe only \"fix\" i've found is to fast foward the music for 10 seconds, and then the playback goes normal until the music restarts...\nI did cleared the cache partition, and a factory reset from the recovery, i still have the problem on android 10. \n I'm desperate, what can i do ?\nThanks in advance ",

Since a month or so it's suddenly started to beep every two or three seconds when I'm listening to music on a Bluetooth device. I've googled this and found the usual answers, the headset is connecting, the connection is bad, batteries are low and so on. I've investigated all these common solutions to no avail.\nOnce the beeping starts I cannot get rid of it without rebooting the phone. I've even tried to change to another headset and as soon as I connect it the beeping resumes. And it doesn't matter which headset I use, after half an hour or so it starts. It will even start without playing on maximum volume.\nI lean towards something on my phone since it occurs on any headset; an app, a warning sound for listening to music too loud for too long or something like that. But I haven't found anything. I've uninstalled apps that I think could have anything to do with it, made sure the headset is charged and have a good connection. It happens at any location, so I'd think environmental disturbances to the Bluetooth radio is eliminated.\nMy wife who's has an S10 for some length of time doesn't have these issues.\nI always install the latest version when it arrives, so all software should be updated and good.\nThankful for any help I can get.

A couple of notable examples:\n* Voice Recorder - will normally play back recorded audio, but the recorded audio is ONLY being recorded through the phone's internal mic and not the connected Jabra 75 headset's speaker.\n* Whatsapp and Viber - as above. Only phone's internal mic is used whenever I record or communicate.\n  Most importantly, the Jabra 75 headset functions perfectly normally on my other devices (i.e. another phone and a Win 10 laptop) - as it has always done, with the headset mic recording normally whenever the headset is bluetooth paired. So it is definitely not the headset, nor is it a permanent problem on the Samsung S10 5G phone itself. This is what makes the issue so difficult to solve.\n  I've followed all of the steps here, and performed extensive Google-ing with no luck at all, hence am hoping someone from Samsung's team or one of the users on this site can help me out - please:\nhttps://www.samsung.com/us/support/troubleshooting/TSG01001249/\n  Cheers,\nMilo\n  **** UPDATE ****\nI've managed to get more information about this problem: \n  - The main apps causing the problem are WhatsApp and Viber, because they have the \"record audio clip\" functionality. I have confirmed through testing that during any Whatsapp/Viber active conversation, the headset microphone _does_ work normally. However, when recording an audio clip in either app, it does NOT. \n  - So I suspect that the issue is one of \"headset mic activation\" which does not occur in some cases, like the WhatsApp/Viber and Voice Recorder examples.\n  - Please help - all out of ideas now!\n     ",

Is anyone else getting this problem?\n Below are the details and configurations:\n Proximity sensor works when on a phone call (phone screen goes black)\nWhen AOD is active, if you cover the proximity sensor it does not blank the screen (like it did with my S8+ previously)\nAccidental Touch Protection is on (turning it off makes no difference)\nTouch Sensitivity is activated (as I am using a screen protector). Taking off the protector and turning off touch sensitivity makes no difference. \nLift to wake is on (turning it off makes no difference)\nDouble to tap to wake is on (turning it off makes no difference)\nSmart stay is on (turning it off makes no difference)\nI also have a Gear S3 watch which keeps the phone unlocked whilst in range of the Bluetooth (for my convenience) this is why the notifications open in my pocket and it doesn\u2019t prompt for fingerprint to unlock\nI've disabled \"Smart Relay\" within the Gear app as apparently this can cause issues with the S10, but you guessed it. That's not made any difference either.\nAny help would be appreciated.\n Thanks",

It's so hot that i feel it in my pocket. Sometimes after 20 minutes speaking on it it's so hot that i cannot put it on my face. I'm worried about this. The other strange thing is that i bought samsung car charger in order to charge my phone in my car. One morning after 20 minutes of driving some very scare alert notify me with sound and text that i should remove the charger because of moisture detected in usb port. This was firstly very unplesant because of the scariest sound when i'm focused on my driving and then because the phone never be touched by water or other liquids. From 2 weeks ago i'm loosing signal and cannot calling people by phone. I must restart the deviceand then i can connect. Also the Bluetoth connectivity sometimes is lost with my galaxy fit or Alpine car system.  I read about in US community about this problems and some of the people had returned their phone and replaced with new one. And on the new one no such a problems. I'm from Bulgaria and i wrote directly to Samsung Bulgaria and i'm waiting for their desision. I hope they will replace my phone but this is Bulgaria and nothing is right.

Plenty loud enough on full, but not enough (for me) to have to turn down from 100% (more on that at the bottom) certain on par with the packaged earphones which I found more then suitable.\n Controls: A bit lacking to be fair, bit that's mainly Aimed at the fact you can have EITHER volume controls OR ambient sound. Would like to have Ambient sound AND volume controls, but not possible. Which is a shame because on the odd occasion I would use it I can't as I have volume controls mapped to it. On top of this, the ambient sound option has you hold down the touchpad for as long as you need it. This makes you look like a Pillock and a knock off secret service agent. Would much prefer it as a toggle.\n Wear app: Decent options (well, all you need) but one pointer\n1. The equalizer MUST be orange, or its off. Took me a few minutes to realize why the sound was flat.\n Not much in the options to be fair, but not much I can think of missing\n All in all, very good. Decent sound, no wires, good connectivity, and hard wearing (as I found when I dropped them on concrete less then an hour after having them...) and no real complaints (apart from the adaptive sound annoyance I have) would I pay \u00a3130? Yeah probably. All in all, happy.\n One thing I do recommend is connect the buds, go to Bluetooth settings> advanced and turn off volume sync. This stops the buds volume controlling the phone volume. Turn the buds on max volume then the phone media volume. There, max volume. Without this the buds will be adjusting the phone volume without being on their own max volume.\n Sure others will jump in if anyone has any questions, fire away.",

    "content": "I purchased the Galaxy Note 9 on release day as I had been advised it would support the aptx HD Bluetooth streaming codec like the Galaxy S9/S9+.  As I had purchased a pair of Bowers + Wilkins PX wireless headphones at the beginning of the year I was looking forward to taking advantage of their aptx HD support with my Tidal subscription.  It transpires that none of these supposed \"flagship\" devices actually have this codec installed natively, although it is apparently possible to install it if you are willing to root the device, which I am not.  It seems ludicrous that a phone costing the best part of \u00a31000 would not be compatible with aptx HD.  Although the UK spec Note 9 has an Exynos processor it does not appear to be a processor limitation despite aptx HD being a Qualcomm product as the Note 9 does have standard aptx capabililities.  It is also capable of playing HiFi quality audio as it has support for both the LDAC and Samsung HD codecs.\n As it is not a hardware limitation and there is evidence that the codec can be installed with root access my question is will Samsung make this codec available in a software update (preferably before the inevitably delayed launch of Pie) or is there any other way to install it without invalidating my warranty?  I had the option of the Note 9 or the Huawei P20 Pro (which does natively support aptx HD) but prefer Samsung devices having owned a Note 2, Note 4, S7 Edge, several Samsung TVs and computer monitors & now the Note 9.  If i had known at the time that aptx HD was not available on the Note 9 I would have taken the P20 Pro.",

    "title": "[In-Depth Look #1] A Mobile Remote Control: The Galaxy Note9\u2019s Connected S Pen",
    "content": "Each new addition to the Note family introduces exciting capabilities to the smartphones\u2019 signature feature: the S Pen. Over the years, these refinements have unlocked innovative ways for users to communicate with others and streamline work, play and everything in between.\n  The Galaxy Note9\u2019s S Pen raises the bar with an array of convenient additions, including Bluetooth Low-Energy (BLE) connectivity, Samsung DeX compatibility, and integration with several fan-favorite Note features. Together, these enhancements offer much greater control over your mobile experience, making it easier to get the most out of everything you do.\n      Even Better with Bluetooth Low-Energy (BLE)\nThe S Pen has always been a boundary-pushing innovation, but adding BLE connectivity takes it to another level, literally expanding the boundaries within which you can use your S Pen to manage your device.\n  The S Pen\u2019s connectivity allows it to serve as an intuitive remote control for your Galaxy Note9 that lets you easily manage key functions, including the device\u2019s camera, from within 10 meters of the device. This means that when taking a selfie or a fun photo with friends, after launching the camera, rather than reaching for the shutter button (and possibly jeopardizing your carefully framed shot), you can instantly snap your pic with a click of the S Pen\u2019s button. A double-click will switch from the front to the rear camera, and vice versa.\n    Other apps that support the use of the S Pen as a remote control include the Gallery app and various presentation and media-player apps1. A simple click or double-click will allow you to play/pause a song, skip to the next track or video, or view the next/previous image in an album. You can even utilize the S Pen as a convenient clicker for presenting with the Galaxy Note9 and Samsung DeX. And with its open SDK (software development kit), developers will be able to integrate the S Pen\u2019s intuitive controls into a wide range of apps that will allow you to streamline more tasks with a simple click.\n    The S Pen also allows you to easily launch a favorite app or feature with a long press, regardless of the currently opened app. You can also customize clicks in the S Pen\u2019s settings2.\n    BLE technology ensures that the S Pen is always ready whenever you need it, enabling the device to pair with the Galaxy Note9 as soon as it\u2019s removed, and maintaining a stable connection even when Bluetooth is turned off. The S Pen\u2019s Super Capacitor takes just 40 seconds to reach full charge, and offers 30 minutes of power\u2014or up to 200 clicks.\n    Made for Multitaskers\nNote users are true multitaskers who require a phone that\u2019s as versatile as they are. That\u2019s why Samsung enhanced the Galaxy Note9\u2019s S Pen with Samsung DeX support: to offer users more ways to get down to work.\n  Samsung\u2019s ultimate productivity service solution has been enhanced for the Galaxy Note9 with highly portable HDMI adapters, which users can easily plug in to a display when on the go without the need for a separate device. In addition, there\u2019s also the dual screen support that allows you to work simultaneously on the smartphone\u2019s display and on a connected monitor.\n    Connecting the Galaxy Note9 to a monitor will also allow you to utilize the device as a touch keyboard, a touch pad, or a surface for writing or drawing with the S Pen. The S Pen\u2019s pressure-sensitive tip delivers a realistic and efficient writing experience when working on Samsung DeX, making it easy to, for instance, take notes on an interesting video that you\u2019re watching on the monitor, or fine tune an image or illustration using your Galaxy Note9 and the Adobe software suite.\n    More Ways to Make Your Mark\nLast year\u2019s Galaxy Note8 introduced Live Message, a particularly fun feature that allows you to inject more emotion into messages by drawing your own emojis, making animated GIFs, and customizing photos with pen effects and handwritten notes.\n  The Galaxy Note9 expands Live Message\u2019s expressive capabilities by integrating support for Samsung\u2019s ever-emotive, user-resembling AR Emoji stickers. The S Pen adds new layers of fun to sharing AR Emoji stickers by allowing you to customize them with personalized messages, drawings and more effects, which may be shared via messaging apps.\n    And the fun doesn\u2019t stop there, thanks to the new PENUP-powered Photo Drawing and Live Drawing features. The former adds a creative twist to the Gallery app, allowing you to draw over your own pics to create impressive works of art, while the latter offers video tutorials to help you fine-tune your artistic skills.\n    Screen off memo has also been made more dynamic, as the color of the pen\u2019s markings now matches the color of the S pen itself\u2014either yellow (for the Ocean Blue Galaxy Note9), light grey (for the Midnight Black model), lavender purple or metallic copper.\n    A Refined Design\nThe Galaxy Note9\u2019s S Pen is comfortable in the hand, measuring 106 millimeters in length and weighing in at 3.1 grams. Its 0.7-millimeter tip and 4,096 levels of pressure sensitivity provide impeccable precision, adding comfort and accuracy to note taking and drawing.\n  Like the Galaxy Note9 itself, the S Pen is IP68 water and dust resistant3. So wherever your day takes you, and no matter conditions, you can rest assured that it\u2019ll be ready to work.\n   https://news.samsung.com/global/",

My interfacing skills a short distance behind. Desktop Hub (app), being very helpful in managing my anxiety. The apps, I feel confident, will catch up.

The two primary constraints I feel are: 1) the DeX interface (HDMI, wireless HDMI, other). 2) power for that screen. From research done I cannot find a VERY usable mobile option. \n My techie logic dictates a screen with a wireless DEX/HDMI interface and it's own power. But open to other ideas.\n My two questions if I may:\n1) what options exist today that get's closest to the above requirement?

There are many posts from all different countries in this and other forums expressing this problem. The only reason why it does not get raised as an issue in the UK is because in the UK it is the single sim variant that is sold, and RSAP connectivity works perfectly fine with the single sim S9.\n I have seen various posts from consumers giving their opinions, but I can't find a post from an official Samsung representitive explaining the cause and the solution.\n So, please can some one from Samsung categorically state:\nWhy does the single sim variant works with RSAP but the dual sim variant does not.\nPlease explain when the dual sim variant will be modified to allow it to work with RSAP.\nIf you state that that there are no plans to add this feature, please state the reason why as there are thousands of people that want to know why they can't connect their phone to their car using RSAP.\n Please don't advise other ways to connect to the phone, I know how to connect my phone using bluetooth or a cable, but that doesn't allow the capabilities that are provided when connected by RSAP.\n After you've provided these details, I and all the other users that have this problem can then decide whether to keep our Samsung phones and live with the reduced functionailty, or whether to buy an alternate brand that does provide this facility. \n Thanks",

An explanation mark appears next to wifi logo and wifi signal becomes unresponsive, and I have to switch off and on to get signal again. This happens x3-12 times a day. It only drops on my home router and works perfectly on other wifi routers. All other devices in home work perfectly on wifi router. It is only a problem between my S9 and my home wifi router.\nWhen I listen to radio via Bluetooth through wifi, even when wifi signal hasn\u2019t dropped, radio keeps buffering. It will go silent, but sometimes if I press power button it will play again.\n If I switch off wifi, all features of phone work perfectly on 4G including radio streaming. I am guessing the settings of S9 are somehow interfering with First Media wifi router or visa versa.\n I have tried the following solutions, but none of them solved the problem:\n Reset network settings\nDeleted wifi connection and reconnected\nDeleted Network cache\nFactory reset of phone, at home and at service center\nChanged wifi settings from DHCP to static\nService center replaced motherboard and then entire phone, the same problem persists with new S9 replacement\nChanged wifi channel of router\nChanged security settings of router from WPA-PSK/WPA2-PSK (AES) to WPA2-PSK (AES)\nMy ISP said because wifi router works on other devices, the settings of S9 must be to blame\n The fact that phone was replaced and problem persists, suggests it\u2019s something to do with Samsung S9 settings.\n Does anyone know a solution to this?\n Thanks",

    "content": "Since the update in October I have been having problems with my S9+ maintaining a Bluetooth connection to some devices. It appears that the problem affects all Exynos based flagship devices (so S9 series and Note 9).\n\nWhilst I can live with my speakers or car disconnecting (as annoying as that is), what I can't live with is my Continous Glucose Monitor disconnecting - I rely on this to manage my diabetes and warn me of high or low glucose in my body, and the possible impacts of that (ketones, coma, death - fun things like that)\n The problems happen when the phone is not being used and the screen locks itself - this seems to cause the connection to the Bluetooth device to be missed or disconnect. As long as the phone is unlocked it maintains the connection. This was not an issue until immediately after the October update patch was installed.\n I've spoken with other users of these CGMs who also have a 2018 Samsung flagship and they are also having the same issue. This appears to be affecting two types of CGM so looks to be a Bluetooth/Samsung issue rather than a problem with the apps, which worked perfectly until the update was installed.\n The CGM devices are also not paired via the phones Bluetooth menu. They MUST be paired via the Bluetooth menu within the appropriate app for them to work and connect properly.\n\nAll Samsung have done for me so far is to suggest I call the Galaxy Stars phone line, and all they can do for me is suggest a factory reset.\n\nTo try to fix this problem so far I have:\nFactory reset\nCleared Bluetooth cache\nUninstalled/reinstalled my CGM app\nRebooted the phone (several times)\nInstalled the November update (didn't fix anything)\nNone of the above have worked. Are there any other things I can try, or how can I get Samsung to take this seriously, log a complaint/bug report and investigate to resolve? I have been emailing them but I just get a standard response and asked to call the Galaxy Stars team.\n Thanks",

My phone correctly connects to my car (Hyundai Ioniq), and Android auto loads without issue.  All apps within Android auto work perfectly, and all music/navigation comes through the speakers perfectly.  \n If I activate google assistant with OK Google, the phone correctly listens and takes the command through the car microphone.  However, when I press the voice activation button on the steering wheel (or the mic symbol within android auto on the car screen), the Google Assistant dots appear, but 90% of the time they don't listen (they don't respond when you talk, and if you leave it they just time out).  There is no real consistency to this, if you press the button ten times in a row it will probably work one of those times.  I have tried doing it with the phone locked/unlocked and it makes no difference.  If you make a change within the google voice settings it seems to work on the next attempt, and then goes back to being rubbish again.\n I feel happy it's not the car, as my iPhone works perfectly with Apple Car play everytime, at any speed, and Android Auto worked perfectly pre-update\n I have tried turning the various google assistant settings on and off (work over bluetooth, with wired headsets etc...), and I also completed a total factory reset of the phone which hasn't made a blind bit of difference.  Everything worked perfectly pre-update\n Any help would be much appreciated\n Thanks in advance\nA",

The touch sounds seem to go loud and quiet by themselves in the same session (by session I mean a typical usage session of a few minutes checking messages, emails etc). When watching youtube the audio has 'popping' sounds and again seems to come forward and backward like the audio is switching in some way by itself. When connected to bluetooth audio device like earbuds or the car handsfree, I take a call on the connected device, after about 1minute the audio switches to the phone loudspeaker by itself. When listening to music say on the earbuds the same thing happens, first plays on the earbuds for a bout a minute then by itself the sound switches to the phone loudspeaker by itself. Sometimes if I switch it back to the connected device after another minute it switches back to the phone loudspeaker again.\nI had no issues prior to this update. I have tried restarting the phone several times to no avail. I really don't want to restore to factory defaults as it is a real ball ache for me to get the phone setup to how I need it.\nI checked the last update and the info provided is this:\nBuild Number: A415FXXU1BUC3\nAndroid Version: Q(Android 10)\nRelease Date: 2021-04-15\nSecurity Patch Level: 2021-03-01\nClearly there is an issues with this update, is there any way to roll it back? or can Samsung fix it with a step upgrade?\nThanks",

The problem comes when playing music and the device is moved to the point that it's not 100% in line with any bluetooth device.  My car for instance if my phone is sitting underneath the dash in the little cubby it seems to stutter. I tested this out by moving the phone from it and then toward the door handle and the music became choppy.  Which made me wonder what exactly is the range of this?\n The next instance and the main one that I am curious about is with my bluetooth headphones. I pretty much buy mpow headphones at this point in which the bluetooth is always pretty good. It worked quite well on my old phone, but for some reason ( like in my car ) I have issues with stuttering. I first noticed this on my morning run when I tried to put my phone in my pocket and the audio became quite choppy; to which I had to hold the phone for the run. I ended up investing in an arm band and that seems to have solved the issue. While at work tonight I got a new pair of headphones with bluetooth 5.0? I'm honestly not that savy on the bluetooth so I'm assuming that's good, but even that once everything was synced and I was about to drop my phone in my pocket; The audio became a bit choppy. \n So I was wondering is there some setting I can check to try and alleviate this? Something I could perhaps turn off or maybe a hidden menu for me to do an update? Phone has been superb in everything else save for the bluetooth audio.\n edit - I'm sorry I just realized this is EU community and I am from the US. If a mod could please delete this unless perhaps it doesn't matter too much?",

Both Wi-Fi and Bluetooth use the 2.4 GHz band to transmit data, and because of this, Bluetooth audio skips or stutters, Device doesn't connect. To Avoid Interference, you can use the 5 GHz band instead of 2.4 GHz for Wi-Fi if your router supports both bands.\nI hope Samsung finds a solution to this problem because it is annoying. ",

It happens both with my Bluetooth headphones and with my wired headphones.  This leads me to conclude it is a problem with the phone itself rather than any particular app or accessory.  To clarify, the volume setting itself doesn't visibly change, it is just how it sounds during music playback. There is obviously some kind of algorithm or effect or something operating on the sound output. I wish I knew what it is. It was fine up until about 2 weeks ago, then it suddenly started happening.

I have Android Oreo and Developer Mode turned on. I can see from the dropdown list of bluetooth codecs that aptX and LDAC are available but whenever I switch to aptX, it just switched back to SBC again when I leave the settings menu.\n I have tried turning bluetooth on and off, restarting my phone, changing to aptX with and without my headphones connected and nothing seems to work. I have seen suggested that you need to turn dual mode off in bluetooth but that setting isn't available on my phone.\n According to the official aptX site, it isn't availble on the S7 but every other Samsung Galaxy phone for some reason: https://www.aptx.com/product-listing?product_category=11&brand=52\n I did a live chat with Samsung earlier and they said it is available on the S7 and suggested there may be something wrong with my phone and to take it to my nearest Samsung repair centre but I'm not entirely sure if that's right.\n If aptX is available on the S7 please can someone advise me how to get it working and stopp my phone being stuck in SBC mode.\n Thanks.",

    "content": "Note 8 is about 2 months and i am having twice this moving rectangle box on screen with alerting sound problem, which disables screen, do not allow any function, that also locks screen design to access phone, or to turn on or off.  By coincidence i reached emergency call and turned on and off made phone to normal. after 2nd alert,  i realized that somehow my \"universal switch\" option was on, as caution i turned off  \"universal switch\" also : if it repeats 3rd time  after all I have done i will return phone. Mean time I searched  this site & i reached 4 systematic solutions. You may give a try, and give your feedbacks pls! \nUpdate: \"Screen freezing with blue box scanning\" problem has been reported on also Samsung 6, 7 and 8 all these problems are referring \"UNIVERSAL SWITCH being ON\" now on NOTE 8!\n And Universal switch has very important function as stated here http://www.samsung.com/uk/accessibility/mobile-universal-switch/ Such an important option why should be turned off, my suggestion, the process with heavy involvement may be overloading this program. so after doing so much camera, screen functions etc joining external instruments, using extensive Bluetooth, USB etc, better turn on and off \"Universal switch\" once while may be the solution for future!! Or UNIVERSAL SWITCH should be off when screen off, and be On demand!\n\n AAA-same problem with samsung 8: solved like this:by member ChetanGalaxyS8 \nHere are the step to follow.\n1. Wake up the screen by pressing the power button\n2. Press and hold the Power button so that it shows the 3 options\na. Power off\nb. Restart\nc. Emergency Mode\n3. When the moving blue box comes on the Emergency Mode tap on that blue box\n4. It asks to enable the emergency mode. To enable you will have to press power button and volume up key both simultaneously.\n5. You will see the Emergency Mode enalbing screen. Once it completes 100%, you will be able to operate it normally and you disable the embergency mode now by selecting the 3 dots on the right corner.\n6. By doing this your phone will recover to the original state as it was earlier and you can use it.\n BBB-disable the Unisversal Swith simply by asking bixby to do it. (Long Press on the bixby button and say Disable Universal Switch). That worked instantly! by member nad0101\n  CCC- tap on the gear icon, scroll down to \"Accessibility\" then look for \"Direct access\" in this menu: search for universal switch, disable it. by member LoopHule\n DDD-Just Press \"Powerbutton and Volume up button at a time for few seconds\", then your screen will turnoff automatically. Just press power button this issue will be resolved. Please turn off talkback in accessibility in your mobile. by member Helping",

I don't know if it's something on the phone, something with the headphones, or something else. I thought it was something that had to do with Google Assistant, as occassionally, after receiving a notification, a voice would come on and say something to the affect of \"When you receive a notification, press -\" and then it would end. I think it has to do with the Google Assistant, but I've turned it off, as far as I can tell, for bluetooth devices. But it's still going. Any ideas?",

It usually starts when I am wearing my bluetooth headphones, and keeps going through wired headphones or the regular speaker once it starts.  The only way I can reliably get it to stop is when I restart my phone, but that is only a temporary fix.  I have read that some people believe it is tied to the NFC but I always keep that off.  Any ideas on how to fix this?\n Thanks,\nTomkat02",

Syncing with Outlook 2007 - calendar, contacts tasks\nI use Outlook 2007 as my \"PIM\" on my laptop.  It holds all my contacts,  calendars,  tasks etc et.  My current phone will sync all of these both ways without any problems.  Can the S8+ do this ?  Note that this is not an exchange server in the \"cloud\" somewhere.\n\n2. BT Linking to my cars system - Phone Audio, SMS and Emails\nThere are more than enough posts on US forums about the S8 and S8+ not being able to link to a cars phone kit via bluetooth (the last post I found was 14 days ago from today).  Is this a problem ?  Does the 8+ have SAP and MAP BT profiles ? \n\n3. App Store payment details ? Can I enter them on an adhoc basis and prevent them from being saved anywhere ?\n\n4. Can I operate it and buy stuff without a google account ?\n 5. I work away from home so at night in my hotel room I turn my current phone off and plug in the charger.  I get no beeps or boops when emails come in (until I turn it on in the morning),  and my alarm functionality still works so I don't sleep in!  Can I turn the s8+ off and it's alarm functionality still work, and when I plug in the charger does it stay off ?  (Unlike my G/F's apple which insists on turning itself back on when she charges it)\n Thanks for you help!\n Regards\n Rich",

I have tried other bluetooth devices, Polk sound bar, Samsung sound bar, JBL flip 5 speaker and those 2 albums play just fine, unless i play audio through my truck then try to pick up on that same song on another bluetooth device without skipping songs the audio will continue to crackle playing out of the phone speakers or any other device until I change songs. I have redownloaded the albums multiple times, transferred them to my phone with multiple cables, cleared the bluetooth cache and \"forgot\" bluetooth from both my S21 and the Pioneer head unit, still no luck.

I've also been purchasing music through iTunes for years, under the MPEG-4 (.m4a) audio format. These songs played just fine on my S8 and S10.\nI recently upgraded to the S21 and used Smart Switch to transfer all of my music from the S10 to the S21. All of my old music plays normally. However, any music that was purchased (via iTunes) after I started using my S21 has issues with the audio cutting out and sounding very static-y about 30% of the time I select them with my Buds on. If I start playing the song on the speaker and then connect my Buds, audio cutting always follows. After clicking the song a few times, the song plays normally. However, these newly purchased songs are totally unplayable using Android Auto, as the audio cuts out every single time I select them.\nI have re-installed the Samsung Music app and re-downloaded the songs with audio issues from iTunes multiple times, to no avail. How do I fix this? I assume nothing has changed in the way iTunes encodes their audio files since I got the S21, this happens over bluetooth and the speaker (therefore bluetooth isn't the issue), and all my old purchases play without any issues. I can't think of any explanation other than the S21 being the issue here.",

The connection just says \"Connected\". Very occasionally some apps will cause a message along the lines of \"WiFi unstable, waiting for stable wifi before continuing\"\n\nEvery other device in the home connects just fine, including my previous phone s7 edge. On my s7 edge, I can be on the complete other side of the house and still get reasonable speeds. \n\nWhen enabling mobile data tethering on another device, I can connect to that device's hotspot with a reasonable speed.\n\nWhen checking the speed directly next to the router, I see good speeds, as expected with any device right next to a router. A couple feet or more away from the router, and the speeds are abyssmal as described. It seems the WiFi range on my device has huge exponential drop-off after a couple feet.\n\nMy router is single-band (2.4GHz only). The model is MI424WR rev 1.0. I pay for 100 mbps, my s7 edge gets around 25 mbps consistently, but the s21 ultra gets around 1mbps on average, and very commonly even less than that.\n\nDue to COVID I will likely not be able to test my device on anyone else's router but my own anytime soon.\n\nIs it safe to say the device is defective? Do you recommend I RMA this device? Anyone else with similar issues have advice? Sure one can argue I have an \"older\" router but I would expect this device to at least match the network performance of my S7 edge. It does not make sense to me to say this is an issue with the router.\n\nI have submitted an error report through Samsung Members, just thought I'd post here as well to get more community feedback and discussion going.",

    "title": "USB-C Dongle Static During Audio Playback",
    "content": "Hello,\nI have had this Note20 for less than a year. Like many people, I was not aware phone companies started removing the 3.5mm audio jack so when I got this phone I was FURIOUS (it was a feature I figured would be on phones for the foreseeable future so I didn't even know it was something I had to research!).\nI specifically upgraded to unlimited data so I could stream music in my car, my work vehicle and in my garage at home via stereo. I do not have a car with Bluetooth capability so I had to buy three of those silly USB-C to 3.5mm dongles from Samsung. They worked great for probably 6 months and now they all create static noise if the USB-C plug is moved at all or not perfectly straight, for example if I drive over a small pot hole or on a dirt road. Since all of the dongles create the issue, I can safely say it is the USB-C port on the phone, not the dongles. The phone still charges as intended, only the audio playback is messed up. I also used compressed air to try to clean out the port on the phone and looked inside with flashlight to ensure no dust is inside.  I suspect most will chalk it up to the cables being unplugged from the phone in a rough way or crooked but I can assure you after having charging port issues with phones throughout my life, every time I unplug any of my devices now I do it carefully and properly.\nHas anyone else encountered this issue and if so, have you discovered a more thorough way to clean the port or the dongles or did it turn into a warranty issue? I tried using chat feature here to determine if it was viable for warranty or not but there is no \"pre-scripted\" option in the prompts for audio static issues or anything related to audio quality aside from Bluetooth etc. Thanks for reading!",

    "content": "[Asked a few months ago - no responses - let's try this again, now that the device has been on the market a while.]\n\nIs there any way to do hands free voice recording on a note 20 ultra? I.e., use Bixby or Google to start either the voice recorder or samsung notes in voice mode. I seem to be able to get Bixby to open the voice recorder, but not start it. And then there's the question of stopping a recording - either by voice command, or silence (and, if the latter, any way to restart and continue rather than have to start a new note?). I like to take notes while driving - and it sure would be easier to do it hands free.\nFollow-up. What about doing this with a bluetooth mic, or earbuds, while the phone is in one's pocket?",

    "content": "I've been a note user since the Note 3, and just recently had to upgrade my Note9 so I went with the Note20 Ultra. And it seems like with every iteration we lose more basics.\n- I don't need 12GB of memory, but I do need an SD slot - that I had to upgrade my upgrade to get that was more financially disappointing.\n- While the sensor block in the back can pick up the stripes on a Zebra in southern Africa all the way from Philly, the heart rate sensor is gone. I understand you're trying to sell smartwatches, and I own a Gear watch. but I am not wearing it all the time - I'm a jiu jitsu practitioner so I can't exactly wear a wristwatch while I'm grappling so I used my Note9 sensor to take my heart rate before and after a workout, because my watch is at home. That aside, how many users wear a watch 24/7?\n- This is also the first of roughly 10 Samsung devices I have owned where the app-provided sounds were by default overridden by the Samsung generic sound theme. I had to uninstall and reinstall many apps after switching over from my 9 to be able to just, for example, to tell the difference between Slack and Outlook. I was told by Samsung that this is a design choice and to come here to mention it, so I am.\nThis is not to say that the phone isn't masterfully constructed, but these aren't bugs, they're design choices and planned omissions. No one is buying a Note because it's thin and light - if other users are like me we go with the note for pure functionality and versatility. It's not like they're omitted to make room because the phone is huge with an additional section that juts out and takes up more volume.\nAt one of the highest prices in mobile ($1,300 as of right now), if we are going to be losing more and more basic features and forced into buying ADDITIONAL accessories for hundreds of additional dollars to make up for it in the name of a gigapixel camera or whatever you're planning next, I'm not sure this is going to continue to be worth the money. At this price point I expect pretty much everything, and I don't think that's unreasonable. I am a career technologist and use my mobile device to manage my universe.\nSorry for the rant, but there's a principle here that began when phone manufactures started nixing headphone jacks, then SD slots, and I don't know what's next. And as the price increases we need to buy more accessories. I don't want to buy and carry around a bag of bluetooth accessories so a phone works as advertised.",

I tried restarting my phone multiple times and notifications always temporarily work again after the restart, but always reverts to acting as if it was on vibrate after several minutes. I've also turned on notification reminders and those appear to work.\nThe last software update was a few days ago, and I didn't really do anything on my phone before the issue started happening. I did connect it briefly to the bluetooth in my truck, but I've done that many times in the past.\nThings I've tried: Restarting the phone, Turning off bluetooth, reviewing all sound settings\nHas anyone experienced this issue/does anyone know a resolution?

I listen to Pandora and others using an FM transmitter, paid $20 something at Target. With my J3 the music would get so loud you could feel it in your soul. The Rearview mirror would vibrate on certain songs. However, with the A11 the music level is horrible. I've tried every setting on the phone.  Had several people look at it and can't find a reason for it. Any suggestions? Is it the phone, the transmitter? I have heard I could use my J3 as my music source but I'd have to add it to my Boost account so it has a network??? I am older and not tech-savvy. Thank you so much for your help!",

So its not like its a buffering issue, it just seems to almost be dropping connectivity for 1-2 seconds. and it is very random, some times it can go 40-50 minutes without dropping any sound, other times it can do it within a few minutes of the last drop.

To pass the time,  I listen to podcasts using Podcast Republic but broadcast through the car via Bluetooth. At the same time,  I'm using Google Maps for traffic, directions, ETA, etc. Yesterday was my first time doing this after the Bixby Voice install.\n During random parts of various podcasts, Bixby would launch as if summoned. (Nothing remotely sounding like \"Hi Bixby\" was said.) This would cause the screen rotation to go back to portrait mode,  obscure the map,  and shut off the podcast. Then I could only sometimes get it to cancel, as I could only fuss so much while driving. And of course once it did,  I had to restart the podcast. This happened 4 times on a 3 hour drive. \n Anyone else seeing Bixby fire up inappropriately? And very often?",

While listening to music it seems like 2-4 times a song my bluetooth shuts off and I have to turn it back on, select earbuds, and then another minute or 2 later it turns off again.\n I have recently noticed it is also disconnecting me from my internet at the same time.  So I am not sure why this is happening, not sure if it is a problem with the latest update, but it is hugely irritating.  Being stuck working from home, with a working from home spouse and kids unable to go to school it is hard to pay attention to work without something to drown out the other noises.

Even doing this it will just disconnect again in the time frame listed above. This never happened prior to the update. I wanted to be sure it was the phone update so when I was at the dealership with my car yesterday I had them test my ford sync system and had them sync my phone to another ford sync system and it was doing it at the dealership also. To further test things one of the technicians had an s9 which has not run any updates since June. The phone connected and stay connected for over 2 hours.\n They are 100% sure that it is an issue with the September 2018 security update and they also have other complaints in their system from others reporting this issue.

Just in case you suggest clearing the cache, resetting network connection, and resetting the phone to factory. I have done all this and it has not fixed the problem. I waited to report this until the security update in October came out to verify and it is still doing it.\n Sean",

Is there a way to block access to the top menu (where you have Torch, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi etc.) and the small menu on the right hand side, while on the lock screen? So that you can't access anything, just have the options to unlock the phone and see the time.",

When someone tries to call me, the phone rings continuously and will not connect the call through the vehicle.  I took myh vehicle to the dealer, and the problem did not occur with a phone without the latest software update.  \n Tried soft reboot, tried power cycle, tried disconnecting and reconnecting bluetooth.  Nothing works.  Phone won't stop ringing unless I hit call OnStar and disconnect the call.  I found this possible solution through a websearch.\n I'm considering going to the Samsung kiosk at Best Buy to have them flash the software back to the previous version. \n Is Samsung aware of this problem with the software update?\n Is a fix in the works?\n I will not continue to drive a brand new vehicle without handsfree capability.",

    "content": "I have a good pair of headphones that can be used via both aux cord or bluetooth. It worked perfectly with my old S6, however, I upgraded to the S9 recently and my new phone seems unable to find them when scanning for bluetooth devices. I know the headphones are still good because I've had friends try to connect, which they did very easily. I tried rebooting the phone, and clearing the partition cache. I have reset my phone's network connections, I have reset the whole phone, and I have done a factory reset. I have no clue what else I can try. The headphones don't have a \"pairing mode\" if they are not connected to anything, they are available to be paired with, and I am certain they are not connected to anything because they give a notification when they do connect. Any help would be greatly appreciated. I'm completely out of ideas now.",
