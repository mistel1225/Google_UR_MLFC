    "content": "I am getting slow WiFi speeds, maybe 2 to 3 Mbps download. I know it's not my router because I can test my router separately. It gets the full speed fine.\n\nI also tried testing speeds in safe mode and am getting the same results.\n\nThoughts? Anyone else seeing this?\n\nAlso wondering if this related to the latest security release (May)",
