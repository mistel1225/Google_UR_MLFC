    "content": "Started having a significant battery drain problem on my pixel XL in the November-December time frame. I had not added any new apps; in fact I'd deleted unused ones.  I have done all the diagnostic and third-party app checks, etc, and am at a loss as to what to do next. One recent diagnostic shows my battery discharging speed to be 24.9% per hour with chrome at 404 mAh. The next app is at 34 mAh.  When I turn off both WiFi and mobile there is very little battery drain over time.",
