    "content": "Having problems with notifications from numerous apps\n\nNote: Do Not Disturb mode is turned off for everything detailed below\n\nDuo: Many times my wife will say she tried video calling me on Duo. My phone won't make a sound. Not even a missed call notification. I open the Duo app and I get all of the missed call notifications come through at once.\n\nFacebook Messenger (I use this all the time). Frequently I stop getting notifications of messages. I have not muted conversations or turned sound off etc. I open the app and I will get all the notifications come through at once. \n\nHangouts - Again, I won't get message notifications right away. Sometimes an hour after they were sent to me. Sometimes I have to open the app and then I get the notification.\n\nNormal voice calls and text messages - I don't seem to be having any issues with notifications for these.\n\nAny ideas of what this could be? I have a Pixel 2XL\n\nThank you",
