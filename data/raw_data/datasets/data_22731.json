    "content": "I'm currently travelling Vietnam. Last night when charging my phone I noticed it was reasonably hot when I woke up. Today when I tried to charge it, it wouldn't charge. I cleaned out the port and think I have removed any bits of fluff and dust that were in there. Power cycled it a couple of times. Which has helped and it did charge until I moved it. Now it vibrates every second when plugged in. I was originally using my travel plug that has a USB C connector attached. I have now switched to the original adaptor. Any thoughts?",
