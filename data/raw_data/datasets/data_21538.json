    "content": "I bought the google pixel 3a few weeks earlier, and the speaker phone and alarm is not working already!!!. It is very frustrating to navigate  through with my busy schedule. I contacted google support and after hours of \"do this an do that\" thingy. they told me to reset the phone and I lost some of important contacts and after all this hassle, I was given the option of free repair!!! Free repair..? with a new phone. I would need a replacement. \n\nI bought the google product thinking it will be good but I am very very disappointed with this google hardware product and their customer support. Phones are very important device to oneself and I was expecting a very good support at least!!!",
