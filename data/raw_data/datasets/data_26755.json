    "content": "Hi, i tried using tips and support chat via my pixel in settings but he told me to factory reset my phone which will not solve my issue. i was curious about the pixel buds that came with the phone and i plugged them in setting up weird stuff that it asked for and now for some reason whenever i try to use the mic on the buds, or my other headphones the mic does not work, they both work on my original pixel, i can hear audio, but the mic function (discord to be specific) does not work\nwhen i tap text to audio on the keyboard, it does work, but again im trying to get it to work on discord :(",
