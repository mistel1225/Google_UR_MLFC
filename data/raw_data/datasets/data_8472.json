    "content": "I am trying to send a message to a five digit number from my university in order to receive a coupon code or a link to the discount I am not sure. When I tried to send this message initially I received a pop-up that indicated that the message could or would cost money in order to send/receive the messages. I accidentally clicked never allow, I don't remember the exact wording but now I can not find where in my setting to change this back. The message should not cost me anything to send or receive the coupon so I am not sure why the message will not go through. I have tried to resend the messages and go through my settings and clicked apps ,messages . Thank you for your help!",
