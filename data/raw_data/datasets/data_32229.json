    "content": "The usb c earbuds volume rocker that came with the pixel 3 it's so sensitive that wind outside will turn it up or down and my beard will mess with the volume just by proximity to the rocker button. Is there a way to adjust this or what the next option. I have reset the headphones and turn off assistant off but the volume still sensitive to the touch by the wind and my beard hair.",
