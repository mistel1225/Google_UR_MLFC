    "content": "I recently updated my Pixel 3 XL to Android 11 then the latest security update. And cant change contact information anymore. Not sure if the issue was Android 11 or the security update, I rarely make contact changes on the phone. I can see all the info in the contacts to dial numbers, send texts, and send emails with it. I if change contact info on Office 365, the new contact data syncs to the phone. If I click edit contact on the phone or click the create new contact button, then the screen is blank. If I go into contact settings and click default account, there is none, and the option to choose one is blank. If I click your info, it is also blank. See screen shots. I tried uninstalling contacts updates and re-updating, cleared the cache, and the storage. Removed my email account and added it back. Started in safe mode. I have not done a factory reset, to avoid reinstalling and resetting up the phone. Contact app version is 3.36.3.346104542, Phone build # RQ1D.210105.003, thanks. ",
