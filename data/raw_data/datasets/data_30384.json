    "content": "in wikipedia page about pixel\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel_(smartphone)\nis not said that it comes with android one, nor stock android\nnor here https://www.android.com/one\nthe pixel phones are listed as having the android one\n\nbut here \nhttps://www.androidauthority.com/best-smartphones-stock-android-844672/\nits listed as pixels are running stock android,\nwhich acording to their article : https://www.androidauthority.com/what-is-stock-android-845627/\nstock android is the same as android one\n\nso, in reality, pixel phones run android one or stock android?\n\nhere\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_One\nis said\n##Android One is a near-stock version of the Android operating system released by Google##\nbut there is also said\n##Android One cannot be altered by the companies that make the phones, and only runs on certain smartphones.##\nbut if the OS cannot be altered by company, then shouldn't it be a stocked version (that is, the OS has no retouches from the phone manufacturer)?\n\nso, i am a bit confused, whats the difference between stock and one android?\n\nthanks",
