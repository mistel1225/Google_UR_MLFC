    "title": "Pixel 3a Auto Unlocking / Pressing Notifications",
    "content": "Pixel 3a - Android 11\n\nKeeps auto pressing notifications when I receive one, on the lock screen and opening them, how do I stop it? It doesn't happen on every notification, and is very random when it does it.\n\nIt doesn't seem to matter if smart unlock is enabled or not, because if it requires the passcode then it opens up the pin entry bit you normally get by swiping up.\n\nAny ideas? I've tried disabling any apps that can access notifications, and removed any apps that needed accessibility too, not sure what else to try. (not keen on a factory reset)\n\nI see some others have also posted about the same issue but have no solutions:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/jmrh5z/pixel_3a_w_android_11_auto_opening_notifications/\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/jq7joy/auto_opening_notification/",
