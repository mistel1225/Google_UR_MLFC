    "content": "My outbound calls drop after precisely 30 minutes - without fail. My carrier (Vodafone UK) can't seem to find anything wrong and have suggested looking at the phone's call settings - but I can't find any call settings on Pixel 3. Could this drop be caused by some phone settings or liekely to be a network issues.",
