    "content": "Dark marks appeared on the screen of my google pixel 4a. I live in Greece and I bought it from amazon.uk a few weeks ago. Since I didn't buy it from google store, it isn't registered there. I tried many times to call 0800 328 6081, as it was suggested buy amazon's help, but the line doesn't seem to work. Who should I contact?",
