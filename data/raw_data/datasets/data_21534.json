    "content": "Hi, team & anyone.\n\nBought pixel just over 2 years ago.\n\nMy phone updated recently, I was using my phone at nighttime - flash light to find something in my room. Light's the other side of the room.\n\nAnyways - I noticed my phone had frozen with flashlight on, screen froze everything froze.\nA few seconds later the screen flashed Black/Greenish colors across the screen.\nThe phone switched off.\n\nHasn't come back on within 2 days.\n\nDoesn't show any signs of life, no charging lights or icons.\nNo vibrations.\nDoesn't call when I use another line in case it's the screen.\n\nI've tried holding various buttons down, to reboot, nothing.\nEven put it in rice - but I haven't been out of the house in 2 weeks... so nowhere near water. \n\nRather frustrated. \nCovid - lockdown, lost my job, no income, now a broken phone just outside warranty.\n\nAny ideas?\n\nThanks for all your help.\nStay safe ^_^",
