    "content": "My Pixel 2 XL started asking for a password suddenly. It did not do this before.  I have exhausted all possible ways to try resetting it without losing the data.\n\nI did not have it connected to my Google Account, and I have a LOT of photos I do not want to lose, which are stored only on the phone.\n\nIs there any way possible to get this phone password removed so I can get my pictures? Maybe send it to Google?  I cannot find any way to call Google directly.",
