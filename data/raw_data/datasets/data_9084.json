    "content": "Been trying to find out if anyone else is having buggy issues with the music recognition feature.  For whatever reason my phone will sometimes \"hear\" music nearby (but there is absolutely no music playing) and when I view history I don't recognize or recall some of the music.  I've had it log music that played in the middle of the night (while I'm sleeping with NO MUSIC).  Anyone else having this issue? Is this some weird bug?",
