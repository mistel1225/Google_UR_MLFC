    "title": "calendar widget colours don't stay set for page view till tapped (3a xl)",
    "content": "i have the calendar widget on one page of my home screen set, i changed the default holiday colours to grey and use a bright green for appointments.\n\nwhen i open the phone the widget reverts the holiday colours back to original colour (green) which clash with my appointment ones\n\nwhen i tap on the widget then exit it so its back as a 'quick look' on the home screen it remains as i set it, grey and green.\n\ncan you get the developers or fix it team for updates to see if the widget can remain as set for the quick look, ie i open my phone that day and i dont have to tap the widget for it to show the correct colours.\n\nthanks bobby",
