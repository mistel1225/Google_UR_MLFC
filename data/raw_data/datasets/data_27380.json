    "content": "Right now, my front-facing camera does not even open (i.e. it plays the animation to \"flip\" to the front camera, but it just pauses for a while and goes back to the back-facing camera). Also, trying to click on Playground mode instantly crashes the Camera app.\nBack when I first got the phone, the front-facing camera was fine. After a day or two, it wouldn't flip anymore.\nAlso, when I first downloaded Android 10, the front-facing camera worked again. But then it stopped working again.\nThe problems still occur after safe mode.\nWhat should I do?",
