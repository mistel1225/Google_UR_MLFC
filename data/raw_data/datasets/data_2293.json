    "content": "Trying to connect my Pixel 5 to my PC (Windows 10) with Bluetooth for music streaming. I'm able to get them to pair but the Pixel almost immediately drops the connection. The PC shows up as a Previously Connected Device. When I tap Connect, nothing happens. The PC shows the Pixel as paired but not connected. The Pixel also shows up in the PC audio settings as an input device, but shows as disconnected with a red down arrow. However it says \"device is working normally.\"",
