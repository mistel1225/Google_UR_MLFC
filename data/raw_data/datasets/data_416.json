    "content": "My Pixel 3XL was a brilliant machine before recent forced update. Now it barely works. Want the update removed. This is BS. Trying to hold off replacing until Pixel 6 is released in October. \n\nPixel 5 sucks. Wife has one. We are a Google family with many Pixels and Chromebooks and home devices so please don't try to refer me to other brands. \n\nMessaging, call app, attach, camera, photos, web, keyboard, all take several attempts to open and then won't work at all sometimes. Have to close and reopen. Use my phone more than computer for work so I need it to function as intended. Come on Google!!!!!",
