    "content": "I have seen this reported by other Pixel 3 owners here and all replies ask to contact Google Support. I have tried the support options, but it doesn't seem that either Chat or Phone are available, they both loop me back to the main help page. My phone is under warranty still and I would like to get in contact with someone to get this fixed. Any ideas?\nCheers!",
