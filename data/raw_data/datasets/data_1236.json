    "content": "was paired to Panasonic base station, then upgraded to latest.  Panasonic still showed up, but wouldn't connect.   Deleted Panasonic, which is what I usually have to do after a poorly designed system update.\n\nBut no, now it won't pair at all.   No other bluetooth devices are connected.\n\nPixel 3a is a piece of Junk that causes problems over and over.  Way worse experience than my iPhone.  I'll Never buy anything from Google again.",
