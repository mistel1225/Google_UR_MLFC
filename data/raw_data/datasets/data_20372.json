In order to track wifi related issues, have included additional debugs prints in some files under wpa_supplicant_8/, but it was not effective after flashing system.img to the pixel 3a device. So I have below few queries.\n1. How to make my wpa_supplicant related debug prints effective or what else needs to be changed through Code. \n2. What is the wpa_supplicant packaging flow, does these changes goes to system.img or any other images.\n3. I couldn't see vendor.img in the AOSP out/target/product/sargo/ even on clean build. But I could see it in Factory image. How can I build vendor.img through AOSP",
