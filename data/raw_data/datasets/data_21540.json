    "content": "I have a pixel 3xl device which I gave for the esim issue to the authorized service center my device was in fully working condition but when I gave my device  they told if we opened there is a possibility the display can be damaged as there was no liquid or physical damage on display so I denied opening device and they returned the device as the esim issue was not found but when I receive the device the display started having lines and a scratch and the back panel was too open. I showed to the person at the center while collecting about the device in which he told all the technician are not available he told me to collect the device then I called the pixel customer care and I shared the image too and they told me that they will look into this matter and told to submit the device so I submitted the device again and there is no assurance about the condition they gave me and no update as the case is handled by the highest authorities in India but I need some help can any person form the pixel team at Supreme post can look into this case it will be very helpful.
