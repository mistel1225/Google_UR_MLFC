    "content": "I plugged my Pixel 2 into a fast charger and it charged at normal speed, but afterwards I plugged it back into various normal chargers and it says charging slowly for all of them and by slowly I mean that I picked up the phone to look at a few things and it went down in percentage!\n\nSo its basically not charging at all, the first time I left it over night and it went up 2%.",
