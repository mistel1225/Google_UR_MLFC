    "content": "I took my pixel 2 on a floating trip yesterday and the phone was exposed to some water (it was never fully submerged). I have had the phone for almost 2 years now and it does not have any cracks or damage. Yesterday on the way home the pixel screen stopped responding to touch, however the buttons on the side work. Late last night I got it to respond for a short while after restarting a few times (by holding down power button) and applying pressure to the screen and back of phone and fiddling with the buttons. Now the screen will only respond sometimes (rarely) and not for long periods of time. Is this a water damage issue? Can google help?",
