    "content": "Two weeks past since I updated my Pixel 3 to 11 Android. Suddenly, I received an error \"Your device is corrupt. It can't be trusted and may not work properly.\" I pressed power button to continue and that's it, device can't be turned ON at all. No safe mode, nothing.\nWant to highlight that no changes to operating system was done. I didn't even try to do.\nHow can I resolve the issue? Is it possible to do reset without turning pixel on?\n\nPicture attached for visibility.",
