    "content": "When I have a bluetooth device connected and try using the recorder or WhatsApp or anything it won't use my bluetooth mic. The mic is fine and works perfectly so it has to be a software issue. I tried resetting my bluetooth settings restarting my phone etc. . I know this is a widely spread issue but Google still doesn't fix it. I got this Pixel 5 a few weeks ago (I switched from and iphone xs max) and even though this phone costs a third I am still happy but this is really annoying me.",
