    "content": "Hello!\n\nI bought a Google pixel 3a 2 months ago from Amazon Germany. Two days ago my screen suddenly stucked with Google logo when I turned it on and the only thing that I could do was to factory reset it so I did it. Now I realize that my bottom speakers it s not working anymore in applications, music, games or speakers calls. I m not sure if this problem was before factory resetting or only after it.\n\nI live in Romania and I really need an advice about how I can contact 1 to 1 support or how and where I can use my warranty for fixing the issue. 2 years ago I had a pixel 2 and from nowhere it was locked in boatload and I couldn't t use it anymore. I don't want to repeat the story.\n\nThank you in advance!",
