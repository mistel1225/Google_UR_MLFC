    "content": "Supposedly there was a security update recently on Android that caused this.  Referencing this thread here;  https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSilphRoad/comments/jvcocd/question_keep_getting_a_bluetooth_pairing_request/\n\nBasically those of us using a Pokemon Go+ or Pokemon Gotcha are being hounded with requests to approve pairing every time we sync our devices.  It's annoying, and we have to do it multiple times an hour.\n\nI'm not sure how else to get googles attention about this, but a fix is a must.",
