    "content": "I've read where people say the phones are the same, there's no difference between the Fi version of the Pixel 5 and the unlocked version, but those discussions were related to buying the unlocked version for use on Fi. I'm the other boat, the unlocked version was sold out so I purchased the Fi version. I'm hoping to use it on T-Mobile with both an esim and traditional sim, both T-Mobile. Should I expect everything to work without issue or have I made a mistake in my purchase and assumption? Thanks.",
