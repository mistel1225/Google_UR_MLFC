    "content": "In the last couple of days, the bottom speaker on my pixel 2 has become distorted and tinny. When playing music, the top speaker is fine, just the bottom one. I've not had any incidents with my phone, so it won't be because of an accident.\n\nDoes anyone know of a way to fix this? I'm guessing it's a hardware issue, but would like to try other fixes first.",
