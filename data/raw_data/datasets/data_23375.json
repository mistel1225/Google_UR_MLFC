    "title": "Can't get phone notifications through USB-C headphones",
    "content": "My (non-Google) USB-C headphones work well with my Pixel 3 except for one thing: I cannot set them up so that I can hear notifications or use Google Assistant. After reading other similar posts I'm guessing it has something to do with the fact that when they're plugged in, under Connected Devices is says \"Charging Connected Device via USB\" - my phone isn't recognizing them as headphones.\n\nIn all of the other posts I've found, the users are using the Google USB-C dongle with non-USB-C headphones, and they are having issues with all audio, not just notifications. And all of the solutions to that seem to be \"clean the dongle and USB port\". This is doing nothing for my issue.\n\nSuggestions?\n\nFor the record, I am using non-Google headphones because the ones that came in the box really hurt my ears and the second, more traditional earbud-style headphones that I ordered (because they were recommended on Google's Pixel accessory webpage) just...fell out of my phone if I moved too much. Like while walking. I'm really hoping this isn't some weird branded issue where only Google headphones can fully function with the phone - I'm fairly sure my second pair was only affiliated with Google through their recommendation so it seems like that wouldn't be the case?",
