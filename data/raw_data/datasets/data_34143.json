    "content": "Hello!\n\nLast week I went to bed with a perfectly working Pixel 3, I put it on the nightstand beside me to charge like I do every night. Woke up the next morning to turn the alarm off and my screen was doing this.\nIt was never dropped and it definitely didn't get wet (Its kept inside an otterbox case as extra precaution)\n\nOn the top left of the screen there's what looks to be a burn mark\n\nI brought in the phone to my local Rogers (Canadian telephone company) and it was sent to their repair facility. They contacted me and said the phone is out of warranty due to physical or water damage and I'm having the phone sent back to me now. This whole process has been infuriating as I always babied my phones (This is my third cellphone out of my 23 years.)\n\nDoes Google offer their own warranty program I could use? I feel like I'm out a $1000 phone that I didn't break. Meanwhile my Samsung S6 has been chugging along with no problems since 2015...\n\nThanks,\nMatt",
