    "content": "I received an email offering me 6 months of YouTube music premium for free as a thanks for purchasing a google pixel 3. I clicked the link in my email on a desktop and on my mobile phone, and both only lead to a page where I can get a 1 month free trial. There's a big difference between what the offer says and what the trial page is telling me.",
