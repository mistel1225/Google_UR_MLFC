    "content": "My bluetooth earbud mic is too soft. I want to take calls with audio outputting into my earbuds, but using the microphone on my phone.\n\nSo far I have tried Soundabout - no Android support, app no longer accessible\n\nLesser AudioSwitch - \"Non-Blueooth microphone will only be used if Bluetooth microphone is unavailable\", so I need to find a way to somehow disable the mic in my earbuds if I want to use this option\n\nEarphone mode off - only works for wired earphones\n\nAny way I can achieve this?",
