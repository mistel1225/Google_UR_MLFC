    "content": "I usually charge my phone overnight and today I am not able to unlock the phone or even check the time as the screen will not turn on. I have tried using the charger in different outlets and still the screen will not show charging.\n\nI have held down the power and volume down buttons for 20 seconds and nothing. I have connected to PC and nothing shows on the screen and I cannot access my phone files via computer either which leads me to believe it isn't just a screen issue.\n\nI have tried using a portable charger which shows it starts charging for 30 seconds (Portable charger turns blue) but then goes back to red after multiple attempts.\n\n\nCan someone please help and advise how I can access my phone? :(",
