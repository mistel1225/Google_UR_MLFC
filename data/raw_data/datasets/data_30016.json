    "content": "Hi everyone!\n\nI will be staying in Japan temporarily. I want to buy a new phone as soon as possible as my old one broke. My question is that if I buy a pixel 3a phone in Japan, take it to India (after 3-4 months of the usage here) and insert an Indian sim card in it, will it work - or will it be locked for Japanese sim cards only? \n\nI wanted to buy one from a store in Japan, but apparently, we can only purchase contract phones in stores, which are cheaper but require a residence card in Japan and I don't have one.\n\nAnything anyone knows or any experience in this matter will help. Thanks a lot.",
