    "title": "My replacement Pixel 4XL battery is swollen",
    "content": "I recently noticed that my battery was turning off when it reached about ~20%. Also, a week before the phone wasn't charging wirelessly with the pixel stand. Then, today I wanted to change the my case and noticed that the back of my phone is coming off and looked like it was bulging. This current phone is a replacement because my old pixel 4xl got run over by a car, so I had it replaced in the summer. This new replacement they gave me, had no accidents and I have taken very good care of it. I am aware that if there are problems within the 90 days, there is no fee for any defects etc. But since it has been over the 90 days, my options are to pay again a service fee of $225 CAD, or go to ibreakufix store to have it diagnosed, the Assurant support person said. I even have preferred care, which was an additional $200 and if I get charged again for a service fee, then this phone has costed me $2k. At this point I could have gotten a better phone from a different carrier. I even found many threads on reddit about people reporting the swollen batteries, shouldn't these be recalled since many users are reporting this? Is there anyone that can help me? I already called customer support (Assurant), they literally just gave me generic responses, when this clearly is a manufacturer defect. I just find it annoying how they are gonna charge SAF for a manufacturer defect. If someone higher up can help me with this, please do.\n\nThanks for listening.",
