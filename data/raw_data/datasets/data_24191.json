    "content": "My pixel 3 does not vibrate nor ring at all when I receive notifications and calls. The notifications for each application is turned on, volume is on and vibration is on. However the ring tone and vibration do work on my alarm, so it must be a problem related to notifications and calls  only. Please help, this is a big inconvenient! Thank you",
