    "content": "i have tried everything suggested by Google help, start to finish. have been in touch with support. Have done the factory reset. Have tried disabling video stabilization. even tried the suggestion of giving the camera a strong 'tap'....EVERYTHING. Nothing worked. however, after the factory reset (which didn't work, as many strings had said it would not), I got tired of testing the camera and waiting for the HDR+ to resolve, so i tested the camera with HDR OFF. THAT WORKED. Photos finally back in focus. Quality looks fine. Looks to be an HDR+ software issue at Google to me. \n\nThis just resolved, so i'm hoping it stays fixed with HDR off and that Google fixes what certainly seems to be an HDR issue.",
