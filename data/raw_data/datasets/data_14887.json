    "content": "1-the music on lock screen won't show up.\nUnless I turn on and off the notifications, but that is insanely to do every day.\n\n2-the finger print won't read all the time even tho my iPhone reads it well.\nHaven't found any solution for it yet. Sometimes it just say put ur pin for security, even if it was my first trial.\n\n3-google assistant rarely responds to me. If I say hey Siri at the same environment Siri would listen but Google doesn't.\nThis has been happening for many months, I guess it's a Google issue.\n\n4- when unlock the home screen show up before it is unlocked!? Then shows the lock screen!??\nThis started since the last update.\n\n5- Bluetooth issue, it disconnects so often and cannot find my earphones unless I click on pair a new device everytime. Compared to my iPhone SE it always connects right away.\n\nThings I have done but didn't help much:\nI restarted the phone, updated the system, killed the background apps, made sure all the time to use less than 40% of the phone memory, no games, no illegal download. All the apps I use are what'sapp, snapchat, Netflix, Amazon. \n\nI contacted the support in chat... All they did they say hi and then my name and how can I help you. When I tell them my issue they disconnect!\n\nI have screenshots and reference numbers but for confidentiality I cannot share here.\n\n***Attached a screenshot of asking google to take me home and it answers me who do u wanna text...\" I'm speechless.***\n\nAny suggestions would be appreciated.",
