Both my phone and TV are compatible but when I select cast on my phone it displays \"no nearby devices were found\".\nFrom a quick search this can be fixed by selecting \"enable wireless display\", on some phones this is turned on by pressing the 3 dots in the top right corner, I was able to fix the issue on my wife's phone by pressing the right hand button on the bottom of the phone. \nAs my pixel has no physical buttons and the 3 dots appear to be missing, can any one tell me how to enable wireless display?",
