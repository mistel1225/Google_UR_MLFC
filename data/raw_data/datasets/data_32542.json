    "content": "The phone rings but the screen doesn't show an incoming call. Therefore I can't take the call. It doesn't matter if the phone is locked, if it's unlocked or if an app is open. There is no button to take a call. I got the phone two months ago. This problem only came up three weeks ago. Since then I can't take any incoming calls anymore.",
