    "content": "So I've been facing these battery drain problems on my Pixel 3a and surprising fact is it's barely been a month since I bought this device.Battery percentage drops from like 42% to 23% or so overnight which is an 18% drop; as much as I know this isn't normal.I contacted the support and initially they asked me to factory reset the device,which I did but the problem persisted. When I got back to them, they asked me to send it over to USA to avail the warranty and stuff. Here's the problem, I bought the device from Best Buy Canada during my vacation there a little over a month back. I live in Bangladesh and it's almost impossible for me to send my phone all the way. I'd really appreciate it if anyone could suggest other alternatives.Thanks",
