    "content": "My phone randomly opens apps or calls contacts. It over heats my mobile data drops off. I have to restart the phone to get data service back. I'm an Android user that doesn't like the iphone navigation, well I like my pixel 3a navigation even less. I will not by a Google phone again. I will go back to LG or Samsung. In response to the post from Sarah I read, no Sarah you aren't the only one who hates Pixel. I read go reviews and had high hopes just to be disappointed. Google recommends running in safe mode and if the phone runs fine then it's an app. Wrong the same apps run fine on my LG I still have it as an back up. What good is the Pixel if it won't run the same apps without issue. Just really disappointed.",
