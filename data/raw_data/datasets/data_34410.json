    "content": "My video player recently started to minimize. I noticed other people have posted about all their apps doing the same thing. I tried running my good maps and noticed that also minimized after a few minutes too. In some of those posts I saw some recommendations about disabling pic on pic so I tried that in my settings for video. Apperrantly that inhibits the video from minimizing but actually shuts off the video player completely. How can I fix this?",
