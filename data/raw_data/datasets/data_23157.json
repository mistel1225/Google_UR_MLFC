    "content": "Pixel 4xl has by far the worst location accuracy of all the phones ive owned. It does not give the direction while walking in maps. The maps keep rotating and it cant find direction even after a considerable amount of time. This also happens sometimes when I stop at a traffic signal, the maps keep rotating confusing and distracting the driver. I've tried recalibrating the compass, which always shows accuracy as low.",
