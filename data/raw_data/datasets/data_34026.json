    "content": "I received a replacement Pixel 3 from Google because my previous two devices from Google either had a flashing screen and/or a green screen as well. This new (refurbished) device they sent now has green smudges on the screen on lower left hand corner (most obvious one). The green smudge is more apparent when the brightness is set lower. ",
