    "content": "The wi-fi connection of my Pixel 3 XL has been constantly dropping for the past two weeks and I've tried a lot of things to solve it, even factory resetting it. But before this, I was having extremely slow internet speed on 5 GHz networks, not only with the one in my household. Now, not even 2.4 GHz speed networks seem to properly work. Any helpful advice? Thank you in advance.",
