    "content": "I acquired this device on Monday, and the issue has only begun today. It's currently running Android v. 11. The screen will briefly flicker a variety of colors when the screen wakes up - probably 3 out of 10 wake times. I've rebooted in safe mode and there was no change. I've also tried turning off adaptive brightness, turning on dark mode, etc. It hasn't been dropped or exposed to water.",
