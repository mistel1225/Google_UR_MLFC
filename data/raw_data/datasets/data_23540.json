    "content": "For some odd reason I cannot delete this old files, that variate from .jpg, .mp4, & even .pdf. The images below are an example of the process. I highlight the files, select delete, a bar begins to load, then I get the notification in the last pic. I'm at wits end about these miniscule files that I just want gone.",
