    "content": "My phone battery stays at 50% after I fully charged it over night. I already tried a factory reset and fully dischargeing it but nothing helps.\nIt showed the low battery icon when it was empty, but as soon as I put in the charging cable it displayed 50% again.\n\nThe weird thing is what I noticed while I tried everything to get it back to normal, that the custom recovery TWRP shows the correct battery status.\n\n\nFor more infos: it happened after I updated to the Android q beta (I'm now on p again) and I didn't unlock my phone until the problem happened.",
