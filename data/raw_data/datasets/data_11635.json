    "content": "While cleaning my Pixel 5 which is only around two weeks old I had the impression to see a small scratch on the main camera lens. Checked that with a magnifying glass and a flashlight and it turned out to be a light scratch underneath the glass ಠ_ಠ I could see that it's underneath because light reflection was really \"weak\" and dust particles on top of the glass changed position to the scratch perspectively so it could only be underneath the glass.\n\nTook some test shots with bright light sources to see if any obvious flares or similar occurs but couldn't notice any impacts on the images. Scratch is only visible with a bright flashlight but somehow I'm disappointed.\n\nWould you consider to go for an RMA hassle because of this?",
