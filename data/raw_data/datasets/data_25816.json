    "content": "After taking portrait shots on my Pixel 3a if I try to edit the background blur manually it doesn't work. \nDefault blur which is applied also goes away. Sometimes only small patches of blur show up. It's not consistent.\n\nFirst snapshot is of default blur\n\n\nSecond image is of custom blur\n\n\n\nWhat could be the issue?",
