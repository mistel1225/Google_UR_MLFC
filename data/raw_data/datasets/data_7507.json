    "content": "When I attempt to upload photos from my phone to Facebook It defaults to gallery on my phone That's all of my photos are actually in Google photos on my phone. I cannot find a way to get to my Google photos from Facebook so that I can upload the needed photos? Other words I am in Facebook ready to create a post, from Facebook I click photos videos and it takes me directly to gallery and the photos I want to upload or not there from there I can not get to my Google Pixel photos to upload them.\nThank you for your assistance I appreciate you and look forward to hearing from you.\nLinda Robertson",
