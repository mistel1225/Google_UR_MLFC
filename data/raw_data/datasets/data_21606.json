    "title": "Clock widget not resizing small enough - empty space beneath clock",
    "content": "I accidentally removed my clock widget this morning, and when I went to replace it the widget now went resize to what it was and includes a large blank space beneath it. The space appears to be the size needed for additional clocks for other locations, but I turned them all off and it's still there. My old widget too up 2 spaces horizontally and 1 space vertically. The new one is 3 spaces by 3 spaces. The first image is what I see when I realize, the second shows the space where the clock widget used to be.",
