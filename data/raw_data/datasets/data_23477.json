    "title": "Pixel 2 freezes when receiving calls after Android 10 December 2019 security updates",
    "content": "I have an Android 10/Pixel 2 and the Phone app crashes/hangs really often when I receive a call, making it impossible to answer it. Started 3 days ago, after December 2019 updates. The issue doesn't happen all the time, I noticed it looks more likely to happen when the phone screen has been off for a while. \n\nI reached out to Google Support, they suggested clearing cache on Phone app, clearing storage, uninstall Phone app updates and apply then again from the Play Store. All these steps were followed yesterday and today my phone froze again when receiving a call.",
