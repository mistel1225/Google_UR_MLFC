    "title": "Default Pixel 5 Camera is not storing photos as of Jan 2 2021. What happened!?!",
    "content": "My Pixel 5 was taking and storing photos on Jan 1 2021.  Jan 2 I noticed the camera was not storing.  There was a small update if I remember correctly.  I've cleared cache, stored data on camera, started in safe mode but still the same results while in safe mode.  Permissions is to allow, etc.\nUpdate: Facebook, WhatsApp, and other software is working.  The Google Camera is not and I'm unable to take videos.  Anyone else having issues?",
