    "content": "Yesterday my pixel 3 decided to stop charging. It went from about 50% battery to 1% within 30 minutes of no usage. Now it's currently stuck at 1% while on the charger but won't go above this. Is this likely a battery issue or a port issue? Would replacing the battery fix this problem?",
