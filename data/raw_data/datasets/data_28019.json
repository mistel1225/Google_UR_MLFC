    "title": "Why does my phone die if it's not constantly plugged in on charge?",
    "content": "I will start at 100% on charge. As soon as I unplug it, it will drop to 70% then within the hour of social media apps or internet browsing it will drop to 60% at which point it will power down. When I switch it back on it will be on 0% and needs to be plugged back in to switch on. I don't even have to use it. I can have it on 100% when I leave the house. Leave it in my pocket untouched. Walk 20 minutes and it will die. I must have Location Bluetooth Battery Saver Hotspot (you name it) disabled or else it won't even power on. I can have WiFi OR data enabled but only one at a time. \nI have checked all apps to see which is draining but none are the answer. I have even uninstalled all my games and cleared out all my photos. Still is draining. Please help. Funny how it broke immediately after the 2 years contract ended, well played Google.",
