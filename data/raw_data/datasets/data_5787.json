    "content": "Ever since I moved to pixel 5 from 2 XL, everyone complains that they can't hear me clearly or the voice breaks during some part of conversation. I don't use any ear phones or buds. Is anyone facing the same issue? If there are any settings that can increase sensitivity of the lower microphone, please let me know. Thanks",
