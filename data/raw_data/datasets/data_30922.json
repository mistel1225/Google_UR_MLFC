    "content": "Google Inc. I am going to share my complaints which I am facing with your company's manufactured Google PIXEL 3 phone. Within 3 months of purchase, the pixel 3 phone went twice to service factory for device repair, related to RF antenna which is faulty and not working. On top of that now the pixel 3 front camera is having issues too along with several known issues.\n There are 2 service tickets have been raised (service ticket numbers GL0057410 & GL0067824- escalation ), +25 complaints email communication and phone call with google support team.\nGoogle pixel support team is not ready to replace the new device. \nI am sorry to say but google is failing in customer satisfaction and incompetent to provide quality service and device for a premium high end phone which is worth more than 70k INR.\nAfter not getting any concurrent response and decision from Google support team, I have no choice but to go public and share my grievances with everyone so that my voice can be heard and action can be taken in favour of customer",
