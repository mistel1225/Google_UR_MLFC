    "title": "How to stop location permission warning in Android 10",
    "content": "Ever since Android 10 came out it keeps putting unnotified message in the pull down list that tells me that this app and that app has been granted location permissions and that I can review and/or change the permissions at anytime by going to settings and making the change.  Although the notification could be considered to be a benefit to some users, I think these reminders over and over again that this app and that app has this permission to be a bit annoying.  Is there away to turn this specific notification off?\n\nLet me know.  Thanks.",
