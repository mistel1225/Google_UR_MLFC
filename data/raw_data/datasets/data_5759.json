    "content": "Plain and simple, the auto brightness on pixel 5 is GARBAGE. At least 4 or 5 times a day I have to manually increase it because it's not displaying properly and too dim.\n\nThe 2nd issue is with auto rotate. Whether I have it on auto, or the option where the icon pops up in the corner. It is also garbage. Auto just doesn't work sometimes. And with the icon setting, the icon often doesn't pop up all\n\nLove the phone otherwise but these things are getting annoying enough to make me switch to another device. this is my last ditch effort at a fix",
