    "content": "I've had my pixel 4a for about 2 months now. I've noticed that occasionally, my phone will refuse to open any apps, and when I try, they immediately crash. Every app. I'm not really sure what the common link is, but I have to restart my phone to use any apps once this happens. I do also try force stopping & clearing cache for apps, closing apps from multi-tasking, etc., but no dice.",
