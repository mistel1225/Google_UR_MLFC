    "content": "Past few months, my 3XL fingerprint reader has become very bad at detecting my fingerprint. I have to constantly wipe the reader and my finger every single time to get it to work properly.This just started 1-2 months back. Could this be due to any recent software update or is this a hardware failure?\nAnyone else facing similar issues?",
