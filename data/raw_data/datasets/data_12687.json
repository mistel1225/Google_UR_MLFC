    "content": "The maximum font size allowable on the pixel 4a is too small. I understand that the phone is smaller than my old one but I'd like to make the font bigger and the phone won't allow it. I don't want to carry readers around, just to use my phone. I don't care about cameras or speakers, I wanted a budget phone and if I could read the damn thing, this phone would be perfect.",
