    "content": "Okay so I reset the two and that worked fine did it the way with the buttons. Now here's the problem my mother flagged the other pixel as suspicious and she didn't realize what she was doing.... Now that pixel won't link to the only two accounts ever associated with it witch means it won't let me complete the restart... I went to Verizon store six times tryna transfer over to their service what a waste of time......\nIf I didn't have to witch from boost I wouldn't they are awesome and they're customer service agents are 100000 more capable then a Verizon employee..... But seriously how do I get the phone to complete the reset",
