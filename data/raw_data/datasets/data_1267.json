    "content": "My phone won't update and here are the problems. The phone audio while watching/listening to stuff on the phone has gotten worst! At first I thought it was my headphone but I tried it without and it was the phone audio messing up!! Then, the audio when you are talking to another person if you are not speaking loud prominent sound your call won't be heard! Also how google play music app no longer available to store your music and it being on YouTube music is not efficient unless you're only on the app!!",
