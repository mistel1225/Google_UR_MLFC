    "content": "Hello,\nI accidentally turned off my notifications for Google Home schedules. I have tried going into \"Apps and Notifications\" and into the Google notifications section to find somewhere to turn them back on. I can't seem to find a way. Had anyone else had this issue and know how to turn them back on please?\nThanks for your time",
