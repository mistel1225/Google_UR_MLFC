    "content": "When i first purchased a pixel phone, I was promised 100gb of free storage for as long as I own a pixel. without warning, it expired yesterday (8/26). An assistant with google help gave me 100 gb for 14 days so I can manage my files and email. I am still in need of more than 15gb and was promised more as long as I am a customer.",
