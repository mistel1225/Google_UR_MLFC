    "content": "My photos from my Samsung were backup on Google Photos.  I then transferred to a new Pixel 3 phone.  The photos did not show up on my Pixel.  I tried to search Google Photos for them.   I wish to find photos of my art projects that were in an album.  I can not figure out how to search to bring them all up.  I can search on one topic but not ALL my projects at once.",
