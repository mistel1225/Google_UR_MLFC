    "content": "During, or just after a phone call, when I remove the phone from the side of my face to use the key pad or to hang up, the screen remains black - which prevents me from doing those things. The phone seems to think it's still on the side of my head. I just asked, in another page, for help with my screen's lack of sensitivity for inputting data - it just occurred to me that these could be related.",
