    "content": "So I Upgraded in February from my Google Pixel 2XL to a Pixel 3. \nTo my frustration, VoLTE is not available on the Pixel 3 With Telenor. I've talked to the phone company and they say it's Google that hasn't enable it(or sent them the data/information on what it should be).\n\nIt's really sad because I love the phone but I'm not able to use it for phone calls and I'm being forced to use Facebook messenger calls or Whatsapp which I do not want to use. \nVoLTE was working perfectly on the 2XL and I now am starting to regret the switch and I'm contemplating on moving on to another brand. There are many Pixel users here I Norway please fix it :)\nI've been waiting and hoping for an update that would enable it but it has taken to long now.",
