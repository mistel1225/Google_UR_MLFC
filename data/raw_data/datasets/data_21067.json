    "content": "I have Smart Lock turned on and it works as advertised.  However, even in the location where it is set to work I often find when I turn the phone on with a tap on the screen (my preference) I see the line that says something like \"For added security\" then a request for pin entry.  I don't like or need that to happen but see no way to turn it off.",
