    "content": "I have all photos/videos taken synced to Google Photos. However, I notice that I also have a Camera folder in my library that only has some of the photos/videos I took. Can I just delete those photos since I already have them in Google Photos? It looks like those photos are taking up storage space on my phone, and I'm trying to clear them up.",
