    "content": "I cannot figure out why my Pixel 3 says I am in Baicheng, China. When I first get in the car and start up Android Auto, the weather often says it is way colder outside than it is and when I go to the weather app in AA it gives me the weather and forecast for Baicheng, China.\n\nAdditionally, when my wife looks for me in Google Maps she says that it shows me in China sometimes. However, when I use Waze or Google Maps with AA it displays where I really am just fine.\n\nI cannot figure out the disconnect. Is there a setting I am missing? Is there an issue with the phone? I do use Google Fi and use the VPN services provide with that but so does my wife and she does not have this issue. I don't think it is the phone because I used to have a Pixel 3 XL and it did the same thing for the few months I had that phone.",
