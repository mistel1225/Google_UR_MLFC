    "title": "In Camera App, Video volume too low.",
    "content": "When I take video on my camera app the volume is so low.  I have to turn it up to full volume just to hear it.  That's when I'm holding the camera right in front of me.  I've tried doing it in safe mode, clearing cache, force stopping and making sure app is up to date and nothing has worked.  I haven't yet uninstalled the camera app yet back to factory setting  because I'm afraid my photos will disappear.  I'll try that after I make sure my photos are backed up.  Any thoughts?",
