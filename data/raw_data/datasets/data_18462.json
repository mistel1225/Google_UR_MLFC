    "title": "Issues with Driving Mode Turning on randomly and Google Assistant chiming in when unprompted",
    "content": "I've tried restarting my phone in safe mode to see if the driving mode and google assistant problem still happens. It is continuing. Less evident (or no issue noticed) when I don't use earbuds. The earbuds seem to trigger the driving mode to turn on. When driving is on, the phone automatically disconnects my phone calls. Also while in driving mode, my audio apps will constantly be turning themselves off ( and on, but less frequently) and the Google Assistant will consistently interrupt asking what I want. Also before I went into Safe Mode my home screen wouldn't even come up. Google assistant was the only thing that would show up when I swiped my screen or used the lower screen back arrow. I had to restart my phone to get my home screen to appear. I was in an online chat with Pixel Hardware team and they were the ones that recommended I observe my phone for 30 minutes in Safe Mode. It seems as if the driving mode is mucking up the phone. Is there any way to disable this?",
