    "content": "Like the title says, I just bought this phone and I can't figure out why the ding won't play when the assistant opens. I've turned on switch access, started the phone in safe mode, check volume controls and nothing seems to work. I get the ding when I'm in my car or connected to Bluetooth but not when it's just the phone. Any thoughts?",
