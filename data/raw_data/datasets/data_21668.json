    "content": "Bought a refurbed Pixel 2 xl -condition \"like new.\" Had lost my previous Pixel xl phone; synced and uploaded the data, apps, accounts etc from the Pixel xl. The Pixel 2 xl worked fine for the first two days - in which time I had downloaded perhaps 6 new apps, and also deleted some of the previous apps. On the third evening the phone appeared not to charge. Once I noticed this and put it back on charge, it said charging slowly. It didn't make much progress in the hours I left it on. There was a day I left it on charge for 12 hours, and gained less than 50%. \nI have cleaned the charge port, tried different combinations of cable, power adapter and power socket. I have attempted a battery calibration. I have since tried charging in safe mode, with the same issue, so it appears not to be an app issue. That said, I have reset the phone to find that it charges well with no link to my accounts, apps etc. As soon as I link these back in, the phone informs me it will take 2 days to fully recharge (from 16%).\nThought on how to resolve this?",
