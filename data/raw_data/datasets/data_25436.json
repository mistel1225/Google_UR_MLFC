    "content": "Hi all,\nI updated to android 10 a while ago and I really miss a part of the Android 9 two-button navigation system.\nYou used to be able to swipe from left to right on the pill and hold to one side to go through all of your open apps.\nSince the update you can now only multitask between the last 2 opened apps by swiping, and holding across the navigation bar no longer lets you multitask like before.\n\nI really liked this feature, Is there a way to enable it or something?\n\nPixel 3 btw\n\nThanks.",
