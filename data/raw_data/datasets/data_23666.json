    "content": "I recently, sadly, moved from my original Droid Turbo to the Pixle 3a and have a problem that I cannot seem to get \"fixed\".\n\nIf I turn up the volume for text notifications, which is \"Media\" I get audible notifications/sounds from other apps. I didn't have this problem with the Droid Turbo. \n\nHow do I turn of notification sounds for all other apps, such as games, without affecting the sound for text notifications??? Also sounds from the apps themselves or from the ads within them, as in between levels of play?\n\nThank you...",
