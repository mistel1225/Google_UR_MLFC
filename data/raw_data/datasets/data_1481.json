    "content": "Dear team,\n\nThis is regarding my case ID 3-4489000031425 for which i am following up for more than 1 month. \n\nIssue : Facing coverage/Network issues in the new device and google support picked up the mobile for repair service. After 10 days, received the device without a fix and still having issues.\nI have been following up with the support team for more than 45 days and seems they are lethargic  about the case.\nFinally, they gave a feedback that in India, they don't have replacement/refund options and they can only provide repair service. Now again they are requesting to send the mobile for diagnosis after 45 days of follow-up. During this pandemic situation and being at work from home, i am more dependent on mobile and how can i again manage without a mobile again?\n\nBuying a New device, expensive and renowned brand, but when so much of functional issues happen, the support is very disappointing. I am stuck and Can someone please advice on the solution and how to take this further?\n\nRegards,\nJk.",
