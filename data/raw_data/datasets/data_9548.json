    "content": "Whenever I cast media to a chromcast (such as iPlayer or nowTV in particular) the notification sound pings continuously. This also happens when just playing content from within chrome and other apps (although not all the time). It normally stops after a minute or so, but is really annoying.\n\nI have tried to put the media notification onto silent notificaitons, but this option does not seem available, like in other notifications, in the swipe setting menu.\n\nThe issue seems like a bug, as I am unsure why you would want continuous notification when trying to play media content",
