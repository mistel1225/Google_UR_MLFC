    "content": "I am very disappointed with my recent experience regarding Google's handling of my case in damage protection warranty question. \n\n I bought a Pixel 3a in June and activate it joining Project Fi phone service in July within one month.  Later on there happened an accident causing a cracked screen.  When I contacted Google help, the staff told me that the damage protection warranty is invalid because - the google account used to activate Project Fi phone service is different from the google account used to purchasing the phone.  \n\nFor some reason, I did use a different google account when activating the phone service.  However, I can prove that I'm the owner of both google accounts and the Pixel 3a belongs to me all the time.  \n\nI communicated with Google help staffs for quite a few rounds via online chat as well as email without convincing them that the damage protection warranty should be valid and should go with the device, not the google account.  I have two main points - 1. I don't know that the damage protection is linked to the purchase google account, not the device. 2. when the phone is activated using another account, I have no idea (and receive no warning or notification) that it will invalidate the damage protection.\n\nI'd like to hear from you with your comments/opinions about what happens here - should my Pixel 3a keep its damage protection warranty even if the activation account is different from the purchase account?\n\nThank you all!",
