    "content": "I bought my phone from America, but I live in Bangladesh. The I used the device for three days only. And on the fourth day it developed this screen glitch that makes the display flash like a strobe light. I am heartbroken because, I saved up a lot of money to buy this dream phone of mine and I absolutely cannot buy another 1 thousand dollar plane ticket to return this unusable device. I demand refund.",
