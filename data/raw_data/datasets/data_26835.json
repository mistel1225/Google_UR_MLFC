    "content": "Since this morning I've not been able to hear incoming calls or texts and neither can I hear when on a phone call, they can hear me. However, media volume seems to work fine, i.e. Spotify , instagram etc. Alarm volume was working but not working either!\n\nBefore anyone suggests, I've checked the volume settings (obviously!), restarted my phone and also rebooted in safe mode to see if a third party app is causing the issue.\n\nAny suggestions??",
