    "content": "Pixel 4a does NOT seem to offer any way to turn on/off sync for certain Google apps as decribed in these Pixel Phone Help pages where it suggests\n\"Turn off auto-sync for certain Google apps\" and \"Turn off the apps you don't want to auto-sync.\" \nHOW? There is NO apparent WAY to do this. That is, going through the prescibed menus yields nothing that allows any specific Google Apps to have sync ON or OFF.\nThis is not under the \"Accounts\" nor under the specific app settings that I can find.",
