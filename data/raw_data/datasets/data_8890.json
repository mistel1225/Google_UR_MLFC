    "content": "I've just purchased a new Pixel 4a and installed my sim from my previous phone. It recognises the network provider in the settings but cannot find any network. I've tried with three other sim cards with active accounts and same thing. All sims work in other phones. I've tried various solutions posted online but no sign of any mobile signal. Any suggestions?",
