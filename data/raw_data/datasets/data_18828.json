    "content": "My phone syncs all Google accounts perfectly. The issue I have is that Google Calendar doesn't update frequently enough. My workplace has terrible cell service due to electronic equipment, so I update Google Calendar online. I work nights occasionally, and will set a reminder of something I need to do in the morning, however my phone doesn't usually sync until around 5pm. So, my reminder doesn't remind me. Is there any way to adjust or add sync times?",
