    "content": "Hello everyone,\n\nI am trying to get the Google \"Phone\" app to display only contacts from a specific third-party address book, not any contacts from my Google Account. In \"Google Contacts\" app I can easily select which contacts (= address books) to show with a simple setting in the search bar at top. Unfortunately, I can't seem to find any such setting in the \"Phone\" apps contacts, which shows contacts from all address books - surprisingly without any duplicates, though.\n\nIs there any way to show only contacts from third-party address book in \"Phone\" contacts? Or, if it's easier the other way around, can I hide all Google Account contacts in \"Phone\" app?\n\nAny help would is highly appreciated. Thanks in advance!",
