    "content": "Just bought a pixel 2 XL. Everyone I speak to hears an echo of their own voice when they are talking to me. I have checked accessibility options and made sure that the hearing aid option is not selected. I have done a safe Boot and the conditions still exist. Have also checked the microphone hole at the top and see nothing blocking it. Have tried covering it. Have also tried with a supcase cover on and off. Just updated to Android 9 after trying these options and the condition still exists.",
