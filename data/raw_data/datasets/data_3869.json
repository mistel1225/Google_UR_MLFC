    "content": "Hello everyone,\n\nMy Google Pixel 2XL started restarting on its own continuously, 8 times in the last couple of hours (at the end it restarted thrice back to back, like it restarted, turned on, and again restarted). \nDuring that time, it heated up to the point it was difficult to hold on to and the charge dropped rapidly from about 55% to 9% before the last restart. After which point, I switched it off as a safety measure since I do not know much about these things. \nMy usage in this duration was quite light, only using messenger and Facebook in clusters (not end on).  \nI have been using this device since late 2017 without any issues, till now. Updated to Android 11 earlier this year (if this information is relevant).\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated.",
