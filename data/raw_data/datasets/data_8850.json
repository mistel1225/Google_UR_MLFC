    "content": "I cannot read my notifications fast enough with the current way my phone is set up. When I press the lock button to look at the lock screen, I try to read my notifications but it automatically dims after 5 seconds and the screen blacks out 2 seconds after. I comstantly end up pressing the lock button and scrolling down to the notification I was previously reading before it blacked out. I would like to remove the automatic dim and at least be able to keep my lock screen open for 30 seconds.",
