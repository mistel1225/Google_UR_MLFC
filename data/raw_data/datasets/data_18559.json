    "content": "My Pixel XL has been constantly restarting this afternoon, only occasionally giving me like a couple minutes of use before going back to constantly restarting. My phone is effectively unusable in this state and I'm not sure what's causing it. It's happened in safe mode and it happened after a factory reset as well, but not while I was setting it up after the reset, weirdly enough. I'm not sure what's causing it or how to fix it.",
