    "title": "Pixel 2 charge port unreliable",
    "content": "I've owned my pixel 2 for roughly 6 months. In that short amount of time the charger port has increasingly become unreliable in terms of whether it will actually charge depending on what charger cord I'm using. Secondly, for the dongle that allows you to plug headphones in: It barely works and never really did even when it was new.\n\n lastly and unrelated... the UI for this forum is pretty awful and not very intuitive. I'd suggest looking at how most forums work versus the methods employed here.",
