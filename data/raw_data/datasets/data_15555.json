    "title": "After doing the Android 11 update, my pixel 2 xl is slower than ever and freezes non stop. Help.",
    "content": "I am just trying to use my phone normally. But apps keep freezing, screens keep freezing, apps close for no reason, texts won't show up for 10mins after the notifications. I did the new update, cleared history, cleared out some space, deleted photos and docs, restarted my phone multiple times. Nothing works. This all started when I did the new update.",
