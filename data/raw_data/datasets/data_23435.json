    "content": "So my phone (Google Pixel 3a) has lost all sound from the bottom speakers. I have had the phone in a life proof case, it has never been dropped or in a damp environment and just stopped while K was in the middle of watching a YouTube video. This is very disappointing especially considering the phone is less than 6 months old.",
