    "content": "I have noticed many people walk while browsing their phones. I do this on occasion as well, but notice you can sometimes walk into someone or something.\n\nI think it would be useful if the front camera had some kind of collision detection built in, to detect if you are approaching an object, or, if an object is approaching you. Just a subtle extra feature of the phone. It would perhaps beep to let you know something is approaching.",
