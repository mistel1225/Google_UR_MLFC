    "title": "Pixel 4 Automatically Deleted my Photos and Videos",
    "content": "I have a Pixel 4. It is around 10 months old. Prior to that I have owned a Pixel 2 for two years and know how to operate these phones well.\n\nI was deleting a single photo from my album and suddenly a huge number of my photos and videos were permanently deleted.\n\nThey are not in trash, or in any other albums. They are not in my Google photos album if I access via a desktop. \n\nI have contacted the support chat who advise me Google Photos do not have any staff who can be contacted via phone, email or chat and the only way to seek help is to post a message on here. I asked to be put through to a senior and I was assured twice that supervisor Eric was investigating my case, however despite numerous requests I have not even received an email from Eric to confirm this. \n\nGoogle chat is not working tonight, and the email option is also not functioning and returning with error messages. \n\nI would like to repeat that my phone automatically deleted a large number of my photos and videos permanently, and that Google are unable to offer me any support other than to post in a chat forum. \n\nAs someone who has previously highly recommended (and converted) a number of friends from iPhones to Pixels previously I am highly disappointed. \n\nIf this issue cannot be resolved and my photos and videos are irretrievable I will not be buying or recommending a Pixel phone again.",
