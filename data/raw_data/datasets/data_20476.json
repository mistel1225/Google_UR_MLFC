    "title": "Notifications Sounds way too loud",
    "content": "Is there any way to separate the notification sounds on the google pixel xl 4 from standard sound?  Like no matter how low I put everything notifications are always much louder than the rest of the phone. I guess I could just mute notifications? But I would really like to hear them at a more reasonable volume without impacting what I perceive to be normal volume for other applications. I've messed with all 4 volume bars and still can't figure out which one affects notification volume. Any insight into this? Thanks in advanced.",
