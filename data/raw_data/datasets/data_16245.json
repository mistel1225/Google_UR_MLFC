    "content": "USB File Transfer Mode not working on Pixel 2. Works perfectly fine with same laptop and cable on Pixel 3A but with Pixel 2, all options in USB preferences are greyed out. USB Debugging Mode is on, all suggestions from blogs, forum, posts tried. This is really frustrating. A flagship phone and can't transfer music from my laptop to the phone.",
