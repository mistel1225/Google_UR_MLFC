    "content": "So long story short over the past month my phone has kicked the bucket. The USB port out of nowhere stopped working (hardware issues),  nobody from the support team could help me, they suggested I just get a replacement. The problem was I still needed to get what I could off of my phone first. As I was getting close to figuring out a solution my battery died, and as I plugged it back in to recharge I received this message:\n\n\"Cannot load Android system. Your data may be corrupt. If you continue to get this message, you may need to perform a factory reset and erase all user data stored on this device.\"\n\nFrom what I'm gathering this could be another hardware issue. I was also really low on space when it shut down so maybe an automatic update happened, uninstalling the previous version, and it realized there was no space to install a new update. I heard I could try to clear the cache through recovery mode to try to fix this however recovery mode just takes me to the same screen. I've also heard of a solution using a computer, but unfortunately as previously mentioned my usb port barley even charges let alone connect to a computer.\n\nI guess my only option is a factory reset, and luckily since I'm still under warranty I'll get a replacement. I know I'm not going to be able to retrieve a lot of things like the extremely important texts that I need, but if anything I really want to recover the memories/pictures of the past year that I've been trying to get off of the phone. Please help.",
