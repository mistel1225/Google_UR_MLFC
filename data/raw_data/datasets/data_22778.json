    "content": "Last night, I charged my Pixel as usual. I unplugged it around midnight when it was fully charged. When I woke up around six and a half or seven hours later, it was at 51% battery when it normally would have been around 95%. I had no apps open at the time. I charged it as fully as I could while getting ready, getting it to about 90%. The battery continued to drain at a much faster rate than normal, losing 1% about every six or seven minutes.\nI'm not sure if this is related to the battery issue or not, but my phone resent a picture I sent to my friend (Message+ app, not the default Messages) twice, once at 2am while I was asleep and once at 7:36am. When the battery drain continued, I restarted my phone. My friend let me know that I had apparently texted her the same picture yet again, although it never showed up on my phone. I don't know if anyone has had the same kind of issue, mainly because I'm not sure how best to search for it, but I would appreciate any help with either/both of the issues.",
