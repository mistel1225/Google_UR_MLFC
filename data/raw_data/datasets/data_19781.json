    "title": "Why is Google Photos so horribly complicated?",
    "content": "I am trying to open a photo in my photos app, it continually gets sent to my \"Files\" folder. I have copied the file to the \"Photos\" app, it still does not show up. When I open the folder I tried to copy it into in my \"Files\" app it shows up that it's been transferred, but it hasn't. Now it literally shows a thumbnail on the cover of the \"Downloads\" album when I go into Google Photos, but when I open the \"Downloads\" folder it's nowhere to be found! I have tried tracking down the image online and downloading it that way, rather than through my email, it was exhaustive and it now shows that it has been added to my \"Downloads\" folder in Google Photos because there is ANOTHER thumbnail, BUT it is STILL NOT THERE when I open the folder itself in the photos app. I have done everything, given permissions to storage in settings for any app I would be saving media from, have tried copying the file and sharing it from Files to Google Photos, have sent it to myself via email and tried downloading it from there, have gone through an advanced image search for said image and downloaded it from there, have tried to copy it from Files to multiple folders in my Google Photos, nothing works!\n\nI regret buying this phone so much, it's been nothing but garbage in performing the most basic tasks of media storage. Please just tell me how to get this Google Photos app off my phone so I can install a better piece of storage software and be done with this headache until I buy anything else that isn't a Google product again.",
