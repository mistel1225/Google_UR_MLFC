    "content": "I have tried every single suggestion on these help forums and nothing works. I have a Pixel 2 and about 3,000 songs left over from my iPhone days. I never wanted them on my pixel and now can't delete them.  I can't get my google play to connect online where I should supposedly be able to delete all of my files. Finally, I cleared the google music app on my phone but all of the files are still there! \n\nEvery other \"hack\" idea on here no longer seems to work, or is outdated. \nI want them all gone without having to delete every single one individually, or reboot my phone. \n\nPlease. I'm ready to cry. Make it stop.",
