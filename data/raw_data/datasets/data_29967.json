    "content": "Since the June security update, my Pixel 3 takes multiple tries to connect with Uconnect and launch Android Auto. Usually I have to go to the USB settings and say \"let this device decide\" but that setting gets lost the next time I try. I've deleted the phone from the vehicle and recommended it. I've done the same thing with the phone.\n\nAlso, launching audio (Spotify and Google Podcasts) usually give me an error and no sound. \"Something went wrong. Please try again.\"",
