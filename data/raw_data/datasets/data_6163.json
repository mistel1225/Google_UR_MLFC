    "content": "I thought when I received a notification the screen would wake up, like when you touch to wake the screen. The screen would get bright.\n\nWith the Pixel 5, when I get a notification, the screen does show the notification but the screen doesn't light up, so it's hard to see the notification from a distance. Is there a setting in the Pixel 5 that will brighten the wake screen?",
