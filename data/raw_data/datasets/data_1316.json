    "content": "My replacement Pixel 2 came with a preinstalled Google camera app that opens in front-facing (selfie) mode and can't be changed. An error screen comes up and the camera doesn't work with other apps that need the camera. The app cannot be removed and reinstalled but I did try to update to no avail. I spent a lot of time emailing back and forth with Google and they said I have to wipe the phone and redo everything from scratch for them to know if it's a hardware or software issue before they can help. I may have to do that and spend hours resetting many apps to the way I want them because this phone is actually good in other ways with a good battery. I prefer the phone to phone transfer if I have to get another replacement phone. I'm wondering if that method would transfer the same bad camera app or if the app would already be loaded on a new phone and should be safe to transfer the rest by cable from phone to phone.",
