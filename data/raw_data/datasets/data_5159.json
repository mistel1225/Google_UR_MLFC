    "title": "Touch screen for part of a screen does not work",
    "content": "The touch screen stopped working for some areas of the screen. It started right while I was using the phone (a reading app) with a random ghost slide-down of a notification panel. Reboot calmed the panel, but the touch screen stopped working for the top of the screen (25%) and strips around 15% height in the upper half (see the attachment).\nTried everything from the list https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/6010316?hl=en\nNothing helped.  \nIs it firmware or hardware?\nThe last thing that I could try is to downgrade the firmware (according to https://developers.google.com/android/ota ). Should I try or there are other possible options I could test?",
