    "content": "I installed the October security update this morning on my Pixel 2 XL and since then my phone has been running hot and the battery has been draining like crazy.  I've had to plug it in to charge twice since 7AM this morning and while charging it's even hotter.  I've tried restarting the phone a couple of times which hasn't seemed to make a difference and AccuBattery doesn't show any usual battery usage from the apps that are running.  Any suggestions?",
