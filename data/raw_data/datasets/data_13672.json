    "content": "My phone was rebooting after the Android 11 update, and I thought it was stemming from WiFi and mobile network connectivity. So, I wanted to reset my network settings to see if that might help in the future. \n\nHowever, I think I have screwed up my phone now by interrupting the process. I can't get the phone past the \"please wait\" message while it's resetting my network settings and now I'm not sure that I have mobile network access anymore. What should I do? Will a factory reset fix this?",
