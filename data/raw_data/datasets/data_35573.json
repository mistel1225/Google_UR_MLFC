    "content": "My month-old Pixel 3 (as of February 2019) has developed an annoying bug. Sometimes, when I'm sitting down to watch a video on the device and flip the device horizontally, it fails to recognize that the device has been rotated and maintains its portrait orientation. Sometimes turning auto-rotate off and back on solves this hiccup, but other times it seems to only go away after a matter of minutes. I've rebooted the phone a few times, but the problem keeps returning. It's not a huge issue, but it is annoying and I would like to know if anyone else has had this problem and managed to solve it.",
