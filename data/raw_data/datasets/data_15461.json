    "content": "So, I'm having the infamous back plate peeling issue that seems to be rather common with the pixel 4 device... The problem is it seems to be impossible to contact google in the country I'm currently in (Portugal) to address the issue. I don't even have the \"Contact Us\" button option!\n\nThis is rather ridiculous, google fails on the hardware quality again and again, device after device, and seems to either refuse or make it incredibly hard to contact someone who could help.\n\nMy goal with this post is to try to get in contact (email or call) with someone responsible about dealing with these issues, I'm as much of a consumer as someone in the US so why am I being denied of official support regarding Google's own faulty hardware for living in a different place?",
