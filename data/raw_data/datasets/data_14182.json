    "content": "My downloaded music and other downloaded media cut in and out when the screen goes dark. It sounds like a streaming issue because the music picks up where it left off intermittently but these are downloaded and are not dependent on connection. I have given permission for spotify and audible to run in the background. I downloaded the music and books to ensure it was not a WiFi or streaming issue and ran the apps in airplane mode with no luck. I tried multiple wired headsets, bluetooth speakers, and the phones speakers",
