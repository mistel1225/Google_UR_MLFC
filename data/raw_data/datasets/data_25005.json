    "content": "I ran into that problem a day ago. I have already done everything that was suggested in this topic (https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/3705680?hl=ru ). It's not NFC, reset of notifications doesn't help either, moreover, this sound also happens in \"Don't disturb\" mode. What is it and how do I turn it off? I'm going crazy right now because of that sound.",
