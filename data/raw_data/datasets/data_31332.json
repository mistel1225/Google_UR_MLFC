    "content": "Hi a couple of weeks I was facing the same problem...mobile did not charge and when I inserted headphones, mobile just switched off and showed the battery charging image. After I contacted Google through chat, the mobile returned to its normal function state after a factory reset. The same thing happened to me yesterday after I did an Android 9 update. I tried to contact Google but the chatting option is no longer available. I tried a factory reset but this time it did not work. Mobile still not charging and headphones not working. Any idea how I can fix it? I am quite sure the problem is with the software not the hardware.",
