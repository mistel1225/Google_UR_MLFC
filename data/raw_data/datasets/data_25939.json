    "content": "2 Days ago my Pixel 3 start to restart itself into a loop.\n\nIt's like the phone is turned on, then the off-menu appearing, then the camera app, back and forward, and finally the phone restarts itself, and doing the same issue.\nNo need to say I couldn't use the phone.\n\nTried \"Safe mode\" - didn't work.\nI tried getting into recovery mode, which was a pain because the phone tried to restart, but finally managed to wipe and factory reset.\nThe phone worked well again for 2 days, and now it started the issue again.\n\nI guess if it was a hardware issue, the phone wouldn't come back to normal, so maybe it must be a software issue?\n\nPlease,\nWhat should I do next?\n\np.s.\nI can't use the warranty, because I've bought the phone in another country.",
