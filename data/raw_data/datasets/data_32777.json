    "content": "I purchased a Google Pixel 2 XL from Telus in Canada. I have just moved here from the UK. The kind gentleman at the store offered to transfer the contacts etc from my UK phone to the new Canadian Pixel 2. For some reason the phone is now convinced it is English and in England. It will not allow me to download and use Canadian or North American specific apps. I need to download some Canadian specific content. My Google and Gmail accounts were opened in the UK a few years ago. How can I change my Google account, Gmail account but mainly my Pixel 2 XL so it is Canadian? Many thanks.",
