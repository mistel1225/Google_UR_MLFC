    "title": "Pixel 4 requests to support LHDC codec",
    "content": "I checked some information and found that the LHDC codec was merged into the Android operating system's source code when Android 10, but unfortunately, Pixel 4 does not support the LHDC codec. Nowadays, more and more headset manufacturers are starting to sell LHDC-supporting Bluetooth headsets, such as Sennheiser and Xiaomi. I hope that the LHDC codec can be integrated, like the LDAC codec, in the next Android operating system update.",
