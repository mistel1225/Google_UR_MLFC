    "title": "Pixel Stand not causing app to start",
    "content": "I have a Pixel Stand I'm using with a Pixel 5. At first, it all seemed to work fine. It'd start charging and boot the app up when my phone was on it, showing pictures when the room was bright and the clock/assistant button combo thing when it was dark.\n\nAt some point though that changed. It's still charging just fine when it is on it, but it is no longer launching the lock screen app, instead just showing the basic Always On display. I'm not certain when this started happening as I've not had my phone on the stand much during daylight hours recently and the difference between the Stand's night mode and the normal AOD is pretty minimal.\n\nAnyone have any clue as to what setting I may have changed that broke this? I've been trying to set up a lot of smart home features recently and have had to make a lot of changes to some system settings to try and iron out some setup and connection issues I was having.",
