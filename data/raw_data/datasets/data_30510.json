    "content": "So far I've tried developer options, rebooting the phone, different chargers, different outlets, different sets of headphones. \n\nMy USB-C port seems to be invisible to the phone.  So, it won't charge.  It won't send audio through to my pixel wired earbuds.  It's like the port isn't a part of the phone at all. \n\nPreviously, it's worked perfectly.  I updated my apps as always thru the play store and afterwards, the entire phone has shut itself down multiple times and NOW it won't charge or recognize the wired earbuds. However, Bluetooth audio still works.  My main concern is that I won't be able to charge it at all after it dies in a few hours",
