    "title": "Pixel 2: Text messages randomly not going through - AT&T",
    "content": "Beyond frustrated with a continual issue not sending/receiving texts on my Pixel 2.  I bought it from Google and use AT&T as my carrier.  I've tried all of the weird hacks I've found on the web to fix (disabling VoLTE etc) and it doesn't help.  It is with group texts as well as individuals.  In the group texts, there are both iPhone and Android users (specifically Pixels like mine) and it happens intermittently with EVERYONE'S texts.  They simply don't come through, or mine don't appear in the thread.  \n\nEven in a text with just one user, who has a new Samsung Galaxy Android, it is happening.\n\nPlease help.  It's becoming a huge issue for me.  I researched getting the newest Pixel, but it doesn't seem device specific from the reports I've seen online.  I've cleared cache and storage in the messages app.  Last summer, I actually factory reset my phone.  Didn't help.  \n\nI have also considered just getting a d&*n iPhone, even though I despise them.\n\nPlease don't suggest using whatsapp.  I see that as a response, but I cannot get all of the people I text to download a specific app because my phone's native app is jacked up.  \n\nAny ideas?  Suggestions?",
