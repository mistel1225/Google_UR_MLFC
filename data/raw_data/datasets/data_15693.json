    "content": "I would like to exchange my brand new Google pixel 4a for another one? The reason why I'm requesting this is because the one I currently have one of the speakers does not work. I wondered why this phone was so quiet even with the volume all the way up and just now realized that the left speaker doesn't work at all.",
