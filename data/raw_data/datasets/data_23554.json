    "title": "Pixel 3a freezes when making.or receiving phone calls",
    "content": "Whenever I make or receive a call my phone freezes. When I receive a call it will continue to ring, but the screen doesn't turn on to let me answer. When I make a call, as soon as it starts ringing, the phone freezes and then I cannot disconnect the call. Only thing that seems to pull the phone out of the frozen state is to hold the lock button and restart it. I bought the phone recently (black Friday) and issues started almost right away.",
