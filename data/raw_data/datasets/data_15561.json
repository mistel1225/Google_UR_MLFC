    "content": "After \"upgrading\" to android 11, i noticed that i couldn't take screenshots just by holding down the power button and selecting the option from the screen.  To fix this, I turned on 3-gesture navigation.\n\nThe problem is, when I swipe up, no matter where I swipe up, it just accesses the app drawer and not the active app \"cards\", if that makes sense.  Everywhere I go it tells me to swipe up and hold, but again, it just accesses the app drawer.  How do I access my active apps?",
