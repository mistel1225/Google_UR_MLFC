    "content": "Hello dear community.\nFew days ago I bought new Google Pixel 4XL (128Gb). My previous mobile phone is Google Pixel 2 (64Gb).\n\nFirst of all I would like to check a camera - rear camera is good and I like it, but selfie camera take poor photos compared with my old Google Pixel2..\n\nLet me show you:\n1. Google Pixel2\n\n2. Google Pixel 4XL\n\n\nPhotos was taken in same conditions and in the same time.\n\nBoth devices have highest photos quality setting:\nFace retouching: natural\nMotion: off\nCamera photo resolution: full resolution\nSame camera app version: 7.2.016.279154257\nBoth devices on Android 10\n\nIt's only one pair of photos but I took a lot of photos and Pixel2 takes more detailed photos than new Pixel 4XL.\n\nIs any thoughts about this problem? Right now I'm very disappointed...\n\nHope Google support will observe my small post.",
