    "content": "I am trying to get a return label for an approved Assurant claim.  I have called Assurant who told me to call google support.  I called google support who transferred me to Assurant.  I have done this twice now so hoping this post will break me out of the infinite loop.\n\nAssurant claim is: Claim Number: 48820235, previous support # case ID:3-4088000031106\n\nPS At least google support was able to transfer me instead of making me call myself.  So I suppose +1 there\n\nUpdate:  Talked to google support again and they told me Assurant would have to give me the label.  Then I called Assurant again and they told me since the replacement phone came from a google warehouse I would need google to give me a return label.  Tracking number for the replacement device which I received is 926935565082.  The assurant agent seemed to think if I told google support that they would be able to help me.  I still do not understand how all this happened but I will just keep looping between Assurant and Google Support.",
