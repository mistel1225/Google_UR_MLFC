    "title": "Pixel 3 Vibration Stopped Working",
    "content": "In January my original Pixel 3 stopped vibrating. I went through all the troubleshooting with Google Fi support via calls, emails, and chat, including safe mode, vibration apps, every setting possible. They determined it must be a hardware issue, so I paid my insurance deductible and received another phone.\n\nNot a week later, same thing happened to second phone. I was either convinced there was a hardware flaw, or more likely a software issue. I didn't want to pay for another replacement phone, so I have just dealt with no vibration for three months.\n\nToday, I was pushed a phone update, and voila the phone vibrates for the first time in 3 months....I'm sharing this in case it is helpful to others who ran into this vibration issue, and to the community in case it helps pinpoint why the failure was occurring in the first place.",
