    "content": "About 30 minutes after I unplugged my fully charged Pixel 1, it shut off.  I held down the power button to turn it back on, and the startup screen popped up, then the screen went black, then the startup screen popped up again, then went back to black. It did this several more times, then just shut off for the rest of the day. I was unable to get to a charger until later that evening, and when I did, the battery icon popped up, and I was hopeful!  I let it charge for a few minutes, and tried turning it back on.  It went back to the startup screen, black screen, Startup, black, back and forth again and again and has been doing so for the last 30 minutes.\nIs there anything I can do to bring my baby back to life?\n\nAny advice is appreciated!",
