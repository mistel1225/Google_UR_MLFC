    "content": "As far as I can see I've only ever connected my personal gmail to my phone. The left hand side of my screen is unresponsive and support will only talk to me about repair options if I contact them via the email 'linked' to my phone. They are unable to tell me how to discover what this linked email is. I cannot see any accounts in my phone other than my personal gmail. Any ideas?",
