    "content": "I'm wondering if the Motion Sense will be exported to Malaysia. If it doesn't work in countries that are not supported, does the face unlock work as fast as advertised? And also does google plan to sell their hardware items in Malaysia in the future? I really want to buy Google's items but having to import their things everytime annoys me. Thanks in advance",
