    "title": "Updated to Android 11 last night. This morning several apps are connectivity issues.",
    "content": "Updated to 11 on my Pixel 4 and some apps are having connectivity issues. Pandora works fine, but Spotify says it has no internet connection. Images won't download in messaging, email doesn't work, and the Espn Fantasy app just has the spinny loading thing. Youtube is working fine. This is super frustrating.",
