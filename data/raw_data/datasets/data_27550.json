    "content": "Hey guys,\nMy pixel is pretty weird, this is the first time I've seen a real problem with it and it happened before I upgraded to Android 10. The sound just stopped working along with the P2 connector, and every time I try to play a song, video, call and etc, my cell phone hangs and if I force a few times, the cell phone restarts. Sometimes the phone will restart itself and the sound will work again for a short time (3-5 days) and stop again. I'm in doubt because it appears to be some software problem. I formatted and the sound worked for 2 weeks (along with P2). What can I do?",
