    "content": "Hey all. When I take a video longer than 22 minutes and 14 seconds, the clip splits and a new clip begins. The video doesn't stop recording but it just creates two clips instead of one seamless one. Is there a way I can fix this, or at least tips on an easy way to put the two clips back together would be appreciated. (I've tried imovie but there's always a hiccup where the split is.)",
