    "content": "While using an OEM USB-C, to connect my pixel 2 XL to multiple computers running Windows 10 I get disconnected intermittently.  Upon opening Device Manager and Uninstalling the USB driver for phone I get mixed results??? Sometimes it will file transfer for a few seconds, other times minutes, but most offtenly I get a device error from Windows 10 that won't allow the connection.\n\nI have done the following...\nTested multiple OEM USB-C cords, including a brand new one that I got with my pixel 3.\n\nShutdown computer\n\nShutdown phone\n\nTested on other laptop also operating Windows 10\n\nHad the USB-C port cleaned professionally\n\nI have also followed advise from previous posts regarding the issue.\n\nI hope someone can help me with this I really feel that is a software related issue.  Please note here that I have specifically checked that both the pixel 2 XL and the Windows 10 are up-to-date.\n\nThank you",
