    "content": "Hello everyone,\n\nI recently bought Google Pixel 2. Today I had the phone in my hand and I hit a chair by mistake. The hit was very light, hence my hand wasn't sore. But suddenly the phone showed a blue screen with lines and then the screen went black. I tried to turn it on but the screen did not go on, however, I noticed the phone vibrated when I touched the screen. It also vibrated when I rang it with another phone. I tried to do a reset, hard reset, safe mode... but it doesn't work. However, the screen goes white for a split of a second and then black again. I plugged it to the laptop and it recognises the device. I tried also all the option Google gives in their troubleshooting page. Nothing works. What's going on with my phone?\n\nThanks",
