    "title": "(Pixel 3 XL) Why does my charger keep turning on and off when plugged in?",
    "content": "First off, I have had this phone since mid February, along with the charger that came when I bought it. I've not done anything special do the charger, I've only used it normally, but now it stopped working. When I plug it in, the charger usually doesn't work, but sometimes it goes on and off in sequences. Does this has something to do with the charger, or the device? I really hope that this is a malfunction and not because of the products quality.",
