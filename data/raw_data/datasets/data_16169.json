    "content": "I filed a service request for getting my Pixel 2 XL repaired. I was promised by the customer support that the whole process will not take more than 19 days. My phone was collected on August 6. I was prompted to pay for the repair on August 15 and I paid up by August 16/17. The estimated delivery date at that point was August 22. Four days hence, the website shows that the phone is still under repair and the ETA keeps getting pushed ahead each day.\n\nI tried reaching out to the customer support but the chat option is disabled and the callback takes forever. They make me hold for 15-20 minutes with no response, even though it says that the wait time will be less than a minute. Why, Google?",
