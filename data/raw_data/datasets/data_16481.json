    "title": "why does Android 11 screen recording video got compressed when I view the videos back?",
    "content": "I am trying the screen recording and was excited about it but when I recorded anything the video becomes compressed and not at the right size, the videos suddenly became like 1:1 squared video. Doesn't matter if I'm in vertical or horizontal it does that. \n\nThe only solution that I found is when recording in landscape I gotta stretch the video to make it look normal (in youtube at least that's the only thing that I tried).\n\nAlso just adding one more thing, why can't I record spotify? is it because of the DRM? is there any way to bypass that or no? also how can I record youtube audio meanwhile I can't with spotify? what are the other apps that I can't record audio with?",
