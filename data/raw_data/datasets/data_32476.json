    "content": "Every time I transfer music from my computer to my pixel 2 via bluetooth, it shows all the files in recent downloads and I can preview them, but after previewing they disappear from that queue and then cannot be found in the file organizer or in the Play Music app. In the past, I've been able to find them hiding in some odd place (that I cannot remember,) and then I have to hit \"download\" again before I can open them in Play Music",
