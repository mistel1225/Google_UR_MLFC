Then I'll get a screen that reads, \"Get the full assistant experience. With your permission, your assistant can help you with that and more.\" And below that is a button that says \"Get started.\" \n\nWhen I click it, it just takes me back to the original voice command, and I'll say \"call Nadine,\" and it will just keep doing the same thing over and over.\n\nI'd like to ask it to call someone and it just does.",
