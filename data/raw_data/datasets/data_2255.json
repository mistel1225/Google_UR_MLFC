    "title": "Pixel 4XL - Smart Lock - Trusted Places - not working at \"Home\"",
    "content": "A few weeks ago, my Smart Lock - Trusted Places stopped working.  It continued to work on my wife's Pixel 4a.  I had read that Google Play Services might be the issue.  My Pixel 4XL is on version 21.18.14 (150400-372847196).  My wife's Pixel 4a was not on that version.  Once my wife's Pixel 4a Google Play Services was updated to Google Play Services version 21.18.14 (150400-372847196), her Smart Lock - Trusted Places also stopped working.  So, my assumption is Google Play Services version 21.18.14 (150400-372847196) breaks the Smart Lock - Trusted Places functionality.",
