    "content": "I just got a Pixel 4A for my Google Fi account this week.  My old phone is a Moto X4.  When setting up the Pixel, I did the hardwire transfer of my Google account, apps, and everything from the Moto to the new Pixel.  \n\nI just noticed today the Gmail won't open PDF files, it says downloading and stays at 0% indefinitely.  Similarly, when I try to download episodes on the Google podcast apps, it starts spinning but doesn't actually download.  With other apps and accounts, I am able to download files, it just seems to be Google accounts.\n\nHow do I fix this?",
