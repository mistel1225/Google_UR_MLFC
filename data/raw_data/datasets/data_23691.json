    "content": "Hello my Google Pixel 4 has stopped making ringtone sound and notification sounds, and some days ago started to make weird sounds while recording, like a low buzzing noise. The ringtone and notification issue has been going on for maybe two weeks where it happened while I was watching a youtube video. The sound of the video suddenly cut off for a little bit making weird noises and got back to normal. But after that I don't get notifications or calls, missing the whole purpose of having a phone- that it rings. It also stopped vibrating with calls so I have no idea when someone calls me. It is quite frustrating. \n\nWhat I have tried to fix it:\n- Checked do not disturb, no it is not on- I have turned up the volume.\n- Changed ringtone or notification sound, no it did not work they don't even preview. But I can play media sounds.\n- Turned off and on my phone\n- Factory reset\n- Safe mode\n\nI do get notification sounds if I am playing media sounds and it overlaps, but the ringing does not do that.\n\nI bought my phone around 7th December.",
