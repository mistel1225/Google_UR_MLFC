    "title": "Pixel 5, speaker prioritizing fluctuates, goes from top to bottom speaker randomly",
    "content": "When not on a call, or perhaps on them too, not sure yet, the speaker that is being prioritized switches randomly.\n\nExample:  I'll be playing a game or video and at first the speaker balance is basically the same for the top and bottom speaker.  Then, randomly, the bottom speaker will decrease in volume while the top speaker increases.  Curiously, it fixes itself if I turn the volume up a ways while it's doing this, but typically when I turn the volume back down to where I had it, it will do this speaker volume shift shortly afterwards again.  This is incredibly annoying.\n\nI've already tried turning on dynamic listening/volume. (it did this before turning that on, I read that this might fix the issue.  It didn't)\n\nMy system is up to date.\n\nIt doesn't matter what media it is, it will do this on anything.\n\nIs there either a) a way to disable the top speaker entirely if not on a call, b) fix this issue to make it work correctly, c) or is this still not been able to be resolved?",
