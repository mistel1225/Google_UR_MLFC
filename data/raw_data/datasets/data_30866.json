    "content": "My camera on my Pixel 3 keeps crashing. When it does open, I can take pictures until I leave camera mode. However, when I try to go back into camera mode, it won't load. It's like a one time use situation. Even just looking at the picture I just took can keep it from working.\n\nI can restart my phone and sometimes get it to work again, but it's still a one time use.\n\nOther apps that use my camera can work if the camera hasn't been opened already. If I'm using my camera and it won't load, I can go into apps that use the camera and it's crashed there, too.\n\nAll of my apps are up to date. I've also tried clearing the camera cache which doesn't seem to do anything. \n\nI've tried getting Google Assistant to find the issue, but it just searches forever and never finds anything.\n\nWhen it crashes, the camera screen opens up. It then doesn't show any picture of what I'm looking at. The camera button goes to a darker shade of grey. It thinks for a few seconds and then closes the camera app completely by itself. \n\nClearing the camera from recently used apps doesn't do anything.",
