    "title": "New 4a: Internet stops working for about a minute, strong wifi and other devices work fine",
    "content": "I got a new Pixel 4a a few days ago and since the beginning I've been having an internet problem several times per day. The internet suddenly stops working. I have a strong wifi signal and am connected to cellular data when it happens. Loading pages in chrome the progress bar will hang at about 5% no matter what site I try. All other apps just go into endless loading.\n\nI've tried forgetting the wifi and reconnecting, doing a full router factory reset, doing a phone factory reset and not restoring a backup from my old phone. Nothing has helped. \n\nOther devices (both wifi and wired) don't have a problem. Any help would be appreciated as I really like the phone, but this is just frustrating.",
