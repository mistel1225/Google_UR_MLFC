    "content": "Hey, so when I open apps on my phone (mostly third-party apps) after a while, they will freeze and send me back to the home screen. I have checked for updates in the app, there are none. I have uninstalled the app and re-installed them, but they don't work after I shut it out for the first time. I've tried checking for updates on my phone, but there aren't any. I've put my phone into safe mode, checked the google apps, and none of them time out. I deleted all of my recent apps, the problem still happens. I have restarted my phone, and still nothing works. I just want to do stuff on my phone again without it timing out.",
