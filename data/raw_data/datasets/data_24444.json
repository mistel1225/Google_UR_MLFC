    "content": "Hello everyone, I have a problem with my original pixel phone. the battery will be as low as 40-50% and the phone shuts down. The phone will not turn back on until you plug it into a charger. At which point you can turn it back on within 30 seconds and it will have a charge around 55-60%. So I know that its not a battery issue.\nI've tried all the recommended solutions from Google.\n\n·Reboot\n\n·Install latest updates (was already on the latest update)\n\n·Check battery usage report for apps draining the battery (there were none, and the report did not add up to the amount of battery drain)\n\n·Reboot in safe mode, to disable all 3rd-party apps\n\n·Factory Reset\n\nNone of these resolved or mitigated the problem.  Furthermore, on occasion, after the device dies and I plug it in and power back on, there will be a drastic change in the reported battery level - i.e. 59% prior to dying, 8% when powering it back on.  I can then reboot it again and it will report 68%.\nMy warranty is expired but this is pretty f***ing unacceptable.",
