    "content": "I have a Pixel 4 and an Kenwood DMS8020DABS unit. The worked nicely together until I received the latest Android 11 update. Now it will start and then after 5 minutes disconnect the wireless. The head unit will still show Android Auto frozen. There was older threads on Pixel 3 that claimed that it was batter saver etc. I have already disabled all these and it still does the same. Looking at threads, it seems to be a common occurrence",
