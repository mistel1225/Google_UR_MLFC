    "content": "Pixel 3a started flashing green just before unlock after the device has been asleep for a minute or two. \n\nAlso very apparent during boot as the device will not boot to the Google logo but instead flashes green. Multiple long presses of the power button are needed to turn on device.\n\nThis is screaming hardware issues. Is this a known issue? And how to resolve?",
