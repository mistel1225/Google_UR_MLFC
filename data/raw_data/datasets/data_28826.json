    "content": "Starting a few months after purchase (and continuing now for a couple of months), my pixel 3 rear-facing camera has shown non-linear distortions in the image that flicker in and out, along with very poor focus stability.  Pictures are worth a thousand words:\n\nhttps://photos.app.goo.gl/6QoC36SX5UAFCAXe6\n\nThe first is a still image which needs to be viewed with Motion On.  Notice that the image is generally still, but on the left side there is a non-linear distortion of the image that comes and goes.  I see this effect quite frequently in my photos and on the screen while framing a photo.\n\nThe second is a video where I am panning back and forth a bit.  You can see the focus jumping in and out at high frequency and hints of the image non-linear distortion.\n\nI don't see these problems with the front-facing camera.",
