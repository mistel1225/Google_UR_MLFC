    "content": "I have purchased new phone on Oct 3rd and I have received a handset that manufactured on March 2019. During usage, I'm facing a problem that my battery drains very fast that I'm getting only 4 to 5hrs SOT. I have lowered brightness to minimum, unistalled all third party apps and turned off GPS and did everything possible. Also updated to 10 and all apps updated. Still problem persists. What should I do ??",
