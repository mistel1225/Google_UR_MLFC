    "title": "Pixel 2: Notification Volume DURING CALLS",
    "content": "First, let me say that I understand how to access the four volume sliders for Media Volume, Call Volume, Ring Volume and Alarm Volume, and I understand that in current versions of Android, \"Ring Volume\" controls volume for both incoming call rings and notifications.  I also understand that many people have complaints about that coupling, and have adapted settings on the DND feature as workarounds for their issues.\n\nIn my case though, DND customization won't help.  I do want to be able to hear my ringer and notification sounds at all times.  Currently, I'm very happy with the volume when the phone is in my pocket, sitting next to me, on the other side of the room ... wherever.  It's fine, it's great, it's set at a little over 1/3.\n\nBUT ... when I'm ON a call and have the phone against my ear, the notification alerts come in at SUCH a high volume that I'm constantly yanking the phone away from my head and yelping in pain.  Sometimes a series of e-mails or messages will come through while I'm on a call, and my ears are literally left ringing afterwards.  This is going to cause long-term damage.\n\nI do need to be able to have audible alerts while I'm on a call -- no, I don't want to use DND to completely silence them, and no, I don't want my phone constantly vibrating while I'm on a call.\n\nThere are tons of volume control apps out there, but I haven't found any that will help me.  Does anyone know of an app that will let me customize in-call notification volume without also changing the standard notification volume for when I'm NOT on a call?\n\nAppreciate any tips or suggestions!  Thanks everyone.",
