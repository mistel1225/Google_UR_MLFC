    "content": "Has anyone been able to resolve this issue. I have a Google Fi Pixel 5 (refurbished replacement under a warranty issue in March) and am trying to transfer service to Verizon from Fi. Verizon is telling me that my IMEI is incompatible with their service even after the app said that it was compatible and allowed me to place an order for service and sent a Verizon SIM.\n\nIs or isn't the Google Fi Pixel 5 compatible with Verizon and has anyone else been able to successfully transfer a Google Fi Pixel 5's service to Verizon? Verizon customer service says they cannot get around the IMEI being \"incompatible\"",
