    "content": "The camera on the phone isn't opening at all. The screen shows black and after a long time shows the image but freezes immediately. I looked up on how to fix it and found the following  -\n1. Restarted in safe mode\n2. Uninstalled latest downloaded apps\n3. Reset to factory settings.\n\nNone of the above has worked. My phone is 3 months old. Any help to fix the problem is appreciated.",
