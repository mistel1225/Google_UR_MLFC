    "content": "ಠ_ಠ Annoyed & Disappointed ಠ_ಠ like many other Pixel owners, due to persistent issues lately with Pixel & Android update. \nThe rear camera stopped working on Pixel devices from long since and it hasn't been resolved yet. Haven't seen an official statement or response from \"@Google\" so far! Adding to this frustration, connection to Fitbit no longer works! (while can connect successfully on an iOS device!! so not seemingly a Fitbit problem). Tried various troubleshooting process posted on Google community. None of them are guaranteed to fix the problem.\n\nSounds like a major screw-up in Google's history :-(",
