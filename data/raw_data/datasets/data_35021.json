    "content": "I have tried all the available troubleshooting options on the Help Center titled\n\"Fix a Pixel phone that won't charge or turn on\". \n\nWhat happened was as I was recording a video, the picture froze.  In order to reset this I clicked on the power button to return to the lock screen, however the screen just went black and never turned back on again.  Now when I try to charge the phone, the charge screen does not show up, nor does the phone turn on anymore. \nThe only response I can get from the phone is when holding down the volume and power keys for approximately 30 seconds, a red dot blinks in the upper right hand corner.",
