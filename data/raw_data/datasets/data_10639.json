    "content": "Hello my Pixel 4xl received the security update I believe for the month of December 2020 - I updated it last night. All over the news - they are saying that the Feature Drop should be available for Pixel devices now... that include HOLD FOR ME, and other new features. I am excited to use the hold for me feature because I am on hold often for work.\n\nWondering why I did not get the Feature Drop? Do I need to turn it on somehow? I looked through all of my settings. Is it possible that I am last on the list for the rollout possibly? I have Verizon. As of 12PM CT 12.8.2020 I have checked for an additional update and I do not have one.",
