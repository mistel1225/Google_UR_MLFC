    "content": "I am trying to reach someone to start a claim for a replacement phone. I am under warranty. I have factory reset my 4a 5 times since December (I bought it on Nov 28) just to keep the audio / media working. Now I want to file a claim so I can get this obvious manufacturer defected phone replaced. But all I get is an infinite loop and no contact number. The 3 step \"contact us\" never is an option I can click on. \nI regret ever buying a google device.",
