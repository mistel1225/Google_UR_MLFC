    "title": "Is the Carrier Hub app from Sprint necessary?",
    "content": "Is this app necessary? I was on the Files Go app and this Carrier Hub app showed up as an app that hasn't been used since like, 4 weeks ago, so I uninstalled it. I did a little more digging and the app description states it's responsible for things like VoLTE and Sprint WiFi Calling, but since uninstalling it, these things still work perfectly fine, as well as texting and Chat Features on Messages. I would imagine it's okay since Pixel phones have the Carrier Services app. I just wanted to know if this could cause potential issues in the future, and also to let people know that this app probably is not necessary to have on your device.",
