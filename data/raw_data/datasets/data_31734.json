    "content": "Why is their no accessibility option for those with dyslexia to use the Dyslexie font?\n\nI've found the only possible way to do this is to install another launcher which is something that i'm not willing to do as I bought the Pixel for it's plain android system. I don't want to have to install a poxy launcher that will change the phone just to do such a simple thing.\n\nThe only option is to change the font size which doesn't help anyone with dyslexia. Such a simple option would make things easier for those getting strained eyes. I only recently discovered that such a font exists and the difference that it makes. I would love to see the option included.",
