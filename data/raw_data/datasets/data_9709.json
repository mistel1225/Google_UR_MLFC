    "content": "I want my Bluetooth speaker/headphones to reconnect automatically when I turn the speaker or headphones on.\n\nTurning bt on/off, restart phone does nothing.\n\nDevices are paired.\n\nI have to go into settings>connected devices>media device each time or it doesn't do anything at all.\n\nIs there some menu option I can't seem to find that fixes this? It's a really stupid flaw to have in any phone -but especially the flagship Android device from Google themselves.",
