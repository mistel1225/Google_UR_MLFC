    "content": "starting from yesterday touch screen no more responds, connecting a mouse I can fully interact with my pixel 3a (latest android, build number QQ1A.200105.002). no issue from google play protect, no security patch to install, no hidden code tried out. I switched off developer mode without changes in the issue.\nI did not perform a factory reset, before I would like to test the screen.",
