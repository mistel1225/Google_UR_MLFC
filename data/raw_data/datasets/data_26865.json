    "content": "So its a GOOGLE device and that cannot detect whether my phone is in my pocket !! Calls are rejected / Answered while pulling out from pocket !! So I guess the Proximity sensor cant detect pocket mode/ protect from unwanted dialing/ screen activity !! WOW So Smart !! So much for pixel experience !\nAnd i was in Que for 30 mins for support ! Really i shouldn't have switched from iphone  , decision to regret.",
