    "content": "I just bought a brand new Pixel 3a from US amazon and shipped it overseas to me in Kuwait, but ever since i've been using it since day 1, every few minutes or so the entire screen would freeze, then the System would crash, yes even during the setup process, I've factory wiped this device at least 5 times so far and nothing has changed, I tried safe mode and everything, it still bugs out where nothing would be responsive, not even the buttons then i'd wait for 2-3 minute a message will show up that System UI has crashed or w/e that is on, the device does not have any 3rd party programs on it, or even is setup with an account, brand new fresh. my problem is that I can not send it back for warranty so I am trying to find a solution for it, sending it back would require to pay 30%-40% of the price I paid on a very limited time which I am not able to do.\nhttps://photos.app.goo.gl/Vqo22DviEH4Dkp7C7\nhere is the picture of it crashing during the setup process right after system wipe",
