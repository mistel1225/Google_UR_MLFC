    "content": "A week or so ago, while taking pictures, my 4xl started having intense wild glare, on anything with any amount of light. Didn't matter if it was a dull light or a bright one. The blurry glare would stretch across my screen. If I hit the 2x zoom, it would go away, but as soon as I went back to normal, boom, crazy blurry glare everywhere. \n\nI will attach some pictures I took, just for this message, so you know they're recent. I bought this phone to use mainly for the camera, and have bragged on the capabilities to everyone. I am a author, but over the past couple of years, photography has taken up much of my time. \n\nI have a DSLR, but this phone takes such amazing pictures, and is easy to carry. I haven't quite had this phone a year, maybe if it were a few years old, I could see something not working as well. I searched the internet for answers, with no luck. \n\nLess intrusive, but still terrible, the vertical lines that sometimes appear, when trying to take a picture are terrible. Please, please help me fix this issue. I have tried every fix online I could find, followed all the steps, but no luck at all.\n\nPapaw Shane",
