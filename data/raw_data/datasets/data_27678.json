    "title": "Trouble with Bluetooth compatibility and functionality.",
    "content": "It seems that latest versions of Android are dismissing some Bluetooth functionality and/or compatibility with older Bluetooth standards. \n\nI've been using Bluetooth with my car stereo and car phone utility for years (like 7). ALL my smartphones worked great so far (including two Nexus devices I've had) BUT my Pixel XL with Android 9 and again now with 10 it's failing to fulfill some functions.\n\nFor starters there's no way to make the stereo show Song ID Tags, anything.  I've tried tenths of Music Player apps, including the ones that worked correctly in elder phones, also I've re-reviewed phone and stereo settings repeatedly.\n\nFurthermore, when you try to make phone calls, some phone information cannot be retrieved.  It's not possible to navigate thru call history using stereo dash (nor missed, neither recent) even if you make the call from the stereo... Nothing never appears on any registry. It's possible to navigate the address book, and see names and numbers (since I've correctly set address book permissions on both devices) but that's it so far... Can't retrieve anything else.\n\nHope someone can help, also hope this is not a case of \"ceased for good\" compatibility thing.\n\nThanks.",
