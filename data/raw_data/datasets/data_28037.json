    "content": "I am looking for a way to get my issue escalated. The case is 2-4894000027787. I had a Pixel 2 XL that was RMA'd due to a finger print scanner that quit working. I was sent a replacement. The replacement reboots randomly and I cant use it. I called with this issue and have been given the run around the for the last 15days. They say there is an issue generating my replacement and cannot get me my replacement because of some glitch. No one can give me a time frame nor any details. Very disappointed with Google support at the moment.",
