    "content": "My Pixel 3a (bought last year directly from Google in California) usb port is acting up. I think I need to send it for repair (it should still be in warranty - less than 1 year since date of purchase, but not much left - see below) but I am now in Europe (Poland - no official support for Pixel devices here) and unable to return home for (i guess - covid...) some 2-3 months probably. Would it possible to file a warranty claim from here (and if so - how :-) and have this phone sent to US for repair (it can be sent back to my US address after repair, also I could sent it to repair center in e.g. Germany and get back either to US or my current address in Poland)?\n\nI guess I might send it us by mail and as my friends to send it for repair from there - but I am afraid that with covid mail delivery delays (I heard that US-Europe shipments might take as long as 2 months now) my warranty would expire by then...",
