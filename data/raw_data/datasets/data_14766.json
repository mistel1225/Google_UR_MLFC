    "content": "After upgrading to android 11 my phone only vibrates one short time when my clock alarm goes off when the screen is off. My alarm is set to silent and only vibration on. I can see the alarm is still active, it just doesn't vibrate.\n\nThe same is true when my phone is in vibrate mode and someone calls me. It only vibrates once.\n\nIf the screen is on the vibration works as it should.\n\nI have both overslept and missed several calls because of this.\n\nAny ideas on how to fix it?",
