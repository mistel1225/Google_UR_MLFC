    "content": "In the last week or so, my phone stopped playing audio/making any sound through speakers/receiving audio through mics. It happened suddenly, one moment I was listening to a song through my bluetooth headphones and the sound dropped out. I opened Spotify and it said it was still playing, though no audio was coming out.\n\nI tried turning my bluetooth off and on again to no avail, and realised there was no sound coming from my phone's speakers when playing music. Checking Instagram later that day, it wouldn't play any videos or stories with sound in them. I can't speak to google assistant, all calls are completely silent, and when I tried to play local media files it says the phone cannot play the file. \n\nI'm at my wit's end here. I turned off the phone, upgraded to Android 11 and still nothing. I have had the phone since September and dropped it a couple weeks ago which cracked the screen but the audio hardware was not affected. \n\nIs this a problem anyone else is facing? My phone is essentially useless to me without being able to make and receive calls, play music or upload videos to my business's Instagram.",
