    "title": "trusted placs isn't working. Still have to fingerprint to open, already updated location & software",
    "content": "I can't get the phone to stay unlocked at home.  I tried setting trusted places with my home from my google account, I tried updating the software, and updating the location in trusted settings by moving the pin around, and restarting the phone.   Location services is on.  This is extremely frustrating.\n\nI am having other issues as well,  which I'll only mention because they might be related. no one can hear me after I've been on hold for a while and calls start to sound garbled if i walk into my kitchen, but only sometimes.  Happens on LTE and on wifi calling, speakerphone and non-speakerphone.",
