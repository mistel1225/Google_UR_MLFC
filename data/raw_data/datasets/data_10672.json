    "title": "Upgraded Pixel 2 to Pixel 4a - texts and call history can't access contacts in work profile",
    "content": "I upgraded from pixel 2 to Pixel 4a and transfered all my data over.  I'm having trouble with this new Personal vs Work profile setup.  In particular I have all of my contacts located inside my work / GSUITE email account.  The phone only lets me send text messages through my Personal profile text app - but it cannot access my contacts in the work app - please help!  FYI I do NOT want to copy the contacts over to my personal profile, because my contacts continually change on the work profile and are auto synced.  I just want to be able to text and see call history with the phone number tied to the contacts that are on my work profile.  Ideally I'd love to remove the distinction between work and personal profile and have the phone operate in a similar mode to how the Pixel 2 operated.  It was WAY cleaner and simpler than the way the 4a is operating.  FYI I am the master administrator for my GSUITE domain.",
