    "content": "My USB-C earbuds suddenly stopped playing music. The only way to hear the music is holding down the middle black button, none of the inline controls work either. I haven't been rough with the earbuds and there is no visible damage to them. \nIs there a way of redoing the setup process or is the hardware broken?",
