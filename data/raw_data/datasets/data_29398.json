    "content": "#madebygoogle\nHi myself Akash Mohanta I am a native of India and a huge fan of your Google product have literally used my Nexus 5 as my baby. In view of that only I recommended pixel that too pixel 2XL black and white version for my cousin. She happen to buy with great enthusiasm.\nTo add to misery:\n1-its excessively heating up on charging\n2-it's freezing/hanging more than 3 times a day.\n3-speaker setting is switching on by default.\nMy cousin got her finger burnt because of excessive heating while phone was on charging. And accidently dropped the phone.\nNow the screen is crashed and OS is also not functioning appropriately. Device a solution! \nThe love for the product has now taken a u-turn. The event is to the utter displeasure of my further indulgence into your product. Keep an eye on the comment and do reply. For any solution. \nI request suggest something",
