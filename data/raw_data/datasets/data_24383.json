    "content": "Hi All,\n\nMy phone was out of battery and while the charging I opened my phone, but it suddenly looping in Google logo and unable to load in Recovery mode or Rescue mode as \"no command\".\n\nIn fastboot mode, it said my device as locked, is there anyway to solve the issue? \n\nI'm in Hong Kong and my phone was bought from Amazon. Should I courier the phone to Google for further checking? \n\nThanks, \nAlvin",
