    "title": "On the Google Pixel 3, why is the ringtone and notification controlled the same?",
    "content": "Why on earth would this phone be programmed so that the ringtone and the notification volumes are controlled the same.  Who on earth came up with the insane function.  Did anyone realize that by doing this, you either have to mute your phone so that you are not interrupted during the day and night of notifications, when you only need to worry about phone calls.  I love this phone, but this needs to be corrected and never happen again.  I have elderly parents and children that travel as well as needing the ringtone on at night due to my job, but now I cannot do that as anytime a notification from email, Facebook, etc occurs then I have to hear that as well during the night.  Not getting much sleep, which is needed as I have a job that requires concentration; hard to do when I am tired most of the time!\n\nNOT A VERY SMART MOVE BY WHOEVER DECIDED TO DO THIS!!!",
