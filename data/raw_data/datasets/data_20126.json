    "title": "Anyone know how to resolve Pixel 3 incoming call audio intermittently not working for either party?",
    "content": "intermittently incoming calls have no audio for either party regardless of whether I'm answering the handset, speaker phone, blue tooth to car, or USB-c earbuds.  I commonly get an incoming call; try to answer it but there's no sound.  Then, the caller tries again; same result.  Then, if I call that number (outgoing call), everything works.  \nI have tried using phone in safe mode and performed FDR.  Still fails intermittently.  \nGoogle/Assurant want even more $$ to replace it, after it's already been replaced 2 in < 18 months for other issues.  I'm growing tired of throwing money at Google.  I never damage phones.  This device is in pristine physical condition.\nanyone have same problem or ideas that I haven't tried?",
