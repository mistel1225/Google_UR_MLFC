    "content": "Looking for assistance. Something corrupted my Pixel 2xl. I think it's Android Auto as it's been hanging on after leaving my car. Left car today and screen totally unresponsive afterwards. I've tried soft reset numerous times and have followed every instruction I can find re: how to do a hard/factory reset. The problem is all instructions say I have to turn phone off but I can't because the touch screen won't work. Anyone have suggestions how to shut off so I can get to recovery mode?\n\nOther than AA hanging after leaving car and having to swipe it closed for the last week or so, no other issues. No new apps added etc.",
