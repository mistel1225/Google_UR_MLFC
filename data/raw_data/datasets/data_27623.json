    "content": "TICKET NO - GL0085039\nJOB NUMBER - JOB136131\nCREATION DATE - 30/09/2019\nHave been a victim very poor functioning Google Support, been past 10 years user of apple and thought this would be better and moved with enough warnings. The device malfunctioned very soon and it was promptly picked all that was good. Post that the device went to repair on 30th and the last update was on 3rd OCt after that am running pillar to post no info. Case has been escalated and I was promised many call backs not a even single call back received. God know what is going...a very poor communication between google and B2X, hope they will change my perception. Be aware next time when you want to get your device serviced, its damn herculean task. I jumped the gun already and gave very good feedback to one Miss/ Pam initially and she stopped responding to my mails once the feedback is done :). Please reserve of your feedback till the end. No one takes responsibility and when I request to escalate they all are worried about their stats and doesn't want to move any level further. Im repeatedly i hearing from support folks that the escalation is waste...i was surprised to hear from themselves...in fact shocked...Whats happening google? I think these doesn't reach higher level of google am sure this is NOT the standard of Google that I know..of !",
