    "title": "Pixel 2 XL Android 11 Captive Portal Connectivity Issue",
    "content": "Every time I try to connect to a Captive Portal  to login to WiFi, I have getting a \"This site can't be reached\" page.\n\nI'm getting this on Android 11 on the Pixel 2 XL.\n\nI noticed if I turn off mobile data completely, I can login to the captive portal without any problems.\n\nI'm guessing that Android is swapping between the WiFi network and Mobile data network. So when I try to get to the login screen for the captive portal, it ignores the WiFi network and tries to find the captive portal through the mobile data network.",
