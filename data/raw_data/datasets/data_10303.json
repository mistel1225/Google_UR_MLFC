    "title": "Pixel 3a ignoring sound notification settings",
    "content": "My phone will be set to vibrate, but texts coming in (Google Messages) will ignore the settings and either come through as silent, or ring the notification sound.  If I restart the device it will function normally for a while but it always reverts to ignoring the settings.  Making the notification sound instead of vibrating doesn't happen as often but may be related to connecting bluetooth headphones.\n\n  I connect a pair of Bose headphones that also have Google assistant capabilities, so when the phone is in vibrate mode but the headphones are connected, it will play the notification sound in my ear.  I had the headphones connected the last time it happened. When I shut the headphones off, the phone continued to play the notification sound.",
