    "title": "My Pixel 3 XL's USB-C port has stopped working.",
    "content": "I've had the phone for 2 weeks now. Bought it brand new. About a week ago i noticed the usb-c port had issues charging, sometimes id plug it in to charge and id notice it didn't detect the charger, and didn't charge. Then 2 days ago the port stopped working entirely, wont charge, nor will the usb-c earbuds work. I tried cleaning the port out, which got it to charge again (normal charge, fast charge still doesn't work), but earbuds still don't work at all. I've attempted to get it fixed over warranty with Google Repair but with no luck. The chat and phone options both don't work, saying google support is currently unavaliable.\n\nLooking for any help.\nThanks",
