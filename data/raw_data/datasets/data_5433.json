    "content": "I'm trying to enable VoLTE on a new Pixel 4a but the option to turn it on does not appear in the settings.  The following pictures show my settings and VoLTE is not visible.\nhttps://photos.app.goo.gl/JgxUsKmhKsViZd7x8\nThis picture  is from someone else's phone and it shows what I would like to see but it is not visible on my Pixel\nhttps://bit.ly/3ixkkXu\n\nMy previous phone, a Xiaomi, did have the option and I could enable it and use it.  When I put the same SIM card into the Pixel 4a there is no VoLTE option available.  I then double checked and took the same SIM card out of the Pixel and back into the old phone and sure enough VoLTE is an available option in the settings.  On my old phone when I turn VoLTE on I see a logo at the very top of the screen next to the signal strength icon.\n\nI can see that many other people have had the same issue\nhttps://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/83667098?hl=en\nand\nhttps://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/67698193?hl=en\nand\nhttps://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/81299473?hl=en\n\nI have spent quite literally weeks going back and forth with Google's Pixel support contractors and they have no idea.  Google really needs to hire better support contractors.\n\nDoes anyone know how I can contact a real Google support person to get an accurate answer as to why I'm not able to use VoLTE on the Pixel 4a?",
