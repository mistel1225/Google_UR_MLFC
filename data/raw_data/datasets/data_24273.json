    "content": "Tried resetting phone, deleting cache and data of play store. Can't download new apps or update any that have updates waiting. Play Store just stops (screen goes away).\n\nUnable to take screenshots, fails to save, so I can't show anyone that my ringtones for various sounds are now just numbers, and they don't work (no sounds fire when I get calls or messages).",
