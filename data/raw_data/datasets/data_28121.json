    "title": "Pixel 3 - Android 10 - Can't switch call from Speakerphone, ear speaker or bluetooth device",
    "content": "After Android 10 update, when placing a call...\nOnce the call is ringing, if I want to switch to my Bluetooth headset, or switch to speakerphone...the button does not respond (no popup showing which options I have for the call audio). The button is just totally unresponsive. \n\nThis has happened 2 times yesterday, and so far 2 times today. Both times I ended up completely restarting the device and the symptoms were temporarily resolved.",
