    "content": "While using chrome the phone hangs especially while switching between tabs. At that moment the whole phone doesn't respond or only the navigation bar will respond but won't react to the taps just shows that I tapped on the home button. If I get back to the home coming back to Chrome doesn't immediately fix the issue, it does get batter after a few seconds.",
