    "content": "I have lots of images downloaded on my phone since I'm a photographer. Keeping the photos on my phone helps me keep track of those I haven't posted on social media. I think I may have accidentally clicked on \"free up space.\" I can still see them in my camera roll but when I try to uploading photos using Instagram, they aren't in the camera roll because they're not \"saved to the device.\" Is there a way for me to get these photos back on my device without downloading hundreds of photos to my device again?",
