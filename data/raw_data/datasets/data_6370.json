    "content": "I have charged the phone for 30 minutes in safe mode but it didn't help and i have also factory reset my phone but it is still not working.the other issue is that i can only use the phone when it is in charge and when i unplug it it would turn off literally after 10 seconds.so i couldn’t use the phone at all.the issue happened right after the February security patch update. So it is 100 percent a software issue.I have bought the phone from Boston MA two years ago but i am not  in the US right now. I don’t want to trade my phone to a newer pixel or something. The IMEI of my phone is 358327092262612 . What should I do? Could you send me an update specifically for my phone to fix it?",
