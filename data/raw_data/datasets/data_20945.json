    "content": "My Pixel XL was stuck at 50% for almost a whole day and at the end of the day while I was using it, it jumped to 0% and shut down. I plugged it for charging and left it for an hour and came back to see that it was again at 50%. The phone shows 50% but shuts down a few seconds after I unplug it. It starts charging from 50% even after it dies. When I go to the recovery Menu and try to select restart bootloader, it reboots to the same menu. Therefore I'm unable to do a hard reset either. I faced the same issue almost a month back and after several restarts and battery draining it somehow got fixed on its own. Please don't tell me I need to replace my battery because I faced the exact same issue 1 month back also and after it got fixed on its own, it worked fine for the entire last month. I had my battery replaced at the Google Service Center less than 6 months back. Now the phone is plain useless.",
