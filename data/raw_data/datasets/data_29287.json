    "content": "My pixel 3 keeps crashing my Asus RT-AC66U router. I lose all internet - including wired internet - while it reboots. I don't have any problems with the router if I turn off my phone or turn off wifi on my phone. The router's firmware is up to date. I'm able to connect to other wifi networks. It doesn't seem to matter whether I'm actively using the phone at the time.",
