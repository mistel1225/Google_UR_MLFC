    "content": "Since half a year, every time a talk with someone on viber, whatsup or FB the connection is lost after 3-5min of talking. Everytime I have to end the call, and call again but everytime is the same problem, after a while the connection is lost. The problem is reproducible. I have tried to turn off the mobile data and bluethooth but this does not helped me. On the same network (at home) my wife has not problems with her Samsung mobile when talking on viber, whatskupp or FB. The problem occures only when talking with these apps, when I get connectin lost, I can surf or do other stuffs on the phone, the internet connection is there.  How can I fix the problem, because this is very annoying",
