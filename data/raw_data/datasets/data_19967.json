    "content": "I've seen the threads where users are experiencing the phone shutting down with 30% of the battery power left. Google is suggesting a new battery (which, as I understand, you can't have replaced if the phone has been out of production for 3 years). I wonder if their solution is correct. I didn't have this problem until Google forced the update to Android 10. Why the hell can't they just let people's phones alone. Every time an upgrade has been forced on any of my Android phones, I ended up having to trash them. I believe the phone shutting down is a software bug - or an intentional \"feature\" to force users to buy new phones every year. They call it \"engineered obsolescence.\" Each of my three Android phones lasted 50% less than the one before. And the price tag doubled.",
