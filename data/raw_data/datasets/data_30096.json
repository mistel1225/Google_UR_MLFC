    "title": "OS not calculating remaining battery life correctly - Pixel 3 XL",
    "content": "The OS on my Pixel 3 XL doesn't seem to be able to calculate the remaining battery life correctly. Within the last few days, I was using my phone with about 27% of the battery stated to be remaining, only to watch the phone rapidly tick down to 0% and shut off within a minute. And this has gotten worse over time - a couple of months ago, I observed the same behavior at around 17% battery life remaining, and 10% a couple of months before that. This is super annoying and has the potential to be a real problem if I'm out and about and my phone dies without warning and I don't happen to have a charger on hand. (This is my first phone with a sealed battery and I'm still not happy that there aren't any premium phones available with user-swappable batteries any more specifically because of the potential for problems like this.)\n\nPhone was a Verizon purchase\nOS patches are current\nOS says no apps need to be restricted, and nothing abnormal as far as apps being used\nRebooting phone has no effect\nCalibrating battery has no effect\n\nWhat's going on here? Is my phone's battery defective or is there some kind of OS problem? Do I need to bite the bullet and factory reset (which I really would prefer to avoid)? Please help!",
