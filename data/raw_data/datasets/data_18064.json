    "content": "Hello everyone.\nDear community, \n\nGoogle pixel 3 is my first Google device and I'm satisfied in all respects by this device. But I have never use OLED display in my phone's before . \nI have a question about my display colors.\n\n\nOne half of display renders colors correctly, but another half of displays renders colors a little bit brighter (looks as if the black color has faded in the sun). I use my Google pixel 3 only for one week , it is absolutely new. It is impossible the display to be damaged by sun.  It is not very noticeable, but as an attentive person, it catches my eye and spoils the impression of my device\n\nPlease, tell me if it is OLED screen feature or manufacture defect.\n\nThanks a lot for your help and answers.",
