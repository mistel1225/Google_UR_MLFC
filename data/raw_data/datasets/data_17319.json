    "content": "I am devastated, I just broke my google pixel 4a screen. I just got the phone on Aug 19th. Am I still under warranty to get it fixed. What will i have to do to get it fixed? The finger print sensor wont work because I got a paper cut on my finger and wont recognize it and it wont allow me to put my pin in. I can only get one number. I absolutely love my phone. I had a strong phone case and screen protector on it.",
