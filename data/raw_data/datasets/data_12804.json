    "content": "Been having issues with my pixel 4xl since the android 11 update, and in particular since the early oct update came through. phone keeps turning off when in my pocket (locked) this last time it turned off and won't turn back on. press and hold power button (when connected to charger) brings up a constant cycle of the google logo, but as soon as I release the power button, phone switches off.\n\nCan get in to boot menu, however as soon as I try to scroll through options with volume buttons or release the power button, the phone again switches off.\n\nbattery does not seem to be charging at all.",
