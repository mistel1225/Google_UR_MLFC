    "content": "So you know the move to folder button? I use that alot. I have a strange sorting system and I find myself needing to transfer photos from screenshots to downloads, for example. I would select the image I wanted to move, tap the \"Move to folder\" button, and select the folder I wanted to move it to. The pic would disappear from the screenshots folder and reappear in downloads (again, using these two as an example). This process has worked for years up until a week ago. Now the file stays in both places and leaves what I'm going to call a \"ghost file\" in the original location. This ghost file takes up the space that the original image took, is incredibly low resolution and when I want to upload photos to Facebook (for example) It appears as a corrupted file (see attached image [yeah I play alot of maker games, lol][I also already used that coupon code]). Yeah, I guess this isn't a huge problem but it's certainly annoying. I restarted my phone But that didn't work. Anybody else have the problem and was able to fix it?",
