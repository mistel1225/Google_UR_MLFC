    "content": "I'm gonna keep this short and simple. Some of us can and enjoy paying for phone upgrades regularly; even annually and are able to afford $1000+ phones using various methods like trading, financing at 0%, EIPs, etc. \n\nLong story short some of us want flagship-spec'd out phones. Google, please make a flagship for 2021. This is the first year I skipped Pixel and went with the Note 20 Ultra instead and I've gotten used to it, but I had major growing pains with OneUI's bloaty feel, double apps, unable to remove crap without mods, etc. I just hate OneUI.",
