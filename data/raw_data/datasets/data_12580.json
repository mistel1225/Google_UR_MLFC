    "content": "I use Verizon.  For the past three pixels I have purposely purchased an unlocked Pixel directly from Google so that I would receive timely monthly security updates.  Apparently now, even though I've purchased an unlocked pixel, because I have a Verizon SIM card in it I have to wait an extra week to get the November security update.  Why is this? This is not how it has worked in the past.  had I realized I would have to wait extra time as a Verizon user I would have just purchased a Verizon pixel at a discount rather than purchasing the full price unlocked version. This is unacceptable!",
