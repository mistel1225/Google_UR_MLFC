    "content": "So I've seen other posts like this about the Pixels fingerprint, and the sad \"recommended\" answers with 40+ thumbs down. The sad truth is Google (along with other companies) purposely makes its products with shitty components not meant to last more than a year or two, that way, you can come running back to them to get a new phone. Out of nowhere fingerprint scanner completely stopped working, and even ended up locking one of my bank accounts, even after redoing my fingerprint in ALL 5 possible fingerprint sections not even 30 seconds prior. Would someone from Google just admit the truth? Or am I going to get a sad answer like everyone else: \"it must be a hardware problem\", \"reset your phone\" \"add a second fingerprint\". So my question is this: why are SO MANY pixel phones having this same issue surprisingly around 7+ months into use? Sad pathetic excuses for answers won't fly so unless you have a real answer Google, don't respond.\n\nFYI: I have already done everything anyone could suggest, other than a factory reset which I refuse to do. I'm looking for someone from Google to admit they are doing exactly what apple and Samsung were fined for doing in Italy in 2017.",
