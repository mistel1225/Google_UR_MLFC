    "title": "Screen wakes up for disabled notifications",
    "content": "I have a Pixel 2 XL running the latest version of Android 10. (All apps are also up to date)\n\nI've disabled notifications for several apps, most recently Snapchat. I've noticed that even with notifications turned completely off, incoming Snapchat notifications STILL wake the screen when the phone is locked, even though the notification does not display (and has been disabled).\n\nI have 'wake for notifications' enabled and also have 'always on' enabled.\n\nI want to keep wake for notifications on because it's useful for the notifications I WANT to see. However, it's incredibly frustrating that disabled notifications STILL trigger the screen wake.\n\nPlease advise.",
