    "content": "multi-user login is such an awesome feature :)\n\nI accidentally locked myself out of an added user I added fingerprint login to.  after reboot, it requires a password & must have mistyped it when I set the password so now I don't know it & I've failed so many times it is asking me to wait several minutes before trying again.\n\nis there any way my primary user can reset the password to the added user or am I SOL & should just delete & recreate the user?",
