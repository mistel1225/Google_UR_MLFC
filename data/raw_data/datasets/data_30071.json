    "content": "I have reset all the Bluetooth connections on both the phone and in the car. This allows access to on phone playlists etc but after leaving and returning to the car access is lost. The Bluetooth connection is fine and whatever is playing on the phone will play through the speakers. Calling etc is all fine as well. I can just no longer use the root menu option to change playlists. My iphone 6s had no issues at all and the ability to access playlists and songs was always maintained. If anyone has any suggestions it would be much appreciated as I hate not being able to change playlist on the go when doing long journeys.",
