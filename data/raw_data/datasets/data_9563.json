    "title": "Selfie camera takes terribly blurry pictures. Even worse using Snapchat camera.",
    "content": "Does anybody have a fix or think it will ever be fixed by Google? The picture looks fine when viewing the camera, but when snapping the picture you get an ugly blurry effect. It's as if the after image processing changes the focus or applies a heavy filter, or something else crazy. It seems the issue is worse when using Snapchats camera, I guess because Snapchat is trying to do it's own additional filters. Please help!!! Very very frustrating. Considering switching phones over this.",
