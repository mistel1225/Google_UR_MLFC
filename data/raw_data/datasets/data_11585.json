There is a huge price difference in USA its available at 650 US$ and as you can see that there is a huge difference between the prices as the phone pixel 5 has still not been released here in India.\nI wonder why amazon india have kept the price so high.\n\nhttps://www.amazon.in/Google-Pixel-5G-128GB-Black/dp/B08H8X23ZB/ref=mp_s_a_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=pixel+5&qid=1606139117&sr=8-1\nYou can check on this link and compare the original prices.",
