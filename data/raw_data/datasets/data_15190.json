    "content": "I used the phone set-up feature and adapter cable to transfer data from my Moto 3 play to my Pixel 4 and I did it twice.. I could not get the app icon set-up (my homescreen and additional screes with my apps  and widgits laid-out) to copy either time.\n\nIs this a glitch with this phone - shouldn't this copy over with everything else.  Do I have to re-arrange all my widgets and apps all over again on this new phone??  Is there an app that can do this..I see Samsumg has one",
