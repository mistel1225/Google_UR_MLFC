When I switched it on again, my phone had a different wallpaper, notifications are not shown anymore, you can't search in settings anymore, if you go to developer options you see a screen with this message: \"Developer Options not available for this user\"\n\nI was reading in internet in seems to be a common issue I tried to do what it's suggested in some forums like this:\n\nhttps://forums.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-s7/659407-s7-edge-not-showing-notifications-tray-recent-apps-button-settings-button-dnt-work-2.html\n\nBut nothing seems to work. \n\nI would really appreciate some support! \nThank you very much",
