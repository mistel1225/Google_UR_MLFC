    "content": "My Pixel 3XL received the december 2020 update over the weekend and then last night when went to check something it was dead and thought ran out of charge.\n\nPlugged into charger and waited but nothing, no charging message, no led, tried resetting using power button and volume but again nothing.\n\nPlaced on Google Stand and nothing, no lights on the stand which I assumed meant it needed charging, but an hour later still nothing. Retried using usb charging and left overnight, but still nothing.\n\nConnected to pc and all i get is usb_bulk_cid:0402 listed in device manager for the phone.\n\nPhone was pre-orderd directly through Google on 14 Oct 2018 and received 13 Nov 2013 and 25 month to the day of receiving it, it's dead. Not very good for a phone that is only 25 month old and cost Â£900\n\nAnyone know best way to resolve this? Would it be new phone, especially if I can't prove that the issue has been caused by the recent update",
