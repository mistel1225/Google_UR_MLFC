    "content": "Good day to you all! I recently bought a used Pixel 1st Gen and have noticed so battery issues. Battery were not disclosed (I realize they don't have to.) but when I got the phone, I immediately charged it normally and noticed that it was really hot. After charging, I updated to the latest Android version. After testing it for a few weeks, I charge the phone up to 100% and upon restarting the device it lowers down to about 50%. Even upon restart, the phone shuts off at about 20%. I'm sure I may need a battery replacement, but any other ideas will be appreciated!",
