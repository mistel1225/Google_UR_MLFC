    "title": "Any attempt to open an app results in an almost immediate return to the home screen. Even Keyboard.",
    "content": "For whatever reason I can no longer open any app without the phone quickly returning to the home screen. The first app i had noticed with this issue was HBO max. I removed and reinstalled the app, and it seemingly went away, but then trying other apps the issue would show up again. Now i can't even use the keyboard to type in the search bar without it returning to home screen.\n\nI thought for whatever reason my cover or case might be accidentally holding down a button or causing the capacitive screen to react, but after removing them this issue still occurred.\n\nThis seemed to have happened just in the past 24 hours. The last Security update was March 5, today is March 23.\n\nAndroid Version 11, Pixel 4a.",
