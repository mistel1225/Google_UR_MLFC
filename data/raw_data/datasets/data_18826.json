    "content": "I purchased this particular Pixel 3 from a dude via the OfferUp app. Which at the time of purchase I was informed it had been purchased straight from Google and was not a carrier branded phone. Which upon booting up the device. No sign of carrier branding has ever shown. The boot logo/animation is just the simple google Logo. For some reason tho, inside my developer options tab. The OEM unlock toggle is greyed out and says I should either connect to the internet which I of course am. Tried using both a Wifi connection and just my LTE connection via my AT&T simcard. Both to no avail. So I was hoping someone here could help me resolve this issue.",
