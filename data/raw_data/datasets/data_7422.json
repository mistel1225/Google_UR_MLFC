    "content": "After installing the Feb 2021 update, I am facing some fingerprint unlock issues. The main screen lock is working fine, but other fingerprints locks in some apps like:- Whatsapp, Google Pay, UPI and other apps that needs fingerprint authentication.\nAs of now, if the fingerprint is not working, I just lock the phone and then unlock it, and then it works for those apps.",
