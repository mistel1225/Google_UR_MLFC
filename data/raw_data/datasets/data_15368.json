    "title": "Messages App Draining Battery",
    "content": "This started maybe a week and a half ago. The Messages app seems to be excessively draining my new Pixel 4a's battery. Up to 25% battery usages, happens maybe every other day. I've tried everything. Force close, delete cache, uninstall and reinstall, restart device. It's just running in the background for some reason and draining my battery. Anyone else have these issues or have any other ideas I could try? I'd really rather not have to use a 3rd party messages app.",
