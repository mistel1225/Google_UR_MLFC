    "content": "Last night I was using my pixel xl at around 30% when it randomly just died and restarted,it kept doing this for about 30 minutes before it eventually started fine and worked for about an hour and restarted just two times during this period. When I finally turned the phone off for the night it was at about 50%. But when I woke up this morning the phone wouldn't give me any response and it has remained so for the past few hours. It will occasionally show the battery symbol for a split second and then immediately turn off. I think the phone may be broken I haven't had it for even a year yet. if anyone could help that would be greatly appreciated.",
