    "content": "In the Google home app on my Samsung S9 I have the sensitivity settings but they are not available on my pixel 3a??\n\nAlso something I noticed on the Samsung S9 for the light setting it only has one button that says lights, but on my pixel 3 a it has 2 buttons For lights one button for on and one button for off?\n\nCurrently the pixel has a higher version of the home app but it was just updated recently even prior to that when they both had the same version I still had the same issues.\n\nThanks",
