    "content": "Hi all,\n\nI have a new Pixel 4a that I'm trying to enable VoLTE.  Phone information shows that my carrier has it activated and placing my SIM into my wife's Samsung VoLTE is enabled and working.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf I go into Setting and search for LTE it finds the following.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever selecting any option shows the same screen with no VoLTE.\n\n\n\n\nPreferred network type shows.\n\n\nAny suggestions on how to enable VoLTE would be appreciated.\n\nTIA",
