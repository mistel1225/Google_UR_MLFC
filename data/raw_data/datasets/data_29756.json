    "content": "I have downloaded the mp3 file and copied it into my Ringtone folder on my Pixel 2 phone. When I manually access this folder, my song is there. It lasts 29 seconds and takes 708 ko of space. When I click on it, it plays correctly with Google player. However, when I go to the sound app to select it as my ringtone, it doesn't appear in \"My Sounds\". I can see another .mp3 file that I put there about one year ago, but not the new one. I've read many many answers on google, and they all say to make sure the .mp3 file is in the ringtone folder. It is. Everything should work but it doesn't. Why does it have to be that complicated? Honestly, can't wait to go back to Iphone :(",
