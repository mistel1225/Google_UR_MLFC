    "content": "My Pixel 2 XL is broken and it is under warranty. So I send for diagnosis and the team said they can't fix my device, instead they can give a \"Factory Tested Device\" for a particular quotation. \n\nWhat is meant by 'Factory Tested' Device ? Does it means an Used mobile ? I can say for sure that it's not a Brand New one. I tried to get answer for this from Google but they are not telling directly, they kept saying Factory Tested. \n\nI have to decide whether I should spend 18,000 INR for Factory Tested Pixel 2 XL or should I get new Pixel Phone based on the meaning of 'Factory Tested'",
