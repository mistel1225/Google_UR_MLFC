    "title": "Google Pixel XL volume control increments needs fine tuning.",
    "content": "The default sound adjustment increments from the 3rd to the 4th setting is too large of a jump in volume. The 3rd setting from 0 is pretty quiet but moving up to the next available 4th setting is a way to large of an increase in volume. There needs to be an in-between volume of these two settings.\n\nI've tried downloading a few apps/equalizers but none of them helped to fix the issue, every app was limited to the phones hardware setting. If anyone knows of a way to fix this, please let me know.\n\nPerhaps it's time to get a new phone..",
