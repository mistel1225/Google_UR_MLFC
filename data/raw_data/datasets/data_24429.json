    "content": "My Google Pixel hijacked my Pixel this morning when I was turning it on, this TALK BACK is annoying as FUCK!  How do I scroll with TALK BACK on & DOUBLE TAP on?  Why did turn itself on?  Even tho I may use the TALK BACK, how do I scroll with talk back on if I want to use both features at the same time, when I am required to DOUBLE TAP?  Then I can't PINCH to ZOOM or SCROLL!",
