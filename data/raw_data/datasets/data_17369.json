    "content": "Recently I have been sending videos to my friends who have iOS devices. I sent them through my Android (Motorola G Power) and when I send them the videos, they say the videos don't have any sound when on my end, the videos clearly have sound. This only happens when I am texting videos to iOS users and not other Android users. I've tried toggling with the settings and such but they can't receive any sound on my videos everytime I send them",
