    "content": "I am planning to import Pixel 4a 5G from US to India. I see both Pixel 4a and Pixel 4a 5G devices are having same LTE bands. I would like to get it confirmed if Indian carriers (Especially \"Jio\" carrier , which needs VoLTE to work) are compatible with Pixel 4a 5G. \n\nThanks, \nKrishna",
