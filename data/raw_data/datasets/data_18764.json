    "content": "It is unfortunate that Google has chosen to ignore the problem of these phones shutting down with 30 to 50% of power left. From  reading the previous posts on this subject and lack of Google answers leads me to believe they are getting out of or should get out of the phone business. Instead of taking a chance and paying a small fortune to get my battery replaced I and the rest of the people on these posts would be better served by getting a Samsung or an IPhone and let the Google phone ship sink. I like the others have to wonder if update 9 wasn't set up to make the phone randomly shut down early to get you to buy another phone. They wouldn't do it to every phone just 20% - 30%........... If I remember correctly they did something like this to the Iphones and they were sued in a class action lawsuit........Maybe a good lawsuit would be a better fix?",
