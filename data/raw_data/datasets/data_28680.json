    "content": "Hi,\n\nJust today I'm getting very bad battery performance. I went down from 100% to 8% in 9 hours, with 8 of those hours being idle. Going into the settings battery monitor, even with setting it to show the full list, shows absolutely nothing. Screen on is 12%, and everything else is at 1%.\n\nI downloaded AccuBattery, and it said that my battery is discharging at 25%/hour. I'm on the latest update, and I haven't downloaded or installed any new apps recently. I have no idea what is causing this.",
