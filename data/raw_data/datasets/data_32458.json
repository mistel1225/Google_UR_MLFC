    "content": "I've recently had to get a replacement device and when doing the initial set up there is only one back up showing and it's for the current temporary Samsung I am using. When I go to my Google drive from my Samsung it shows both the Samsung back up and my previous Pixel 2 back up. \n\nI would like restore my new Pixel 2 to the way it was before it broke. I don't understand why it is not showing up as an option at set up. \n\nThanks for any help you can give. \n\nBret",
