    "content": "Hi!\n\nMy Pixel 2XL suddenly started flashing (like lock/unlock), then turned off and gets me into the recovery mode with two options:\n\n1) try to load Android again;\n2) reset settings (or something like that).\n\nI've chosen second option. And the day after I face exactly the same problem.\n\nPlease, help!",
