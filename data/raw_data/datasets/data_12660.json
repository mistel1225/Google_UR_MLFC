    "content": "Your search - I recently upgraded to a Pixel 4 running Android 11 and a Thinkware F800 Pro Dashcam I have been unable to successfully complete the Registration of the F800 Pro using the Thinkware Cloud App on the Pixel 4 however when I tried the same app on my wife's iPhone SE 2020 I was able to successfully complete the F800 registration. Thinkware support tell me that the problem is with Android Phones not just Android 11. Are you aware of this issue and if so what action is being taken?",
