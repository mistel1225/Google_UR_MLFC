    "content": "How would I go about changing the sounds of the notifications for different apps? For example, if I want my text messages to make a different sound than a separate messaging app like GroupMe? I want to be able to hear what is a text message from other app notifcations. I have tried searching under settings in apps and notifications and opening  the specific app settings but no luck so far. Thanks!",
