    "content": "I have tried rebooting, which didn't help. I am waiting for the OTA Android 11 update to appear in the System Update, but nothing has come up. I'm hoping that would resolve this issue.\n\nAfter August 2020 update, I have also been facing issue of Dark screen during unlock. I keep finger on finger print, nothing happens. I click on power button to unlock using PIN, nothing happens on the screen. Although, as soon as I connect the charger, the screen automatically lits up, with fingerprint working as well. \n\nThis is all weird.  \n\nI have read many forums and haven't found any one solution that has worked for anyone. \n\nI was a fan of Pixel phones for their camera, simplicity and free Google storage for the photos, and this is my second Pixel actually. I do not really want to switch, but after all these issues, it feels like Google wants me to switch. Sad!",
