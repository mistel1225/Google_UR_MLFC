    "content": "I got my Pixel 3XL replaced due to a screen issue. With the new Pixel I am seeing a bluetooth connection drop issue with any bluetooth device including my watch and earphones. This issue happens right after the device is powered off and on. The issue persists until the bluetooth is turned off and on or the device is rebooted. I tried formatting the device but the issue still persists. I dont know if this is a device specific issue or if others have also been seeing this.",
