    "content": "Hello everyone, I really hope you can help me with this problem.\nI was trying to root the pixel 3a for mobile app penetration testing purposes. I followed the guide on how to root the device using Magisk, everything looked fine but after reboot the phone is stuck on \"The boot loader is unlocked and software..\" and f I move forward the phone freezes on G loading screen. Looks like I cannot do anything.\nI am not able to use fastboot commands because it says \"waiting for any device\".\nIs there a way to restore the phone?\nThank you very much",
