    "content": "My calls are dropping when new calls come on my google pixel 2. It is dropping the original call when the incoming call comes in. I have researched how to turn on call waiting, but that selection is not available on the my phones phone/settings/calls menu. Please advise how this can be fixed ASAP as I used my phone for business and multiple disconnects is very unprofessional. I'm currently unable to use my google voice forwarding as a consequence.",
