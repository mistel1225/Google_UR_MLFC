    "title": "Are screen flashes and glitches warrantable?",
    "content": "I purchased a brand new Pixel 3 less than 3 months ago and within the last month, I have been noticing several screen-glitching issues which appear to be increasing in frequency.\nThe most common issue is a white flash that is seen when pressing the power button to turn the phone on or off. The screen will fill up with white for a quick flash then shut off. I have read other people have had this issue but it did not appear to be a cause for concern.\nNow, after the white screen flash the screen will half fill with random green and white pixels and display a static-like time in the middle of the phone, under the regular time seen at the top. This does not happen every time I press the power button and seems to happen more at night time, but last night I was unable to get my phone screen to go black.\nI contacted the company who had sold me the phone and said that it should be under warranty still, but I wasn't sure whether this was a warrantable issue, or if I should be concerned about it getting worse. I have read some people mentioning patches to help with the screen flashing issues but have yet to see any evidence of such a patch.\nI have had a lot of bad luck with phones in the last 2 years (all Google phones), and if this one doesn't make it a year I'm probably going to have to consider another phone company.",
