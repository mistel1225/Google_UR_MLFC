    "content": "I deleted by mistake my entire conversation with my wife spanning 1.5 years including photos and other info from my Pixel 1. The Help pages say that only SMS is backed up for 25 MB. Can I recover the entire conversation with the photos? I haven't downloaded any files after that? Thanks.",
