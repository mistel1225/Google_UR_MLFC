    "content": "I can be on images, tiktok, or even unlocking my phone. Most anything I do has a small chance of setting me phone into a frenzy. It doesn't freeze. It just reboots. Then when it gets back on it refuses to connect to data or wifi. And I have to re-reboot. Then it's fine. But today it stopped playing audio so I restarted it. When it turned on it was in \"Fast Boot Mode\" and it didn't get to read the massive paragraph of info and settings... Before it was gone. :( I just got the phone. October 24 was the day I ordered it and I got it on the 28th. It sucks having a brand new nice phone... That's borderline trash. I can't work on any work related tasks on my phone in fear of them not saving. This sucks... Please help . ðŸ˜­",
