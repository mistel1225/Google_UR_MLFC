    "content": "the usb-c adapter to regular audio jack from google won't work anymore. Bought a new one yesterday and it worked on and off. Today it caused any app with audio (netflix, spotify, and youtube) to crash and when trying to adjust volume it wouldn't work and my phone froze. Restarted my phone multiple times (it restarted on it's own once) and then updated my phone but it's still an issue. Headphones work fine on my laptop.",
