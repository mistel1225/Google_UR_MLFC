    "content": "Hey all, \nWhenever I turn on Hotspot connection on my Pixel 4 the speed drops to below .5Mbps\nThis seems to be time sensitive, 1st thing in the morning it's fine. I suspect it's the Network which is Three UK. \nIs there anyway to test this. They tell me something different every time. Or that it's probably the phone. \nIf it is slowly down it must be them throttling, but they say they don't this on unlimited data accounts. \n\nAnyone have any suggestions?",
