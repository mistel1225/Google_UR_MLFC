    "title": "How to file a major complaint? Already filed through Google feed back and survey with no resolve.",
    "content": "I have been dealing with a issue with Google support team and to be honest I feel the support team does not care about a persons device and issue.  If they did it wouldn't be 2 months later and still no device returned back to me.  I have spoke to the online chat more times than I want to count with the same scripted answers. I am a high Google supporter and the longer it takes the more I rather not be.  The devices are great and where Google technology is going is great, but bad customer services leads to not caring what Google is going to come out with because the support team can't fix a issue or get back to you in a timely manner.  In addition to that I asked to have someone from a higher management team to contact me and what do you know they denied me because of Covid.  I am sure a Company of your size have people in relations and other departments working at least remotely that can help, and to any company they should never deny someone to talk to a person especially having issues with your team and your product.  So, I would like to know how to get google higher management team to contact me and also file a complaint before other actions are taking to resolve this.",
