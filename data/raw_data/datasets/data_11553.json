    "content": "I was told to report this here:\nhttps://issuetracker.google.com/issues/172596238\n\nNo idea if reporting here can help.\nAnyway, the issue is that many times the device won't allow Windows OS to show its storage, or won't allow a bit later.\nAnd today I even saw the opposite, of showing it twice (and with different storage usage).\n\nThe workaround is to disconnect and re-connect, of course, but it's very annoying.",
