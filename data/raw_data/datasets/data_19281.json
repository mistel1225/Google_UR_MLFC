    "title": "Pixel 3a wakes up, launches apps, dials phone spontaneously",
    "content": " This morning out walking the dog/exercising, I hear my Pixel 3a, in my pocket, no apps open, emitting all sorts of beeps, as if it were dialing a number. Sure enough, it had launched the phone app, brought up the number pad, and was in the process of dialing a long series of meaningless numbers and symbols - all on its own. The phone app was closed (all apps were closed) when I put it into my pocket, and the lock screen on. My hands were nowhere near it. \n\nThis happens constantly. The 3a regularly launches Google Assistant, dials the phone, opens apps, tries to send messages, you name it, all without me touching it. Occasionally it happens when sitting on a table, but it's near-constant when I'm out and about. It will even happen when the phone is tucked away in a backpack.\n\nWhat's going on? Is there some setting I'm missing? I have a suspicion that Google Assistant is the cause, but I don't know how or why.\n\nThanks for any help.\nEd",
