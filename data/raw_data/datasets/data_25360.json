    "title": "Temperature units change randomly on lock screen",
    "content": "I have a Pixel 2 running the latest 5 May 2019 patch level of Android 9. Lately I have noticed that the temperature reading that shows on the lock screen sometimes shows the temperature as 째F rather than 째C (we use Celcius here in Australia). And sometimes there is no temperature shown at all. I haven't been able to see any pattern to why it changes. Yesterday morning it was showing 째F, later in the day it was 째C, and this morning the temperature is completely missing. Any suggestions? I don't see how it can be a setting on the phone if it keeps changing with nothing changed on the phone. The problem has only started happening quite recently - I never noticed it prior to a couple of weeks ago.",
