    "content": "I updated to Android 11 today, and now my pin can't be used to sign into the phone. \nOddly, I was able to use it the after the phone had updated to log into the phone after the reset, but now it is telling me I have the wrong pin. \n\nIs there any way other than a factory reset through the command menu to fix this?\n\n9/28 Update: A factory reset removed this issue",
