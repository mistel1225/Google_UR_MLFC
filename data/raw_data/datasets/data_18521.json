    "content": "Hi,\nI switched sound notifications for messages (personal, not group) off in both the pixel phone settings (silent)  and the WhatsApp settings (conversation tones off), however it still keeps switching back to sound notifications. Any idea how to fix this? There's no option to switch sound notifications off for each single chat..",
