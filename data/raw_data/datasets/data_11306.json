    "content": "So, since upgrading to Android 11, I recently have found this issue with my microphone. This had not ever happened before I upgraded to Android 11. I went ahead and attached a photo of the recording app. The large spikes are after I hit play on some music. Essentially what happens is that when I record a clip and the phone's speakers play any sound, there is loud, abrasive tapping. I was able to replicate this many times using the recording app, and this issue renders GBoard's voice typing (which used to be my favorite way to type) completely useless as it chops up my words. Do I have to take it in to get repaired, what should I do?I just installed the latest October security patch and the issue still stands.",
