    "content": "I receive an inordinate amount of robo calls and spam calls and I find the ability to screen my calls with google to be literally invaluable...\n\nBut when calls disconnect before, during, or after the screen I get prompted and asked if the call was spam. \n\nHow do I know these calls are spam if they disconnect? Why would you ask?\n\nMy phone labels them as disconnects. Doesn't it already know i never talked to them then?\n\nIt is not a big issue, but I hate useless notifications that I have to swipe away.",
