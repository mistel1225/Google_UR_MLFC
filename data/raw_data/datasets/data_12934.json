    "content": "I have two gmail accounts. \"Forever\" I have had the backup go to google drive on my primary account. I realize that the other account (a university alumni account) has unlimited storage. Will there be any (negative) dfference if I direct the phone's backup to the google drve on this other much less used ie secondary account? If not should I then delete the accumulated backups found on google drive of the primary account? Thanks for your experience.",
