    "content": "Hi all, \n\nI've got a pixel 2xl - great phone! \n\nBut... as of July 5, it won't connect to my mobile network (t-mobile). \n\nUnder 'about phone', it says 'sim status: not available' and 'phone number: unknown'. \n\nUnder settings > network and internet > mobile network it says: 'connect to mobile network - to use a new sim card, you'll need to remove the one that's currently there'... oh, that means it knows one is there... hmm. \n\nI can take the sim out and put it back in... nothing changes. \n\nThought maybe I could connect to t-mobile using the esim, went to the local t-mobile store to get a qr code to scan into it, but they said that it won't work with a pixel 2, only 3 and 4's. They said the problem I'm having is probably related to an update and is a software issue. \n\nI see I did get a security patch on July 5. Could that be an issue? \n\nAppreciate any suggestions, \n\nChris",
