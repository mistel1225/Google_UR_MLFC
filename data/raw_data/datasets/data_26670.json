    "content": "Hi, I've got a Google Pixel 3 and just bought some earphones for it. The earphones are 'Gritin Sound Blossom Stereo Bluetooth Earphones'. When I click on Pair New Device on my phone it can't seem to find the earphones. I've fully charged both phone and the earphones and restarted both of them a few times and I've turned airplane mode on and off.. Have also reset/cleared Wifi/Bluetooth settings.. Couldn't seem to find any other suggestions on what to do. Thanks very much",
