    "content": "I've seen this posted on other sites as well.  After the July update my phone battery life it absolutely horrible.  I'm now charging multiple times per day when I could go for 2 days without ever charging.  I have other friends with the same phone and they all said they are having the same issue since the July update.  Is there any way to remove the update or get some support?  I have not added any new apps and have checked the Battery app to verify nothing is draining the battery, etc.  I've tried all the settings to minimize battery usage but it's still draining very quickly with minimal usage.",
