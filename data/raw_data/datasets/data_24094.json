    "content": "Is is possible to take a slow motion selfie video on the Pixel 4xl?  I can shoot slow motion with the non-selfie camera, but when I change the video to selfie mode, the slow motion option doesn't seem to be available.  If I can't do it with the built in camera, is there a good app that would allow me to do this?  Thank you.",
