    "content": "My pixel 3 seems to be crashing randomly.\nWhen using certain apps such as the camera or taking videos the phone will randomly turn off. Likewise when I'm using the video chat function on WhatsApp. It doesn't always turn off but sometimes and it seems to be random.\n\nAdditionally my phone will turn off when I am charging the phone with the attached pixel charger that came in the box. Obviously this is a huge issue because I'm used to leaving a charging overnight and having an alarm set, and now I've missed alarms because of this issue.\n\nOther times when I reboot into the system, my phone will turn off as soon as I have put in the password to log in. Sometimes, when I turn on airplane mode then I can log into my phone properly before turning off airplane mode and using it.\n\nI've tried rebooting in a safe mode, but even so my phone has crashed as soon as I log in and turns off. This is driving me nuts has anybody else experienced this and what have you done?",
