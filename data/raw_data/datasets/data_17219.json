    "content": "A couple of weeks ago my phone gestures (i.e. double tap to wake, squeeze for Google assistant, and lift to wake) stopped working. Now, in addition to that, my phone's adaptive brightness is not working and my screen is not shifting to black when I'm on a call (instead my face pushes buttons for the entire time). How can I get this fixed? Is it a simple system bug or is a larger fix needed?",
