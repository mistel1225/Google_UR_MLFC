    "content": "I have this issue with the display on the Pixel 3a. Whenever I scroll and it contains dark or black photos (mainly black) both as the subject or as the background, there would be a trailing effect from those photos but only on the dark or black part of it that would produce the trailing effect. It becomes more noticeable when scrolling at a faster rate. The phone was purchased on 31st of December.",
