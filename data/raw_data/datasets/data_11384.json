    "title": "Nobody can hear me on a phone call when I use the loudspeaker. Applies to Phone App and other apps.",
    "content": "When I make a phone call, either on the phone app or WhatsApp, I can only be heard if I put the phone to my ear. If I turn on the loudspeaker, the other party cannot hear me and they say I am cutting in/out. Tried Safe Mode, same problem. Microphone port is clean (basically a new phone). This is an issue for video calls, because a loudspeaker is a must. Have to get around it with headphones. Feels like a software issue as Recorder app works fine and audio on video recordings through camer app are fine. Maybe an issue with noise cancellation?",
