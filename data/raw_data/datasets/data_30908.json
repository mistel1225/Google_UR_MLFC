    "content": "Anyone else having this issue? I pocket my phone throughout the day and it seems to be having a sleep bug constantly. It's happened 3 times today. It requires me to hold the power button down for 10 seconds to force shut down, and then power it back on like normal.\n\nA user on reddit told me he contacted customer service and got a new phone sent out via RMA. Although since him and I are both having this issue, it seems to sound more like a software issue and not a hardware one. Anyone have insight?",
