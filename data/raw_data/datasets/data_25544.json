    "content": "Looks like their is a bug with the Pixel 4XL where the screen gets a purple hue or tint when ever the phones proximity sensor is covered during a phone call. When turning the phone screen off then on again the tint disappears. Im sure this can be fixed via software update in near future. Its seems to be related with the 90hz also. It just makes all dark colors look purple and it does not look good.",
