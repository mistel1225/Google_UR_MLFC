    "content": "Hi,\nI have just got a Pixel 3a and started transferring music from my Windows pc using a usb cable.  The first 10 albums transferred but thereafter a problem in that they do not appear on the phone google music player but I can see them in the phone through Windows explorer.   So where are they?    I have stopped transferring now as I can see 5 or 6 albums through the PC's file explorer as in the phone but when I open the music player in the phone they are not there.  As if the transfer got blocked up somehow?   Any suggestions how to resolve, please. Thanks",
