    "content": "I see this same issue reported in a couple other forum questions, but no clear resolution and those forums are locked.  My Pixel 3A XL pairs properly to both my car and to a Panasonic BlueTooth enabled home phone.  I can make and receive calls, but once the connection is made, there is no sound (hearing or speaking).  The other parties confirm they answer or know that I have answered but then there is no sound either way.  I know this used to work when I first got the phone.  Feels like something changed in the past few months?",
