    "content": "I have a Repeat Alarm set up on my Google Pixel 4a.\n\nWhen the alarm sounds, I swipe right to dismiss, and get a pop-up message \"Alarm Off\". But this seems to switch off the alarm completely, in the Clock App. It has switched off and will not sound tomorrow.\n\nHow do I change this behaviour? I want to switch off the alarm right now; I do not want to switch it off permanently for the future. \n\nI have checked the setting according to the below link, and cannot resolve this problem:\nhttps://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/2840926?hl=en\n\nThanks & Regards,\nAKnn",
