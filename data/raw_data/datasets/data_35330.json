    "title": "Pixel crashes when sending or receiving calls",
    "content": "Whenever I receive a call, the phone locks up on the call screen, and I need to reset the phone. Whenever I try to send a call, it will ring once, then go silent, while the call timer goes on indefinitely. If I try to hang up, or do anything, the phone locks up, and has to be reset.\n\nAfter googling the issue, I saw some people had success uninstalling and reinstalling the dialer app, and while inconvenient, it worked a couple of times, but now I can't even make a call on a fresh reinstall.",
