    "content": "Hi.\nI've been on Android phones for many years now, and I'm about a week or so in on my very first Pixel (5) device, and I have to say I'm loving it!\nI like the fact that we can send feedback in the About phone menu, and I love the online chat that google offer through the Tips+support menu. What a great service this is. Brilliant!\nI also like this official google forum to put our questions in, and to look for advice.\nHowever, wouldn't it be more logical to sub divide this forum into device-specific forums, as when I'm looking through here for possible answers they probably wont apply to my specific pixel.\n\nJust a thought.\nKeep up the good work. I probably will not sway from Pixels now that I have one! :)",
