    "content": "The Gmail search function does not work for my email addresses using POP3. It works for only my email address using IMAP. I've contacted Google support many times and they are not able to resolve this issue. I ended up upgrading my phone from a Pixel 1 to Pixel 2 and I'm still having the same issue. I do not recommend a Pixel phone if you're trying to connect to your emails using POP3.",
