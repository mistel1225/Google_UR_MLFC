    "content": "For the past few weeks my automatic app updates have stopped working while my Pixel 3 is on the Pixel Stand.  I put my phone on my stand every night and everything used to work fine.  I would wake up in the morning to find 'X' number of apps have updated.  Now I just get the notification that application updates are available, but they never update.  If i take the cable out of the stand and connect it directly to the phone all of the apps automatically update within a few minutes.",
