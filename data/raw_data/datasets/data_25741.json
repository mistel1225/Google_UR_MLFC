    "content": "I have used Driving mode on my Pixel devices for years.  I now have a 3 and for the past few months, it no longer prompts for driving mode when connecting to Bluetooth or when it detects I'm driving, like it used to.\n\nI've tried deleting Android Auto, clearing storage on Pixel Ambient Services and then just clearing storage on Android Auto.  I don't think the problem is with Android Auto.\n\nI'd say in the past 3 months, my phone has prompted me 5 times for driving mode out of the 100's of times it should have, based on past experience.   Now, instead of prompting the screen flashes like it's turning on driving mode, but then goes right back to whatever I had open and working on at the time.\n\nI'm afraid the next step is to reset my phone, but I'm hoping someone out there has an idea of what app I can clear storage on or reset some other way to make this work again.  I miss the feature.",
