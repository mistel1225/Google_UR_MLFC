    "title": "3aXL media cuts out under a few minutes after screen sleep after android 11 update.",
    "content": "I updated to android 11 and have been unable to listen to any media on my phone such as audible, podcasts, or Amazon music due to audio cutting out sporadically after screen sleep. If I pick my phone up and the screen turns on the audio will automatically come back from wherever it was.\n\nThis is apparently an issue that was around with one of the earlier OS updates and I tried some of those solution to fix it such as allowing the apps to use battery in the background and it hasn't fixed anything.  Audio will also sometimes cut in and out, stutter, then resume, it may be resuming from when the screen turns on due to notifications however.\n\nI drive long distances for work and spend a lot of time in my car listening to audio books and this update just destroyed 75% of what I use my phone for these days. Like so many others I'm considering going over to apple after getting bent over the table with this \"update\".",
