    "content": "So for the past few weeks I've experienced a rather weird and annoying bug on my google pixel 4 which sort of works like the black screen of death where my phone screen wont turn on. I've tried many different steps that appear in tutorials and reddit posts such as rubbing your screen, some freezer trick, restarting, charging it for a while, and many more. It's weird because some fixes do work but my phone only stays on for a random amount of time before it turns off again. For example first time that this happened it didn't turn on for a hour, than for a day, and it worked fine after but after a few days it just turned on and didn't turn on for a week until today when it did turn on but only for about a minute before it turned back off. Recently, I've also been getting a green tint on my screen and lines that flicker and are almost transparent. All these problems have started around the same time on my phone (almost a month ago) so I think that they are related but I don't know. I'm thinking of bringing my phone in for repairs but I just wanted to make sure that their isn't any thing I can do on my part. If their are fixes please let me know and is anyone else experiencing this (Not my picture but it describes what's happening well).",
