    "content": "I've recently signed up to the pixel 5 on a 5g plan and yesterday became aware of the issue regarding the pixel 5 not streaming HD content such as Netflix etc. I signed in to my Netflix account to test it out and it looks like my phone is one of those affected, the video quality reminds me of VHS. I looked online and found articles from April saying Google are aware and trying to sort it out but just wondered if anyone knew any more info or if there was something I needed to do to sort it. I've updated the phone and all apps already.",
