    "content": "I'm not interested in seeing sports items in my newsfeed (the Google App on the leftmost screen). So, in Discover > Customise Discover > Sports, I have turned off Sports updates.\n\nAlso, whenever a sports item comes up in my newsfeed, I select the menu > Not interested in Sports. The message is shown, \"Got it. No more about Sports.\"\n\nHowever, this does nothing, because it keeps showing me Sports items, every time when the newsfeed refreshes (several times daily).\n\nHow can I fix this to stop showing me sports items?",
