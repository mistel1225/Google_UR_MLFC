    "content": "I am interested in knowing if:\n\nThe cables USB-A to USB-C    and  USB-C both ends,  that came bundled with a brand new OG Pixel  XL (1st generation)  as well as the original Pixel XL charger that came bundled with it,  can be used with the 2018 Pixel 3 XL phone.\n\nI kept those cables from the OG Pixel XL when that phone broke.  So, I want to use, specially the USB-A to USB-C to connect my phone to my computer and transfer files and use Android's \"adb and fastboot\" utilities.   Can that cable be used safely with the Pixel 3 XL ?\n\nWhat about the OG Pixel XL charger ?  It seems to be also a 18W charger.  Is it functionally identical to the charger that comes bundled with a brand new Pixel 3 XL ?  Can it be safely used with the Pixel 3 XL ?\n\nLastly, the OG Pixel XL  USB-C to USB-C  charging cable... same thing,  can this be used with the PIxel 3 XL ?\n\nOf course I am interested in engineering/science grounded answers,  not on beliefs or \"I think that\" answers... we need truthful info here as to not fry a brand new Pixel 3 XL !    Guess, that makes sense, right?\n\nThe reasons for asking this is that with (my) previous Google phones,  namely Nexus 6P,  it was absolutely NOT recommended to even exchange cables with the Nexus 5X ... due to some (lots?) of incompatibilities.  This was advised by Benson Leung  from Google.   https://bensonapprovedcom.wordpress.com/   back at the time.\n\nYour comments are well appreciated,   thanks in advance.\n\nFelipe",
