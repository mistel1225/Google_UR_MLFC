    "content": "since ldac performance is contingent on streaming at 660, and I don't have a desktop I have invested a lot of time and effort in acquiring Tidal and a Zen Blue Receiver-DAC for Home Audio. is apparent that the makers but my phone don't hold music in his high of regard as LG and Samsung and some of the others,but being that I have Android 10 on this device it is just hard to imagine not being able to adjust bitrate to 660 and having it stay adjusted in developer settings. I've also read some conflicting things about the LG in the Samsung devices in terms hope they're having the capacity that my phone seems to lack but I've also red smarticles on Tidal which state that their maximum streaming speed for cell devices is 330. all this vague and conflicting information is made me nauseous and I'm about ready to go out and get a TracFone I love music by and by no means a technologically adept individual and I don't have the money to pay somebody to do it for me.I really miss the days when you can talk to a live person face-to-face and get advice for get information on how to do something",
