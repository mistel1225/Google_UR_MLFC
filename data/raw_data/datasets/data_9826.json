    "content": "Haven't dropped my phone but the display won't stay steady unless I push down on certain parts of the screen. The touch screen still works perfectly fine. When I restart the phone the screen stays on but has a sepia colour while it's turning on until my lockscreen is shown. Not really sure what's happening. I got the screen replaced with UBIF back in August and haven't had problems until now.",
