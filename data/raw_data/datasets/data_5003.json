    "content": "Hello,\n\nI'm having trouble opening PDF links straight from google chrome. Before, I'd be able to search for a journal article in the search engine, click on one of the links, I'd be prompted to allow the pdf to download, and could open the pdf document for reading directly in chrome. Now, when I click on the search engine link, it doesn't even prompt me to allow for download and nothing in the downloads folder either. Please help!",
