    "content": "After the Android 10 update my Pixel XL has intermittent Bluetooth issues. It will think it is still connected to the car Bluetooth after the car has been turned off for example and it will not connect to any other Bluetooth device unless the phone is restarted. Turning the Bluetooth off and on again does not help with the issue. \nWhen the issue occurs it does not matter if i turn the Bluetooth off and on again. It will still think it is connected to a previously connected device. \nIt was all smooth sailing before the Android 10 update. Never has an issue with Bluetooth. \n\nAnyone else experience this or has a solution?",
