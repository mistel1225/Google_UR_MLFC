    "content": "Hi,\n\nSince I upgraded my Pixel 2 XL to Android 10 my 5G wifi has issues staying connected and I am only 20 ft from my router. Nothing has changed when on Android 9. The device keeps attempting to connect to my 5 G or 2.4G signal but nothing connects. Never had an issue before on 9 and signal strength was never an issue.",
