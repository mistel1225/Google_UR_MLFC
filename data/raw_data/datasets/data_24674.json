    "content": "My wife is having trouble sending me pictures from her new pixel 3 XL to my new pixel 3 XL. She can send pics to anyone else but when she tries to take a picture directly from the message app and send to me she gets a \"file too large\" error message. Not sure if this is an issue on her phone or mine but it seems to only happen when she sends pictures to me",
