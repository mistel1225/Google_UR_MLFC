    "content": "Previous questions about enabling the FM radio have (rightfully) pointed out that wired headphones are essential to enabling the FM radio, but the 3a _has_ a headphone jack - thank you - so it could be possible.\n\nCan someone comment on whether there are plans to allow users to listen to FM radio on the 3a?  The FCC continues to want this enabled.  Thanks!",
