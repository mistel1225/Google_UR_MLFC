    "content": "Hi. I hear that google pixel won't work in india because indian government doesn't have the technology to manage it. Sorry to say but I can't get it clearly, what does the i dian govt need to make it available? Could you please explain me detailly what feature won't be available and why? I am in india and I'm planning to buy it in the future from some other country. I also heard that the features will be regionally blocked. Does that mean the phone won't even work in india or only the soli sensor and things related to it won't work? Could you please tell this also, \"what features won't work in india\". Thank you. And also tell me when the latest model of Google pixel will be sold in the Indian market? Thank you.",
