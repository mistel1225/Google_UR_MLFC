    "content": "Hi! I bought my pixel 2xl in February 2018 straight from Google and it had been working great till yesterday. Since last night my phone has been shutting down randomly ( not restarting, just shutting down). I've tried factory resetting the phone but that hasn't helped and right now I'm in part of the world which doesn't any Google stores. Can someone help?",
