    "content": "Kinda new to this. Sometimes I need to save a file that is on my Pixel 3 to GD for safekeeping.\n\nRight now I select the file in question in the FILES app and choose SHARE (to GD). Is that the usual method? Are there other (better) ways to do the transfer?\n\nThanks for your experience.",
