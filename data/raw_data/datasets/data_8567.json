    "title": "Why/How is Google Pixel 4a now showing temperature on the Home and Lock screens?",
    "content": "Starting today, 13th Jan 2021 (after an Android 11 update), I now have a temperature display on my Google Pixel 4a home screen and lock screen, alongside the date.\n\nTwo questions:\n\nHow can I switch this off? (I did not ask for it; it just appeared after the Android update)\n\nHow is the phone getting my location?\n\nAn accurate minute-by-minute temperature display shows that the phone must know my exact location. However, I have the \"Use Location\" setting switched OFF, and I also have denied access to Location for ALL my Apps ... so I do not understand how the phone is getting this information? Are there other location settings I need to switch off? Anybody know?\n\nThanks\nAKnn",
