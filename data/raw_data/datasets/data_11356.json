    "content": "I got my new 4a 5G last week. \nWhen I am on a call and hold the phone to my ear, the screen goes dark (as it should).  \nHowever, when I take the phone away from the ear during the call, there is a delay of 2-3 seconds before the screen lights up. \nThis never happened on any of my previous Android phones - the screen always lit immediately.  \n\nAny advice?",
