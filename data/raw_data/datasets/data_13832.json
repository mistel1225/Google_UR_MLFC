    "content": "I received my Google pixel 4a yesterday and wanted to set up the Pokemon companion live wallpaper but couldn't find it anywhere. Updating my phone to the newest Android version, updating the wallpaper and live wallpaper app, as well as turning the apps off and on again in the system settings all did not help. I also tried to use the apk-app method, that lets you download the live wallpaper to a non pixel device without any success. My question now is if the pixel 4a is compatible with the Pokemon live wallpaper at all (since other live wallpapers from Google are functioning without any problem) and if so, what else should I try to make it work? Thank you all so much!",
