    "content": "Which speaker (top or bottom) is used when your phone rings or is on speaker? Those 2 sound functions are not working. I'm in IT and have tried everything I know to try to resolve it. Curious if it sounds like my bottom speaker is broke if someone could answer because youtube or any videos and games do play sound with no problems. I tried booting into SafeMode and still no audio. Even if I test a ringtone it will not work. If I have a Telehealth call, no speaker phone. Microphone is working no problem. Does this sound like a hardware problem? I tried to google to find out if the ringtone and speaker is on the bottom speaker only and I cannot find the answer.",
