    "content": "I have an unlocked Pixel 4A that I bought new on Amazon a couple weeks ago. I am using it with Verizon.\n  The issue: if someone sends me a text message when the phone is off, I never receive it when the phone is turned back on. I’ve confirmed this over and over again with my wife texting me from the same room.\n  Even stranger: if airplane mode is enabled and someone sends me a text, I do receive it when I turn airplane mode off.\n  This is true for both the default google messages app, as well as the Verizon messages app.\n  I spent an hour on the phone with Verizon, where they ultimately kicked it to their IT department, who told me a few days later that the network is fine and it must be a device problem.\n  I then spent an hour on the phone with Google, where we tried a number of fixes, including a factory reset, and nothing worked. They said this was an unknown issue for them and it must be a problem with that specific phone, and they recommended replacement.\n  So I got another new Pixel 4A from Amazon, swapped over my sim card, and… it has the same problem! The android software is entirely updated, and it still does not receive texts sent when it is turned off.\n  So I guess I’m not turning my phone off anytime soon, and I need to get used to using the Do Not Disturb function.\n  Does anyone have any other suggestions?",
