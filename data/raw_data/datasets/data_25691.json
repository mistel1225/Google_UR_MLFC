    "title": "Blue dot in images with strong light source in frame",
    "content": "Whenever I take a photo into the sun, or with another strong light source within the picture frame, I get a pronounced blue dot appearing in the image. See, for example, https://photos.app.goo.gl/dbefSUVr9LZz6sok9, where the dot is centred left-right and about three quarters of the way down.\n\nI'm quite familiar with lens flare - I've been shooting pictures into the sun like this for more than 50 years - and this is not it - you can see lens flare in other parts of this picture, and the dot is something different. It appears in any photo I take with the Pixel 2 that has the sun within the picture frame, and also if I take a night-time photo that has a strong streetlight in the frame.",
