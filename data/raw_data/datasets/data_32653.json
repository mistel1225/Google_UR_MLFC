    "content": "when I am in a phone call, I can constantly hear a crackling noise in the background most recently all sound keeps cutting out for a few seconds throughout the phone call, and people on the other line say I keep cutting in and out and they can't hear me. Think it might be something wrong with the hardware. even when it is working people say its very quiet and somewhat crackly.",
