    "content": "Play music on concerts and DJ mixes does not have continuous playback without a momentary pause. It worked fine on other pixel devices pixel, pixel 2 Standard and XL models. On three different pixel 3 XL and pixel 3 devices I have experienced this non-continuous playback. Anybody else have this issue? Google will not confirm the issue when one of their techs duplicated and heard the issue with their in-house support phone.",
