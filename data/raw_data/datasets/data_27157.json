    "content": "Why does the pixel 3XL (64GB) variant has only 260$ trade in value for buying pixel 4XL where as the rival company's Apple iPhone XS max (64gb) have a trade in value of 470$?\n Can Google team please fix this by increasing the trade in value for pixel 3XL than iPhone XS max?\n\nNote: I have selected other network device for both the mobiles.",
