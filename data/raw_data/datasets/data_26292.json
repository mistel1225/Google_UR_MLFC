    "content": "I have my screen changed at CTDI. For the first time, the screen went green after half day usage; for the second time, the screen become super insensitive and response lags. (If type 4 letters, only 2 recorded) I asked Google call back, if they can't fix for the third time, is there another solution. Google asked me to keep going to CTDI. I asked Google what if they can't fix it forever. Google said they are hands off anyway, and CTDI is the only option. Good for CTDI, too bad for Google users. Shame on Google.",
