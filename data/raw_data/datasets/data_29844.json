    "content": "I bought my Pixel 3 XL new shortly after they came on the market, and I've never had a problem with the display. I'm also by now very much accustomed to how the display looks. I went out for breakfast this morning, and there was nothing unusual about it. When I got home, I noticed that there was a yellowish tinge to the display. I had not installed anything--though I believe there was a system update that came through shortly after.\n\nI have, of course, tried restart the phone, as well as powering it off and back on, but I'm not seeing the display restored to normal. On the other hand, when I restart, the white screen that appears at the beginning of the process, with the animated Google logo, is white, as it should be. When I get to the home page, the time display looks white for a brief moment and then rapidly transitions to the yellowish tinge.\n\nThe screen isn't less legible: it just doesn't look right. What's the fix?",
