    "content": "I'm looking at ordering a pixel 4a for work as they support dual SIM with eSIM, however it is not clear whether pixel phones which support eSIM allow you to assign contacts to specific SIM cards. The information I can find only talks about setting the default SIM for certain services (text, call, data) and then being able to choose which one I use each time.",
