    "title": "Phone or alarm (?), without notification of any sort, cannot be dismissed nor lowered in volume",
    "content": "Twice this past week a loud ringtone or alarm sound has gone off without the being a way to stop it or turn it off.\n\nThe first time, the loud repeating melody interrupted a call I was in, but, without anything to dismiss, I told the person on the other end that I'd have to call them back. After ending that call, the sound continued until I reset my phone.\n\nThe second time, when I had taken my phone out of my pocket, it began playing loudly again. I tried turning it down, but again no effect. I opted to restart it, which fixed the issue for the time being.\n\nBoth times this has happened, I was home and the phone was on vibrate (my default \"ringtone\"). I bought the Pixel 2 from Google and put a Verizon wireless chip card in. I have a formerly Google Fi phone number that I used internationally this last summer that is now my family Google Voice number after cancelling the Fi subscription stateside and I have my original Google Voice number that is tied to my work account. I've opened Hangouts and Voice with these other accounts to check for any missed calls, and there is no indication that there were any. The differing times the sounds went off and my alarm settings make me want to rule out it being alarm-related.\n\nAny ideas or suggestions?",
