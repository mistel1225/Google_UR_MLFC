    "content": "I have flashed a build of the Android Open Source project to my Pixel 3 via usage of the Android Flash Tool, and I want to update the operating system to the latest build without losing any data. I see that there is one option to flash one image without 'wiping the device', but what data, exactly, does this keep?\n\nIf possible, I also want to know whether I can gain root access via usage of the Android Flash Tool, as there is one option that is labelled as 'Force Debuggable', which mentions 'adb root'.",
