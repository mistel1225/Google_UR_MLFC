    "title": "Pixel 5 - WhatsApp Notification Loop",
    "content": "I am having an issue with my Pixel 5. When listening to Spotify with my Pixel Buds 2 and a notification comes through from WhatsApp the notification sound (galaxy) plays on a permanent loop over the music, even after the notification has been dismissed. Only a reset of the device solves this issue.\n\nUpdate: this happens with WhatsApp on Android 11 even when the Pixel Buds are not connected. Killing WhatsApp does not stop the loop so it is clearly an Android issue.",
