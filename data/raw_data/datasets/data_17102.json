    "content": "After the latest security update, music is muted unless Live Caption is turned ON.  When you turn it on, the music plays, but is again muted once the screen turns off (after 30 seconds on my phone).  If Live Caption is OFF, no music comes out of either of my 2 players, Google Play Music and Blackplayer EX.  Interestingly, this does not affect podcasts, so I suspect it is the music stream that is being impacted.  I am using pocketcasts for podcasts.  I am on a Pixel 3XL with Android 10.",
