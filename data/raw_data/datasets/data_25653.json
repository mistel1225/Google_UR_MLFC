    "title": "Trouble restoring data and settings after reset",
    "content": "Hello, My phone was in my purse earlier today and I had noticed it was on the \"G\" logo screen. When I got home about an hour later, I found out that this meant it was stuck in Boot Loop. After trying to soft reboot without any luck, I quickly realized I had to factory reset. I have always had my phone on backup, so I knew that it would be as simple as logging in to my account once prompted in order to recover my data and settings....\n\nNow that I have gone through the set up process and logged in with my account, none of my settings or apps have downloaded. I can see my backup on my Drive, but there is no way to download. I am not sure what to do. Will have I have to factory reset again just to access that recovery screen again?\n\nThank you in advance!",
