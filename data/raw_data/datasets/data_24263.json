    "content": "this is undoubtedly a pixel specific issue,, all other devices are actively connected to wifi with solid connections. my pixel 4xl (since last system update) constantly experiences \"no internet\" connection error on my personal home wifi network despite signal being solid with an 5 GHz frequency, Excellent signal strength and 800+ Mbps speed... \nI have followed all recommended troubleshooting steps provided by support.google.com and online forms posted prior to the 1 January 2020 update with no joy..    \ntroubleshooting steps include: resetting phone, forgetting network, resetting the modem/router, reset all network settings.. i have tried checking for updates but nothing has been released.. \nI have yet to start a full factory reset as i am reluctant to lose everything and start over :( \n\nany help is greatly appreciated !",
