    "content": "My phone has a camera problem. The camera is constantly refocusing, which is why often photos are out of focus or part of the photo is out of focus. I upgraded the phone to Android 9, but the problem did not resolve. I did a phone reset - that didn't help either. Support chat does not work, I can not send a message. The call does not work either. How can I exchange my phone, the warranty ends on December 4th :(",
