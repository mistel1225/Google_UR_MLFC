    "content": "Has anyone else experienced very high battery consumption after updating to Android 11?T updated my pixel 3 last night and today my battery has gone from 100% to 11% in about 5 hrs with only 38 minutes of screen-on-time... What could be doing this? Previous battery life was the 14 or so hours advertised.",
