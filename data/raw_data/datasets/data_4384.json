    "content": "I feel like I'm going crazy because the media controls are wildly inconsistent when they appear and when they don't. It'll be appearing fine for a while on my lock screen and my notification bar but then suddenly it won't appear on my lock screen and I have pull down twice to see it. I haven't changed any settings, all the media apps have notifications turned on and are allowed on the lock screen. Media player in quick settings is enabled so why does it keep disappearing? I've various solutions from forcing the Pixel Launcher to stop and clearing it's cache to toggling to the Media Player in Quick Settings option (even though it was already on!). Can we please get this fixed?",
