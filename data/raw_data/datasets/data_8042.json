    "title": "Other parties can't hear me on a conference call",
    "content": "When I initiate a conference call, the other parties can hear each other, but they cannot hear me. Weirdly, if one of the other calls has a phone tree that has to be navigated, it *does* register the keys I press on my phone, but once a human answers, they can't hear me. I have tried this with a wired Google-branded headset, a Bluetooth headset and no headset, all with the same result. I have tried restarting my phone in safe mode (a solution recommended elsewhere in the community forums) and I am still experiencing the same thing. I use the conference call feature for my job, so I need this feature to work. I don't know the last time this feature worked correctly, but I first experienced the problem on April 7, 2020 and I am still experiencing it today (April 15, 2020). My system and all of my apps are up to date.\n\nI don't know if this is relevant, but when I add a call to an active call, the calls are immediately joined in a conference call. I am no longer given the option to \"merge calls.\"",
