    "content": "I have been trying to downgrade from the Android 11 Beta back to a stable version of Android 10. When I opted out the normal way, the update downloads, installs, but I am welcomed by the beta program still. I tried sideloading Android 10 but there was no luck there. My device is bootlocked by my carrier and there is no way around it. What can I even do?",
