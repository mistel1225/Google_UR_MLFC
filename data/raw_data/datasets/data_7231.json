    "content": "Hi,\n\nSo my Google Pixel 4a seems to randomly turn the notification and ringtone all the way down at sporadic times. There doesnt seem to be any set pattern to it, it just turns the volume for ring other alerts down resulting in me missing texts. Is there a way to stop it from randomly turning the \"ring and notification\" volume off? Thanks.",
