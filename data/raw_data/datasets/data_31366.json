    "content": "I used to have a Google Pixel (the original). Soon after I upgraded to Pie, my wallpaper started reverting to a certain (stock) wallpaper every day or every time it restarted. After it did that [assuming I didn't change the wallpaper back], the next day or next time it restarted, there would be a black bar across the bottom of the wallpaper on the home screen. Then every day or restart, the black bar would cover more and more of the screen until the wallpaper was only visible at the very top. [If I tried to change it back to a different wallpaper, the process started over--wallpaper change the next day, black bar appears, then gets bigger, etc.]\n\nWhen I got the Pixel 3, for the first 2 weeks, it worked perfectly. Yesterday when I woke up, the wallpaper had reverted to the stock wallpaper that was showing when I first got the phone (the pink sky with mountains at the bottom). I changed it back to a (stock) wallpaper. This morning when I woke up, the wallpaper is now a different stock wallpaper (that I've used before, but not the one I set yesterday), AND there is a black bar covering nearly all of the screen.\n\nI don't have any wallpaper apps installed (except Zedge, but I don't use their wallpaper). I had not downloaded any new apps or installed anything the day this started. The only thing that I can think of is that I had changed the lock screen (not the home screen) to one of my own photos for the first time; I had been using stock wallpapers exclusively for the last 2 weeks before that. \n\nPhoto attached from today. I regret having deleted the screenshots from my old Pixel, but I thought the problem was solved when I got the Pixel 3. ",
