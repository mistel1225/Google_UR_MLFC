    "content": "Okay. So i'm hoping the quality of life stuff i'm experiencing with the pixel buds comes down to me just not understanding how they work. I currently am using the pixel buds paired with a pixel 3 XL.\nI'm wondering how people use them first of all, since for me it feels like they just hinder my ability to use my phone. Are you supposed to just leave them in your ears for the entire day? I find the pixel buds quite comfortable, but i don't think i can keep them in my ears the entire day. However, if i take them out and place them on a desk or something beside me while i'm doing some work, they stay on and I find I miss notifications of text messages or emails and such. Also, when i go to put them back into my ears to use, the touch sensitive right ear bud just starts turning on music or prematurely answering calls before i'm ready. I read there was now a way to turn them off by tapping the right earbud 3 times, but when i do that, and take them out of my ears, they seem to have been turned on again by the act of me touching them to get them out of my ears.\nSo how do you guys use these things? i feel like they should be easier to use than this. I love the sound quality and the buds are quite comfortable to me, but i find myself frustrated by the usage.",
