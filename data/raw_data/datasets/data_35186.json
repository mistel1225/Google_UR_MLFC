    "title": "I have a 2007 Audi A3. I can pair via BT but there is no audio during a call. Why?",
    "content": "My phone and car are connected via BT. I know this because if I make a call, the music in my car (i.e. radio) stops and it shows a call is being made. But no audio comes through. What is the fix?\n\nI had a Pixel2 (and numerous Nexus and Pixel phones before this) and never had an issue until now.",
