    "content": "Weird issue with my device. When I upgraded and went to a different launcher I noticed Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter were all grayed out. Checked settings on the device, confirmed grayscale wasn't turned on, still no luck. Went back to Pixel Launcher and voila, color returns. Got bored, went back to a different launcher, same problem. Decided to go back to Pixel cause I'll trade off features for functionality and those same apps when opened are still gray. Worth noting, I thought it was a social media issue but Snapchat has color. So, not sure what that's about. Anybody aware of a setting I may not have tried?",
