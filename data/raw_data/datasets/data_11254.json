    "content": "The fingerprint doesn't work often. When I use fingerprint to unlock it often said couldn't process or not recognize. I already tried to remove fingerprint and add one in safe mode according to chat's instruction, but it is not fixed. I tried to reconnect to chat but it showed chat closed. This problem has been two weeks and I just got my phone last month.",
