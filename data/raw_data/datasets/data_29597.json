    "content": "After transferring all my data including photos and videos to my new Google Pixel, I found that the dates shown for my photos were wrong. My Sony Xperia X Performance has the correct dates for the photos. But on my Google Pixel it displays it wrong. Such as a photo taken in 2014 was stated by Google Photos in my Google Pixel as January 2018, the Xperia displays it as the correct date. I have over 20000 videos and photos, and scrolling through wrong dates for photos is a hassle and confuses me a lot. As a mom, I really don't want to forget and remember wrong memories as I get older. Does anyone have a fix to make it display the correct date?",
