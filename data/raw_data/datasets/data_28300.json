    "title": "Google apps keep crashing after Android 10 upgrade",
    "content": "After upgrading from Android Pie to 10, my phone has been partially functioning for a week without solutions or OTA fix. Here is a list of critical things stopped functioning. I do urge Googlers please push fix ASAP. I know it's very tempting to show-off OS feature superiority right before Apple special event. But current Android 10 release is by no means an up-to-standard stable consumer ready version.\n\nMajor malfuntions:\n1. Google Play always crashes on \"My apps and games\" screen when it tries to upgrade apps.\n2. Camera app takes not photos or videos despite of clicking shutter button.\n\nBesides that, significant performance slowdown is observed. \n\nI am sure people like me who bought Pixel phones have accepted the assumption that Google is a great software company hence we are tolerant and patient about Pixel hardware faults. But with Android 10 major letdown, I start to doubt Google's ability to be a great software company.",
