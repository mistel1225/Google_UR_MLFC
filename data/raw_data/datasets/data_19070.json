    "content": "After the update today, my phone doesn't wake up from sleep. I push the power button to turn off my phone.. and then it won't turn back on with the button. It takes several presses and waiting for it to wake up. There doesn't seem to be any helping it. Holding the button down does nothing. I don't know what to do.",
