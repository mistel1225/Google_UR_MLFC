    "content": "Recently, I've had trouble making both of my Soundpeats Truecapsule 2 earbuds work.  My phone can connect to both of them, but can only set one of them as an active device, meaning I'm only listening with one of them.  I've tried resetting my phone and the earbuds, and resetting my bluetooth settings, but nothing has worked.  Could it be a phone problem?  Or is it just the earbuds?",
