    "content": "Only recently got this pixel 4a and been having trouble using the 3 button nav. I much prefer this to gestures as I find it quicker to use. \n\nI have found it increasingly unresponsive however when clicking on the navigation buttons. Specifically the multitasking button, which often does not bring up recent apps tray. If typing like I am now and I press it, it will minimise the keyboard as if it is about to open the recent apps tray but it doesn't. Equally, if I press the button in an app that is using device's location, the location icon will disappear briefly as if it were to close the app and open recent apps tray, but again it doesn't...\n\nIf I use the multitasking feature from the home screen it seems to work. Also, using the gestures method of opening the recent apps tray also works which I find peculiar as I have chosen 3 button nav.\n\nThe home button also has this issue, but not all the time.",
