    "content": "Problems with the camera started ~1.5 month ago. When I try to open camera app it shows black screen for 2-3 seconds and then closes, sometimes it offers to send feedback to Google. sometimes camera opens (1 of 30-40 attempts) but theres still troubles with the focus. I tried to clear cache and made factory reset but it didn't helped.",
