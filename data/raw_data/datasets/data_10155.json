    "content": "Google logo circles, freezes and then it boots. I get into the bootloader but whatever option I choose in there I get \"no command\" screen but pressing down or up does nothing. Why?\nLast I used the phone was outdoors in the snow so it's possible it got water damaged. No way to check obviously because we have infinite resources to mine to make new phones. No need to design the phones so we can open them right? I can only guess the enormous amounts of e-waste coming just from the phones made so that the owner can't remove the back cover. I assume it's just because of greed but if I can't fix this, Google phone won't be the next one I'll buy.\nIt could be something else though but what else could it be?\n\nHaven't got a reply from the reseller about the warranty yet but if it's out of warranty what should I look for after melting the glue and prying the screen off?",
