    "content": "At random times my wifi and bluetooth will drop and sometimes my data as well. I've tried safe mode but nothing seems to happen at that point. It started happen after I update my phone two weeks ago. I typically have to reset my phone 3-4 times and take the SIM card out to get it back to normal but it is becoming quite bothersome.",
