    "content": "My Pixel 2 volume button is missing. The phone is within the warranty period. Verizon says they will charge me $299 to replace the phone, because this has not been described to them as a known hardware issue. Google says I have to send the phone in and won't get a replacement for 15 days? This is a business phone and I can't operate without it for 2 weeks. Has anyone found a viable solution to this or similar issues?",
