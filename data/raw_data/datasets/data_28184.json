    "content": "My Pixel 2 xl randomly stopped charging on my factory charger. I assumed it was the charger and ordered a new factory charger, however the problem persisted. I Restarted my phone multiple times, no luck. The dongle stopped working too. other USBC-USBC chargers do not work. only USBC to USBA works. I performed a factory reset and that still did nothing to solve the problem. I had Verizon look at my port and they could not see an issue.",
