    "content": "Google Photos on my Pixel 4a is on version 5.34.0.363108239. I have yet to receive the portrait light feature. I have checked on multiple single-person (above waist) photos taken with and without portrait mode. I have already tried uninstalling updates, restarting the phone, clearing the cache and data, and booting in safe mode.",
