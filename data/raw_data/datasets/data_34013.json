    "content": "I have tried 3 ways to get vibrate to work with notifications: 1) clicked vol up and power at same time 2) clicked vol down and clicked until vibrate icon shows in volume shortcut slider 3) went into sound settings and clicked the icon to vibrate. I get a small vibration when clicking icons and typing, and it vibrates for calls, but nothing for notifications. Is there a way to fix this?",
