    "content": "Since getting the Pixel 4 XL I have had it randomly reset / power-down abruptly. It started relatively benign at first. I assumed it had to do with applications and the software being updated, but as I spend more and more time with the phone the issues continue and have gotten more intense.\n\nThere have been several occasions where the phone's display would cut out and a large pixelated area would occur across the display. On one occasion the phone would not turn on at all causing me to do a hard reset. \n\nIf there are any suggestions I'm up for it.",
