    "content": "I've returned my Pixel 3 for warranty replacement, a month ago. It seems like nobody takes responsibility for this and it's impossible to get past helpdesk which is overseas and has no access to anything.\n\nI'd like to know what is your policy for keeping customers waiting. Is it indefinitely? If you never get stock again, what will you do?\n\nBesides my questions, I have to say that dealing with Google tech support has been a nightmare.",
