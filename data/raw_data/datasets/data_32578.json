    "content": "Request for an SMS Message API to store messages.  When assigning a different app to SMS, the files are still stored under a system default message folder and cannot be altered.  I'm requesting an API to all the SMS app to determine where to write those files with a default stub to go to the system message folder.\nSpecifically, Signal cannot save SMS messages to the message thread because it doesn't write to the default SMS folder.  It can send & receive but sent files are not visible.",
