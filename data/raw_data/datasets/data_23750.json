    "content": "My pixel 3 has gone into an infinite reboot loop, and the top of the phone has become very hot. Everything I've tried so far has no effect (ie holding the power + volume buttons, plugging it into a computer). The back of the phone is cracked and I suspect some water got in, but the phone has been working completely fine for a number of days since it got wet. Is there anything I can do? I'm assuming the phone is bricked which is literally the last thing I need right now -_-",
