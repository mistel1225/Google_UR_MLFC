    "content": "After updating the Pixel 3 XL to android 10, a week ago, the mobile network began to fall off on it constantly and the Wi-Fi speed decreased to 0.01 mb per second. I tried to dump it to the factory, it did not help. Previously, on the previous version of android everything worked without problems. Now I canâ€™t use any Wi-Fi. And in order to use the mobile Internet, I have to regularly turn it off and on in the settings so that it works stably for at least half a minute. According to my feelings, the mobile Internet stops working immediately when I do not use it, but in the future, despite the fact that it is turned on in the menu, you cannot use it until the communication module is rebooted. I already sent feedback from the phone about this problem, but for two days they did not answer me and did not consider the problem",
