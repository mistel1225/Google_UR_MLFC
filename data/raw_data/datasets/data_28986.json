    "content": "My Pixel 3 XL won't turn on. I get an error message that reads:\n\n\"Can't find valid operating system. The device will not start. \nVisit this link on another device:\ng.co/ABH\n\nID: 61FDA12B\"\n\nIf I hold the power button and volume down I get the following options: \"Start, Power Off, Barcode, Recovery Mode and Restart Bootloader\". They all lead me to the same error screen that I started with. \n\nI have not changed the operating system myself or done anything that could explain this bug. \nThe device was bought in November and I recieved this error recently.\n\nI'd prefer trying to fix the phone with your help before shipping it for repairs/replacement.\n\nRegards,\nStefán Ingi Árnason",
