    "content": "I bought the pixel 3a a few months ago and I had to do the Android 10 update while setting up the device. I wasn't allow to use cellular data to do the update. I thought maybe the update was over a GB so it wasn't allowing me but I recently I got a 17 MB update and it still won't let me use cellular data to update. I have attached the photo of the warning I keep getting while trying to use cellular data. How can I fix this problem?\nP.S. I tried resuming but it keeps taking me back to the same message in a loop.",
