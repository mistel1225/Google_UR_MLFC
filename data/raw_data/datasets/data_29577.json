    "content": "I ordered a Pixel 3A while the offer was on for the $100 credit from Google Store (ordered before 11:59 pm Saturday, 5/18). Later I went to the site to check on the order and it was canceled. I chatted with the support people and they told me that I canceled the order and that they couldn't undo the cancellation. I asked to speak to a supervisor and they told me someone would contact me within 24 hours but that they wouldn't be able to 'un-cancel' my order either. I got that e-mailed response and they did tell me that there was nothing they could do and offered no other avenue. Who can I contact within Google Support with the ability to make this right? I want the Pixel 3A but it seems kind of stupid not to get the additional benefit of the credit to the Google Store. I met all the criteria. It seems a bit odd to me that someone within the hierarchy of Google doesn't have the authority, ability, and desire to fix this for me. I love that 'corporate' mindset. I'm open to any suggestions as to how I can resolve this.",
