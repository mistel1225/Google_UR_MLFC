    "title": "Android notification, sync, and app-install issues",
    "content": "I had an OG Pixel XL, and after the update to Android 10, I started having the following issues:\n\nNotifications for ALL apps (including text messages, Google Voice, calendar notifications, etc.) would come in en masse once or twice a day, but not as they were supposed to arrive.\nI could get them to sync if I loaded the app (Voice, for example) and manually refreshed it.\nSyncing within apps would not happen unless I manually synced them\nFrom the Play Store, apps would download (either installing from scratch or updating) to 100%, then never install or update. \nRestarting the phone would often allow the app that had downloaded to update, but the next would get stuck in the same way. This was frustrating when updating several apps.\n\nFinally, out of frustration, I bought a Samsung Galaxy Note 8. This is a different manufacturer and different version of Android than the Pixel (Pie as opposed to 10). However, after a couple days of flawless functioning on the Note, the same EXACT issues cropped up. \n\nI'm at my wits' end! Can someone please tell me how to solve what appears to be an issue with my account? If it were a device issue, wouldn't switching devices have fixed it?\n\nThanks for any help you can offer!",
