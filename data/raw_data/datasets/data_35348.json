    "content": "For the last few days, I have had inconsistent issues with my Pixel 2XL (purchased July 2018).\nIssues include apps (eg Settings, social media, games) crashing upon opening. Camera opens, immediately crashes with fail box. Flashlight icon also is greyed out and not working. These problems happen all at once. However, the last few days the problem seems to resolve itself only to revert back to malfunctioning again.\nI have cleared caches and data, restarted the phone numerous times, and done a factory reset. Problems persist.",
