    "content": "Just received my Pixel 4a 5G yesterday and noticed at night when the display got dimmer that it had a greenish tint. It was especially noticeable in the menus in dark mode. Comparing with my Pixel 2, it is very obvious. Is this a defect? See images of pixel 2 screen (taken with pixel 4a5g) and pixel 4a5g screen (taken with pixel 2).",
