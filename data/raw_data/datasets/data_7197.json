    "content": "I own a lot of music through itunes and digital downloads I'd receive from buying records and my music files say that have transferred over but I have to manually go into them to play each song individually. I have spent a lot to own my collection and have consolidated it to a refined list of maybe 400 songs I want but don't want to start from scratch when it's already there. I just switched from my iPhone so it's all new to me and I've been struggling to find software I can download to make this an easier time.",
