    "content": "I installed the Baldphone launcher for my elderly father (which is awesome!) and he needs to also be able to use the keyboard that came with this app. When I go into the Pixel settings, there is not an option to change the keyboard default to be Baldphone (the option to deselect the Gboard is \"grayed out\"). He needs this keyboard for accessibility reasons. Is there a workaround?",
