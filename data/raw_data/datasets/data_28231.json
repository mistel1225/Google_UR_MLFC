    "title": "Download done with the Pixel Search bar (On Home screen)? Can not Find even with File Manger",
    "content": "Hello,\n\nSo I have a pixel 3 and used the search bar at the bottom of the home screen. I found a picture pressed in it, selected \"download\", I received the little message at the top of the phone notification showing the picture had been downloaded. \n\nI then went to look for it, tried the photos app and used the file manager the Default Pixel one and another one I downloaded from the play store (thought that might help) and could not find this picture. So I then went ahead and did this 2 more times, again the same thing, nowhere to be found (see the picture below, this is the message I got 3 times saying the pictures had downloaded).\n\nSo then I opened up the CHROME APP (used the chrome icon), did the same search found the same picture followed the same steps and everything went fine. The picture showed up in my photos under the \"Download\" and I also could see the download from the chrome app itself (by clicking on the bars/settings on the lower right). I also found the picture using my file manager, as I expected.\n\nSo......... here is the question, what happened here? Where did the first 3 pictures that I downloaded go? The ones that I downloaded using the main search bar at the bottom of the home page (not by clicking on the chrome app)? Clearly these pictures have a size to them and I want to delete them as they are holding up space somewhere. \nDid the phone lie and not really download the pictures? Does using the home search bar download these pictures elsewhere? \n\nAny help is appreciated , thank you.",
