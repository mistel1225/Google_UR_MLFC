    "content": "How can I select a phone number from Google Contacts or Google Maps and place a Hangouts call? \n\nSo Sad!  I now receive the error message, \"Cannot make a call without phone permission.\"  :( I use Hangouts ONLY on wifi or data for *ALL* of my phone calls and text messages!!!  \n\nMy Ting service provider has Calls and Text Messages BLOCKED and subsequently, of course, I have the Google Phone app and Google Messages app disabled! \n\nFor half a decade I have enjoyed no problems making calls this way through Google Contacts and Google Maps with Hangouts on my LG Nexus 5X :)  How do I now enable my new PIXEL to do the same thing????? \n\nI just want to click a phone number and make a phone call. \nThanks for any help you can provide.",
