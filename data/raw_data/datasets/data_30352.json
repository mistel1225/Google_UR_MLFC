    "title": "I have free original quality photo storage through Jan 2021, but it's hitting my drive storage",
    "content": "My photos have been backed up since I got my Pixel 2xl 18 months ago. It never hit my drive storage limit. I have the free unlimited storage of original quality photos until Jan 2021. In the last couple of weeks I have noticed that my drive storage is being taken up by photos. I don't think I've changed anything and I don't know how to stop my photo backups going directly to my drive.\n\nI hope this makes sense\n\nThanks!",
