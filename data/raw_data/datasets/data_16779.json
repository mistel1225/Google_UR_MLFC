    "content": "Out of nowhere last night my pixel started to rebooting itself and after each start it worked for like 10 seconds and then screen got frozen, dead pixels randomly showed up and phone rebooted itself again.\nAfter restarting the phone myself it worked for a while, and even it was up til morning and then again after the alarm went off it kept rebooting.\nI tried safe mode and phone rebooted in that mode. From then it just went from black screen to Google logo and black screen again... As its completely unusable for now I just turned it off to see what I can do.\nAs I don't have a backup of my data, is there anyway to fix it without factory reset? Or can I somehow get a backup in this situation?\nAlso I've read even factory reset won't work sometimes, what in that case?\n\nThanks in advance for your support!",
