    "content": "I have a Pixel 3a. Worked great until a few weeks ago.  Now, the bluetooth no longer connects with my vehicle (2018 Lexus NX) or Fitbit.\n\nI tried with my work iphone and it connected fine by bluetooth.\n\nHave restarted the phone, erased network settings, unpaired devices, and nothing works.\n\nHas anyone else or Google posted a solution  to this problem?  I suspect it was caused by Android 11 update to phone.",
