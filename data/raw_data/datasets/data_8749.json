    "content": "I received my Pixel Stand last December 2020 and it was working fine with my Pixel phone. Left it plugged-in before the December 20 in my condo unit and when I returned yesterday from vacation, the stand is no longer working. \n\nI have followed the instructions in the Help page for orange light.
