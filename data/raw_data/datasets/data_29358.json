    "content": "A few days ago my Pixel 3 (only 2 months old) stopped charging for no reason. Now when I try to plug it in white smoke emits from the charging port and I smell burning, like battery acid or something. \n\nHonestly, I just want my money back as I'm unhappy with the product as a whole but there seems to be no way to contact Google directly so I'm posting this on here.",
