    "content": "Recently my pixel's keyboard has been glitching. It will suddenly start spamming the C key (occasionally V and X as well, but primarily C) such that I cannot type anything else. It does this even when I am not currently touching the phone. It comes and goes, and will go away briefly after I restart my phone. Has anyone experienced any strange keyboard glitches like this? Thanks in advance",
