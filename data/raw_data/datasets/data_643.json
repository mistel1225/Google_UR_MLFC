    "content": "Since purchasing my Pixel 5 the network reception at my home is terrible and unreliable. My network Wifi calling enabled for the Pixel 5 and occasionally it shows up in the top taskbar as wifi calling (but not for long) but I am never able to make or receive calls.\nI have been in contact with my network providier for the past few weeks trying to problem solve this but they now say it must be a fault with the phone from the checks they have done (iDMobile). \nThe network reception is poor and the ability to use Wifi calling is a must, my Pixel 2 was great at this but the Pixel 5 seems to have this issue from alot of people, Anyone else experiencing this please?",
