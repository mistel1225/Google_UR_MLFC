    "content": "Hi there. \n\nI have a BT Pixel 3a (UK) that I would like to add an esim to.  I have signed a contract with O2 and obtained a qr code. However when I go to load it on my pixel 3a, it gives the message that the eSIM is \"locked to o2\" and that I need to check with carrier. \n\nI have spoken to o2 but they can't help because they say it doesn't make sense that the device is saying it's locked. It's an O2 SIM, so it can't be locked by o2! \n\nCan you help?\n\nMany thanks\nPhil",
