    "content": "Since my Pixel 3 updated to 10, I can no longer personalize each app to dark mode, it's either all or nothing. I liked my messages in dark mode but everything else in \"regular\" light mode. Not seeing any way in 10 to make just messages go dark? Was this option taken away? SO annoying when updates \"fix\" things that were not broken.",
