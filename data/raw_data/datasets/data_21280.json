    "content": "I want to use Gmail App in my Pixel 3 (of course, Android!) for reading e-mail on my own imap server and sending e-mail with Gmail smtp server. To setup so, I need to use Advanced Setting of Gmail App. However, Advanced Setting  of Gmail App has no choice for my using OAuth2 for login to Gmail smtp server. I eagerly expect Google will renew Gmail App and it will have OAuth2 function. Thank you.",
