    "content": "I have a Pixel 3A, just upgraded to Android 11.  I have Do Not Disturb set to allow interruptions from Contacts.  The phone does not ring when called from a contact, it rings fine when DND is off.  It worked perfectly for version 10, ringing for contacts.  I have been on with the support chatline and they checked all my settings with me no improvements.  Any ideas?",
