    "content": "I have owned Google phones since the original nexus. I currently have the pixel 3 xl and I am looking at upgrading the phone. Verizon is currently installing 5g in my city. My problem is that I'm not going to waste the money to buy another pixel until the phone can utilize 5g. Every article I have read say that the next release will not support 5g. When is Google planning on upgrading their line of phones to support 5g.",
