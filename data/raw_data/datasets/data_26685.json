    "title": "My Phone gets switched off when I quickly navigate from any app.",
    "content": "I have noticed this mostly when I use my phone camera & Whatsapp status. After which my phone would not start easily. Each time I try to switch on, my phone will shut down after showing Google written on the screen. Usually my battery will also die after this start and shut down cycle goes for around three times. Read other questions and saw some of them mention about this kind of behaviour when battery life is less than 50%. But for mine it happens even when battery charge is more than 50%.\n\nThanks Please help.",
