    "content": "The Jabra Elite 75t paired with my Pixel 3XL worked smoothly for a significant period of time and then, suddenly, a few months ago, the sound became completely erratic and very choppy.\n\nThe only situation in which the sound doesn't chop is if the earbuds and the phone are in clear line of sight, separated by less than one foot.\n\nEarbuds work perfectly when paired with a Pixel 3a.\n\nPixel 3XL\nAndroid 11 \nBuild RQ2A.210405.005",
