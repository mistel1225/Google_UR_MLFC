    "content": "Hi folks, maybe someone can help with this:\n\nRe-started and updated my Pixel 4a (Late 2020). Since update the keyboard is barely working. E.g. when entering SIM-PIN or trying to unlock phone touch screen / keyboard will recognize certain numbers easily, such as 3 or 5 and some not at all, no matter where I tap.\nAs a consequence, I cannot unlock my phone, because it won't accept my input on a couple numbers in my unlock-pin.\n\nPhone is in perfect condition (no broken screen, surface is clean and my fingers are also not too dry or whatever for the touchscreen to recognize) and it worked perfectly 1h ago before the update. Unfortunately, I cannot rewind the update because I can't unlock my phone.\n\nAny idea what to do?\n\nBest, Max",
