    "content": "Not every time, but often enough, the phone throws an update at me in the middle of the night which for whatever reason makes my alarm not work. It doesn't do anything. I'll wake up late, go to the phone and like clockwork the only thing on the screen is \"update ready restart to install'. \n\nI would just turn off auto update but in predictable fashion it seems this isnt an option. Which if true is bullshit.",
