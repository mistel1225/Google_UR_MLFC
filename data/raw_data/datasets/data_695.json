    "content": "About a week or two ago I noticed the battery on my 3 XL was draining much faster than normal. Now, every once in a while the \"___ isn't responding\" (I think that's what it says) box pops up and disappears quickly before I can choose an option. In addition, my phone isn't recognizing any wifi networks and Bluetooth is not working. Has anyone had similar problems or know how to fix this?",
