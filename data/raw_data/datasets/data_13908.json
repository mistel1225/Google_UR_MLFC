    "content": "I get bars on my camera screen sometimes on my camera screen, my phone has also been crashing/lagging and doing weird things like switching through screens recently. I have restarted, tried uninstalling and reinstalling my apps but I think my phone may have hardware defect. Is this common and should I be filing a warranty claim? I have only had my phone for like 6 months and haven't damaged the screen or anything.",
