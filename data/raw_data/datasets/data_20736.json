    "title": "Why has my Pixel 3XL's battery abruptly gotten worse in the last few days?",
    "content": "Just in the last few days, my phone has had very poor battery life. On a normal day, I go through maybe about 60-70% of the full 100% at charge. 6 hours in to the day and my phone is almost dead now. I tried restarting and looked at restricted apps, but nothing is sticking out. I've only had the phone for 15 months.",
