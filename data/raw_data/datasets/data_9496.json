    "title": "Notifications not working for signal, slack and messenger",
    "content": "I'm not getting proper notifications for slack, signal or messenger. The new bubble feature for signal works and I hear a sound but no notifications show up in the notification bar. If I turn off the bubble feature I only hear a slight dip in volume if I'm listening to a podcast or music.\n\nI'm not getting any notifications at all for slack. The only apps that seem to work are Gmail and the phone app.\n\nI've turned on notifications for all apps in phone settings and app settings and granted all permissions. All apps are up to date.",
