    "title": "Pixel 4XL sets its own media volume to maximum randomly",
    "content": "The volume randomly maxes out on the media when I try to do anything with it. This is terrible when I try listening to music and it will randomly set the volume to max. It is also important to note when I go into the sound settings and manually lower it on the slider it gives me a little ring and then goes back to max volume on it's own sometimes after a few seconds.",
