    "content": "Hello, I am using Pixel 4a under Android 11 and I have problem with the front camera: the picture quality and color is ok with the camera app, but when I make video chat with apps, my video quality is bad and the color had yellow to grey tint depending on the app I use (wechat, Line and Duo). Wechat is very yellow. I never had this problem with any of my old phones.\nCan it be a software issue from android 11 ?\n\nThank you.",
