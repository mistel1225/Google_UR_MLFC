    "content": "Have been using the pixel 3a since May so it's been more than 4 months in and the bottom and top firing speakers make crackling noises when audio is being played. Now it's been more prevelant and I haven't gotten this issue using Android 9 and I'm currently on Android 10; not sure if it's the update or some other thing causing the problem.",
