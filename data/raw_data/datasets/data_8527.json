    "title": "Why won't my Pixel 3XL not work after Version 11 came out?",
    "content": "I spend over three hours \"chatting\" with tech support.  They assured me they would email with instructions.  It just came in.  They told me to do the very same thing that THREE support people told me to do.  I was shuttled from one to another throughout a three hours \"chat\".  This morning I received a popup message to restart my Google Pixel 3XL phone to finalize a Version 11 update.  I did so and now NOTHING is working right on my phone.  It's basically useless at this point.  \n\nMy buttons don't work.  No swiping. No home screen.  I have to try to arrow around. I have no 4G network.  I can only do something when I'm on wifi.  Because everyone told me to clean my cache and reset my settings I now have all 172 apps without the appropriate permissions.  \n\nMy music is no longer available. I can't download anything  from the Google App store.  My phone won't connect to my fitbit. My phone won't download apps.  I can't back up my phone to perform a factory reset.  Argh!\n\nEssentially, I have a worthless phone.  I am beyond frustrated.  This has to be something in the Version 11.",
