    "content": "After trying out Android 12 beta, I decided to do a factory reset and go back to Android 11. \nWhen I logged in with my Google account, it transferred everything but my texts (which are very important) and my recent calls lists. (not that important)\nI did remember to backup my SMS, so this is not the issue. \nI have tried to reset 2 times now, and same thing happens.  What to do?",
