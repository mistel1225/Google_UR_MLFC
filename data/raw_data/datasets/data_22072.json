    "content": "So a few days ago I started noticing that my Pixel 2 would be really low on battery when I checked in the morning, after having been plugged in all night. Moreover, as I use it throughout the day, when I try to charge it with my quick charger, it just does not seem to be charging and there is no indication that the phone even knows its plugged in (e.g. battery icon does not change, no chime from being plugged in). However, once it has died (it's very sad to see its life dwindle away as I'm desperately trying to resuscitate it with the charger), it seems to charge pretty quickly back up. \n\nI've tried cleaning the usb-c port. This definitely has been the issue previously when I would have charging problems. But now I'm quite sure there's no more lint and nothing seems to have improved.\n\nI am running Android 10.\n\nThanks!",
