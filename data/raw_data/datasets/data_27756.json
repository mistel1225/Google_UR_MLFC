    "content": "Over the past week or so I've been having issues with my touch screen glitching. I first noticed it when I tried to send \"touc a text and and when I clicked send, it dialed the contact.\n\nAs I type here it is getting worse. I am about 10 minutes into this draft........\n\nI've restarted my phone which seems to temporarily fix it. I Uninstalled the only app I recently added. I tested the screen per the \"touchscreen issues\" article. I have not done a factory reset. The most common sign of the problem is I'll be typing (lower half of the screen) and the top taskbar will drop like i dragged it down. Interupting my typing and removing the keyboard.",
