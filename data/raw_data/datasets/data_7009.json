    "content": "I received my device yesterday and day 1, I had issue with screen timeout setting issue for a whole day and finally it worked after restarting the device. I invested so much and faced an issue already in a day 1. Now I am worried how long this device will perform in order. This is very bad for customer satisfaction and trust.",
