    "content": "So I have a Pixel 3 XL set up in French, and the \"h\" in the time format 23h23 allows me to have only 2 notifications displayed in the top left corner when device is unlocked (the notch cuts off the rest)\n\nI have seen videos of the pixel 3, and when set up in English, it seems to allow for one more notification space.\n\nMy question is: is there a way to change the time from at from using a \"h\" to using \":\" without changing language?",
