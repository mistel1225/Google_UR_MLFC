    "content": "I have a Pixel 3 that is too loud on the ears and I cannot use it without headphones. It seems that the other person is shouting in my ear and I have not been able to resolve the issue by lowering the volume. Whatever the other person is saying feels amplified on my side. I have checked that 'Hearing Aid Compatibility' is off on my phone.",
