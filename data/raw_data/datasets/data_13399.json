    "content": "How do I silence the \"Battery Full\" notification on my Pixel 4a w/ Android 11?  I don't know who decided that having my phone awaken me at 3am because it fully charged is a good idea, but it's not.  I went to \"Recent Notifications\", and none is listed.  I found instructions for earlier versions that entailed using the three-dot menu under \"notifications\", and that does not exist on this phone.\n\nNote:  That this is even needed is yet another reason that removing the notification LED was a really bad idea.",
