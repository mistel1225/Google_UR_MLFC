    "content": "The photos in my camera roll are gone. I did not delete them. I did not free up space. They are not in the trash. They vanished!  Photos that were moved to specific folders that I created were saved, but the vast majority of my photos were in the camera reel.  I did not have cloud sync turned on. What happened? Where are they. I am extremely upset. Ready to throw this phone in the trash.and buy the latest iPhone. I have lost priceless photos. Priceless memories. I notice I have 37 gb more free space than yesterday, leading me to believe the photos and videos are gone forever. Nobody had access to my phone. They literally disappeared on their own! WTF!?",
