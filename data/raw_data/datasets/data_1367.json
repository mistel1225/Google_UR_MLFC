    "content": "I tried following the directions I copy/pasted at the bottom of this post. However, my phone doesn't give me the option for step 5. I can select the content/layout/theme, but there's no Create button at the top right. Only the option to 'x' out of the selection. Is it because it is sound only without words (I'm recording the sound of cicadas)? I have another recording where the option to share as a video file is there. Just this one recording doesn't allow me the option.\nThanks!\n\nShare or save audio as a video file\nFrom the recording, you can create a video clip up to 60 seconds.\nOn your Pixel, open Recorder .\nTouch and hold a recording.\nAt the top right, tap Share   Video clip.\nThen, if you want, customize the video's content, layout, and theme.\nContent: Select Transcript & waveform or Waveform.\nLayout: Select Square, Portrait, or Landscape.\nTheme: Select Dark theme or Light theme.\nAt the top right, tap Create.\nTap Save or Share. If you choose to share the clip, select the app to share to.\nIf you don't want to save or share, at the top right, tap Done.",
