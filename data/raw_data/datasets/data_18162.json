    "title": "Pixel 3a doesn't switch between routers of the same wifi anymore",
    "content": "I have two routers with the same SSID, so one router works as a WiFi extender. Before, my phone switched between routers by itself so it has the strongest signal. Then some settings of the router changed and my phone won't switch between routers anymore, only when I turn my wifi off and on. I reset both routers and set them up again but the problem still persists. \nI read that Android only switches if there's no signal at all, but that wasn't the case in the first place. I tried installing some apps that fix this issue but those didn't really work for me. \nIs my problem because of Android or is there something wrong in my routers settings?",
