    "content": "I installed the update that was waiting for me this morning but then kept getting the \"Pixel Launcher keeps stopping\" popup. I eventually found that I could solve the problem by selecting App Info then uninstalling the Launcher update.\n\nNow my question is: was there any intended performance improvement or new functionality that I have now lost by uninstalling the update?\n\nBy the way, my wife's identical phone did not have this problem after the update.",
