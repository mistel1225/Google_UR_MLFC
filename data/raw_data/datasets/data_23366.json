    "title": "Complaint about quality of the Google Pixel 2",
    "content": "I am writing to complain about the poor quality of the Google Pixel 2 screen, and the incredible high price of changing the screen. \n\nI bought the Google Pixel 2 believing it was an extremely high performing phone, but my screen has broken 3 times already, and I do not know if I should change the screen again. The cost of changing the screen is more than 110â‚¬, meaning I have spent enough on repairing the screen as to buy a completely new phone. \n\nI have had other phones such as the iPhone 5c and a BQ Aquaris M5 (a spanish low-cost phone), and both of them have proven to be more resistant than the Pixel 2. I have slowly lost faith in Google smartphones, and do't know if I will be buying another one. \n\nRegards to anyone reading.",
