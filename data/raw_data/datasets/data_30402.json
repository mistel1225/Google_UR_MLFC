    "content": "I keep unplugging and re plugging my phone in and it works every time briefly, after stopping if I switch to Bluetooth it's ready to play no matter how many times I disable auto connect, forget pairing, clear cache ... Android auto was to help me navigate safer keeping my hands free, but I'm just juggling my phone trying to get it to keep working.",
