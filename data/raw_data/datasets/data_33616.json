    "content": "When I receive an incoming call it shows the number as +1 xxx-xxx-xxxx. I don't want the \"+1\" displayed, so how do I tell the phone not to do that? Reason is, if I want to save that incoming number as a contact it puts the +1 in front, I have to go to the phone number field and backspace over it. Then when I save it the phone number appears as xxx-xxx-xxxx. If I want to save the number as (xxx) xxx-xxxx I figured out I have to save the contact with the +1 included, then edit the contact and remove the +1, now it will appear correctly.\n\nThat's a big pile of BS steps and a hassle.\n\nAnyone know how to force the Pixel default to ignore the +1 right from the get-go?",
