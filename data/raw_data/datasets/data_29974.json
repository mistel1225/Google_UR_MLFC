    "content": "My Pixel started rebooting loop out of nowhere until battery ran out. Local phone doctor told me it was a motherboard issue. \n\nGot it home and somehow managed to get it through recovery mode and now it started again. Performance seems a bit slow and flaky though. \n\nCan I trust the phone will work from now on or is this the known motherboard issue? What can Google do for non-US out of warranty users that forked out 700 dollars for their phone 25 months ago?\n\nEDIT: Reboot loop started again. Can get into the home screen but not for long.",
