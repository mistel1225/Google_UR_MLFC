    "content": "My Pixel 3a will start playing music on YouTube Music for no reason while it is just laying down face up or face down at different times unless I close all Android apps to shut off YouTube Music. I wish there was an off button to shut it down! This behavior is new and has only occurred for the past couple of weeks. I mostly use YouTube Music on Bluetooth in my car and that's for short runs with only one or two tracks playing most of the time. It doesn't happen very often but usually occurs once daily. Since I don't always keep my phone in the same room I may not hear it do it all the time. Perhaps it happens more than once per day. If I pick up the phone and turn it on with the fingerprint reader it may start playing again continuously.",
