    "content": "I accidently slipped my Pixel 3A into my soup. The battery showed 10%. So I was running out of time. I tried to put it in the rice bucket. Nothing. I tried using other cables to charge it. Nothing. But I can hear the text notif ding means other than the battery, all system works. Now, my phone is completely zero battery. I can't seem to get a human customer service here in Google to talk to. How much would it cost me to change the battery or to fix it? Should I go to Google or just any repairperson near me? I don't have warranty. I bought it back in July 2019. Any suggestions or recommendation? I live in St. Louis MO. Thanks.",
