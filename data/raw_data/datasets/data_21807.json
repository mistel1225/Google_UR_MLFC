    "content": "Pixel 3 purchased last september started acting funny the other day and crashing. I tried safe mode and it was okay for a while, uninstalled apps I had installed in recent days incase something was wrong. Today the phone shut down and gave me the 'your device is corrupt' screen.\n\nI've never messed around with it's operating software or bricked it or whatever it's called. I tried a factory reset and cleaned it up and even downloaded apps from scratch rather than restored to make sure it's not anything in the apps. I'm still getting the message and the phone just froze and restarted WITH THE SAME MESSAGE.\n\nI am extremely frustrated, I am not in the US anymore and the whole world is on lockdown and my phone does this now, this is perhaps the third google phone I get and they all just decide to go haywire on me. I can't believe it this is traumatic.",
