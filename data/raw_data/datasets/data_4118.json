    "content": "I just updated my phone a few days ago and it continues to switch from vibrate to sound. I have even had to switch it back to multiple times since I've started this post.\n\nI think it has to do with ring settings by physical location... I have it set to be on ring when I'm home, but I never wasn't able to turn it off manually before.\n\nThe fact that it continues to switch back minutes after I've turned on vibrate makes me think it's something with the recent update. Help! :)",
