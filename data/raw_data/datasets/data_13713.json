    "content": "I sent in my Pixel 3a for a repair order and the order status says that they're waiting to receive the device even though the shipment was delivered almost 2 weeks ago. I need the device for a trade-in order and I've received no updates, aside from a message from the repair team asking me to send my device in.",
