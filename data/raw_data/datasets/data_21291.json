    "content": "One of the two speakers at the bottom doesnt give any output, which wasn't the case earlier when the phone was brand new (3 weeks back). Both of the speakers were functional at the beginning. \n\nAnother issue is that of a green tinge on the bottom of the display and it flickers as soon as you touch the screen. \n\nHave tried multiple settings but none of the issue gets sorted. \n\nAny advice would help. Thanks !",
