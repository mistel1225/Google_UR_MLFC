    "title": "Bluetooth app keeps crashing every 2-3 seconds when connecting car's music system (Harman Music sys)",
    "content": "My phone has Android 10 updated with the latest September 5, 2020's security patch. My car's music system is a Harman (App version R1.4_PV_30062016). \n\nProblem - My phone's Bluetooth app keeps crashing when trying to listen to music from my car's Harman music system.\n\nInterestingly, I am able to connect this Android 10 phone to a JBL Bluetooth speaker and another wireless headset with no issues. Also, I am able to take calls over Bluetooth from the car's Harmon system. But when I try playing music, the Bluetooth app starts crashing.\n\nI have two other Android phones and I face no Bluetooth crashing problem when connected to my car's music system (Harman). They both are Android 7.\n\nTroubleshooting steps that I have tried till now:\n\n1. Restarting the phone.\n2. Making the car's music system and my phone forgets each other and pairing them again.\n3. Factory reset my phone - still no success.\n4. Post-factory-reset, I updated the system to the latest Sept 5 update, but still the same problem.\n\nKindly guide.\nThank you!\nRegards,\nNiteesh",
