    "content": "Good day, all, i have a question about my device: i recently bought pixel 3 from a guy, but he told me that it new and yes i check it, he show me that all fine. But i can't check IMEI on the store.google.com/us/repair it show me \"For the device with this IMEI or serial number, youâ€™ll have to check the Hardware Warranty Center to see your repair options\" (device made in US, my imei - 99001200****, it confirms that device made in origin country (the 7th and 8th digits are the country code - they indicate where your device made, in my case it is 00 - origin)  i check it on the imei info - no black list, shows that it is pixel 3, all fine. \n\nGuys what is a problem? Why i cant check IMEI on site? This guy told me that shop where he bought pixel, said him that they don't know why, maybe smth with google data base))",
