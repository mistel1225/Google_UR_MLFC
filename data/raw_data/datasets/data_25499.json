    "content": "When trying to view older photos in the \"Camera\" album, quite a large amount are clearly missing. It looks like some entire months only have one photo each when that is not the case. The strangeness is compounded by the fact that at least some of these missing photos do appear in other albums such as \"Places\". Until very recently the \"Camera\" folder had everything in it. I just got the latest update a day or two ago. Any help would be greatly appreciated :)\n\nThis is not the same issue as https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/1428112?hl=en",
