    "content": "I noticed there is a feature on my wife's phone (both Google Pixel XL-gen 1) where she can pin live sports scores to the home screen of her phone (feature under Google Feed>Search Scores>a link under the score allows you to pin). I have tried everything under my account to activate, but nothing works.\n\nThe thing is, when I open an incognito tab on my phone under chrome and search sports scores, the features exists and I am able to pin.\n\nI realize this might be a server side update, but this was rolled out last year and I do not think I can getting this feature for some reason. Plus, it is odd that it would work in an incognito mode and not when I am signed in. How can I get this activated for my account?",
