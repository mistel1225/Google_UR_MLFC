    "content": "I would like to be able to turn Wifi Calling on and off easily from the quick settings tiles. When I start a call on wifi calling, and then I move out of range of wifi, the call drops. I'd like to be able to turn off wifi calling more easily before I start a call. Either that, or fix why the call won't automatically switch to phone plan when out of wifi range.",
