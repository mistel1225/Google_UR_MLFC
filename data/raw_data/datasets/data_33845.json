    "content": "Hi, I purchased new Pixel 2 XL and was playing with camera taking several pictures in absolutely dark room. Then I reviewed photos on mobile phone using highest brightness. I also reviewed pictures on my laptop and I was shocked. There are thousands white pixels on dark picture. Looks like a cosmos. Can you help me to clarify if it is dead pixels on camera matrix or not? Here is the link to download image photo https://www.dropbox.com/s/ny3hjs1mef4ae8m/IMG_20190203_230411.jpg?dl=0\n\nThanks.",
