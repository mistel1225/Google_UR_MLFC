    "content": "Have loved and admired Pixel phones especially the computational powers of photo qualities even with a single lens. But I feel that Pixel's Android OS is missing one key feature.\nWhat I'm talking about is the ability to hide apps and a safe & secure way to access them again similar to how Oxygen OS or MIUI implements it.\nSo, I do hope Pixel-Android developers and engineers try and not just emulate but enhance how hiding and finding apps is implemented on future. \nSO, LISTEN UP GOOGLE. TAKE ACTION PLEASE!!! Cheers.",
