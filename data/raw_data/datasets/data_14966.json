    "title": "Why does opening android messages raise brightness to 100%",
    "content": "I have switched my default texting app because Android Messages always raises the brightness to 100%. It is the only app that does this. Even when I open the app and try to manually change the brightness it stays at 100% until I exit the app. After I exit the brightness reverts to my default settings.",
