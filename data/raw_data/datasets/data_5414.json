    "content": "Yesterday I updated my phone to the most recent Android 11. After that I stopped receiving text notifications but only from certain contacts. I've uninstalled the messages update to see if that would change anything and still I would not get notified about the messages from those contacts. Then I reinstalled it but still didn't work. I've restarted my phone several times. My text notifications are default settings. Is anybody else having this problem? And have you found a solution?",
