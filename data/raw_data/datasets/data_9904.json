    "content": "I can't get my Pixel 5 to even show JBL Xtreme or Xtreme 2 as available devices (I have one of each) when trying to pair them. I am doing everything right. I press the bluetooth button on the speaker to make it available to pair, then search for new devices to pair on my Pixel 5. I have had no problems connecting either of my pairs of headphones (AKG and Bose), or the random little speaker we use at my workplace. It even shows bluetooth keyboards as available devices. But JBL speakers are invisible to it? Is there any way to fix this?",
