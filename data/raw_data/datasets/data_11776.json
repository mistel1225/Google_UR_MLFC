    "content": "Been using it for a few weeks and the buttonless interface is very frustrating. I miss my back button and home button, why was it decided these were obsolete? The gestures pulling from screen edges don't work half the time and I just swipe endlessly trying to catch the edge just right. In some apps the swipes overlap with other gesture functions and don't give the anticipated results - instagram for instance, almost never does what I want it to do. The whole swipe to replace buttons thing feels more cumbersome than like some revolution in usability. If anything it feels like some BS apple would force on its lemmings... Please give me back my 'back' button! I want functional over flashy! \nAlso disappointing to lose the squeeze for assistant feature. I used that all the time on my previous Pixel. The swipe from a corner thing is not nearly as intuitive...",
