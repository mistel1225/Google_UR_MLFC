    "content": "Pixel3 - Android 11, Dec2020  security update. Phone crashes/restarts, battery drains, camera is blurry, phone crashes when launching Google and 3rd party apps, phone crashes when swiping up to access apps.\nI've done a factory reset, deleted a number of third party apps at the suggestion of the Google support team, ran my phone in safe mode. Those seemed to help but only temporarily. Now I've deleted more apps and disabled find my phone and gestures. When I'm on a charger it seems to work better, when I get to 50% battery or so I'll get in the crash/reboot loop and my battery will drop to <10% in about 15 minutes",
