    "content": "Pixel XL froze/crash out of nowhere. Then bootloop. Was stuck in bootloop at first but eventually able to get to restore mode, and eventually able to start phone, but it would crash again after running for a few minutes and then I'm back at the bootloop again.\n\nWondering if there is a way to fix this, this should be some sort of software glitch.\n\nOr it not able to fix, could do factory reset.. but would be great if I'm able to back things up and/or get into the files on the phone first. Would appreciate any tips on doing that.\n\nThanks in advance!",
