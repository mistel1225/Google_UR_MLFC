    "content": "Dear sir,\nI am using google pixel xl. Few days ago restart my phone and then I can not use this anymore. Because this is so buggy and crashing. When I Open my phone this will hang for sometime and then it won't work. After few second this will restart automatically and again when I put my password to use this phone and I swap for the application or just I open this phone in a few second this will hang again and again. I tried to factory reset but I didn't get any positive results. I can't use this device anymore. Because of hang and auto restart. I have no control about that. I updated my device as well.
