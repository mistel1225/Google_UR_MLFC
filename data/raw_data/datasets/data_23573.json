    "content": "Chaps,\n\nAssistant no longer recognises or responds to my voice. It seems to have started some time after the January Patch, and the February patch (2020). (Maybe an app update in between?)\n\nI don't use assistant often, but when I do, it's a must. And I've never had an issue with it until now.\n\nI have followed the online help article, and deleted and retrained the voice profile, which makes it work temporarily, but after locking my phone, and leaving it sat for half an hour or so, when I try to command the assistant, it fails to respond.\n\nAnyone else getting this?\nHow do I solve it once and for all?\n\n-Liam",
