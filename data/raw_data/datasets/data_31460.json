    "title": "Why is my Pixel 3 locking me out after restarting?",
    "content": "After my Pixel 3 restarted after the battery died, I have been unable to access my phone. I am correctly entering my pattern, but it is saying it is incorrect. Do I really need to erase my data to access my phone again? There is no \"Forgot Passcode\" option, only a Secure and Erase Data option on Find My Device. It is also not connecting to wifi until I log in on my phone, and I cannot erase my phone from another device until it connects. Also on Find My Device, it is showing where the last time I connected to wifi was, not my current location because it is not connected to wifi now. Yesterday, I also had issues where my phone did not recognize my Google earbuds and continually beeped instead..Please let me know what I can do, thank you!",
