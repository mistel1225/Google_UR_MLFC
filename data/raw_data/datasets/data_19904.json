    "content": "I really don't know what's going on. Issue happened several times already. Around 5 minutes into a call, the phone will start ringing again and then start replaying what the other person said from the beginning of the conversation. Like if the conversation was being recorder. But I can only hear their voice and not mine. It's like a déjà vu ! Really not sure what's happening here",
