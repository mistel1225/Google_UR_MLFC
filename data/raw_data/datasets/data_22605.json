    "content": "The wired pixel buds worked great at the beginning. But after a bit, some of the fonctions do not work anymore (holding down the volume up button to get the notifications read). I then tried to remove the assistant from the pixel buds in the assistant app, I could not remove it. I clicked the button but it just sent me back to the previous menu without deleting it. Any know what to do?",
