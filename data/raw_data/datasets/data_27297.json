    "title": "microphone and hanging issue, customer service is not so appreciating as compaired to other brands",
    "content": "I have done factory data reset twice on my phone, still the phone is hanging and microphone doesnt work most of the time.I dont like changing phones very often so I contacted google and found that still there is no repair center in Melbourne, I have to send my phone to Sydney to get diagnosed, which will take few days, and I wont have any phone to use between those days, and I will be paying for delivery charges to and from sydney as well. Did anybody else faced the same issues? Should I stop using google and buy samsung or apple? As they have better customer service, offers you replacement phone while your phone gets fixed. Even they replace the phone as well in most of the cases. And they have repair centers in almost all the big cities.",
