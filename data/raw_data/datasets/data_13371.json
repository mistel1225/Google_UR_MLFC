    "content": "After the October security patch for Android 11, my Pixel 2 will not stay connected to my wireless providers network. I have to reboot several times to connect for about 30 seconds to a minute until it drops again. I have reseated the sim and wiped the network settings. I have booted in safe mode and same issue. I have checked and tried new APN settings. I have tried a different SIM card. I have seen countless others have the same issue on Pixel 2,3,4 and they have the issue even after factory resets. This needs to be patched as soon as possible! I cannot wait until the last update in December! This needs to be patched now or at least the November patch needs to be sent to the Pixel 2. Google support told me that they don't show this is an issue and if more people don't call and inform them otherwise, we will be stuck with paperweights after the last update rolls out in December for the Pixel 2.",
