    "content": "Hey,\n\nI got my Pixel a few days ago and noticed that Now Playing is almost never working. In 6 days, it only detected 1 song, while at least 10 others should have been detected (most of them are pretty well-known, so probably exist in the offline database). \nFurthermore, if I try to add the History widget to my home screen, it will just bring up the popup window saying that Pixel Ambient Services keep closing. If I'm in a launcher, it will make it crash, and if in the Pixel Launcher, it'll just do nothing after I close the window.\nI tried changing the notification and lock screen access for Ambient services, uninstalled and reinstalled the service, but nothing changes.\n\nAny idea ? Thx",
