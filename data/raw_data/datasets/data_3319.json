    "content": "So before its happen, my phone was normal. I mean, its happen suddenly. When I tried to unlock my phone by fingerprint and pressing the power button, it won't show anything. After that I force restart the phone by pressing power button for 30s. And now its stuck in the logo, nothing happen. Its produce heat and its really hot. So I wait until it run out of battery. After that I tried to turn it on again, but its even worse. I charge it and then its stuck in the charging logo. No charging animation (down to up charging animation), just static charging logo and still produce heat. Then I force restart it once again and, yeah, its freezing on google logo again.",
