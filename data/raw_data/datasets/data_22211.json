    "content": "Hi, I bought a Pixel 3A in New York, where I live, two months ago through Amazon. The phone just stopped working for no apparent reason and will not turn on. How can I turn it in for an in-warranty replacement? To make things worse, I am currently in Iceland due to COVID19, so I would have to send it in from here and get it sent back here. I am desperately trying to speak to a google support person, but am being sent in circles on this website. Thank you for all the help you might be able to provide.\nBest,\nOskar",
