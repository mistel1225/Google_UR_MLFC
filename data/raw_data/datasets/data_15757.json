    "title": "Volume Of Buds Dropped After Firmware Update Containing Bass Boost",
    "content": "My Pixel Buds have had their max volume dropped immensely ever since the firmware update that added Bass Boost functionality.  I have factory reset them with no chamge.  Gone into dev options and disabled absolute volume for Bluetooth with no change.  Is this something others are experiencing?  I used to be able to not hear any white noise around me at 75% volume, now at 100% I can still hear plenty of it and my buds are fitting just fine.",
