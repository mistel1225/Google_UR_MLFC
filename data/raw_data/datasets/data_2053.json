    "content": "I bought my Pixel 5 phone on May 11 in Best Buy, already on the 13th I ran into the problem that no one heard my through calls and voice messages. I tried to record audio using the \"Dictaphone\" application. There is NO sound on the recording, so the lower microphone does not work! The upper microphone is working, I recorded a video with sound using the Camera application Google Camera.\nI have already tried updating my Android phone to the latest version and even reset it to factory settings. Nothing helped! Where should I go with such a problem? I'm abroad at the moment\nWaiting for your response",
