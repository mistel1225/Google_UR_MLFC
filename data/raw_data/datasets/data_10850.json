    "content": "I have a Honda Fit 2015 and previously played music in the car via Bluetooth connection to my iPhone 6s's Spotify. Recently got a Pixel 4a 5G and, while I've gotten it to connect (my car detects the device), I'm still having issues with music control. The Honda audio display screen says \"No device connected\" even though it is connected, and will play music from my Pixel despite this message, but the select/track advance buttons on my car no longer change the music and I have to physically choose tracks from the phone. I have a feeling I probably connected incorrectly (am Bluetooth amateur) but I'm not sure how to connect the phone to my car. Any advice?",
