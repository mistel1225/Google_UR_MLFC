    "content": "A number of apps are working unexpectedly. Pok√©mon Go in particular. Despite not being optimized for battery performance, it restarts every time I switch apps. It also struggles when either Maps, YT Music, or Messenger are in use at the same time.\n\nMy device has been getting warm unexpectedly, also causing apps to stop. Also, sometimes the Google Maps popup goes away.",
