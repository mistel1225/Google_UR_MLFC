    "content": "Battery is draining quickly on my new Pixel 4a. While using the device, battery is draining quickly. When I am sleeping also, battery drains a little.\n\nIn battery stats: it shows a lot of battery usage for WiFi (second to Screen). Staying at home most of the time and this issue doesn't appear for the other mobile devices at my home.\n\nOther points that might help:\nI have always given location access (ie. all the time) to Google Maps and Google Fit.\n\nGot this device on 23rd December.\nSecurity: 5th Jan 2020\nBuild number: RQ1A.210105.002\nUsing single 4G SIM.",
