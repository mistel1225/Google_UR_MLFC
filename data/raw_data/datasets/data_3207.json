    "title": "Bluetooth speaker not visible for pairing with Pixel 4a",
    "content": "I am trying to pair my new Pixel 4a to Geneva S Bluetooth speaker. I can detect and pair to the speaker using an iphone and an old android 6 device but not using the 4a. I can pair to other BT devices with the 4a (it takes a couple of attempts with some devices). It feels like a BT compatibility problem but BT is supposed to be backwards compatible. \nA Bluetooth scanner on the old android device says the Geneva speaker is using Classic BR/EDR protocol.\nI'd really appreciate any suggestions for how to fix this. The speaker cost more than the phone so I'd something has to go it will be the phone unfortunately!",
