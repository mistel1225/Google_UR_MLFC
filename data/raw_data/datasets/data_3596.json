    "content": "This is driving me mad!\nI can't receive App notifications over data any more. It's only happened since Tuesday 6th.\nOnce I arrive home and then within WiFi range...... Bamm!! I'm hit with loads of notifications.\nOnce I switch WiFi off they all stop.\nI've contacted Google support this evening and they suggested resetting WiFi, Mobile Data and Bluetooth.\nI did this but then lost connection with Google support ðŸ˜¡\nAll the apps I want notifications from have the slider bar on Green and I've gone through all the usual fix suggestions.\nI have a Pixel 3A and love it to bits, but this problem and one with the fingerprint sensor not recognising are now driving me nuts!\nIf anybody can help it would be most appreciated",
