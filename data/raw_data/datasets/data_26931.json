    "content": "My Pixel 1 saved photos to my phone's storage. When full, I would empty my storage into an external hard drive before backing up to cloud. I upgraded to a Pixel 3a and now all my photos go straight to the cloud. I prefer the way it was with my first Pixel. How do I change the storage settings on my Pixel 3a so new photos save to my phone first?",
