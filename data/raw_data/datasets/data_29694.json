    "content": "So my wife got a new job and I am trying to delete her old work number from contact card. When I click on the pencil to edit it the work number is gone but when I am just looking at her contact card the work number is still there and is even the default for whenever I go to text or call her. It's quite annoying. I've included screenshots to show how her contact card looks versus when I go to edit it. He old number is also gone when I check my contacts on google contacts online but for some reason my phone just won't let go off the number. ",
