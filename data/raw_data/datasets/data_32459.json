    "title": "Google search result tiles not responding",
    "content": "When I search something on Google and try to click on one of the tiles at the top with information regarding my search, the tiles do not respond. The actual search results themselves work fine and the top tabs, but any of the drop downs from the top tiles or more information buttons do not respond.\n\nfor example, if I were to get a search result like this and click on one of the drop downs under \"people also search for\", the drop downs do not respond. Sometimes you can see on the screen that it is receiving my touch, but still nothing happens. Is anyone else having this issue?",
