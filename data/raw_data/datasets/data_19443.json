    "title": "Pixel 4XL not powering on after 50% battery issue",
    "content": "Phone had been experiencing the common battery issue where it will not charge past 50%, last night it stopped powering on at all. Will start up but shut down at the google screen, and then shuts right back off. Have been in contact with google about getting a replacement phone before I ship my phone out since i needed it for work. Contacted support last night and they instructed me I can drop it off at a ubreakit store to get it fixed. They provided me with the store to visit, I decide to drive there today (2.5 hours there and 2.5 hours back) but it is close. So I drove to then next store another 30 minutes away and same thing. Have not heard back from the specialist that was handling my case in 4 days. Now all I am told is to wait to hear from them. I do not have time since I need my phone for work. This has been ridiculous, have purchased every pixel phone to date but this officially be my last one after this nightmare.",
