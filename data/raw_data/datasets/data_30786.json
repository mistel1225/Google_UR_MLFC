    "title": "Battery Drain on Pixel 3 XL after May Security Update",
    "content": "I've noticed ever since the recent Security Update that my Pixel 3XL is draining alot faster than normal.\n\nOn a normal day, I can travel to work (about an hour commute) going from 100% to about 94%. Alot of my commute has dead spots which i can attribute to some battery drain with the phone trying to connect. and also there are some normal use things.\n\nPrior to the May update, I could make it to lunch time (noon) and have about 80% left.\n\nEver since the update, that same morning commute is droping the phone to about 89%, and by lunch, im starting to hit high 60s% my use of the phone isnt crazy, and with all of that i have battery saver on...which doesnt seem to be working.",
