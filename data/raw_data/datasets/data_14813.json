    "content": "So yesterday i've got a small update on my Pixel 4 and since than i can't enter the phone folder on my PC. I've tried a lot of cables, tried to change port on my PC, entered \"Safe mode\" on pixel, changed 1000 drivers and still it doesn't work. The phone basicly doesn't shows up in \"My pc\" folder unlike my other phones (Huawei p30 and Galaxy Note 10+ still works excellent). But when i tried to connect Pixel to Galaxy Note they've been able to read each others memory. I would have tryed to try connect Pixel to other PC but i don't have one, so the problem stays unsolved. Any thoughts? Maybe someone have the same issue?",
