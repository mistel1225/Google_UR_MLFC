    "content": "If I plug my phone into my PC and from my PC change the filename of an image, I'm unable to locate that image on my phone whether if I search it on Files or on Google Photos. The only way is to manually go into all the sub-folders it is found at. Strangely enough, hours later I'm able to find the image by its new filename, as if it takes time to process the new change.",
