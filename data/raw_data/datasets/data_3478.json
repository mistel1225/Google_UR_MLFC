    "content": "My Pixel 4a has stopped ringing for the past few days whenever I receive a call. Moreover when I went to choose a new ringtone, there was no sound and the speaker won't work while on call. I've tried restarting the phone, even checked all the settings (and everything was okay) and reset the app preferences too but nothing worked. You can't just expect me to factory reset my phone but other than that I've tried everything else.\nDoes anyone know how to fix this up? Or should I go for replacement as it's still under warranty.",
