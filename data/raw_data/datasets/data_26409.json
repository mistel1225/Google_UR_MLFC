    "content": "I've had every XL Pixel except the 2. The camera has always been top of the line, until the 4. While the rear facing camera works just fine, the front facing camera doesn't focus on anything ever. When you touch the screen, it still will not focus. Any pictures taken are horribly blurry. Anyone have the same issue? Or does anyone know if this is a software flaw or a hardware flaw? If software I can wait for an update. But if it's hardware, I suppose I'd have to send it back to Verizon. Can anyone at Google advise?",
