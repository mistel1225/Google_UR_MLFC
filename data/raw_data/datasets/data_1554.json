    "content": "I've bought the phone three months back and so I can't digest these much issues within the short span.\nMy phone's right bottom corner has some touch issues and while I'm in you tube I won't be able to use the three dots option and also while using Adobe Lightroom I can't use the bottom portion of the screen many times. And my device gets too hot sometimes while I'm shooting macro subjects on outdoors and it losts it's exposure controls and also in the indoors manytimes. This is bothering me more and more.",
