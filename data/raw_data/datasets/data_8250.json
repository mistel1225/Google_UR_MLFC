    "content": "Hi, \nMy Pixel 5 automatically processes all portrait photos to make my skin look smoother. I very much prefer the original where my skin in the photos is as it is in real life (before they are processed automatically). It is troublesome also because by blurring out the pores and whatnot it also makes my eyes lose focus - everything on my face just looks hazy. \nAnyone facing the same issue? How can I turn it off?\nThanks,",
