    "title": "Pixel 2XL December 2020 Patch - Chat bubbles don't work still",
    "content": "I've been on Android 11 since release for my Pixel 2XL and recently updated to the December 2020 patch and the chat bubbles still do not work!  The bubbles will open a blank window or the wrong chat and notifications aren't being cleared/show up hours later.  Also, why are we unable to open new FB chat messages from the Bubbles \"+\" symbol?  It's incredibly frustrating because Bubbles don't work anywhere as well as Facebook's chat heads and leave out some very useful features that the chat heads had.  Why is it taking months to fix?  Are Pixel 2 users even going to receive a fix if the December update was the last patch?  It makes the phone totally useless and makes me hesitant to even consider upgrading if Google can't even fix simple OS features.  Android 11 is just full of bugs and it's been out for several months now.",
