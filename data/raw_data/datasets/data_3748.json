    "content": "Brand new phone, just arrived as a replacement to another faulty phone. Back camera shows black and doesn't capture anything. Already reset entire phone, turned on and off, tried camera on external apps. No improvement. On the premise that it is already a replacement, I would like a refund or a second replacement.",
