    "content": "So I've been reading similar issues to the power button not working and I've tried everything but factory reset the phone, as it really seems to be a hardware issue. I tried cleaning out the button, found that I can press the power button without fully pressing it, and it now just goes through a loop of camera to lock screen to restarting. Is there any way I can get it checked out or is this unsolveable?",
