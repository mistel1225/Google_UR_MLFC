    "content": "Bought my pixel 3 last year about August. It hasn't been a year and now I have to charge my phone 2-3 times a day to making sure the my basic daily use. I use it most time on Chrome/e-mail checking/Map(seldom, usually for less than 1 hr GPS using)/ and abt 1hr video watching in general? The battery will drop to 96 per cent after few minutes from fully change. And probably 10-20 per cent drop per time if I use my phone. I kinda did bit of research and knew that Google wouldn't do any battery replacement or exchange, and even suggested people turn to Apple in my post I saw, which is a shame. I've loved Google system since I started to use smart phone. Basically every friend of mine owns an Appple and I am the only one still using Google products (Chromebook instead of Mac). I am not expecting any satisfying reply from the post as I've done my research and had some assumptions abt how the team would response. Simply sharing my experience with you guys and hoping someone maybe from the management level may realise in one day that losing trust from customers is the start of losing the market. And most customers nowadays still care about basic stuff like battery life.",
