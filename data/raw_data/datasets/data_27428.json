    "content": "Hello! I want to switch away from iPhone and onto the Android ecosystem. However, the biggest drawback is Android's lack of native hearing aid support. My hearing aids are incredibly expensive, and I plan on using them for at least a decade or more.\n\nI tried to see if I could access the accessibility features on the settings app in the new phones on display at Best Buy & Target. However, that section is 'disabled' for demo products.\n\nIs there any possible way I can test out of hearing aids work? If they do I'll be switching over. But, I cannot seem to find a way to contact Google to ask about this! This is a very important feature to me.",
