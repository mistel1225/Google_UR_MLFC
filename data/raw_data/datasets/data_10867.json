    "content": "So, I bought a Pixel 5 on launch day and got in mid October. Within the first few days, I noticed that battery life was dire, I was getting 3 hours screen on time for four days straight. This was a lot less than 7-8 hours reviewers were claiming. I RMAd the device and had the same issue so am fairly certain it's not hardware related. I turned of the 5G and this seemed to help. However, I'm still getting like 4 hours SOT with a max of 5. The phone is also noticeably warm when being used even if it's just web browsing or reading and eBook where it should be stone cold. \n\nI can't work out what is wrong, it's unlikely to be hardware. Nothing obviously wrong shows up on battery usage. Anyone experienced anything similar with their Pixel 5?",
