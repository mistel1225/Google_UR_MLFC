    "content": "I get an occasional bright flashing screen when I receive a notification. By occasional I mean once every 2 or 3 days. \n\nIs there a fix or software update for this? I came around a posting on this but it's for pixel 2. \n\nI have turned off adaptive brightness and dropped screen brightness to about 38%. Night light is set at automatic.",
