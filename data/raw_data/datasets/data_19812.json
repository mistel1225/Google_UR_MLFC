    "content": "First of all, my device model isn't even listed in the drop-down.  It's the Pixel XL!\nIt's performed wonderfully for a year.  Recently it started lagging and locking.  I did some research and some attribute it to the Digital Wellbeing app, which I can't disable, or force close and I don't have the options specified when I Google how to do it (because there are no articles on my specific model).\nSome attribute it to the last system update.\nRegardless of what the cause is, it's such a disappointment given I've been so happy with the phone until now.\nI only am using 40% of my storage.  I force close those apps I don't use frequently.  The phone seems to run hotter as well.  I would say this started about 2 months ago.\nThanks",
