    "content": "Hi,\n\nOn my pixel 4 xl running android 11, the play store has camera app version 7.5 from August 2020. However I think that there is a new version 7.6 since October. I erased the cache of play store and camera, but still play store shows the August version on my pixel.\n\nHow can I install the new version?\n(I tried to install version 7.6 from apk but the installation failed.)\n\nThank you.",
