    "title": "USB PD compatible USB A to USB C charging cable",
    "content": "I currently have a short (6\" max) USB A to USB C cable that I am able to RAPIDLY charge my Pixel 2 XL from both a Belkin car adapter and a AUKEY wall charger.  I would like to find a longer one that supports USB PD (Power Delivery), which I assume is what makes it rapidly charge.  I am wondering if anyone found such a thing?  Does the cable on the Google Store support this?  The reason I am asking is that I have bought and returned numerous cables in the search for one that does more than a slow charge.\n\nThanks!",
