    "content": "Android 10 running on a Google Pixel 2 XL.  \n\nWhen I receive a new notification and have yet to act on said notification, the touch screen near the top of the screen becomes unresponsive until I act on said notification or wait 5 or so seconds.   Anyone else notice this?\n\nSay I am in Chrome and I get a new notification, I cannot access the settings menu in the upper right corner (three vertical dots), but I can access the hamburger menu in the left corner which is slightly lower on the screen.",
