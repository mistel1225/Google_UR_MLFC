    "content": "My Pixel 4Xl screen will occasionally go black with no ambient display and will not turn on again until I press the power button. This started to happen about a month ago but not sure I can correlate that with an update.  This is annoying since I just want to be able to glance at my phone for the date/time and notification icons without having to press the power button.  I am running June 5 2020 update but the problem started to happen before that.",
