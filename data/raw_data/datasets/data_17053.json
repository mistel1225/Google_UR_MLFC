    "content": "I am getting multiple times daily when I turn my phone on, \"app stopped working\" messages.  I am not able to close these or use my phone until I have turned it off and /or restarted it.  These messages continue to pop up repeatedly.  I have tried turning my phone off more often, restarting in safe mode, attempted to close the apps/messages, but they keep reappearing.",
