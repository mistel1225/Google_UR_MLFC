    "title": "Pixel 4 Screen Responsive Lag after Android 11 OTA Update",
    "content": "I just updated to Android 11 on my Pixel 4. However, there is a bug where the whole screen lags and I lose all haptic feedback. It is most apparent when I use the keyboard as the lag time does not allow me to use the keyboard properly. It is intermittent. I can restart the system and it would be gone but after a while it would come back. \n\nThis isn't the beta version but the official OTA rollout I got on my phone.",
