    "content": "Hey guys! Help me, before I had pixel 2 xl and it was automatically transferring my photos to the Google drive and I had a lot of memory left . I bought Google disc but it's 11 from 100 gb. I checked all the settings and didn't find the right button for that. It's like I can see all the photos in \"Photos\" but they are on Google drive, so my 64 gb little phone can be free a bit ) thanks for answer guys and sorry for my poor English !",
