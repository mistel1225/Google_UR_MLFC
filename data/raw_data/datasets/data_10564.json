    "content": "When I have speakerphone on it causes echo/delay/feedback for the person on the other end. At my end it is OK.\n  The louder my phone volume is set, the worse the audio phenomenon they experience at the other end.\n  It happens with both mobile and landline calls.\n  It doesn’t affect recordings I’ve made using Recorder and video functions – these are OK.\n  Safe Mode doesn’t solve it, so it’s not a third-party app causing it.\n  Switch Access is turned off.\n  Is there anything else I should try before I try a factory reset or return the phone?",
