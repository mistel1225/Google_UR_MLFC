    "content": "My pixel 3 hard-bricked (while sitting in my hand) 2 days ago. I took to a local tech who is well-respected. Later that day he told me he got 2 other Pixel 3s with the exact same issue. He said he rarely gets Pixels, hadn't seen them in months, now he has 3 all at once. He has tests ports and swaps batteries, and all seems to be working, as well as motherboard. Seems like some sort of bad software push. Obviously 2 months out of warranty. What software did google release that is bricking pixel phones? Will they take responsibility?",
