    "content": "The reason I bought the pixel was I thought they would compete with apple ecosystem. But google has been a disappointment. Pixel 4 &5, no tablet, google laptop are all disappointing and not even close competing with apple. Lately I been persuaded watching YouTube with apple m1 laptop with great performance. Then I been eyeing on their tablets. And lately I started checking out the phones. Now I understand what people are so hook into apple ecosystem. Once you get one of their product, it just make sense to just go with the whole ecosystem. Right now google hasn't really gave google fans any reassurance why they should stick with pixel phones since all their products has been a disappointment. I own a pixel 3xl. I was disappointed with 4 & 5. I'm just waiting on the next google event to see where are they heading for the future. If the event doesn't assure me that google really has no commitment competing with apple ecosystem, then I might probably ride the bandwagon. I will miss the Google assistant, which I think is better than siri. But as a whole, apple ecosystem is well integrated. I mean they even have final cut to fusion that integrate well from laptop to tablet.",
