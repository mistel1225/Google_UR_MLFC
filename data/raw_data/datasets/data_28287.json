    "content": "I received a phone yesterday as a warranty replacement from google.  I took it to the verizon store and they told me the phone was locked.  I have tried both phone and chat support and they both referred to \"specialists\" that would get back to me via email within a few hours.  We are up to almost 24 hours at this time.  Is there anyway for me to connect to the \"specialist\"",
