    "content": "Using a Zedge custom alarm which sets the default notification to a sound. Battery saver is disabled. Volume is up. Built in sounds work. I once was using the phone when the alarm was supposed to go off and just saw a \"missed alarm\" notification display instead. Testing it more I realized it's only with the custom sounds. I have \"missed\" several alarms because of this. I am running Android 9/ Pie updated Jan 5th but the problem has been going on for months.\n\nUpdate: I tested it with DND on and off and both times  (alarms set 1 min or less from time) with my custom sound it worked. Yet it did not go off last night. And I'm not just sleeping through it as one time I woke up early and the phone was in my hand when the alarm didn't go off and I got a notification instead that I missed the alarm. Unsure if a custom sound was set on that one. Tired of having to set multiple alarms so I don't miss class",
