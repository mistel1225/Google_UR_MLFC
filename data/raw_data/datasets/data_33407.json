    "content": "Today have got some carrier service updates at 7:53AM and I had updated some of the apps from Play Store through WiFi.\nLeft the phone in idle and went out.\n\nAfter sometime found that the time in the phone stopped at previous time. I can Attach a screenshot. Not sure what happened but just verified the settings and there is no change. \nThe clock on the phone notification bar stopped at the same time when I had kept the updates.\n\nI think, Google is the only one who can stop the time.",
