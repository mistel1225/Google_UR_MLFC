    "content": "Volume is extremely low that I can barely hear caller on phone calls. If I use the speaker it works fine. Uninstalled and reinstalled the Google phone call app. Tried using a different Android phone app.  Turned volume up to max.  Nothing resolves this. Problem began since last system update.",
