    "content": "My pixel 3a top speakers have failed immediately after I got the device back in July. I had it sent for repairs twice ever since and it failed again today. I am sending it for repair again the 3rd time now. Has anyone else faced this issue with the pixel 3a device? It has been extremely frustrating and I don't have confidence that repairs would fix this issue.",
