    "title": "Should I pay 27000 to get pixel 3a repaired by B2X?",
    "content": "My google pixel 3a stopped working all of a sudden. It did not power on.\nI sent the phone to B2X to get it repaired. Since the phone was under warranty and there was no fault of mine that the phone stopped working, I was expecting it to be repaired free of cost. Yesterday (after 20 days from service request) I got an email from B2X that I need to pay ₹27000 to get my phone repaired. I had brought the phone for ₹28000. How can they quote so much? Are they trying to con me??\nDo you know if there's some means to contest/escalate this?",
