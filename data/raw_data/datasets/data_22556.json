    "content": "I've had this phone for 4 days so far and can't seem to get over 3 hours of screen time before needing to charge.\nI don't have many apps, don't play games or do anything particularly intensive.\n\nI've tried running the phone in safe mode for the day but had similar results.\nMy messages app (stock messaging app) seems to be the most draining app on the, phone. As of writing this post, it has an active time of 20mins and drain percentage of 14%\n\nIs there anything else I can try or did I get a dud?",
