    "content": "Hi,\n\nI bought Pixel 4a 5G and I have problem connect it with Peugeot 307 bluetooth radio (only calls). Connection works with old phones perfectly, but with Pixel I can't establish connection every time. I had two times when it happened correctly (I could even establish call via bluetooth radio), but when I turn off engine and turn on again, connection lost and didn't back. I tried change programmer options related to bluetooth (AVRCP and MAP version) but without luck. Do you have any idea?",
