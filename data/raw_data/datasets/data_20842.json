    "title": "Pixel 3 Keeps Restarting",
    "content": "Straight out of unboxing and syncing data with my older Pixel 1, the new Pixel 3 I picked up keeps restarting randomly, interrupting my usage. I've tried booting into safe mode but no luck there and when trying to update from Android 9 to 10 it just restarts in the middle of it so I lose all progress. Really don't want to have to reset to factory settings and waste hours of personalizing settings/setting up apps. Haven't found a satisfactory solution from any forums or the Google team so far. Really disappointed and looks like if nothing else works in the next couple days I'll have to return it.",
