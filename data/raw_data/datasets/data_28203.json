    "content": "Hi there I have purchased a brand new pixel 2 XL and it seems there are some malfunction on the led notification.\nFirst I don't know when exactly should blink the notification led (I mean , it blinks with a new outlook mail / whatsapp / lost call?)\nSecond, the few times I saw the notification led works it only blinks once and that's all, the led didn't blinks again.\nIs this the actual way the notification led works or is there a malfunction?\nThanks in advance",
