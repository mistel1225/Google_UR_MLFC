    "content": "I've tried registering new fingerprints, restarting phone. \n\nThe sensor works fine to log into my bank accounts, my credit cards, and Paypal, but won't work more than about 25% of the time to unlock my phone. This seems to be a software problem. I've recently updated to Android 11, but it hasn't helped. \n\nI've noticed that it's very sensitive to the least bit of moisture on my fingers. Even if I've just dried my hands, there must still be a tiny amount of moisture on my finger. Again, this is not a problem with the other apps, just for unlocking the lock screen.",
