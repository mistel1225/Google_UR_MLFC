    "content": "Does Pixel 4 and/or the upcoming 4a support dual VoLTE or dual LTE (LTE enabled on both SIMs at the same time, not one SIM on LTE and one SIM on 3G). There was conflicting information regarding Pixel 3a and there seems to be a surprising lack of information regarding this. Usually, manufacturers don't mention it for some reason.\n\nOne of my networks is an LTE only network. It gets disconnected if I switch to the other one for data when using a non-dual-LTE mobile.",
