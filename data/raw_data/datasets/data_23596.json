    "title": "Waiting 2 weeks for response from escalation department (re-issuing a replacement phone).",
    "content": "The camera on my Pixel 3 phone stopped working.  Google sent me a replacement, which arrived between Christmas and New Years (while I was away on holidays).  Since I was not available to receive / pick up, it was sent back to Google.  I have now been contacting Google support via email and phone for 2 weeks asking for the replacement to be re-sent to me.  I keep being told it is with their escalation department, and they cannot provide any timeline as to when this will be resolved.  What other measures can I do to get this resolved?  I have now been without a working phone for a month.",
