    "content": "Hello,\nI got a new Pixel 4 literally 2 days ago. I did NOT do any transfers from my old to new phone and instead installed whatever apps I needed fresh.\n\nOvernight here in France we went through daylight savings and went back one hour. However this morning my phone was working fine. I was literally lying in bed reading reddit via the Bacon Reader app when the screen suddenly went black. I don't know what my battery level was before then but I don't think it was too low.\n\nSince then, we've tried everything we can to restart the phone. We've held the power button down from 3 - 30 seconds and no change. We've taken out and replaced the SIM card with no change. We've held down the volume button first before the power button and no change. Just now my 8am alarm went off on the phone, however the screen was still black. It actually took us a while to figure out how to turn the alarm off.\n\nHas anyone else encountered this and know how to fix it? Again, the phone literally arrived just 2 days ago. I have not dropped it, and I'm being very honest about that. It does not have a cracked screen or seemingly any other defaults.\n\nThanks in advance for any help you can offer.",
