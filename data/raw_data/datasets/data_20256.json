    "content": "Hello,\n\nMy pixel 2 screen suddenly stopped working. The screen is blank, but when I put my finger on the fingerprint sensor, there is hepatic feedback, which makes me think that it is fully powered on, but is broken or stuck on something. \n\nI've tried hard booting (press and hold power) and use safe mode (power and volume down), but none of these have yielded results. They did give the buzz that they've turned off/on when I did that.\n\nAny ideas? Should I replace the LCD screen? Is it likely the battery is bad, or not giving enough power to the screen?\n\nThanks!",
