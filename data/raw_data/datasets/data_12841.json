    "content": "Steps to reproduce:\n1. Hit up or down on the volume rocker and put into vibrate mode\n2. Go to Settings --> Sound --> Advanced --> Default notification sound. Choose 'None' from 'My Sounds' group.\n\nObserved: Apps like Gmail and Outlook will continue to vibrate the device on newly incoming notifications, even though these notifications do not have 'Vibrate' enabled\n\nExpected: Nothing should vibrate since the default notification sound is set to 'None' and the specific notifications are not set to 'Vibrate'.",
