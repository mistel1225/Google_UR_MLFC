    "content": "Help, my brand new pixel 3 , I'm still enjoying it but I'm sad and stuck with all these problems happening at the exact same time. And with all people having the same problem..\n\n- USB C to C cables don't work, including original and working cables from Google and Anker anymore both ways (They were working several days ago in one way, if you flip the USB cable it will not register a charge but now both ways don't work) USB A to USB C using a computer or any wall brick with USB A seems to be working.\n- Original USB C buds don't work although it works in other phones.\n- Battery is draining so fast, loosing about 50% while phone is idle.\n- Phone is getting extremely hot.\n- Phone won't start until you connect it to a charger.\n\nTried all things that people recommending over internet including factory/hard reset, cleaning USB ports ...\nI'm nowhere near a google warranty or even a licensed repair shop aka UBREAKIFIX\n\nAnyone managed to find a solution? Or the phone is dead?\nMy main question:  is this a problem with battery and the port or it's a software problem, will replacing them solve those issues?\nPlease help",
