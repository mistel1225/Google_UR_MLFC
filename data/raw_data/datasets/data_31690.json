    "content": "I've just got a brand new Pixel 3 XL and every time I open the Facebook app and try to log in, it either crashes the app or sometimes crashes the phone altogether. So far I have restarted the phone, reinstalled the Facebook app, done all my system updates, cleared the cache and storage on the Facebook app, and nothing seems to help. I can login to Facebook on Chrome and the Facebook Lite app works but not the main one",
