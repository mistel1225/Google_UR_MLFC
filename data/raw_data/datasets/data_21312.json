    "content": "I purchased a second hand Pixel 3a XL in an online shop in Malaysia.\n\nWhen switching it on it displays\n\n\"The bootloader is unlocked and software integrity cannot be guaranteed. Any data stored on the device may be available to attackers. Do not store any sensitive data on the device.\nVisit this link on another device: g.co/ABH\n\nThe phone came without the box but otherwise looking pretty much like new and I reckon it's originally from the US.\nI just wonder if I might face any difficulties with running this phone in Malaysia.\nI read something about certain apps not working properly and possible issues with updates.\n\nI didn't dare to set it up yet for the case I have to send it back to the seller.\n\nAny advise on that?",
