    "content": "For the past week or so my new phone (1 month old) battery life has been pretty bad.  I expect this as I play a lot of games. Today the phone started shutting off. It's never gotten below 20% power, but just shuts off, I see the grey battery symbol, then black screen.\n\nWhen I put it on a charger, or plug it in (I've tried many different chargers) the battery level indicator pops up with the little circle splash about every 30 seconds. The phone does not charge at all while its on, but has to be off.\n\nI've done a factory reset on it, and was able to restore the phone in stages, but the problem is the same.",
