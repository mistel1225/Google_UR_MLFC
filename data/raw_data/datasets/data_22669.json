    "content": "I've been using pixel 4 xl for a more than a month. Recently i found my screen is flickering when the screen was in a less bright situation, I checked online, someone mentioned I should brighter the screen it's gonna fixed the issue, I tried ,it works, but sometimes I can't always keep the screen super bright, and also if I turn off the smooth display, it will fix the issue as well. I don't know what happened, it was totally fine before. Not sure if it's just the software issue or the hardware issue.",
