    "content": "Android Auto was working seamlessly with my car infotainment system but it suddenly stopped working. I've already tried uninstalling Android auto update, disabled Android auto app, rebooted phone. But doesn't work. Changed USB cable too. Mitsubishi service guy phone was working when I reported with them. Google support asked me to try it in safe mode but when I click on Android auto, the screen goes blank as if it is trying to start the Android auto and stays that way. This is the same blank screen I get when I connect the Android auto in normal mode to my Mitsubishi Outlander 2019 PHEV infotainment system. Can anyone help me with this issue please?",
