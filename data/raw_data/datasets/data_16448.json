    "title": "After Andoid 11 upgrade Ring and text notifications are silent when volume is on",
    "content": "Since upgrading to Android 11, my phone will consistently vibrate and not ring/chime with audible notifications for calls and texts. My settings are for sure set to be audible and volumes for notifications are up. I've checked to see if there are further updates, but it shows my system at the most recent build. This is not consistent - sometimes a call or text will have an audible notification, but a majority of the time the phone only vibrates with no sound. Several other notifications seem to have similar behavior, but those are so few and far between it's difficult to say with certainty. I've rebooted, cycled from silent/DND/audible several times.",
