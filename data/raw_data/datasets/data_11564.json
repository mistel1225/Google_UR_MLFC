    "content": "Hello,\n\nI'm having issues with my Pixel 4 constantly forgetting my car's bluetooth connection. I keep having to repair it. It's been going on since the phone came out. I've been tolerating for this long because it's only been like once every other week. Now it seems to be every time I get into my car I have to sit there and repair it. I don't have that many bluetooth devices on here, just my watch and headphones. But I rarely have more than one connected. Any ideas on how to remedy this? Thanks in advance.",
