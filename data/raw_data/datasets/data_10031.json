    "content": "My Pixel 4XL began getting stuck at 50% charge, and would die as soon as I unplugged the charging cable.  Based on research, it appeared to be a common defect.  I chatted with support, and they told me it would be fixed under warranty, and to take it to the authorized repair center.  But the repair center would not take it, because they said Google declined to authorize the repair for every phone brought in with this issue, and that the customer would have to mail it in for repair.\n\nSo I created a mail-in case, and sent my phone in over two weeks ago.  Per Fedex, it was received by Google on Friday Dec. 4th (two weeks ago).  But the support portal says Google is waiting to receive the device.  So, I started following up on Sunday, Dec. 6th.  The chat agents escalate to a \"specialist\", and then the specialist chats that they're working on it, and switched it over to email support.\n\nI have been following up at least every other day, and all they will tell me is that a specialist is working on it, and they thank me for my patience.  I have no more patience.  This is unacceptable.  I have provided them the EMEI, RMA, tracking number, person who signed for it and the time it was signed for multiple times.  All they will tell me is that a specialist is working on it.  This is very frustrating and unacceptable.",
