    "content": "Hello,\n\nit's been a few months already that when I plug the phone to charge it, it sometimes doesn't charge and nudging it just a bit makes it charge again. Which means also that nudging it just a bit (like just taking to phone to use it and putting it back) also sometimes lead to it not charging anymore and so bad surprises.\n\nAnd now it's almost impossible to find that 'just right' position to charge it. No need to say I would like my phone to be charged way more easily.\n\nWhat can I do? Can I send it back for repairs? How long would that take?\nI bought it on the google store.\n\nThanks.\nRegards.",
