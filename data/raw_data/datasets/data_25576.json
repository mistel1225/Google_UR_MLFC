    "content": "I was told I can't trade my old Google Pixel 1 in for a Google Pixel 4XL discount!\n\nI have an old IPOD, an iPHONE , SAMSUNG Galaxy, windows touchscreen notebook, I would be willing to part with! Can I get a FREE PIXEL 4XL for trading in 4 old models?  The iPod is a brand that did hook up to the Internet before the ALL IN ONE COMPUTER PHONES! All it did was play music, which I didn't really listen to much!  It has that long messed up end which is not compatible with the current connections! ",
