    "content": "Hi guys\n\nI dropped my pixel 4 XL this morning and it just went off. Charging it doesn't do anything. It only turns on when i have it plugged in and then the moment i let go of the power button it turns off again. If i keep the power button pressed in, it just restarts the whole time without getting anywhere apart from the google logo.\n\nAny assistance would be greatly appreciated.\nThanks \nLorentz",
