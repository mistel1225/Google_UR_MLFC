    "content": "Wanted to buy 3a,and went to Currys to test the camera. The front camera in 3a just shows one eye very clear, but the other eye blur like foggy . I even tried two different 3a phone, but the result is the same. I can't believe everyone test on internet said pixel 3a's camera is as good as Pixel 3 ! Just wandering how come Google doesn't find out this problem , and already started to sell it.",
