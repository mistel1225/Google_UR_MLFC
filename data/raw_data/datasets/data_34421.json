    "content": "I'm curious if anyone has experienced this issue.\n\nThis morning the volume DOWN button stopped working.\n\nThe volume DOWN button physically behaves as expected. It clicks, does not stick, and does not exhibit any physical issues. The OS does not respond to the button clicks in any way. Volume control does not work. Camera shutter control via volume buttons does not work either, but only with the volume DOWN button. \nVolume UP works as expected.\n\nDevice is 20 days old.\nPixel 3 XL 128GB",
