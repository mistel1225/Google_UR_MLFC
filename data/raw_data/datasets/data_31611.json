    "content": "Hi,\nI have a Pixel 3 and since 3 weeks it's a bit annoying to surf on mobile data - websites don't charge at all, the site can't be reached, no DNS record found etc. After trying to load a couple of times there is no change. Just after a minute or so it s possible to charge again.\n\nI never had this problem before - does anybody experience the same problem?",
