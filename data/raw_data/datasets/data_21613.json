    "content": "Phone was unresponsive after sitting overnight plugged in, as though powered off but was slightly warm to the touch. Pressed the power button, phone came back to life with a message that the OS may be corrupt and options to do a factory reset or retry. Retried, phone booted but now the lock screen loops about once per second. The phone can be powered down/restarted and bootloader menus are still accessible. Booting into Recovery Mode only goes as far as a \"No Command\" message and needs to be force shut down by holding the power button. Short of a factory reset, is there a way to recover from this?",
