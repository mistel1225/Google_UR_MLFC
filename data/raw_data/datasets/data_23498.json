    "title": "No mobile connectivity on Pixel 2 after settings reset",
    "content": "In an attempt to solve a (probably) unrelated issue, I reset my phone's network settings earlier today in the Reset Wi-Fi, mobile & Bluetooth option under the System menu, and since then I haven't been able to use mobile data at all. Wi-Fi works normally, but I can't send or receive text messages, or use any internet functions at all while not connected to Wi-Fi. I've already tried turning airplane mode on and off, soft resetting and hard resetting. I'm totally out of ideas and can't find anyone who has run into this same problem, please help.",
