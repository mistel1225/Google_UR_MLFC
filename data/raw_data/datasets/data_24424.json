    "content": "I just updated the phone to Android Q. I frequently make calls at home on speaker phone. I noticed that after I hung up my calls the phone would make a chime sound. It would also chime when I send outing texts. I checked the settings and both settings for outgoing text sounds and ending call sounds are off. I'm not quite sure why this is happening. The update was yesterday and I have a Pixel 2XL.",
