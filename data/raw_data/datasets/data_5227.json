    "title": "White dots in photos taken with long exposure",
    "content": "When taken with a long exposure settings with OpenCamera and other camera apps, I see white dots scattered across the screen like a starfield if I take a picture of a solid background, like my finger covering up the lens. Each dot is plus + shaped when zoomed in. The dots themselves don't move, and don't go away when I wipe the lens. The dots aren't on my screen, as they respond to zooming in and out.",
