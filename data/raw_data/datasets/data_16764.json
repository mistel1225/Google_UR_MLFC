    "content": "I have a pixel 3a. For half a year now, several times a day, but sometimes every 2 days a problem with the touchscreen appears in the lower third. If you touch there, single touches are recognized as multiple, so if you press \"f\" then \"ffffffff\" appears, certain areas do not work at all and gesture control is not possible. With a restart it is gone. \nThe problem seems to be known and as a solution it is mentioned to perform a factory reset or to delete apps.\nI have done a factory reset and reduced my apps to the minimum, unfortunately without success. I also hoped that Android 11 would solve the problem. Unfortunately also not. \nWhat would you advise me to do? I'm thinking about sending in the phone as a guarantee, even though it seems to be a software problem.",
