    "content": "I ordered a google pixel 4a on the 24th October and so far it been a week and I have not yet received any bank statement via email saying I paid or anything and I checked the tracking site and it says \"not yet dispatched\" and with an estimated delivery time of 11 - 12 November. Is this normal or is there something wrong with my order?",
