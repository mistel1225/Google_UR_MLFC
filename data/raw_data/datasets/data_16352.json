    "content": "Recently upgraded to Android 11.  Since the upgrade when viewing videos full screen in landscape mode on Chrome 85, then when switching to portrait mode the OS sometimes reboots.  Removed Chrome data and the problem still exists.  Might be a chrome issue as this doesn't happen in YouTube but did not exists before Android 11.",
