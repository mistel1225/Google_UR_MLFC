    "content": "Nothing because the  effect is one of a multiple number of apps have been launched, things like aeroplane mode on, Bluetooth off. I have taken aeroplane mode icon out of status bar area, but some of the other things are very random. I only have apps from the Play store. The phone is mostly in my breast pocket most of the time. I suppose I could try a factory reset after I've made sure everything's backed up but the device is only a couple of weeks in my hands. My last phone was a OnePlus 3T which I've had for nearly 5 years. I used to have pocket mode switched on with that device & no issues. That is not available on this device. It's the randomness of things I don't like & it's stopped me from taking advantage of some of the new features in V11 (OnePlus was 9 + their mods - which were modest).",
