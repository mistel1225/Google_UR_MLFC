    "content": "Hi folks, \n\nI have a pixel 3 phone that is just over 1  year old. Recently the camera stopped working during use and refused to work at all afterwards. After a restart it was working again, but only allowed me to take 3 or 4 photos (with the rear camera) before it stopped again. If I took a video it would crash at around 15sec. After this only a reboot could potentially get the camera starting again. Since this started happening the camera never works for longer than this and rebooting only gets it working again, allbeit for limited periods, maybe 50% of the time. \nI have reviewed lots of threads and tried uninstalling camera app updates, clearing cache, rebooting in safe mode, and even factory reset twice. Nothing fixes the camera issue. On the last factory reset the camera worked for 4 or 5 pics and now the issue is back. \n\nWhat on earth do I do Google? I have tried contacting you through the pixel phone help and when I get to the point of raising an email to you, I get an error on my PC advising that I cannot email you and there is no phone number (I live in Australia). \n\nPlease, can someone help!!\n\nTB",
