    "content": "Hi, \nMy pixel 3 screen becomes unresponsive. It's not due to an App (tried restarting, restarting in safe mode and factory reset).\nAlso I noticed it might be related to head just above the finger print sensor on both the front and back sides, although the phone is not overheating.\nThe remaining controls stay functional (power button, volume, finger print sensor, side squeeze).\nAnyone has any idea what might be the problem and how to solve it?\n\nThanks\n\nTarek",
