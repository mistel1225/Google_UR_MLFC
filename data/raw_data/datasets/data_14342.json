    "content": "My Pixel phone is under warranty. The black glass is cracked. Trying to update my phone to android beta somehow bricked my phone. Was told that they wonâ€™t unbrick my phone unless I pay to get the entire back of the phone replaced. I told them that I just want them to unbrick my phone and they can leave the back as is. I was told this is not possible and I have to pay and get my back replaced and only then they will unbrick my phone. Is this normal or am I being misinformed?",
