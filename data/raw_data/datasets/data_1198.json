    "content": "Recently, this white rectangular notification bubble began coming up from the bottom of the screen with unnecessary information about the status of some task or operation. It occludes the input area at the bottom of the screen, and persists an insane length of time, on top of any app. Many times I've had to restart the phone to get rid of it. I want to be rid of it permanently. Any help?",
