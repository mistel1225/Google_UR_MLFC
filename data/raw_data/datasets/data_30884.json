    "content": "Hi,\n\nI've recently purchased a Pixel 3 device and I'm having problems connecting both it and my MacBook to my headphones set (Bose QuiteComfort 35 II).\nI'm able to connect my headphones to the Pixel 3 device separately.\nI'm able to connect my headphones to my MacBook Pro separately.\n\nHowever I'm only able to connect only 1 of those devices (Pixel 3 or MacBook) to my headphones but not both of them.\nMeaning if I've connected my Pixel 3 to my headset then I won't be able to connect my MacBook.\nIn order to connect my MacBook to the headset I need to clear the headphones pairing list and only then I can connect my MacBook, but then I won't be able to connect my Pixel 3 afterwards.\n\nSearching for this issue I came up with a few other people running into Bluetooth Multipoint issues in the Pixel 3 but couldn't find any solve (you can try searching for \"pixel 3 multipoint issues\").",
