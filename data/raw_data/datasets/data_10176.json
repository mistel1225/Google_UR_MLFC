    "content": "On my old iPhone as long as I kept holding the middle or camera button on Instagram Stories the video would last as long as I would like it to, but on my Google Pixel 4a it stops after the first 15 seconds. Just wondering if this can be changed at all? It's my first time having an Android phone also!",
