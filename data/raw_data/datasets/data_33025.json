    "content": "I have seen on various posts on different forums that users are still experiencing issues with speaker sound specifically on audio that has speaking. I listen to a lot of interviews and snippets on YouTube and Twitter and there is a clear reverberation and tinny-ness to the audio if the volume is put up to normal listening levels. I've noticed this since i got the phone and noticed some change for the better from the first view patches that were released. There still seems to be some resonance of the issue though. It definitely seems like some audio refinement can fix it, does anyone else notice this?",
