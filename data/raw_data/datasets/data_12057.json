    "content": "Hi everyone!\n\nSo I got the new Pixel 5 a few weeks ago and have been having many issues with data transferring from my iPhone 11 to the new Pixel 5. I've contacted Verizon, Apple, and Google--AND NO ONE KNOWS WHAT'S GOING ON!!! Today I had an idea to try transferring my mom's iPhone data, which was still on iOS 13, and it was a success! So that means that there must be something in the way and iOS 14 is the culprit! I haven't been able to figure out what exactly about the update is causing the issue. \n\nAnyways, I tried to transfer my data onto my mom's iPhone (iOS 13), but when I did that it started updating!! Now it's on iOS 14!! So I have no access to an iOS 13 iPhone and I'm stuck again. \n\nPlease! Someone help!! I've tried everything!! I've had the Pixel 5 since the release day.",
