    "content": "My Pixel 3 suddenly stopped connecting to public WiFi. When I try to sign into the public WiFi it brings me to the page http://connectivitycheck.gstatic.com and has the error 502 bad gateway. I can use my private how wifi just fine and I was using public WiFi yesterday. I saw posts from a year ago with this same issue but didn't see any real resolution to the problem.",
