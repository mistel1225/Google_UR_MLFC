    "content": "Why Google is not yet released the dual exposer control for pixel 3a. Yaa I know pixel 3a has only one camera but Pixel 4a has dual exposer although it has only one camera. Why not for Pixel 3a??\nWhy is Google doing like this. All purchase Google phone's because of the main reason camera. They're not providing proper update to camera only. I know it's easy to provide update I don't why Google not doing this. Is this because it's a old device.",
