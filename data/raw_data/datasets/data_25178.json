    "content": "(actually I think this is relevant to all Pixel models)\nI am sure many of us are concerned at the idea of having NFC on/off toggling involving going through multiple menus. I am sure many of us are concerned at the thought of leaving NFC on all the time, open to any NFC exploits. And I am sure many of us really don't want -- when standing at a checkout counter and wishing pay for a purchase with Google Pay -- to have to go through Settings/Connected Devices/Connection Preferences to temporarily switch NFC on.\n\nGoogle please add a Quick Setting to toggle NFC off and on. I mean, my old LG V20 had one. You can do it.",
