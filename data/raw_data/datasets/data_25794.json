    "title": "Pixel crashes at answering incoming calls, slow performance and random reboots",
    "content": "Whenever I make/answer a phone call (regular but also with whatsapp), my phone freezes. It also randomly reboots. The headphone jack didn't seem to work. And I've noticed that the performance has significantly dropped and so seems the battery life. \nI can't remember exactly when these problems have started, but it's probably since the last 2-3 weeks. \nI've tried whiping cache, emptying space, resetting app settings but nothing helped. I've considered doing a factory reset, but I wanted to wait if there're maybe other solutions I could try. \nI have all updates (both Android as well as app store) installed.",
