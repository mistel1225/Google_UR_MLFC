    "content": "After upgrading to the Pixel 4XL my device will no longer use LTE while Roaming. I reset all network settings, and even did an FDR. It will show LTE while roaming with an X and then immediately go to 3G. I work for the carrier that I have service with, and have seen it to be a device issue.",
