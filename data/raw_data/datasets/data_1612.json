    "content": "Lock button on Google pixel 3xl stopped allowing me to lock phone or turn off/restart but will let me screenshot and take me to camera if I tap twice, clearing cache doesn't always fix it. \n\nMy sound has started lowering itself to off by itself when I'm listening to music or watching a video on social media and is now also doing it when I'm on the phone. When I turn the volume up by the buttons or touch screen it immediately lowers again and then sometimes the banner keeps flashing up when I'm typing. Also having connection issues to plug in headphones but is charging fine.",
