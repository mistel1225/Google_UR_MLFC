    "title": "How do I solve random restarts of my phone?",
    "content": "Since I got my 3a, I get random restarts. Honestly, they're not really intrusive because it only happens when I'm NOT using my phone. I observed also that I get more of these restarts when I'm connected to wifi. I still get them if I'm on data but not as often as when I'm on wifi. Often means about 3 times a day or how often I just leave my phone on the desk and don't use it. When I'm on data I observe at least a once-a-day restart. Even if it doesn't really disrupt my daily use of the device, since it only happens when I'm not using it, it's still bothersome. Hope I could get new insight on this. I've tried most of the suggested fixes but nothing worked.",
