    "title": "No response on warranty claim",
    "content": "My warranty claim has been in progress for over a week. I'm not getting any response from support personnel and the only response I get is a copy paste from support. I've been trying to get an update by calling support everyday but all I get is that I'd get a response from the initial representative but all that he ends up doing is copy pasting the same telling he can't reach me. This is quite frustrating as I'm stuck with a phone which switches off every time I plug it in for charge and also smokes up at times and Google support for a flagship model is so bad in customer support. This is turning out to be a bad experience please help in supporting me on this.\n\nRegards,\nChristopher.",
