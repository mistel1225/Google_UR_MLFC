    "content": "The Pixel 5 produces poor portrait mode shots (bokeh) of non-person objects compared to Pixel 2XL It seems to have too aggressive default settings, causing more than half in object in the center of focus to be blurry as well. Some times the center of focus is off as well. The picture can be manually fixed in the blur settings later, but this defeats why stick with a Pixel phone. My Pixel 2XL does not have any issues and takes better photos on the 1st try than the Pixel 5. Can this issue we fixed for default settings or does Google plan to push out a software update for the Pixel 5 to address this?",
