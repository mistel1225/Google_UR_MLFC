    "content": "I've been trying to determine if my Pixel 4 XL charges at a \"good\" rate.\nIn the 10-50% charged range, it charges pretty consistently 1% increase per 36-38 seconds.\nIs that ok?  Good?  Bad?\n\nThe battery is documented as 3700 mAh.\nI assume that number is for 3.7V.\n\nI hope I'm not publicly embarrassing myself with a simple error in my arithmetic...\n\nI did a naive calculation based on above and arrive at,\nif the 18W charging was 100% efficient,\ncharging would increase 1% per 27.4 seconds.\n\n\nComparing with my 36-38 seconds instead,\nI'm getting only 13W effective results.\n\nOr said in terms of efficiency, I'm getting only approx 72% efficiency.\n\nPardon my geeky question.  But I'm wondering.\nIs 72% efficiency reasonable?\nIs 36-38 seconds to raise battery charge by 1% pretty average for this battery+phone?\n\nMaybe some readers will time their phone battery charging and post their results, please.\nThanks",
