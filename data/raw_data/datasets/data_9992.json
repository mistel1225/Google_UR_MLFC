    "content": "I have an issue with the bluetooth microphone since the last update couple of days ago. As I found out, it is a known problem and a lot of people complaint about it a year ago. The relative thread is closed for some reason, and it's a really annoying thing to encounter. I have tried to reset wifi bluetooth several times, it didn't solve the issue.",
