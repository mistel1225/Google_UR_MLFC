Content violates Community Policy\" error.\n\nThis is my question:\nMy Pixel 3a XL charges very slowly when plugged into my computer's USB-C port, despite displaying \"Charging rapidly\" on the lock screen. I had no problem charging my Pixel XL 2 this way before trading it in for the 3a XL. Tried changing cables but didn't work, and same cables will charge fast when plugged into wall adapter.",
