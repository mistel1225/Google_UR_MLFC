    "content": "When making or receiving wifi calls the audio drops. The call still shows connected, but I cannot hear the caller and the caller cannot here me, yet the call has not dropped.\n\nI quit wifi and make the call over cellular service and this *always* works.\n\nNow I only make wifi calls using whatsapp or skype. These apps always work over wifi (and cellular).\n\nWhat's up with that google?",
