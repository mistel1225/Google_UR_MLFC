    "content": "I purchased a new Pixel 4 (5G) yesterday.  Trying to transfer all data, photos, apps from a Nexus 6P.  The Setup process showed me a long list of things to copy with a note that the process was waiting for wifi, but I had trouble connecting to my home wifi for a couple of house.  The device is now connected to wifi but the transfer list has disappeared and there is no \"Finish Setup\" option showing at the top of the Settings page and no message \"Pixel setup isn't done\".  How can I restart the transfer/setup process?  Thank you.",
