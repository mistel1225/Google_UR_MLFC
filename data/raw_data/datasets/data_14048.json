    "content": "After contacting my companies I.T. Department with this issue, I need further assistance. My team uses Google Suite apps to operate, including G-Chat. Chat is the only app my phone refuses to cooperate with in my Work Profile. No one else seems to have this issue on both android and ios devices. \n\nWhen I try to set up my work profile to access Google apps, it says I have to delete my device policy and existing work profile every time. Gmail and Drive work just fine.",
