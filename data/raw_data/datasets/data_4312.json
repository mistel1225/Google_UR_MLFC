    "content": "I have been having problems with camera/photos for a couple of weeks. I concluded a long chat session with a Google rep but he was unable to fix it.I have also sent this in as Feedback from my Google Pixel 4a phone.\n  These are the issues:\n  (1) Deleting photos and videos on the Google Photos 'roll' is problematic. Some will not delete at all. Some remain but are blurry, out if focus, when I know that the original photo was in-focus. Some stay on the photo directory as grey squares; in other words they take up space on then 'roll' but there is no image.\n  (2) Images/thumbnails on the Google Photos directory/roll have a right arrow in the middle, indicating that they are videos. When that thumbnail is tapped the full image fills the screen, the arrow is still there. When the arrow is tapped nothing happens, i.e. no video plays, the still image stays. I am not 100% sure that the image ever was a video-- I think it was (there are many fake video icons, it's not just one) but it is possible that it was a still in the first place and a video icon was somehow added.\n  (3) The dates of many photos have been changed. Photos that I know for certain were taken in Nov, Dec, Jan, and Feb are appearing under Oct 25th or 27th, etc.The 'roll' is really a mess. Some images from long ago, prior to October, are dumped in the Oct 27th (or nearby date) listing. It's ridiculous. And a big mess.\n  Has anyone else experienced these problems?\n\nThanks.",
