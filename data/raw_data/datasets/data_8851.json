    "content": "Has anyone ever seen an issue where a device (specifically Pixel 5) where only Chrome can access the microphone or bluetooth mics?  Here are the details:\n\n- Updated to January 2021 security patch seems to have caused the issue\n- No applications besides websites in Chrome can access audio\n- Can't make phone calls using phone or bluetooth headset\n- Can't record audio using phone or bluetooth headset\n- Performed factory reset at request of support, and still doesn't work\n\nAt this point, it seems related to the January 2021 security patch.  Support wasn't overly helpful except for suggesting a device swap.\n\nHas anyone else seen anything like this?  Any suggestions would be highly appreciated.",
