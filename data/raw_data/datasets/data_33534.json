    "content": "I know Google doesn't ship phones to this country straight off the Google Store, but I'm here for another 4 months and now I don't have a working camera/phone. I'd rather not buy a different brand of phone because I have the Pixel protection plan, but I'm thinking they won't send me one while I'm here.",
