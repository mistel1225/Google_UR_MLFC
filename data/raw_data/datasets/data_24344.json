    "title": "Search bar on the Google Pixel 3 turned black after using battery saver and won't change back.",
    "content": "I turned on battery saver mode because my phone was at 10% and I didn't have an outlet for my charger, so I wanted to save my power as long as possible. My cord ended up not working, and my phone died, so I had to wait a few hours before I could use my main plug at home. I plugged it in, waited a bit for it to charge, and then turned it back on. Once it was on, I turned off battery saver, and my screen turned white again, but the search bar at the bottom of the screen is still black. Some people say it is because your background is black, but my background is almost fully white with a little light blue on it, not anything dark. I tried turning battery saver on and off again, as well as changing my icon settings to turn dark mode on and off, but it didn't change. It doesn't interfere with my apps, the phone turns the letters on my keyboard white as if thinking the phone was in dark mode which it isn't since my background, apps, and all web pages are pure white. The weird part is when I scroll up to see my apps, it changes back to white, but if I slowly scroll down, you can see it fading back to black. How do I change my search bar back to white? Either nothing in the settings seems to be helping, or I'm just missing something.",
