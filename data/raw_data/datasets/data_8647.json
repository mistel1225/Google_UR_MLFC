    "content": "I can't open links that would take me to a different app. Like if I'm in Chrome, I can't open a YouTube link. Or if I'm in instagram, I can't open up any links to stores or click on the \"learn more\" or \"see on website\" bars. Anything that stays within the app, like a link on a webpage that just takes you to a different page, those work fine.",
