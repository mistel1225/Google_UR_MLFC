    "content": "I temporarily switched my SIM card to an old iPhone. During that time, I received two voicemails but didn't get them until I switched my SIM card back to my Pixel 2. \n\nDoes anyone know why? Just want to make sure the reverse isn't happening. In other words, I want to make sure that voicemails aren't being left on my iPhone that I'm not getting on my Pixel.",
