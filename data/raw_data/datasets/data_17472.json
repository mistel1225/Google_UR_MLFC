    "content": "The prevent ringing feature is super nice, but is there a way to use the same gesture (pressing power/volume up buttons) to turn the ringer back on? It's super nice to turn the ringer off on when the device is off by using the gesture, but it's a little annoying when I have to unlock my phone again just to turn the ringer back on. An example of when this would be useful is when I walk into my school I can just use the gesture while my phone is off to toggle the ringer off, but when I leave the school and start driving home, I'm not necessarily wanting to to use my phone I just wanna know if I get notifications or something, but I have to unlock my phone and press a volume button then press the ringer button to turn it back on. I know this isn't to much more to do, but it would make it a lot less of a hassle.\n\n- By the way sorry if I explained this terribly, I tried my best",
