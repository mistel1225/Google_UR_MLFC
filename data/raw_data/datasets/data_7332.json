    "content": "Switching from Verizon to my husband's GoogleFi plan and from iphone to pixel4a5g . Followed directions for data transfer by connecting the two phones with the cord/adapter. Phone works, all is great! Then realized I did not do anything with the sim card...do I need to? Sim card tool came with phone, but see nothing in paper directions. Will be sending my old phone back in for $back.",
