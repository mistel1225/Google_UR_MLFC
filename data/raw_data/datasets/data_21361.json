    "content": "I'm delaying upgrading to Android 10 due to all the reported problems. So anyone who has done the upgrade, have Google fixed the problem with the volume buttons? In Pie they defaulted to changing the media volume. I'm hoping Google have added a Settings toggle to change the behaviour to either media or ringer volume (like Samsung, Oppo and others already have). I'd be interested to know, thanks.",
