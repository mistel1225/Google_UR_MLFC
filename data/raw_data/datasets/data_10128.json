    "content": "As you probably know, there are 2 speakers on the bottom of my pixel 4a 5g and for some reason, the left one doesn't work very well. The right one plays all the audio and when I cover it with my finger, almost all the audio is drowned out meaning the left one isn't playing. Is that supposed to be like that or is this a hardware issue?",
