    "content": "I recently performed a factory reset, started Chrome, visited news.google.com, and chose Add to Home Screen from the menu. The shortcut did not appear on the home screen. When I visit that site in Chrome, Add to Home Screen is no longer in the menu. Other sites still have the Add to Home Screen option, just not that site. It seems like the shortcut is partially added.\n\nHas anyone experienced this or similar?",
