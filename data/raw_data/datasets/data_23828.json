    "content": "I'm trying to figure out what's the difference or if it matters buying 4XL (unlocked / from google) vs buying it from a carrier for instance.  Right now I have a 2XL I got from Google where I use Verizon on Physical SIM and Google Fi on eSIM for international travel.  \n\nVerizon has the best trade-in deal / upgrade.  I want to make sure I won't have any issues.",
