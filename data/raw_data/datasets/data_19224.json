    "content": "After last update my phone is not the same. I browse normally as usual and all of a sudden google chrome freezes. I have to touch the central button and back to make it work again. It's super annoying. Other apps like Grindr try to load for forever but without any output until I close the app and open it again.\n\nI would rather not reset the phone but I'll do it if I have no other options. I bought it last July",
