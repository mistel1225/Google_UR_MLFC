    "content": "The screen of my brand new Pixel 5 becomes unresponsive randomly for periods of 10 to 30 seconds. Only the on/off button reacts but no screen interaction is possible.\nDuring the first install I used the copy function to transfer my info and data from my Pixel 3XL. During the initial setup of the phone I encountered the problem one time. When finished with the setup the problem occurs 1 out of three times when using the phone.\n\nAllthough the problem occured already during setup (so it cannot be caused by third party app) I did a factory reset and setup the phone only with wifi, my google account and no SIM. The problem occurs again.\n\nI think this phone has a hardware issue?",
