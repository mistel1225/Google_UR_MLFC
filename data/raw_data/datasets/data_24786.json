    "content": "After the (9.0.0 (PQ3A.190505.001, May 2019) pie update, my pixel stays stuck on the boot screen. I can access recovery mode and everything and i could even flash a full OTA image. Flashing was successful but it still doesnt turn on and stays stuck at the boot screen. I bought the phone from someone else so cant avail any official service from google. Hope you guys can help",
