    "content": "Whenever I try to click on Google Lens icon (either from Google Photos app or Google Assistant), I am getting an error saying \"Google keeps stopping\". \nI am using a Pixel 2 XL, Android 10 with most recent update, all Google apps are up to date and NOT using beta form of any apps.\nI have already tried clearing cache, force closing  and restarting my phone. I'm not going to do a factory reset just go get Google Lens to work.",
