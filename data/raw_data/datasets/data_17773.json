    "content": "Android auto does not work with new Subaru Crosstrek 2021. I have tried all troubleshooting, have tried multiple cables, uninstalled and reinstalled apps, cleared caches, hard reset my car and my phone, put my phone into USB debugging, changed my default USB settings to data transfer and nothing has worked. The car USB settings are set to auto play, my phone has never been used for Android auto in another car and I verified it wasn't connected elsewhere. \n\nWith Android auto for phone screens installed it will auto launch when I get in the car but nothing populates on the vehicle screen. I ensured my phone was not connected to another car as well. Please provide a fix for this! \n\nMy iPhone x connects seamlessly and my husband's galaxy s9 initially had issues but he was able to resolve them through changing USB permissions. I'm frustrated that I have two Google products that don't work together!",
