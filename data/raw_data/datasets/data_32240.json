    "content": "My Pixel 3 is refusing to hold a charge for long enough to get through the day.\n\nIn addition, my Pixel Stand will no longer rapid charge.\n\nIs this an issue with the latest update? I installed it Friday and this only started Sunday or Monday for me.\n\nIs there anyway I can actually talk to someone in support for Google? Can anyone link a direct phone number or email address or something?",
