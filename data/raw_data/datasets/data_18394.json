    "title": "On my pixel 3 XL , I cannot update my Google play services to July 1, 2020 regardless of attempts.",
    "content": "I have repeatedly tried to update my Pixel 3 XL Google play services to July 1, 2020 starting from 'about phone' in settings. Regardless of how many attempts I tried, I remain on the February 1, 2020 update and afterward attempts I get a note that 'update isn't available'. There were times where I got the July 1, 2020 update only for my pixel 3 XL to automatically restart and revert back to February 1, 2020 update. The February update is causing tremendous issues with the software bug \"Bluetooth keeps stopping\" along with wifi being disabled with it making my phone unusable.\n\nFurther note; I bought this phone a little over a week ago and I am very disappointed with the phone upgrade that is a rip off. I am living in British Columbia Canada.",
