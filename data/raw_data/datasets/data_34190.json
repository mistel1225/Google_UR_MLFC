    "content": "Tried rebooting the phone which didn't help. Basically what usually happens is I see a phone call briefly appear on the screen, but when I try to answer it, and sometimes even before I have a chance to touch it, it ends. People who I call back say it sent them to voice mail. Outgoing calls work just fine.",
