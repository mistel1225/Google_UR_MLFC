    "content": "Your phone uses ELS only when you call or text an emergency number.\nDuring your emergency call, ELS may use Google Location Services and other information to obtain the most accurate location possible for the device.\nYour phone sends the location to authorized emergency partners for the purpose of helping emergency services locate you. Your location is sent directly from your phone to emergency partners, not through Google.\nAfter a completed emergency call or text during which ELS was active, your phone sends usage and analytics data to Google for the purpose of analyzing how well ELS is working. This information doesn't identify you and Google doesn't use it to identify you.",
