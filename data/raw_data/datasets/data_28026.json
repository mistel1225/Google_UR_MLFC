    "content": "Am I the only person that thinks that it sucks big time that Google is cancelling the 100gb of drive storage upgrades that people have earned thru various apps/rewards and is now asking everyone to pay for that storage. Mine said you have 3 weeks to get your 100gb of data transferred or it's gone midnight of the 15th ( I got the notice about 5 days ago or so, and the date might be wrong, that's what remember it saying though)?? Does anyone know of any kind of benefit or reward for owning a Pixel 2XL that relates to digital storage? I should of just bought the one with more storage, FML, well thank you for the last 3 years of free storage that I have managed to put every single thing of mine in like an idiot. :( Feeling really dumb right now for not having thought that maybe one day that would cost me money. Oh well, I'm just a complainer who rambles, thanks. Have an amazing and blessed life to anyone who ends up reading this.",
