    "content": "Hi everyone.\nI have been using the Pixel 1 for quite some time now and finally got my hands on the new Pixel 5 (Sage). \nMy Pixel 1 has deteriorated so bad that the batter doesnt last more than 5 seconds. Therefore I am forced to use it with either a power source or a dedicated power bank 24 hours a day. \n\nI wanted to use the quick switch tool included in the new Pixel 5. However, I am not sure how I can use it with the old Pixel, given that it won't stay switched on without a power source. Would I be able to use the quick switch tool without switching on the Pixel?\n\nthanks\nS.",
