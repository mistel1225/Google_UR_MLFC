    "content": "My camera will not focus. It can sense things because it follows movement and it sees things very close, but it won't bring it into focus. I tried everything on the 'fixing problems with your Google camera' page and it still won't work.\n\nIt had been doing a werid jiggle thing for a bit beforehand but never looked Into it. \n\nWith iPhone I would go to the apple store, idk what to do with my pixel when I have problems!",
