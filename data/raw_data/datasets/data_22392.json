    "title": "Pixel 4 Navigation gestures interfere with apps swipe from left",
    "content": "I just switched from the OnePlus6t to this pixel and found the navigation gestures to be totally offputting. I use swipe from the edge a lot to open slack channels, email folders, and various other apps - so much that I often try and use it in apps that don't support it anyway...\n\nNow with gesture controls, swipe from the left or right is back; whereas with my OnePlus6t swipe up from the bottom left or right was back which is much more intuitive.\n\nI've now found myself having to use third-party apps to fix an issue with the stock OS. I thought pixel would be a much more intuitive experience but it seems like community developed efforts are much closer to actual users' wants and needs. XDA provides the original functionality with an app.\n\nIt would be great to be able to at least remove the side gestures or reintroduce the swipe up from the bottom left / right to go back and swipe up from the middle to go home / recent or better yet... put the options in the config so people can choose...\n\nIs this being looked into as a feature or a bug? I find it makes the phone very irritating to use compared to the OnePlus.",
