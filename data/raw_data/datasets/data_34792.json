    "content": "Hi, I just got my Google Pixel 3 a couple of months ago. Originally, I would open YouTube Music and play music on speaker mode or with my headphones on and I wouldn't have any trouble. Now, the music pauses randomly with or without wired-headphones. It's happened at different locations with strong Wifi connection. It hasn't happened with other apps yet. Any suggestions on how to fix this problem?",
