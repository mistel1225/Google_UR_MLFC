    "content": "My Google Pixel 3a turned itself off. I tried restarting it with the button options to do a factory reset. When trying to access recovery mode, the phone died once and for all and I could not turn it back on. I charged it the whole night and it didn't turn on. I've followed every step in the Google Site on how to fix these issues but nothing is helping. How can I get this fixed?",
