    "title": "Replaced Pixel 3 still Overheating",
    "content": "My original Pixel 3 was badly overheating so as per the initial Google support, I sent it back and received a refurbished one under Google warranty. The replacement had arrived on this Monday and I started using it since Monday evening. I have not installed 40% apps I used to have on my previous phone and I have tried the manuals the customer service agent provided. But it still overheats constantly and it gets worse while charging. \n\nI tried to contact the customer service via live chat as I used to but somehow it became u available.\n\nPlease advise options?\n\nWill I receive another refurbished replacement? Or is it possible to get a new one? Is there an option to potentially upgrade to newer versions with extra charge, which I would not mind paying if suitable?\n\nLook forward to hearing from you.\n\nBest regards\nSol",
