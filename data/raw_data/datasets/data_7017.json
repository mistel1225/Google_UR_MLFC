    "title": "\"No Sim Card\" message shown after the newest Android 11 update.",
    "content": "I updated the Cell phone in Safe boot, I reset all my cell phone settings. I took out the Sim card and re-inserted it. I contacted my cell phone provider. I used my sim card in a different phone, which worked. I used a different sim card in my phone, but still the same message. Can i go back to the previous version or how can I solve this mess?",
