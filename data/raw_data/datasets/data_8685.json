    "content": "The smart storage option on my device is turned off. Yet my photos on my device are still being removed and transfered to the cloud. Because of this I cannot view my photos without an internet connection.\n\nI have tried reinstalling the photos app, turning back up off, and downloading my photos again, but they are still removed after a couple weeks.\n\nI'm sick and tired of this. I just want my photos on my device.",
