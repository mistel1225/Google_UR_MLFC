    "content": "The 3 buttons that pop up on screen for an incoming call when I'm on another screen are unresponsive. Nothing happens when I tap them. Phone keeps ringing until going into voicemail. The swipe screen opens when there is no other activity going on and the screen is off. Missed 2 calls from hospital yesterday. Beyond annoying when the calls are critical.",
