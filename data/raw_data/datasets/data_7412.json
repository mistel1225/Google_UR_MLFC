    "title": "Broke the Screen on Pixel 2 (Completely Dead), how can I access secure apps like Password Manager?",
    "content": "My Pixel 2 fell and the screen is completely dead. I already got a Pixel 4a and successfully moved my files and apps. My problem is with two apps:\nGoogle Authenticator\nBlackBerry Password Keeper\n\nI moved apps and backed things up by enabling USB Debugging and managing the full fully from my laptop. However, those two apps above don't load when mirroring the screen. I can't find a way around this.\n\nI just want to access them to back the details there and then import them to the apps on the new phone.\n\nAny suggestions?",
