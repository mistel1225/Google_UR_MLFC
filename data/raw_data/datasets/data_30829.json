    "content": "Assistant updated last night.  Assistant now stuck in voice only mode - explains everything touched in shrill voice.  Finally got Power OFF to work and put in PIN to unclock.  When I touched the numbers Assistant repeated them twice. before unlocking.   However, no apps are working.  Tried getting to Settings. Tried turning the phone on and off again.  Tried getting to Safe Mode-  No luck.  Haven't tried a hard reboot since I don't know how being in Q Beta  Progarm will effect that. Volume Controls don't work so I don't even know if I can do a reboot.  Thanks",
