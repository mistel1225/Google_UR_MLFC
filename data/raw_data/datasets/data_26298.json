    "title": "Pixel 1 Phone App \"Show Notification\" Not Working",
    "content": "I've got the Pixel 1 with Android 10. All of a sudden the Phone App won't show notifications anymore for missed calls!  I've tried safe mode, clearing the cache, etc. but nothing works.  Unlike other apps, when I go into Settings and Notifications the \"Show Notifications\" bar isn't responsive.  The writing is dimmed rather than crisp and touching the toggle doesn't do anything.  \n\nWhat's going on?  Anyone know how to fix this so that I get missed call phone notifications again?\n\nThanks!",
