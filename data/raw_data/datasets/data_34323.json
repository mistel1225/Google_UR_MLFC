I bought an unlocked Pixel 2, I had an at&t sim card while there and call screening was working perfectly fine.\nI have now returned to my home country (Portugal) and it doesn't work, don't even have it on the settings menu like it used to.\nMy phone language is still in English I changed nothing since then only got my Portuguese Sim card on it, from Vodafone.\nI would still like to have that feature over here, is it possible?",
