    "content": "I've gone through almost all of my photos in my Google Photos, and can't seem to find any indication as to which files are taking up space. I checked on Google Drive and Google Photos for a storage breakdown, and Google Photos is taking up 1.38GB even though I should have unlimited original quality backup. What is taking up space and how do I find the stuff that's taking up space? \n\nI do not have any unsupported video formats or image formats.",
