    "title": "Bluetooth headset disconnecting and reconnecting constantly during calls.",
    "content": "I'm using a Pixel 5, and as the title states during calls every few seconds my headset will tell me it's been disconnected then reconnected. This issue only occurs during phonecalls and i'm using the Phone app. This issue does not occur using any media such as Spotify or YouTube and can get the entirety of my devices battery life without a disconnect. I have checked settings and permissions, I have unpaired and forgotten the headset to pair it again. I have restarted my phone and the headset itself, and didn't have this issue when using the same headset on my Pixel 3 that I have recently upgraded from. If information is needed, I use the Raycon Everyday Bluetooth headphones.",
