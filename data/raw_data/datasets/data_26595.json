    "content": "I did a factory reset on my Pixel 3 because it's been extremely laggy since updating to Android 10. Constantly frozen, keyboard on screen when it wasn't needed, missing texts. \n\nBefore resetting I ensured backup was on and app settings were also backed up. Upon resetting, the same apps are downloaded but the settings are all gone. It's extremely irritating because I had settings for smart home things all set up. Any advice would be appreciated.",
