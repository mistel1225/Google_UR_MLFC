    "content": "I tried uninstalling the app, settings, support search. Nothing fix the problem. Also I'm using Android 11. When I try to add a loyalty card it shows a search box but no matter what you put in there it doesn't find anything (see the screen shot).\n\nUpdate: I did check with my old Nexus 6p and have the same problem in the app but if I go to the main Android settings I can then actually get results to add new loyalty card. Is this a bug? Any one confirm if this can be replicated in other Pixel phone?",
