    "content": "My Pixel 3 died a little bit ago. I woke up one day and it was just completely dead without anything happening to it. I tried all of the resets and took it in to the store where they replaced it for me. Most of my stuff was saved on the drive but I had a few things that didn't upload. I was wondering if there is any way I can take apart the phone or something to get to the internal storage to get the photos off or if I can switch out batteries or something just long enough to get my data?",
