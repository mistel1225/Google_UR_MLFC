    "content": "I've restarted the phone, turned night mode off and on, and I've pressed down on the line where it meets the border. It goes away when I turn the phone off, but always come back. The warranty already expired, as I'm not the original owner. The original owner had this problem as well, but it was after the warranty expired.",
