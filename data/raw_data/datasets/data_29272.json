    "title": "Pixel 2 volume down error became stuck at BootLoader screen problem. Unable to do anything now",
    "content": "My phone started with the random volume down error that I have seen a few people describing.  Foolishly I thought maybe a reboot would help fix it - DON'T DO THIS if you have the random volume down error.  The phone rebooted to the BootLoader screen where the volume down button is used to select options.  Now it's cycling options endlessly and not letting me choose one.  If I hold the volume up button it stops cycling but still wont register my selection by the power button.  If I hold power for about 10 seconds the screen goes black for about 3-5 seconds then comes back onto the bootloader screen.  The volume down button seems to work (clicks, doesn't feel like a dead button) so I suspect something more internal.  Help I now have no phone, and I actually quite like my Pixel 2.",
