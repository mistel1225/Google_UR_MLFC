    "content": "Why, Google? Why?\n\nMy Pixel 2 xl insists that I push the \"Enter\" key after I unlock my screen with the 4 digit code that I set up initially. But WHY!? It adds no extra security to require a fifth selection if it is the \"Enter\" key. All of my Samsung phones unlocked after the 4th number in the code was selected - SMART.  Btw... Yes - I have asked Google. Nobody can answer the riddle.\n\nThanks for any advice...\nCasey K \nOuch. My finger hurts.",
