    "content": "Is it possible to have my hotspot provide data from a WiFi connection I'm connected to (ie, Starbucks) rather than ONLY my carrier's data plan?\n\nThe post's by google talk about 'mobile data'... so I think that's correct, but wanted to verify that it's not possible to have my pixel device serve up wifi hotspot, like a repeater.\n\nThat Would be a nice feature to have though!",
