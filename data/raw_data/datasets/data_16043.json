    "content": "Phone is restarting in loop for the past 10 hours now. Any help will be so greatly appreciated !\n- Initially the camera was automatically turning on when the phone restarts, then after reading the community forum discussions I applied pressure between the power button and volume button to keep the phone on. While on I changed the Gesture settings , turned off the Active Edge.\n-This stopped the camera from turning on automatically\n- But the phone is still restarting on loop.\n-I also freed up the storage space but that has made no difference.",
