    "content": "I can't get chat features set up on my pixel 5. It worked perfect on my pixel 4xl before I upgraded now it just keeps saying setting up forever and I have done the trouble shooting and clearing the data on the carrier services and messages app multiple times and it still doesn't work. Very frustrating that it worked on my old phone and not the new one. Any ideas?",
