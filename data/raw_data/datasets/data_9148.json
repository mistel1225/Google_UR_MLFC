    "content": "Hello\n\nToday my Google 4a stopped being able to boot. It gets the google splash screen, then goes to the google G logo with the loading line below it, and it never leaves.\n\nI have tried holding the power down to boot into safe mode, but safe mode never comes up.  I am not sure what to do next.",
