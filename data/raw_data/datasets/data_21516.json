    "content": "In Australia we use Celcius for temperature. When I press the power button to bring the screen out of screen save, the lock screen sometimes displays the temperature in °F and sometimes in °C. When I check in the Google app and Home app, I have temperature units set to Celcius and language set to English (Australia), so why is the lock screen sometimes displaying the the temperature in °F and how do I stop this happening?\n\nPixel 2 running Android 10.",
