    "content": "About 3 weeks ago I received my pixel 4a in the mail. 2nd day of having it I dropped it and the screen got cracked. Now just the other day my volume up button stopped working. It was completely jammed in the on position, now it just flops around. I'm wondering if it will be covered under warranty yet, or if I should go buy a replacement.",
