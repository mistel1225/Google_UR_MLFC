    "title": "Interesting Wi-Fi Calling bug since the May Security Update",
    "content": "Since I installed the latest May Security update, my Pixel 3 suddenly doesn't switch to Wi-Fi Calling anymore when I am connected to a Wi-Fi network. I do have to toggle Wi-Fi off and then on again which then fixes the issue until I leave and come back or connect to another Wi-Fi network elsewhere. I then have to do the exact same procedure again.\n\nMy housemate has a Pixel 2 XL and experiences the exact same issues. Anyone else?",
