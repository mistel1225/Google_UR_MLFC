    "content": "Hi all - the camera and microphone on my first Pixel 3a replacement stopped working so I was told to send it back for another replacement handset, which was promptly sent to me. I contacted the customer services team a week later who confirmed by email they'd received my old phone so imagine my surprise when I was charged the full Eur 399 for its non-receipt. And for the last 12 days I've been getting a standard response to my emails. I understand that an \"engineer\" can't inspect my old handset if they can't find it, but surely that's not on me. Anyone else had this problem? Anyone had a positive resolution? Google warranty and customer service are abominable.",
