    "content": "Hi all, hope you are safe and taking care of yourselves during these days. \n\nLong story short: I have bought my Pixel 3 XL in Jan 2019 in Media Markt Germany, warranty goes until 2021. Last Friday my Pixel died. It stuck, I try to restart it pressing Power button + volume down, it shutdown but never turned it on again. I took it to a random repair shop here, they tested the battery and it seems that is not taking proper amperage or something like that. Anyways, phone won't turn on again. \n\nI was contacting MediaMarkt but they told me to contact Google so can I ship the Pixel back or something like since I live in Poland and not in Germany. I tried to contact Google via Twitter (@MadeByGoogle). Here is the answer:\n\n\"Thanks for the info. It looks like you're currently in a location where we have limited support options. Please note that we offer warranty support only in countries where we sell devices. You can get in touch with our team directly when you're back in a country where we sell Pixel phones or ask a friend (in a country where we sell devices) to do so on your behalf by clicking on “Contact Us” in the bottom of this page: https://goo.gle/2Eqys1z Appreciate your understanding.\"\n\nAnyways, my question is: how to do it? Google tells me I need to get back to Germany so I can get support. It should be simple, no? Give me an address, I will ship and that's it. \n\nAny help or clues? Hope I was clear enough. \nThanks all!",
