    "content": "Ever since I installed the Android 11 update last Tuesday, my phone has gotten progressively worse. The first two days, I just had a screen flicker when I would press the power button to look at the screen. \n\nStarting on Friday, my phone randomly rebooted twice in a row in the afternoon and has been doing it more frequently the past few days to the point where sometimes I can't even listen to a full song on Spotify without it rebooting. Some of my apps have been starting to crash as well. \n\nHas anyone tried a factory reset and has it solved your issues? I don't think it's third-party app related and my phone was running fine until this update. I'm quite frustrated with Google for turning my phone into an unusable brick essentially and would like to solve this problem rather than waiting for them to issue another update that might not even work.",
