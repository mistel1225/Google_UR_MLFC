    "content": "The WiFi in my house is usually pretty good, and works on other devices all over the house. I used to have a Pixel 3a and this connected fine. I just got the 4a and I can only connect to WiFi in one room - in the other rooms, it has poor signal and constantly disconnects. My mum also has a new phone (a Samsung) and it's doing the same thing. Does anyone know what the problem could be?",
