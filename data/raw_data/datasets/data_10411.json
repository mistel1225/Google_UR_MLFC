    "content": "Okay this has been happening the last few days. I start talk texting a text message and about halfway through it erases the first 10 words so I have to stop talking erase the whole thing and start all over. Why is it erasing the first 10 to 12 words?   This has happened I would say eight times in the last two days.   So now I have to be careful before hitting send just in case half the message hasn't been deleted. Can't understand why my phone is deleting half of my message.",
