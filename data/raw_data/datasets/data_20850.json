    "content": "My practically brand new Pixel 4 keeps disconnecting from mobile data/service, leaving me unable to do anything internet related unless I'm on wifi, put my Sim card in my old pixel 2 xl and it works just fine. Airplane toggle brings service and lte back for 30 seconds to a minute, then it's back to no service. I've tried restarting, turning off, waiting then turning back on, booting up in safe mode, holding the power button for a solid minute making the phone turn on and off repeatedly, leaving the phone off for an hour, taking the sim out and putting it back in, resetting network settings, renaming apn, everything I can think of save for a factory reset. Activated phone on may 29th, 2020, and the problem popped up after a system update I got on the 30th, got it to go away and it came back today, june 3rd 2020. Any help is appreciated, I'd like to avoid the hassle of having to return it being the first phone I've paid for outright",
