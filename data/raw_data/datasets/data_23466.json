    "content": "I am not able to play any video on my phone ! YouTube or any other app even the videos i records . The phone gets lag and then freezes for 5 second and restart by itself . I haven't installed big apps yet only basic ones . I think the problem must be in the GPU or so,  i tried to factory reset i downloaded all the updates nothing seems to work . What should i do !?\n\nUpdate ( i can use YouTube with no problem but only through Firefox browser ) .",
