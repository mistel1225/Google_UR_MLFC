    "content": "Every so often the screen on my pixel 2 stops working altogether, just blacking out while the rest of the phone works fine. After some time, the screen will start working again seemingly at random with no lingering signs of issues. I have tried rebooting, force booting, and recovery mode, but none of those options have worked. I have yet to try a factory reset but would like to see if there are any other options I can try before that.",
