    "title": "Pixel 2 XL call screen transcription & audio are terrible",
    "content": "Whenever I use Call Screen to answer a call the transcription it generates is useless, makes no sense, and is obviously incomplete. After the call when I listen to the recorded audio upon which the transcription was based I find the audio quality horrible. I most often can’t even make out what is being said. If this is the audio Call Screen is trying to transcribe, there’s no question why it’s struggling.\n\nHas anyone else encountered this problem? Are there any settings I can tweak to improve the audio quality? Is this a known limitation of the feature or the Pixel 2XL? Any help would be greatly appreciated because the feature is basically useless with the current quality of the audio.\n\nThanks!",
