    "content": "Hi\n\nI have a Rode Smartlav+ that been working fine but ever since I changed my phone to Google Pixel 4a I've experienced that the audio recording is skipping a few seconds here and there, It almost seems that the recording is fast-forwarding some parts and make it inaudible. Is this something you have records of happening to more people with Pixel 4a? Any ideas or tips to fix this issue? I just bought a new smartlav+ so it's not a hardware issue from the microphone. It has the same fault.",
