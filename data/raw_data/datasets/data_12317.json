    "content": "While doing a hard reset on my Pixel 4 I'm getting an error code like this:\n\nFormatting /Data...\nFormatting /metadata...\nWiping Titan M\nE:can't send spi message: Try again\nE:can't send spi message: Try again\nE:can't send spi message: Try again\nData wipe complete\n\nI've never seen this before while doing a hard reset on any device until now. Does this mean something is corrupt? Is it actually wiping the data? \nAfterwards when I reboot it acts as of it has been reset, I have to go through the process of setting it up for the first time like normally done after a reset.",
