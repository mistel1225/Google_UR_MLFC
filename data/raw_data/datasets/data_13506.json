    "title": "Pixel 3a Can't answer calls from lock screen",
    "content": "I haven't seen any suggested fixes. Two requests similar to mine got no responses, but replies have been disabled for those requests.\n\nWhen I get a call, I have to unlock the screen before I can answer it.  I've tried swiping down, swiping up, and swiping sideways. There is no \"Respond\" icon. If I unlock the screen, then I can can swipe down to see the Respond icon. \n\nThis might not be a big problem if the fingerprint sensor worked reliably. As if is, I have to carefully clean my index finger, then I try the fingerprint sensor; it says my fingerprint is not recognized (four times), then I enter the unlock sequence, and swipe down. By that time, the caller usually has hung up.",
