    "content": "For the last couple of days I have been having multiple issues with my messaging. When friends/family send long texts or images it says that I must download but then never does. In group texts I have also gotten the messages in the wrong order and much later than they were originally sent. \n\nI have tried force stopping and cleaning out the cache but nothing has worked. And now because it does not download it says I have unread messages. \n\nAnyone else having this issue? Any advice on how to fix it?",
