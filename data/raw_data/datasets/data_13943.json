    "content": "Hello,\nI have recently upgraded from a Pixel 2 to a Pixel 5.\nSince the switch I have observed that I can't seem to get a LTE Advanced connection (T-Mobile Germany) anymore.\nIt does not seem to be a problem with the carrier since I have tried putting the same SIM-card first into the Pixel 2 and then into the Pixel 5: I have even put the phones in exactly the same spot in my house... the Pixel 2 immediately shows the LTE+ symbol whereas the Pixel 5 only shows LTE and never switches to LTE+ (tried this several times). Download speeds are also significantly slower on the Pixel 5 (tested with Ookla Speedtest App; Pixel 2 with LTE+ about 30-35 Mbps, Pixel 5 with LTE about 12-15 Mbps).\nDoes anyone have an idea how to fix this?",
