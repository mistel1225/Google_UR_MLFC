    "content": "I have assistant set up to respond to my initial command but I don't hear assistant on my phone and the only reason selection is no device. I would like to hear the question I have entered for the next input from me on my phone but I never hear assistant say anything on the phone or there is no way to select nvidia shield or chromecast on my shield TV that is built in as a matter of fact I have only 1 choice no device",
