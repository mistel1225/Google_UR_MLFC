    "title": "Audio will not play on car speakers when plugged in via USB cable",
    "content": "This started after updating to Android 11.\n\nWhen plugged in via USB to my car, Android auto starts up and everything will display on the car screen (including maps and what song is playing), but music will only play via phone speakers. When I try to switch the audio output device, my car speakers do not appear as an option. No matter what I try, I can't get audio to play on the car speakers when it is plugged in.\n\nAudio WILL play on car speakers IF connected over Bluetooth and not plugged in. But then I cannot display maps on the car screen.\n\nI've tried restarting everything, uninstalling/reinstalling everything, unpairing/repairing my phone and car, resetting to factory settings, trying new USB cables etc. Also spent 1.5 hours with Google customer support trying literally all the same things, and nothing worked.\n\nHas anyone else experienced this and/or know of a fix?",
