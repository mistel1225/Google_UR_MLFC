    "title": "How do I fix my Pixel 1 which immediately disconnecting from a saved wifi network (over and over)?",
    "content": "My Pixel 1 has multiple saved wifi networks. Occasionally it will have a problem connecting to any network, where if I tap a saved network it will go through the obtaining/authenticating IP address, connecting, and connected steps all in a half second before disconnecting. I don't have a problem with some other networks, airplane mode is off, while restarting the phone, turning off wifi for a while, and forgetting/reconnecting to the network doesn't help. I would prefer not to have to do a factory reset At this point I just wait an hour at least and it fixes itself, but I would like to not have this problem at all.\n\nThanks in advance for any help or advice.",
