    "content": "I had recently joined the Android 12 Beta Program and installed Android 12 on my Pixel (The first Beta release), I really liked it but regrettably I had to go back to Android 11, because an app (DJI Fly) simply wouldn't work on the Android 12 Beta.\nSo I un-enlisted my device and got the notification, that I could go back to Android 11. I backed up everything (it said that I would loose all data on the phone), then I downloaded the update, but I didn't restart my device, I wanted to do that in the morning, in case I had issues.\nLong story short the next morning I woke up and my Pixel was dead (the battery had ran out), I plugged it in to the charger and waited a bit. After 5 minutes i long pressed the Power button, and my Pixel turned on, the white screen with the \"Google\" logo appeared, as per usual. But then it didn't go away. I waited for an hour or more. I tried to go to the fastboot menu (which worked) and tried every option there. NO MATTER WHAT I DID, MY PHONE WOULD GET STUCK ON THE WHITE SCREEN WITH THE GOOGLE LOGO.\nI really need my phone, and I hope this can be fixed. I would prefer to fix it myself, as I bought the phone via Amazon UK, because Google doesn't have a shop in Slovenia, where I live. So I imagine sending it back would be a hassle.",
