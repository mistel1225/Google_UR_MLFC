    "content": "This happens whether the lock screen is on or off. But sometimes it only beeps once but many times it beeps twice one time right after the other. More so when the screen is off. I have to wait until after the second beep to pose my question. This is absolutely driving me crazy and I can't find any help in any of the forums I went into. This has been going on for months!",
