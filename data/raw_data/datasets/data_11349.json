    "content": "My brand new pixel 4a wont turn on and take charge. There is completely black screen. Upon getting the new phone, it did turn on and i was able to charge it to 100 % and  transfer data from my old phone to the new phone. After the battery was charged to 100 %, i disconnected the cable from the wall socket. As i started using the device then, it randomly turned off. After few tries the phone charged again from 0 % and when it charged to around 50 %, i disconnected the charger and turned on the phone and it shows 100 % charge(very strange). Upon using the device for 5 mins it agaim turned off randomly and now it does not turn on nor does it take any charge. I tried all troubleshooting steps as stated by Google. No success. This may be a hardware issue i guess. Now i am left with nothing but a brick",
