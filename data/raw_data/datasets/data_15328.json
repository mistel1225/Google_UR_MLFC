    "content": "I have the Verizon unlimited plan and a Google Pixel 3. my Google pixel just informed me that I just went over my data limit. \n\nI'm assuming that my phone set a data limit even though it shouldn't have. I was just hoping to contact somebody from Google to talk about it to make sure I'm not being overcharged. I contacted Verizon and they said I will not be overcharged.",
