    "content": "So I was having trouble with the camera on my old phone (pixel 3a XL) so I contacted google support and exchange for a new one, which is the same version phone. So once I got it I was in the process of transferring all of my data and everything into the new one. I have google fi and I finally activated my new phone under the account but it seems like I have a different number. is there a way to get back my old phone number into my new phone?",
