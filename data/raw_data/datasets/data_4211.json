    "content": "I used Android Auto yesterday and today for the first time in several months. Even though I've driven several hundred miles away from home, the weather location is stuck on my hometown. I checked app permissions, and they are set to allow location while using the app. I flipped the Weather setting off and on inside AA, cleared app storage, uninstalled updates, and updated again. I turned my phone's location off and on, and rebooted my phone. For a different issue two days ago, I flashed the full factory image to my device and reset it, so everything should be fresh. Location seems to work fine in all other apps. What else can I do?",
