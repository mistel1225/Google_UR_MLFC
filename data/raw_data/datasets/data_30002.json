    "content": "I have issue with ringing volume. While playing media it's speaker is quite good but when it comes to ringtone, while someone calling it's sounds to be so low. Then I notice that while phone rings it will only use single speaker. So I tried to find how to turn on sterio speaker but I couldn't find that option in settings. If anyone know how to fix this issue please help me......",
