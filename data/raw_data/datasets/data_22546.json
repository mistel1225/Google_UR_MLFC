    "content": "Frozen at G screen. Attempts to rescue or recovery mode only yield dead android logo at “No command”.  This phone is brand new ! Google support can only suggest factory reset which wipes out some irreplaceable  photos just taken. Must be some way to get photos off phone. Since it’s brand new I didn’t have time to backup.",
