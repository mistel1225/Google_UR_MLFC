    "content": "This is the second time I've factory reset my phone. The first time (about 4 months ago) worked great and my phone wasn't having any problems. Last night I accidentally l charged it overnight (bad for the battery I've heard) and it froze again. Went through bootloader/recovery mode/safe mode at least 10 times with no significant results then decided to factory reset. Now I'm stuck just trying to set up my phone again and freezing before I can even put in a Wifi password.",
