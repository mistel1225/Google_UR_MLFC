    "title": "What are my out of warranty repair solutions for my Pixel 2 XL in Switzerland?",
    "content": "I have contacted \"Ctdi\" for a repair (Authorized Google repair) but they can only serve customers in the EU (Switzerland is not in EU).\nI have searched the community for help but to no avail. There is a page that lists the pixel repair places around the world but I get a 404 not found. A few posts link this page so it would be useful. Its title is \"get your pixel fixed out of warranty\".\nI used the chat on my Pixel  to get in contact with support, they said they would get back to me in 24-48 hours, 1 week later, no answer.\nI have contacted the store I bought my phone but they have not answered yet.\nAnyone have a similar experience?\n\nRegards,\nNevin",
