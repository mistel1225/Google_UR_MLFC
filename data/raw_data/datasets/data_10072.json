    "title": "Google Service : Pixel 3 replacement under preferred care",
    "content": "I purchased a Google Pixel 3 in May 2019 and opted for Preferred care (basically, extended warranty for one more year). Suddenly, on 30th November 2020, the phone died on me and could not be restored even after several diagnostic steps advised by Google Support. Eventually, I was asked to contact the insurer to get replacement. \nOn the third day, I received the replacement phone and found it to be a refurbished one. But, even the refurbished phone turned out to be locked to an organization. So it couldn’t be set up.\nThis was  week before last. Since then, we have been on the phone with Google almost every evening. However, they couldn’t replace the phone even though it is a routine process.   It has been 2 weeks and Google was telling they have \"escalated\" my issue. \n\nI want suggestions what should be my next step forward.",
