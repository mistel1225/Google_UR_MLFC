    "title": "Dual SIM - 2nd SIM not receiving phone calls consistently",
    "content": "I have a Pixel 3a and recently activated the eSIM to get a 2nd phone number. I am able to make phone calls using both my original number / physical SIM and new number / eSIM without any problems, but I cannot receive phones on the eSIM consistently (it will send them straight to voicemail). Interestingly, if I restart the phone or inactivate/reactivate the eSIM, the eSIM will work (ie. be able to receive calls) until I use the physical SIM again to make or receive a call - after that the eSIM will not be able to receive calls until I repeat the restart or inactivate/reactivate it. All in all is seems like the Dual SIM Dual Standby is not working correctly. Does anyone know how to fix this?",
