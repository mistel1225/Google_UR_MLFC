    "content": "Admittedly, there is a bit of damage on the pixel 2 but I haven't seen anything like this before, my screen is completely off, it won't respond, won't turn on when charging, however, my alarms in the morning still go off on the same phone, I have no idea how to fix this and this hasn't seemed to have been a problem before",
