    "content": "My Pixel 3 is about 3 months old. Recently when the battery levels gets to about 15% or 14%, it suddenly drains down to zero in like 15 seconds...like watching a count down as the percentage levels drops 1% each second.   \n\nIt doesn't happen when I have a particular app running, but just when the battery level gets to that 15% or 14% level.  Otherwise the battery drains at a steady and reasonable rate, until it gets to the 15% or 14% level, then it counts down and drops to 0% and shutsdown really quickly.  \n\nThank you anybody and everybody for your help.",
