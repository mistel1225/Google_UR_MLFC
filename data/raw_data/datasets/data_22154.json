    "content": "Okay so my Pixel XL stopped working about 6 months ago. It had weird battery problems, but I didn’t think much of it until it was too late. It would always drain or “die” and then when I turned it back on it would be at like 50%.\nWell the last time, it died on like 20, and it never came back on. I tried charging it, holding the power button, doing all the volume combos and everything. No response. I contacted support and they said they wouldn’t replace/ fix it for me because it’s too old. So I replaced it with a 3 after, and then eventually lost the original.\n\nI was cleaning my room today and found the XL, and low and behold, it still doesn’t work.\nWtf causes this, and is there any way I can get it to work again? I have a lot of data on there that I can’t access and I really hope it’s not lost forever.",
