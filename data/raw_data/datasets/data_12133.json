    "content": "In order for Chrome split-screen to be useful, I need to be able to type in text fields, but ever since phone updated to Android 11, Gboard does not appear in Chrome split-screen mode, so I obviously cannot type. Seems like a bug. Anyone else had this problem? Any solutions? Should I post this in the Chrome forum?",
