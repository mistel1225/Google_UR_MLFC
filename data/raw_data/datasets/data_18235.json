    "content": "Ok, here is a hole day of troubleshooting.  Problem 1 - we don't have good cellphone reception in our area, but we have fibre internet, so I need to activate my WiFi calling.  Problem 2 - when selecting the WiFi calling the toggle switch turns blue (activated) for a split second, and then grey again, connects with my service provider, gives me an access code to activate the function and tells me from my service provider that the WiFi calling is activated, BUT it is STILL NOT active on my phone.  So took my phone to my service provider because I figured it must be the provider because the phone works fine otherwise.    We did:\n1.We checked and made sure that I have the newest software update (Android 10)\n2.We switched out the sim card\n3. We uninstalled the phone software and updated it again\n4.  We put my sim card in a Samsung, and it worked!!!\n5. Google still wants to tell me that it is my service provider which is at fault.\n\nThrough the whole process, I can see on my account and my provider can see on their side that my WiFi calling is activated!!!\n\nI want my phone to be switched out, because this is clearly a phone problem and not a provider problem.",
