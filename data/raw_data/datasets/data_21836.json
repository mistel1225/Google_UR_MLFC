    "content": "My Pixel 2 used to restart only when I use the camera with the battery at below 30% but now it also restarts when I play videos or stories from Facebook or Instagram. I have no idea what to do and I really love my phone so I haven't really done anything to try to fix it because I'm worried that I might make the issue worse.",
