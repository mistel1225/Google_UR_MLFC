    "content": "Hi,\nI have a Verizon Pixel 3XL, and through the Android developer website, I enrolled my Pixel for the Android Q beta program. I received the update within 24 hours and when I am trying to update my phone, it says system update installing and the progress bar is stuck at 0%. The update also keeps pausing. I have tried rebooting my phone many times, but it does not work. What can I do?\nThanks",
