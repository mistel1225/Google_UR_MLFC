    "content": "I'm Japanese. I'd like to buy the pixel stand, GA00507-JP, in Japan, but we cannot get it in our country anymore since the Google store in Japan finished to sell it. Now I'm trying to get the USA model of pixel stand, GA00507-US, however, I couldn't find the power supply information about it. The Hertz between the US and Japan are different, one is 60Hz, the other is 50Hz. Actually, the west side of Japan is 60Hz, but I live in east side of Japan whose Hz is 50. If I bought the US model of pixel stand, can I use it in other countries whose Hz is 50 like Japan or other European area? Is something related to the Hz written in the instruction manual of the pixel stand of the US model? Please see the attached picture for your reference, in case of our country, the information of the Hz is described like the picture. ",
