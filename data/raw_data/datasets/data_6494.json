    "content": "I thought this might be caused by wifi calling, t mobile doesn't support it, so I ensured it was turned off. I have restarted my phone, but issue came up again less than 24 hrs later.  This actually occurs two different ways.  I get a call and it drops - I hit redial and immediately get a call dropped message.  I can clear the screen and hit it again and it will do the same.  If I go to my contacts and dial, the call will go through.\nAlso, if i try to dial via the button in VM (Visual VM), I sometimes get the same result.",
