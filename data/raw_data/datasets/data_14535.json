    "content": "I have cleared my cache and backed up and removed files that may be slowing the phone down. I have restarted my phone and applied regular updates.\nThe phone turns off from time to time but recently it has been constantly freezing, pressing different symbols on the keypad when writing messages and ends my calls in the middle of conversations,even when I have full reception.",
