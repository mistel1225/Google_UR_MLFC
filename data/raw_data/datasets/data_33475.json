    "content": "Bought a pixel 3 and stand this week. It used to charge rapidly with the stand and now will only charge really slow. This morning I woke up and it had charged 24% overnight. I have tried restarting the phone, and unplugging and replugging in the stand. My phone has a case but it is one that wireless charging is supposed to work well with. Any ideas of what I should try next?",
