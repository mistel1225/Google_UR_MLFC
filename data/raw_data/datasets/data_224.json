    "title": "Google pixel 2 Factory Reset bypassing pin phone locked",
    "content": "Hi -\n\nI recently bought a Google Pixel off of OfferUp (app) and i am trying to set it up and when i try, its asking for the Pin from the last owner? I tried to do a factory reset and it still says it needs the previous pin? i noticed when i did the factory reset that it said PHONE STATUS: LOCKED. So i'm not really sure if that means anything or if im doing something wrong. Does anybody have any suggestions on how to bypass this or reset the phone to its original settings. Again, i already did the wipe data/reboot. Anything you guys can recommend that i try would be greatly appreciated!!! I bought the phone for my son and i thought he locked himself out of it when setting it up or maybe hit the wrong button.\n\nPlease help!!?",
