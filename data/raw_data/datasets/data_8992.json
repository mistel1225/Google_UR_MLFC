    "content": "I had the known battery problem with my Pixel 4 XL. I went through the usual customer service avenues and my phone was sent to a Google centre in Poland. I was told after they received the phone I would be sent a replacement within 1-2 working days. The phone was received and signed for in Poland on November 30 2020. It’s now January 6th 2021 and I have no phone. I do have a lot of identical emails telling me they are still waiting for an answer from the higher tier of support and thanking me for my patience. I received another identical email this morning. The phone has obviously been lost and no one will take responsibility for it. Meanwhile there appears to be a brick wall between me and someone with some authority to put this right.\nI’m in my 50’s and can honestly say I’ve never had such terrible, thoughtless, uncaring customer support in my life. For a company like Google it is disgusting. I have a houseful of Google products and this is my 3rd Google phone. They will never receive another order for anything from me. You’d have to be mad to go back for more after this level of incompetence.\nWhat now though? I’ve basically been robbed. How do you climb the brick wall of indifference at Google?",
