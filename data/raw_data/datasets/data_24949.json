    "content": "I recently backed up and factory reset my phone to have it repaired. When I tried to restore the backup, only my contacts and apps were restored. The Backup page in Settings -> System -> Backup says App Data, Call History, Device Settings, and SMS Text Messages are all still \"waiting to back up...\" and have been for over an hour. Did I just lose all my messages and phone history?",
