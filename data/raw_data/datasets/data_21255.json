    "content": "Imagine being a trillion dollars market cap company and selling phones to consumers that have so many bugs that you want to break it since the day you bought it for $1000 brand new. Usb-c audio doesn't work, giant white line on side of screen, black dot from dead pixels growing everyday, audio turning up and down on its own. I could list more, but this should be sufficient. I hope people see this post and heed my warning. We the consumers need to take control and not buy this crap so maybe they will learn to treat their consumers right by sacrificing a couple dollars in revenue to create a phone that works properly because it cost so much or be willing to own up to their mistakes.",
