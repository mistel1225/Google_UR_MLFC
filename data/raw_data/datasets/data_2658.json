    "title": "Battery on Pixel 4 drains more quickly when away from home - why?",
    "content": "My wife and I have identical Pixel 4 phones, including settings.  When at home both can stay charged above 90% for a day or two with no usage.  However, we have both seen the battery charge drop 35% overnight with no use when we travel to our favorite places.  Both phones have all power saving settings turned on.  Since there is spotty cell coverage in these places I wonder if the phone has to work harder trying to connect to a network, thus draining the battery.  Or, is there another explanation and suggestion as to how to prevent this from happening?",
