    "content": "Here's a chat for the 4 issues that i've been facing for ever since I bought the Pixel 3 and has never been addressed\nThe phone was repaired by Google twice, and the issue still exist.\nHere's a detailed level chat with the support specially on the battery drain\n\nThe google engg team says my phone is draining 9% in 15 mins and the standard is 15% in 15 mins.\nWhich means, my phone will drain 90% in 150 mins\nSo, roughly i'll have to charge my phone every 3 hours :) \nand google says, its within standard limits.\n\nP.S --> Is this your standard ? @google ?\n\nThis discussion was on one of the issues\n\nThe real concerns are\n\n1) Phone Heats up --> Google expects the phone to burn on the table.\n2) WiFi Drops --> all my other devices have normal connectivity \n3) Battery Drains --> the above explanation speaks for itself\n4) Phone Flickers --> For an incoming call, the buttons don't work, and the important calls are missed, just because it doesn't allow me to pickup the call.\n\nGoogle TOLD THEY FIXED ALL OF THESE DURING THE FIRST REPAIR\n\nBut unfortunately, all the issues appeared again, and they fixed it again.\n\nNow the phone is with Google, since about a month and there's no update as such, in fact they don't have the issues listed on them at the first place.\nHere's the screen shot of the issues list on the website.",
