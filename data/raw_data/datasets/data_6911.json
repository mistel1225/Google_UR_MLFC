    "content": "I recently upgraded from Pixel 3 to Pixel 5. But Hey Google or Ok Google doesn't work on my new Pixel 5. I've troubleshooter and ensured that Voice Match, Assistant etc is all turned on. With both my Pixel 3 & 5 sitting side my side, all settings are the same. When I say Hey Google, my Pixel 3 assistant responds but nothing happens on my Pixel 5. So frustrating :(\n\nTakes all the fun out of upgrading to a new Pixel.",
