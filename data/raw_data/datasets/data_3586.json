    "content": "İ have noticed two line like objects in my photos today i looked back at my old ones and it seemed to have appeared two days ago. I've tried restarting and cleaning the lens, they haven't been any help. I'm questioning if something somehow got into my lens but that seems impossible. İt is definitely something about the camera rather than the screen because it only appears on the rear camera, the front cameras do not have it. You can see it on the right side of the photo in the attachment below. When İ zoom in it goes away to the side, which means its something about the lens i suppose. Please help me",
