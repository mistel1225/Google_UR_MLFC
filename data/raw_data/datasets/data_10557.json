    "content": "Google says they gave the package to FedEx. FedEx says they never received it. I've been trying to work with Google Store support for three weeks now to get the phone. Asked them to cancel the order since I was able to place another order and already received while support was trying to figure this out. I've asked them to cancel and refund my money for over a week now. \n\nGoogle Store Support is so slow. I've called, they escalated, three weeks later no resolution. Called and they say just respond to the email. I respond to the email and they just reply that they are working on it. That's the message for three weeks. \n\nCan anyone help with this? How do I escalate this to someone who can actually do something?",
