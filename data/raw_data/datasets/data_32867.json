    "content": " am a T-Mobile customer and have been since before the G!.  I was actually beta tester for it and have been a loyal Android user since that time, I think it is a shame that I should have to constantly switch carriers every time Google comes out with a straight Google Phone.  I went to Samsung after Google moved strictly to Verizon.  I refuse to spend  $1500 on a new phone that Samsung is pushing.  Apple started this high price garbage now Samsung and all the bloatware is following along.  I want a Google phone but I don't want to be forced to switch carriers or have to purchase an unlocked phone.  T-Mobile was willing to take a chance on the G1 but now Google has abandoned them.  I am a visually impaired user and on a fixed income so I have to stick with my current plan but can not get the one phone I truly want.  Google is starting to alienate some of its fiercest defenders in the blind community, we do not want to swap carriers every few years due to exclusivity contracts.",
