    "content": "As a store owner, I have kept a dedicated Nokia Android phone for our Clients. All my clients contacts & addresses are saved/organised (citywise & areawise, the way I want it). Now this phone is also used by couple of my employees. And, at times, they tend to mess things up and unorganise my contacts database. I want them to have access to this contacts database but I donâ€™t want them to edit/add any contacts.\n\nHow can I do it ?",
