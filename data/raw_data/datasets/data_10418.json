    "content": "Hi just a question about pixel 5 and Bose deal, I purchased the pixel 5 from the Google store on the 18th oct, one day before the promotion ran out. Delivery is expected Nov 17th, so if it gets delivered on that day, is it 14 to 45 days after purchase, or 14 to 45 days after delivery.  Oh and why can't Google state when your purchasing the delivery time before you purchase. Thanks",
