    "content": "I've got a Pixel 2 XL (which didn't show up on device list for some reason) and miss the AOD animation from Oreo. Pie just ruined it for us. Is there a way for me to be able to use the Pixel 3 AOD on a Pixel 2?\n\n\nThere is a way to do this using Magisk, but I'd rather not compromise my phone by rooting it. I just don't see the reason as to why Google doesn't give us a better animation on tbe AOD.",
