    "content": "For a couple weeks now I have been only getting notifications when I connect my phone to WIFI. I didn't change any settings or anything before this started happening so not sure how to fix the issue and haven't found anything on here to help solve this issue. I get all my notifications all at once so I am missing important things throughout the day because of this. Please help!",
