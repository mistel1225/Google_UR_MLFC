    "content": "I received an email from AT&T that they're dropping 3g and that my phone won't work anymore when that happens. I thought my Pixel 3A XL was 4g compatible. I came across a suggestion to switch to 4g in the Settings - Network & Internet - Mobile Network - Preferred Network type. I only can switch from 3g to LTE, there is no 4g to chose from.\nAm I screwed?",
