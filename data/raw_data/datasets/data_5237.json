    "content": "For the last two weeks (roughly), Google Assistant on my 4a 5G has been cutting me off in the middle of my commands every single time I use it.\n\nI'll try to set a reminder and it'll cut off on the \"in...\" and then add that to the title while asking me for the time (even though I said it).\n\nI'll try to set an alarm and it cuts off after \"wake me up\", and then asks me for a time (even though I said \"...at X\".\n\nWeirdly, it works perfectly fine on my Nest Mini. I've changed absolutely zero settings on my devices. It just randomly started happening a couple weeks ago.\n\nI can't actually use GA on my phone because of this issue. And I used to use it extensively, so this is incredibly frustrating.",
