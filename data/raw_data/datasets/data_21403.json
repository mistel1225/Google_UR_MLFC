    "content": "So I about 9 months ago I bought my Pixel 2, and put it in a case right away. Recently I noticed that bottom left part of the screen lifted off, and isn't glued to the frame anymore. The phone has never been disassembled, I don't even remember dropping it actually. Tried heating the glass and putting it back in place, but it doesn't work. Any chance I could get that fixed?",
