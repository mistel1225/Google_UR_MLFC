    "title": "Pixel 4a won't play music files - tried both Google media player and RocketPlayer.",
    "content": "This is a new phone; I transferred a lot of mp3 files from my old device and while I can see the files, the phone won't play them.  I thought that maybe they got corrupted in the transfer so I side-loaded a song separately and while it seems that all the metadata is there, that song won't play either.  Is there a setting somewhere I'm missing?  I've tried my typical Rocket Player as well as the media player that came on the phone to no avail.  Please help!",
