    "title": "After Android 11 update Chrome displays \"No internet connection\" banner, pages stuck \"offline\"",
    "content": "Updated to Android 11, had multiple problems that I've found fixes for here. One that I can't find, though, is happening more frequently now.\nSince the update I've constantly had a banner at the top of my Chrome browser that says \"No internet connection.\" I can navigate anywhere, read anything, there are obviously both functional Fi and WiFi connections (it says this at the top of my browser currently). The only use problem seems to be that if I stay on a page too long or close chrome it automatically saves an offline copy and becomes useless, I can't navigate from that saved page.",
