    "content": "My phone is crashing when I try to unlock it. It becomes unresponsive and crashes/restarts, I've tried turning it on in safe mode as well with no success. \n\nI encountered this problem just over a week ago and was able to fix it with a device reset, but the problem just came back seemingly at random.",
