    "content": "I have been using my Pixel 3 XL on Xfinity Mobile for about 10 months. Recently, my phone started going directly to voicemail without ringing. Xfinity says they dont support the Pixel 3 as a BYOD and can't help. However, I found that if I change my default phone app to YouMail instead of the standard Android Phone app, calls ring as they should. It appears that the problem is associated with the latest Android Phone app.\n\nHas anyone else had a similar problem? Thanks.",
