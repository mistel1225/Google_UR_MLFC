    "content": "Both my partner and I have had Pixel phones since the original Pixels came out. We recently moved into a new house and we're using the exact same modem/router setup from the old house (Cox). Now, we are not able to open certain 3rd party apps on our phones, which appear frozen but if you wait 1+ minutes, it will load. I have tried all the usual troubleshooting; forced re-start, reset all WiFi/Network/Bluetooth setting, restarting modem/router, system/security updates, speed test (350 down, 48 up) etc. If I turn WiFi off, I have no problems at all. In fact, everything works perfectly on other WiFi's, just not my home WiFI. I have dual band, I have tried both 2.5 and 5 channels with no difference. The Wifi works fine on my other devices, such as home computer, tablets, and TVs. I can't seem to find any answer. Interestingly, I pulled out my original Google Pixel and it has the same issue with latency around 3rd party apps as our 3A's? Could it be the Pixel OS and compatibility issues with my modem/router? And why all of a sudden? Any ideas or support would be awesome, thanks! \n\nModem: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0781VN7W5/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1\n\nRouter: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06X9CPC45/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1",
