    "title": "Why is my Pixel 2 battery life suddenly terrible?",
    "content": "I have a Pixel 2, purchased right when it came out. I used to have amazing battery life (the estimated usage time would show as almost two days), but in the past month or so it had started to drop like a rock. \n\nNow, the estimated time on a full charge shows as 9 hours, but the phone has been crashing when it reaches 40% (after maybe 5-6 hours). This crash forces an endless reboot loop until the phone settles on the \"charge me\" symbol. Needless to say, 40% is hardly dead and shouldn't force a shutdown.\n\nI have yet to try a factory reset. Before I take that step, I wanted to see if anyone else has experienced this issue and if a factory reset fixed the problem. I have already tried putting the phone in Airplane Mode, Battery Saver Mode, and have checked the app power usage, and nothing seems amiss. The drain issues persist.\n\nAny ideas? Is the battery just gonzo? Is it possible to get it replaced anywhere? The phone is otherwise in perfect condition, so getting a new phone just because of a bad battery seems ridiculous.",
