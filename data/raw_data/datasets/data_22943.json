    "content": "I've had the phone for less than a week and it keeps randomly restarting on me. This is my second factory reset and I'm starting to get annoyed. Is this happening to anyone else?\n\nThere's a slight rattle when I tap the screen hard so I'm wondering if something is loose in there. \n\nThe issue appears to happen when I'm in an app for a bit. The phone is a little warm to the touch so I'm wondering if it's overheating.",
