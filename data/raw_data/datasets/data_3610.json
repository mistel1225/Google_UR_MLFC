    "content": "I bought a pixel 4a from US. Turns out it is not accepting any physical SIM when I try to use it in India. \n\nFrom what I am able to check is that I have a G025J model. Does it limit my use of physical SIM in anyway ?\n\nIs it something that can be fixed manually? Or does Google support assure a repair/return policy on this device ?",
