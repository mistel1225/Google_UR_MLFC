    "content": "Hi, \n\nI bought my pixel 2 XL from https://www.etoren.com/ on 9 March, 2018. When the phone arrived in Brazil it worked well on all carriers. \n\nSo i traveled to Australia last month (April 2019) and have used my phone there with vodafone carrier, all good too, but when i came back to Brazil my pixel just does't connect with any carriers anymore. And checking it with my carrier i figured out that my phone is in a black list, and my IMEI was blocked by \"Canada - WIND Mobile Canada\" by lost or stolen.\n\nSo, I have the invoice and all docs about the phone purchase, i've contacted the etoren and they said that has no more warrant.\n\nPlease, can anyone help me?",
