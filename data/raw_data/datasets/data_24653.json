    "content": "Hello. I am using my iCloud account on my Google pixel, and therefore for Gmail. Today I had to reset my password for my apple ID, because a friend needed access for an old phone of mine, and then my email suddenly won't log in. It keeps telling me that there are configuration issues. So I try to login, and it tells me that my email or my password is incorrect. Then I went to dubblecheck my password for my email and I was what I was typing. Then I changed it so it fit together with my apple ID, and tried again. It still doesn't work. (I also checked it the port and the server is correct. Is is.) Then I updated my phone and still the same. It's driving me nuts, can you please.help me figure out what the issue is? \n\nKind regards Sofia Svea Buur BÃ¦kgaard.",
