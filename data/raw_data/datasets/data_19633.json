    "title": "Constant \"Google has stopped working\" error message pop ups with many apps crashing/not working",
    "content": "Hi I am getting constant ____ stopped working pop ups. Apps include Mint, Libby, Google, and Google Play Services. I uninstalled them. Apps like Netflix, Google Assistant, and certain Google services from the settings app won't open. I have rebooted in safe mode and the issue persisted. I have cleared storage and cache. Reinstalled all of these applications. I have removed my accounts from my phone. I have re updated Google and Google Play Services and nothing has worked. Now I'm unable to add my account back in to my phone and can't open many of my apps. Apparently there is no tech support line to call right now??? On top of that my voicemail has not been working properly with constant \"can't connect to voicemail\" error messages in the Phone app and several calls with Verizon have left me with no solution but to switch to Voxist which has worked okay. My Google Assistant also frequently fails to respond or hear voice commands...I've had nothing but problems and have had this phone for less than a year. I'm beyond frustrated but was denied a warranty replacement last time I called about these issues.",
