    "content": "The screen on my sister's Pixel 2 broke on Tuesday. The screen has gone completely black and the phone is now unusable. This is due to malfunction and there is no physical damage to the phone (it broke overnight). We have been trying to file a warranty claim but both the phone and text support on the warranty page are currently unavailable due to COVID-19. How/where can I submit a claim to get her a new phone?",
