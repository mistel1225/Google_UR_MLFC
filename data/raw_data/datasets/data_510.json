    "content": "I got my pixel 4a yesterday and i have experienced many issues with it. \n1. Its getting too hot sometimes while using which more than the normal amount of heating experienced from other phones.\n2. The front camera is taking the worst pictures. The pictures are too grainy and blurry. It is even worse when used in snapchat and whatsapp.\n3. Even at half of the full volume i felt big vibration on the backside.\nIs these problems common among other pixel 4a phones.? Should i return it? I have 4 days more of return period.",
