    "content": "This doesn't happen all the time.  I think it happens mostly when I'm using speaker phone, (which is often) but it's hard to say for sure.  Basically the call is fine at first, but then after a minute I can't hear the person on the other end, even though they can hear me fine.  Even if they call me back, the same thing happens again.  But then all the calls will be fine for a day.  I just got this phone last week so it's hard to say what's going on. Help!",
