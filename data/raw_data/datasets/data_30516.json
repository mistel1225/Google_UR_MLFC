    "title": "Touch screen problem within 1.5month of purchase, how do I get a replacement? India Support said NO",
    "content": "Within one and half month of purchase, the device started showing a touchscreen problem. Whenever we try to write the letter \"i\" it will not type \"i\" instead it would only type one letter to the left and one letter to the right.\n\nI called Google support in India. They did do a diagnostic test and confirmed the issue with the device, but when I asked for a replacement or refund, they refused to do that. They said, in India, there is no option of replacement or refund. Whereas it is written clearly in the warranty policy that replacement or refund is possible. When I showed her that then she started telling me that it is not there in India. \n\nI asked her how can the policy be different for India? on the website and in the document I received, it is written that it is possible.\n\nPlease help get the replacement or refund of my device. I have paid so much money, I am very happy with the device also but given that the device has come under a faulty category, please help get the replacement or refund.\n\nThanks & Regards,\nAnimesh",
