    "title": "Has anyone had their pixel buds blow out? Turned up the volume on a call and now righ just crackles.",
    "content": "I have a pair of new buds, and was turning the volume up on a quiet phone call, and the max volume 'tink tink' sound went off so loud that it hurt my ears, and ever since my right bud is crackling on all bass lines, even on the 2nd or 3rd lowest volumes.\n\nReally aggravating because it seems self induced by the bud's own tones. Any similar experiences?",
