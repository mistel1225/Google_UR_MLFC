    "content": "Hi, Iâ€™ve been using my new pixel 2 for about a week now (Android version 9). It was working fine up until yesterday when it turned off when I was making a video call to a friend on whatsapp. The phone restarted and I called them back, only for the same to happen after about 10-20 seconds. This then happened a further 4 times over the next ten minutes (on two of those occasions the screen froze and the phone made a high pitch sound which last a few seconds). Also, while all this was happening the battery was draining at a very fast rate (about 40% drain in 15 minutes). This was all happening when on 4g, though not sure that makes a difference. Anyone know what the problem is please?",
