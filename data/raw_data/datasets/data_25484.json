    "content": "Pixel 2, Verizon. Just updated to Android 10 and now when I hit the \"call\" button from Phone or Voice the screen freezes or quits the app. No control over the call, no buttons appear. Lasts 30-60 seconds and then call connects.\nSecond issue has only happened once, but when I put a call on speaker it crashed the app and dropped the call immediately. Like i hit the button from the in-call menu and then poof, straight to the home screen.\nI tried restarting the phone, problem remained the same.",
