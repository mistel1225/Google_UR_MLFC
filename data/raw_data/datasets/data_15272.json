    "content": "I currently have a new Pixel 4a phone and a 2018 Kia Niro.  According to Google's page https://support.google.com/androidauto/answer/6348019?hl=en,  the link says to find out if your car is compatible with android auto wireless.  Going to the link leads to the page https://www.android.com/auto/compatibility/ where I find my car's model listed.  I can get the wired AA to work, but I cannot get the wireless AA to work.  I made sure that option was turned on in the AA phone app too.  Please help.  My old Moto x4 was ALWAYS disconnecting from android auto, and I bought this new phone because Google states they both the phone and car are compatible with android auto wireless.",
