    "content": "I have gestures enabled and when I swipe from the bottom the screenshot and select features isn't available. If I change to the 3-button function then they are available. I want to keep using gestures and not the 3-button mode. Is there a solution for this as I would like to be able to close my screens and not leave them open?",
