    "title": "PIXEL 5 live streaming from front-camera always mirrored",
    "content": "Live streaming on front-facing camera on a Pixel 5 always shows the mirror image such that all the text/image is reversed. \n\nExample: https://ibb.co/FkrQf6n\n\nI understand this is to help users orient themselves and that for *SAVED* (not live) videos you can deselect \"Save selfie as previewed\" option. BUT, for LIVE streaming, it is always in reverse.  \n\nIs there a way to change both the 1) previewed video and the 2) streamed video as NON mirrored? \n\nThanks!",
