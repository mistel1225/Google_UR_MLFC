    "content": "I have update my phone recently from the Pixel 3XL to the Pixel 5 and have noticed that the quality of the images being taken on my new pixel 5 are terrible compared to my Pixel 3XL. I have checked the setting and everything is set to the best quality. Have tried both front and rear facing cameras. The issue is more with the front facing camera. There is less definition when taking the same picture with the 2 phones. Really disappointed as have been a Pixel owner from day 1 and the reason I am is for the picture quality.",
