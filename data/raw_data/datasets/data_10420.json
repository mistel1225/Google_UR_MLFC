    "content": "I have tried everything I could, restarted my phone several times, my latest system update was on 5th December 2020, I am using physical jio sim card. I want to make video calls without using any third party mobile application.\nAnother issue which I am facing is, I have jio fiber wifi connection which has provided me with a landline number, which I could use by jiovoice application but guess what? It is also not working. I can't make video calls on either of them. Really disappointed. Please help.",
