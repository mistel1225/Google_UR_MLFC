    "title": "Pixel 4a 5G Volume is sooooo Low!",
    "content": "Why is the volume levels so low on this device? I've read something about the volume levels were turned down in a December update, but this is ridiculous!!! Seriously, the ringing of the device is barely audible. When connected to blue tooth, even turned all the way up it's about half the volume level of other devices.\n\nWhat good is stereo speakers if you can barely hear what is being said?  And yes I have it turned it all the way up before someone comes along telling me to use the volume control, like it's my first device.\n\nThis absolutely needs to be fixed as there is no need to have the volume this low, none. If I had the engineering code, I would turn the volumes back up myself.\n\nI can not be only one that this is affecting.",
