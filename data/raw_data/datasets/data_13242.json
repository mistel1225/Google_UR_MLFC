    "content": "Google, please take note that having the ability to take a screenshot by long pressing the power button was VERY beneficial & easier than the now \"power button/volume down\" ability. That is very much going backwards in efficiency. I think Google would know this if they read the online forums & the concerns of Pixel users. That long pressing ability was one of the best things about Pixels.",
