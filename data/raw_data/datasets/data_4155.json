    "content": "Hello, I use Google calendar on my W10 computer and want to also use it on my Pixel 3a so I downloaded the Google calendar app to my Pixel 3a.\nI have roughly 25 different icons on my Pixel 3a \"home page\" but NOT the Google calendar icon.\nI CAN open Google calendar but ONLY if I go to the Google Play Store, locate the Google calendar app and click OPEN so my question is, how do I create a Google calendar icon on my Pixel 3a \"home screen\"?\nThank you\nBob",
