    "content": "I've had this phone for a month and I seem to keep having connection issues. I'm at a place where I had full signal with my previous phone on the same provider and I have no signal and keep getting no sms connection. I also have issues with receiving notifications for all my apps and I run a small business on my phone. I'm in wifi at the moment and it's still having problems.",
