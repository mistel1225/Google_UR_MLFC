    "content": "Shoot the horse!\nThat's that lamest & laziest solution every!\n\n(We at Google won't bother actually learning what your phones OS problem is, we'll just reset it because we don't care!)\n\nGoogle developed the Android OS and it's in-house line of Cellular phones. Google has all of the engineers, tools & knowledge to fix this ongoing issue that has followed every version of Pixel.\n\nUnfortunately, reseting/restarting a dumb appliance like a router has become a common pass time but no one complains because they generally don't lose any data that must be reloaded.\n\nReseting a phone that is loaded with personal data & app settings that must be painstakingly reloaded upon each next use is a frustrating & absurd nussance. What a huge waste of time!\n\nUpdate or just refresh the internet port drivers!\nIt's not a WiFi or Cellular (radio or firmware) problem, because I can individually switch off either of these and it will still have an intermittent data connection issue from the radio that's still on. So WTF?\n\nGive us/me a better solution. \nPlease forward these comments to the actual Pixel developer's team. Don't just lazily sit on this like you (tech support) have been doing for years now.\n\nTHIS IS STILL AN ACTIVE PROBLEM!",
