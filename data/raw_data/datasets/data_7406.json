    "content": "Prior to November, when I turned on my Pixel 3a, I would receive a Messenger notification and be able to read any messages received while the phone was turned off. Now, I am not receiving those messages at all. Verizon is showing that the the messages are released/received at the time I turn on the phone, however.\n\nI have a couple other side issues with the Messenger app: sometimes messages fail to send and I do not always receive a vibration notification when a message is received.\n\nHelp would be appreciated!",
