    "content": "Group Messaging (MMS) was working fine this morning, now I get a white box that says \"Messaging with {3 recipients names} is not available right now\".  The only difference is I applied the new system update. I am on Verizon with chat features turned on. I tried both Wifi and 4g and clearing my cache.",
