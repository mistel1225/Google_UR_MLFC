    "title": "Can two people talk and be heard at the same time?",
    "content": "I have a friend who has a Google Pixel 1 phone.  When we have a conversation (with me on a landline), often when I try to say something,  he can't hear me.  He has told me that the phone only allows one-way communication: when the phone is transmitting what he says,  he can't hear me if I'm speaking, because of something the phone is doing, only allowing one of us to be transmitted/heard at a time.  Several questions:  (1)  Is this true? (2)  If it is true, is there any way to let him know that I would like to speak, rather than just letting him continue to speak, without any response from me?  (3) Does it work the other way, too -- if I am speaking, can he not interrupt me?   (4) How does it know when to \"switch directions\" and let the other person be heard?\n\n(This is different from a conversation in person, where if he is talking, and I want to say something, I can let him know that I would like to speak.  It is especially frustrating when I think he has paused or stopped, and I say something, and he still doesn't hear me.)\n\nThanks.",
