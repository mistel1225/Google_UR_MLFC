    "title": "Wi-Fi is disconnecting randomly for the last 5 hours.",
    "content": "When the wifi disconnects, the SSID will not be visible by the phone. After a few seconds it will be visible and just say saved. However, from the same AP, the 2.4 SSID will be visible the entire time. I have two laptops, a Surface, an iPhone, TV, Chromecast, Google homes all on this AP. This phone is the only device having an issue. I have rebooted the phone and AP. I have turned off and on the Wi-Fi. I have reset network settings. I have checked for updates. Does anyone have anything else to try that won't work because this is a driver issue?\n\nThanks.",
