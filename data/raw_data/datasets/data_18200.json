    "content": "I just bought my first brand new Google Pixel 4 but regardless of the Routine name,  or time. It doesn't matter how many \"actions\" I'll add or remove. Nothing works and it's always asking for my \"attention\" instead of just running basic things such as setting my device off silence, tell me about my calendar or any other silly default action. Here I attached a screenshot of the message I always get in my brand new Google Pixel 4! Clicking the notification or the \"Settings\" blue button don't do absolutely anything either.",
