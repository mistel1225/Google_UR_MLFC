    "content": "Each time I take a photo in portrait mode, the camera adds the photo to a new folder. So, ten photos means ten separate folders.\n \nThis makes it tedious, slow and frustrating to view the photos from a third-party app or to copy the photos to the desktop.\n\nIs there a way to turn this off or create one folder for all portrait photos taken?",
