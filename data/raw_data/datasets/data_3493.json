    "content": "Good day,\nI use my pixel devices for all my photography on social media and work. I loved my Pixel 3 and thought to upgrade to the Pixel 5 for the wide angle back camera. I purchased a pixel 5 a few months back and right away I noticed two main issues with the Pixel 5's images. \n1) The HDR bracketing is really bad and not even very noticeable when compared to the Pixel 3 \n2) When editing photos (raw or jpeg) and you adjust contrast, darkness or exposure you can start to see a grid pattern in the image. This is really evident when increasing the HDR in a third party app like Snapseed. \n\nNote: this issue is present using both the wide angle and regular lens\n\nIs this a hardware issue? I have updated my build to the latest release as of the date this is posted. This problem has kept me using the Pixel three. Supper bummed...",
