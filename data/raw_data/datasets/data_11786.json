    "title": "Pixel Launcher : Home screen loop / wrap around",
    "content": "Is there any way (other than using a different launcher app) to setup the home screens on continuous loop when swiping in either direction.  For example, swiping to the right from the first home screen would show the last, and swiping to the left from the last would show the first.\n\nMost other launchers I've used over the years (including manufacturers default launchers) have had this option, so I'm wondering if the Pixel launcher has it somewhere in the settings that I'm just not seeing.",
