    "content": "I've submitted at least a dozen feedbacks via the phone and received no inputs from Google, so I'm turning to the community.  My 1st generation Pixel phone shuts off above 10% power pretty regularly - including sometimes at 20% or more, but other times goes all the way down to 1-2% (then I charge it, I never intentionally let it run out of battery).  Sometimes it's right as I turn on the camera, sometimes I'm on a website, sometimes I haven't touched it in 10+ minutes and when I go to turn it on it immediately shuts off.  When I plug it in, if I immediately turn it back on it shows the last percentage that it was at (like the 20% it just shut off at, about 10 minutes ago).  It charges fine, but I'm nervous to use it when the battery gets low because I can't trust if I actually have 100% of my power.  Around the same time the battery became untrustworthy, it seemed like the screen brightness became less bright as a whole (I rarely keep it at 100% brightness, even before these issues) and the camera became much, much slower (sometimes 1-2 seconds between pushing the button and it taking the picture).  It makes me think it was an update from a couple of months ago that caused this, but I'm not sure, I have no real indication if it is software (update) or hardware (battery).  Is anyone else having issues and is there a potential fix in the works?",
