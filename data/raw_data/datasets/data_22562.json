    "content": "Whenever I go into another app such as YouTube and go full screen it will lock my phone and if I enable Dev options to send a notification of what stopped working system ui has stopped working. This was after Android 10 update. I've attempted to soft reboot my phone issue persists. Rebooted the device in safe mode issue still persisted in safe mode updated all apps and uninstalled non optimezed apps. I've done everything shy of a FDR. If there's anything else anyone can think of it would be appreciated. If that doesn't work I'll reach out to Google to reinstall the binary on my device but my phone is OOW so I'd prefer not to have to send it to Google.",
