    "content": "My Pixel3 is rebooting(often) / freezing (sometimes) - since a couple of days.\nI already checked a lot of info that i found:\n- it also reboots when charging\n- it also reboots when just lying around\n- it also reboots in safe mode\n-battery temp seems to be ok (accubattery)\n-storage is fine (<60%)\n\ni am a little bit hesitate to use the factory reset option due to two factors:\n1) it seems that it is not rebooting when i have spotify constantly running (and/or when the screen stays on all the time)\n2) i have a lot of 2wa apps (for work) need to make sure that all of it is working in no-time.\n\nany idea what i could check? maybe a hint in regard to the mentioned spotify/display on phenomenon.\n\nthanks!",
