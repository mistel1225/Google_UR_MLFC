    "content": "I have 4 of the exact same smart plugs linked to my Google Home app.\n\n\nI can turn one of these On/Off with my phone locked by saying \"Ok Google turn on/off the Christmas Lights\", but when I try this for the other 3, the Google assistant says that I must first unlock my device to perform that action. I have tried clearing storage and re-setting-up the Google app and the Google Home app.\n\nWhy can I control one of the outlets from a secure lockscreen, but not the other 3?",
