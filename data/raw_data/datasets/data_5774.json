    "content": "Recently an acquaintance broke my phone screen on my pixel 3a xl. The phone still functions and I can navigate use by using the google assistant and I have entered my password so many times I know where on the screen to touch my phone to unlock it. I have replaced my phone with a pixel 5. Is there a way for me to transfer data to from my 3a XL to my 5?\n\nIs there anyone who could provide me with what the step by step process looks like in photos? I'm sure I can navigate the process if I knew what the relevant screens were and where to press if I had screen shots telling me what to do. \n\nOr is there just a place I can send my phone to get my data from?",
