But unfortunately since Google launched pixel 4a in india at flipkart, it shows all time out of stock why? If many people wants to buy your smartphone and you didn't taking it seriously than its very worst and bad luck for Google pixel team. It's first time I'm seeing pixel 4a out of stock in first sale, i don't know how many units you will sell in india i hope in future the pixel 4a stocks may available till last next year. Please Google if any Google employe reading this message please send it to dedicated team who is handling pixel 4a in india. And one thing more please pixel 4a fans also need pixel fabric back cover for 4a it should be also available in india. Please I'm real Google pixel fan,, there are many smartphone in the market but they all are very big and huge. I hope the stocks will be back on flipkart soon that till ends next full year.",
