    "content": "I feel like I'm going a bit insane but I could've sworn I could hold my phone sideways and take a panoramic photo using the Camera app.  I have a Pixel 4 and recently had the OS upgrade to ver. 11.  Now when I go into the camera app - other - Panoramic...my only option is to hold the phone vertically which I've pretty much never done before.  If I do rotate the phone horizontally it doesn't auto-rotate (yes, it is enabled on my phone and works fine when taking a regular photo) and appears like it is designed to take a vertical panoramic photo.",
