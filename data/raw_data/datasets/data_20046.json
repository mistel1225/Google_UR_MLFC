    "content": "So.\n\nI bought my Pixel 4 some months ago. Everything worked fine until yesterday.\nI started experiencing a sound \"bug\" or something, I tried googling it but could not find anything so this is my last hope.\n\nIssue: My voice when recorded on Snapchat is in a sort of \"high pitch\". Making it sound really weird and non-natural.\n\nTroubleshooting: I've been troubleshooting with all apps and could not find the same issue on any of them, my voice sounds fine when recorded on Instagram, Messenger, whatsapp and the camer app itself.\n\nSo is there anyone here that has experienced the same or knows what the issue is?\nI've been using the standard Snapchat settings. And it worked fine until yesterday...",
