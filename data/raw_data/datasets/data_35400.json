    "content": "I have an original Pixel phone. I would like to plug a USB thumb drive into it and transfer files to the thumb drive. I used to be able to do this with my Droid Turbo. I received this lovely 32GB combination C-type plug and standard USB plug thumb drive and when you plug it in the phone doesn't recognize there's a drive in there. I thought the upgrade to Pie would take care of this omission by Google programmers. Do I need to somehow specially format the thumb drive? Is there an app that makes this work? I can't believe the stupidity of this not working!",
