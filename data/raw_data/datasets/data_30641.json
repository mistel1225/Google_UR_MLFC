    "content": "So I am thinking of getting Google One, mostly because I have a new Pixel 3a and want to be able to keep max picture quality when backing up photos.\n\nHere's my question - if I add my wife (she also has a Pixel 3a) as a member of my Google One, will she then be able to keep max picture quality when backing up photos as well?\n\nMany thanks",
