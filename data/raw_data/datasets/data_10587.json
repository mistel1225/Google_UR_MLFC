    "content": "I've been trying to install the update for Android 11 on my Pixel 3 for around a month now, but every time I go to the update section in the device settings, the update keeps jumping between 'Installing system update' and 'Download paused'. I've restarted my device and disconnected it from the wifi numerous times with no success. Any help would be greatly appreciated.",
