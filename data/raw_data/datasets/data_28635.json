    "title": "TAKE ACTION: Contact Google if upset by Portrait Mode Creating New Folders Issue",
    "content": "I've seen several posts -- here and through Google search, of Pixel phone users complaining about the awful user experience annoyance whereby portrait mode in the stock camera app creating a new and separate folder for every single photo. This is beyond irritating, because if you want to post a photo using a third party app (like Instagram, Twitter or Facebook) you must scroll through a constantly increasing number of folders labeled something like IMG_00000000_000000. In my case, haven taken hundreds of portrait photos, there were hundreds of these folders I needed to delete.\n\nDespite years of complaints, Google and its camera app developers have done nothing in terms of issuing a fix. The problem has persisted throughout each new iteration of the Google phone. This is unacceptable.\n\nPLEASE if you are having this issue, contact Google developers through the camera app, by tapping More--->Settings---->Send feedback and politely ask for an immediate fix. Or consider telling them you will not be purchasing another Pixel phone until this issue is resolved.\n\nWhen a fixable feature has this many complaints, it's hostile to users for nothing to be done. Let's force Google developers to finally pay attention.\n\nThanks,\n\nDK",
