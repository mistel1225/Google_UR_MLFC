    "title": "Tracking effects (double contours) when scrolling texts on the screen",
    "content": "For example, if I scroll through the news on the \"Google News\" app (also with other apps), there is a wake (ghosting)effect especially for the texts (black text on white background). You can also describe it with double contours. Is this behavior normal or a defect on the display? Thank you",
