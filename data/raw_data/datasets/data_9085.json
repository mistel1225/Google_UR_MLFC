    "title": "Android Auto - audio cuts out suddenly and starts playing on the phone",
    "content": "Along with the myriad of other Android Auto bugs, this is the most frustrating. I'll plug in my phone via usb C to my Volvo XC60, I either use Spotify or Qobuz, then randomly 5/10 mins later, the audio will stop playing from the car speakers and start coming out of the phone. The only workaround is unplugging and plugging in the phone again. I've tried two different cables.",
