    "content": "Pixel 5 will not view or download photos received via SMS text. Photos are received, but I cannot open them. Photos are being sent from iOS and Android users. I have cleared cache, force stopped the app, restarted the phone, turned off wifi, etc. My provider is Verizon and this is a new issue. I appreciate any thoughts.",
