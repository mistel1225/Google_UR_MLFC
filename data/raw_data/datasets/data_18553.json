    "content": "I have a Pixel 1 phone. For the last 2-3 weeks, it has been shutting off randomly even when the battery is 30% or more. This happens especially during calls. It turns on only after plugging into a charger.\nSometimes, the phone shuts off while using other apps like Instagram or bank apps.\nToday my phone shut off at 84% battery during an important call. Now it is not even turning on after plugging into a charger. \nPlease help, this is the only phone I have.",
