    "title": "After updating to Android 10, a issue I have noticed is outgoing calls taking FOREVER to initiate",
    "content": "When making an outgoing call, whether it's from my contacts list or even from the dial pad, it takes approximately 20-30 seconds for it to even start to call that number. Attached photo is what the phone shows until it final starts to call. After the 20-30 seconds, it then populates the call controls and starts ringing...I only started having this issue once updating to Android 10 on pixel 3). Has anyone else notice this extreme delay time to start making a call?",
