    "content": "So its been over a month now and google support is horrible. I had an issue after last months security update. My Android Auto would not connect to any car. First thing i did is reset the device to factory and even reset my cars head unit to factory settings. nothing. My wife's phone worked fine in my car. tried different cable and no go. Called support and got told many different things. I followed the trouble shooting steps i was given, sent in a bug report as requested. week goes by and don't hear anything. Call back multiple times and i was told that someone will contact me. after 2 weeks of this i was approved for a warranty replacement. its a month now. Just had a manager hang up on me because he said there was nothing he can do for me and i have to wait till the terminator team contacts me. So for over a month i have had no support from Google what so ever. I bought my device out right from google, paid in full. Google, you need to get your act together. its frustrating that i am approved for a warranty replacement but this has to go to 3rd level terminator support team and there is no way to contact them. \n\nWhat can be done to help my situation?",
