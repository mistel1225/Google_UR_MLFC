    "title": "Pixel 3 has been randomly rebooting since the October update.",
    "content": "My pixel 3 randomly reboots at least once a day. It's not caused by any case or external battery. I've seen it happen even when the phone is lying on the desk in front of me. The phone then sort of gets stuck in a bootloop where it restarts multiple times (the Google logo appears and then the phone reboots). Also, finally when the phone reboots and the lockscreen appears, it reboots sometimes from that screen multiple times too. \n\nMoeed.",
