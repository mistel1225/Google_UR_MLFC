    "content": "Hi.\n\nI gave my 8 year old my original Pixel.  Recently it freezes and then reboots over and over.  It gets to the \"Google\" screen, hangs there for a while and then reboots, over and over.  The only way I can stop it is to hold the power and volume down button and then select power off from the recovery menu.  But once I start the phone it happens again.\nI don't want to spend a lot trying to fix it as it's for my 8 year old who will probably smash it within a month.\n\nThanks",
