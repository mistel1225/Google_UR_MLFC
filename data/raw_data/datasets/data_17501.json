    "content": "I am having connection issues with the Pixel 4 XL and the August WiFi SmartLock (4th gen). This lock uses both WiFI and Bluetooth to detect your proximity to home for the \"auto unlock\" feature.\n\nThe WiFI connectivity is OK, but the Bluetooth connection is very flaky. August support just offers their standard suggestions to clear the app cache/memory, switch BT off/on, restart the phone, power cycle and recalibrate the lock. This sometimes works for a while and then the BT connectivity begins to fail again.\n\nThere must be others with Pixel 4 and August Smartlock. Has anyone else had this problem and found a solution?",
