    "title": "Brand new Pixel 4a: videos on Instagram explore page glitching",
    "content": "Just received my new Pixel 4a from Verizon in the mail yesterday; love everything about it, except I'm experiencing an issue with the Instagram app. When I scroll through the explore page and tap on a post containing a video, sometimes the video glitches out for no discernable reason. Most times, when I scroll to the next video (which is completely fine), and then scroll back up, everything seems normal. However, it seems pretty commonplace, happening every 7-8 videos. I have tried restarting the phone, as well as deleting Instagram and redownloading it. I've also tried screen-recording to see if I could document it, but when I play back the recording, it appears as if nothing is amiss.\n\nIt is honestly a minor problem, but I am worried that if I am experiencing weird glitches right off the bat, that I should return it and try a different model. I have yet to experience anything else to cause concern; all other social media apps that I've tried seem fine. Any suggestions would be welcome! Thanks!",
