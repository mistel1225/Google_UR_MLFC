    "content": "I have two pixel 4 xls, & my friend has one also, both my pixel 4 xl and his is experiencing this battery bug. When you charge your pixel unplug the phone when it gets into the 90s & the percentage will jump up 5 percentages. You have to restart the phone to get the correct percentage back.This happens most times I charge, only rarely it doesn't happen.",
