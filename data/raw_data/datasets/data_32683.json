    "content": "I am using a Pixel 2 with small font size and ambient display. When I get a whatsapp notification, the icon that flashes up at first is cropped at the top. It's only small, but an annoyance, and not the kind of thing I'd expect.\n\nApologies for the blurry picture, I can't screenshot the notification on a locked screen, so I had to take a photo at that instant with another phone. But you can see there are a couple of pixels worth of the logo chopped off.",
