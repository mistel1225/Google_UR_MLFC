    "content": "Hello I have the Google pixel 2 XL. When I got there phone and turned it on I noticed that it had the weather status on the lock screen and when ever I pulled down the top to see the notifications. But after 30 minutes or so if not using my phone or a app updates the weather goes away. I then have to uninstall Google updates to get it to come back. Is there any way around this as I like having the weather there at a glance. Thanks and look forward to hearing from you. Josh",
