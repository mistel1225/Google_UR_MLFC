    "content": "My pixel 2xl just had a replacement screen via Google. And now that I got it back I do not have any input on the bottom of the screen and sometimes even the entire screen.\nThis is quite annoying, allready did an facory reset twice with first time no result and second it seemed good in the beginning, but this morning it started again. \nAdded a screenshot from the touch pointer to locate the problem.",
