    "content": "I was looking to get the pixel 3a. I have to say that after buying the chrome book pixel for our company and having all 7 fail within the second year of use. I am super skeptical to spend any money on google products almost 10k lost because of battery and crappy circuit board design. I was on the lip to start a class action lawsuit. In any case I see people are getting up to 300$ off some of these phones, what is the criteria to qualify? Honestly I am only looking to buy it for development so we can test out site, I can care less at any point about features.",
