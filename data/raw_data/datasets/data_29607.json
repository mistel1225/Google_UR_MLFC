    "content": "On my pixel 3 with the pixel headphones plugged in, the volume turns down automatically. It got so bad, and I noticed that it wasnt happening with regular audiojack headphones with a usb c converter, that I bought a new set of pixel headphones... and that solved the problem for a while, but now the issue is back :( I love these headphones and my pixel but I use it to listen to music and podcasts for hours every day. Please help! Its like someone is fighting with me, I can be pressing the volume up and it still goes down. Restarting the phone and blowing out the jack doesn't help.",
