    "content": "Unlocked Pixel 4XL purchased from Google Store. AT&T Sim. Repeatedly shows as up-to-date with November 5 patch (which I sideloaded after waiting ten days). The December update was released twelve days ago. It was noted Dec 2 that the 4XL would update \"next week\". \n\nIs sideloading now the only way to keep the latest phone updated? Are other 4XL owners still waiting?",
