    "content": "I connected my Pixel 3A XL to Google Home via bluetooth and played a radio station. I then had to pause music to take a phone call (approximately 15 minutes). Due to this inactivity, the bluetooth connection was lost, and the phone cannot connect to Google Home anymore via bluetooth. I am now casting my phone to Google Home. The problem with casting is that the volume is low compared to bluetooth. If I want to use bluetooth again, I will have to reboot my Google Home.\n\nSecond annoying thing about Pixel 3A XL is that it does not readily remember all my bluetooth connection, but adds an additional step about the devices with whom I connected my phone. An irritating feature compared to Nexus 6P\n\nThe reason I use bluetooth connection instead of casting is because until Tuesday, i was using my Nexus 6P to listen to music over Google Home. When I was casting Nexus 6P to Google HOme, it kept on disconnecting, and I had to use the bluetooth.",
