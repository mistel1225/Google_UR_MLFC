    "content": "My Google Pixel 5 is having some battery drain issues while idle, its not so bad but my phone battery life was better when i first got it (2 weeks ago). The phone won't let me optimize the camera.\n\nCould someone please advise what does this mean in the below snapshot.\n\nEdit: i think it's related to the new Google Camera playstore update. After uninstalling it's gone. ",
