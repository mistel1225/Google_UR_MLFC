    "content": "It's my first Pixel phone, but I've been a loyal Android user since 2011. After receiving my Pixel 4 XL, I found DND not working well, or at the very least, not meeting my expectations according to what I have experienced for the past years.\n\nWhen I turned on DND, I expect all the notification including vibration to go silent, just as I turned on Silent mode. However, I still receive notification ringtones and vibrations through Facebook Messenger or LINE. I've made sure they did not override DND, and \"Restrict notifications\" have toggled to \"No sound from notifications\". To my disappointment, I still receive notifications.\n\nI'd be glad if there are any solutions to this problem except turn on Silent Mode along with DND on, which is what I currently settle for. Hope it's just a bug which is gonna be fixed soon.\n\nPS. https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/6715714?hl=en I've already looked it up here, but to no avail. :(",
