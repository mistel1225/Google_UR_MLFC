    "content": "I ordered this phone during the promotional period while signed into a google account that had Google Pay set up. It's been well over 6 weeks and I still haven't received the $100 Google Store credit. I haven't received any email notifying me and my balance still shows $0 if I check it. I've reached out to Google Support but still haven't received the credit. Anyone else have any luck?",
