    "title": "Pixel 2, Android 10 GA, no Verizon WiFi Calling; how to get it working again?",
    "content": "I just updated my Google Store Pixel 2 to Android 10 (general availability) directly from Pie. (I.e., never installed Beta of 10.) WiFi Calling seems to have stopped working. It's still set On. I cycled it off/on. I checked/re-set the emergency address. Even with no bars of wireless and the same powerful, fast, WiFi connection I just installed 10 over, there is no indication that Verizon WiFi Calling is the active connection. And calls placed just end.\n\nAny ideas? Anybody seeing WiFi Calling working for a Pixel 2/Verizon/Android 10? Anybody else seeing it fail to work as expected?\n\nThis is really a problem for me; our VZW coverage at home is just shy of useless, so WiFi Calling is essential to be able to use the phone as a, umm, phone.",
