    "title": "Notifications not displaying after June Android 10 update",
    "content": "Since the June Android 10 update my Pixel 3 always says 'no notifications' even when it has just played the notification sound and recently sent  shows that an app has sent a notification 'just now'.  But I can't see the notification. Also, the Quick Settings pane cannot be accessed - swiping down does nothing. And no notification 'dots' are appearing on the app icons.  I have set all apps to show notifications, checked every setting I can find, and the problem even persists after booting in SAFE MODE.  I haven't tried factory reset yet - any helpful advice out there? -LME",
