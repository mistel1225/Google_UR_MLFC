    "title": "\"Previously Connected Devices\" list is shows old, useless items instead of my daily connections",
    "content": "I use a couple of bluetooth devices daily, including two different pairs of headphones and my vehicle. When I open the \"Connected Devices\" section in Settings, the shortlist of \"Previously Connected Devices\" is wildly inappropriate, listing my brother's car (which I've used once), a bluetooth speaker I used everyday for a month early last year, and my computer that I have connected to three times since buying this phone. These device names are not listed together on the expanded list in the next page, so it's not a section that is grabbed alphabetically.\n\nIt seems asinine that the shortlist of devices wouldn't be the most frequently used. Is there any way to resort this list, even manually? I'd really rather not delete every connection one at a time until it shows the items that I want, but I'm almost to that point.",
