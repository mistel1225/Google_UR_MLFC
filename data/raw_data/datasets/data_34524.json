    "content": "Hi, \n\nAfter the latest Google update, my phone interface turned all black and white and I have no idea why. I tried to turn off and restart the device but it doesn't seem to work. I'm not talking about the revert colours setting but purely black and white phone.\n\nHope you can help! \n\nThanks",
