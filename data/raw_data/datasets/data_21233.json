    "content": "Since the past few weeks my pixel 3xl has been making random beep sound and no specific intervals or action, comes sometimes when I am on the phone too!  The beep sound is strange, much like an old radio sound, or a malfunctioned speaker - 4 quick muffled beeps.  NFC is off and I have also looked at the notification log but no trace.  I did notice the sound of this beep is related to the phone ringer volume.  I bought this phone last Jan and this is the first time I am experiencing this really annoying thing.  Sincerely hope there is a solution or is it time to ditch pixel?",
