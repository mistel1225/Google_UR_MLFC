    "content": "Hi, I'm having issues with my Google pixel stand as the orange led light at the base of my pixel stand always lights up whenever I plug it into the wall. And I have not even place my phone on the pixel stand to charge yet, as shown in the picture I attached in this post. However, when I placed my phone on the stand, my phone doesn't respond to it as well.\nI tried to go to Google's Hardware Warranty to look for Google pixel stand, but I cannot find it. It has all the pixel phones and other google devices, except for the pixel stand. DOES ANYBODY KNOW HOW I CAN CONTACT GOOGLE REGARDING MY ISSUE? I CANT SEEM TO FIND A WAY TO CONTACT GOOGLE REGARDING MY ISSUE. THANKS..",
