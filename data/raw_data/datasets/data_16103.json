    "content": "PIXEL 4XL BATTERY ISSUES\nStarting about 3 days ago my battery has started acting quite strange with bouncing around on percentages after a restart, mainly sticking at around 50%. The phone also does not charge sometimes when plugged in. it shows that it is being charged but seems to gain no charges. -I have had the phone for about 10months. Any Fix for this or should I just go claim warranty from retailer?\n\nCheers.",
