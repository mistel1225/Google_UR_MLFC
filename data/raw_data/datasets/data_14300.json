    "content": "As the title says, Disney+ and Netflix not working anymore on my Google Pixel c tablet since 2 months.\nI do not understand why as it always worked fine and and i am running on Android 8.1.\n\nMaybe this will help, but with Disney+ i get error code 39 when trying to start a movie\nWith Netflix, it doesn't even allows me to enter the home screen and just gets stuck and shuts down.\n\nHope someone can help.",
