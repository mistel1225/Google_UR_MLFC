    "title": "can't access screen during calls",
    "content": "When ever my phone connects a call, incoming or out going, my screen goes blank and I'm unable to access it. I cannot hang up, use the dial pad, or turn off the device.  I have an otter box cover around the back and a glass screen protector on the front.  This was an issue with an earlier operating system, it was then fixed mid December, 2018 but the new update January 5, 2019 has the same problem.",
