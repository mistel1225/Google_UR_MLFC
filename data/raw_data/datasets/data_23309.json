    "content": "Few days ago, l needed to wait about 3 seconds for the camera to show image whenever i open the original camera application. And the problem is, today the camera suddenly no response when I were taking photo, then i couldn't open it anymore.  I have tried all the solutions from Google website, however those cannot help. Then, I tried to reset my phone to the original setting, but nothing changed. Now, I can't open the Google camera and flash light. If I use other camera app, only the front camera is work, and i cannot switch to the back camera as the app cannot connect to the camera. Anyone tried this experience before? Please help. Thanks a lot.",
