    "content": "Pixel 4 XL.  Android 10, Feb 5, 2020, system patch level.\nPhone app Feb 3, 2020, update (per play store)\nPhone set to do automatic updates\nIf I uninstall the app updates, with Wi-Fi off (per another thread) and then reboot, and then install updates, I get the button on the bottom right of the App back but I loose \"Call Screening feature\"\nIn settings, Visual Voicemail shows enabled.\nBUT\nwhen I reboot again (tried with both Wi-Fi off and with it ON) ( turned the phone off, left off for a few min and then powered on) the Visual voicemail feature goes away.\nI also am losing the Call Screening functionality,\nI have a 2nd Pixel 4 XL that isn't having this problem. It did at one point but uninstalling the updates and re-installing them fixed the problem.\n\nI have also tried, clear cache and force stop.\n\nPlease help",
