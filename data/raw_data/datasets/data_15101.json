    "title": "How to changing local audio output when casting audio from Spotify in Android 11?",
    "content": "I updated to android 11 from 10 and I no longer can control the local audio output from an app while casting Spotify in another room. I cast sleep sounds for my son to a google home in his room. Then I want to watch something on my phone while my Bluetooth headphones are connected. Sometime I want to switch to the local speakers if I'm showing my wife something. This was easy in android 10 and could be done right from the sound settings. Now I cannot do this. This is really frustrating and a step backwards. Is there a why I can turn off the new audio settings? Where did the old audio output setting go?",
