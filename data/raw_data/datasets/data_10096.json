    "content": "I upgraded my Pixel 4 to Android 11 earlier this week, Bluetooth audio has not worked for video calls since. My Bluetooth headset will be connected fine, audio transmitted just fine. When I connect to a video call it automatically starts playing through the speaker of the phone. This has been the case with both the HighFive video conferencing app and the Alexa video call",
