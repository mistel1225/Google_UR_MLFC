    "content": "I cannot pinch to zoom at all on the phone, including camera, photos, social media, etc, all places this previously wasn't an issue. even when I turned on accessibility mode, I can double tap to zoom in really far, but cannot use two finger commands. \nAdditionally, typing has been very off. Where I used to have about one typo to correct a sentence, now the text keyboard I missing taps, correcting to odd words, and generally not understanding my touches. Even when clocking or selecting things, it's almost like the screen can't tell where exactly I am tapping .\nThis started immediately after the last update.",
