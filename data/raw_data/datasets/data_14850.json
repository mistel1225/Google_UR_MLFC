    "content": "On my pixel 4 after android 11 update, the wifi and cellular data speeds are super slow. I have to reboot the phone in order to get it to work correctly. It seems to be happening when the phone switches to cellular data or to wifi once it has been on a network for awhile. Example is phone connected to wifi at home and works fine. Leave the house and get out of range of wifi and cellular data takes over, it is very slow to load data. Reboot the phone and it works like normal. Same thing if I am not on a wifi and using cellular data and then come into range of a wifi connection. Phone will have slow data connection until I reboot the phone.",
