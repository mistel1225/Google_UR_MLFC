    "content": "Hello!\n\nI have already read several posts describing the yellow tint problem. But I din`t find solution of the problem. I tried to switch colours to \"bright\" and \"natural\" in settings, but it didn`t help. I sent feedback 2 times, there is no any response.\nEven my old Xiaomi does way better with colour accuracy.\nSo, does anyone already fix it and how to fix it?\n(Sorry for my english)",
