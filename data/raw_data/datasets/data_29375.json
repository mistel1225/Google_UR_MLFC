    "content": "I've looked at the settings repeatedly and tryed turning on and of the override toggle a dozen times with no effect, it took me an hour to even find the toggle only to have it not work. The app is amino and it's only text notifications I set it as a priority like a lot of updates ago when the system was completely different and I cant undo it now. Please help me I just want to stop getting notifications while watching YouTube because of how much they block my screen.",
