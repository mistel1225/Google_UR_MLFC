    "content": "I use Accubattery to track detailed battery usage and noticed that my battery health is bad - under 90%.  It also fluctuates between 67% to around 90%.  My phone is 10 days old.\nI am not sure if this is related to the other battery issues (such as the percentage not changing).\nhttps://imgur.com/gallery/u2XpiXZ",
