    "content": "This started yesterday, every time I try to charge the phone it either won't start charging using the original cable, or it will just shut down immediately. I've tried booting the phone up in safe mode and have made sure that I have updated the phone to its most recent version. The phone will charger in its shut down state, but any time I plug it in when it's powered on it will just shut down again. Phone is a pixel 2xl",
