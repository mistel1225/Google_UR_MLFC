    "content": "I have two Pixel 2 XL phones. When I read that Google is offering the last monthly update for the 2 XL I rushed to update.\n\nMy first phone updated right away, but on the second phone I get the message:\n\n\"Regular updates have ended for this device\" and I don't seem to be able to update.\n\nWhy is this happening?\n\nAnyone else had this problem?\n\nAny solution?\n\nThank you,\n\nReuven",
