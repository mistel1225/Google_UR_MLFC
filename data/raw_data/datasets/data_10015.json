    "content": "I purchased Pixel 4A from Flipkart about 9-10 days ago and suddenly yesterday on turning on power button the display stopped working and the screen became green. The phone was not dropped neither went through pressure or damage, Since Flipkart replacement period was over, I contact Google support and B2X team picked up the pixel for device diagnosis. I want to know whether I will get replacement or not?",
