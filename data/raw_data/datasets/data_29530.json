    "content": "Starting about a week and a half ago, my device began restarting on its own almost everyday. Before, it would restart randomly once a week or so, it was not an issue. If it doesn't restart, then it will freeze, usually after moderate usage. I have to force restart it mytliple times a day. The Google Assistant no longer responds to my voice and I am unable to reach the settings due to it being unable to connect. The headphone jack no longer responds to earbud usage, and sometimes resolves when I restart the device. I've deleted almost half of the storage off of the device to no avail (it was under half of the 128GB before I deleted). There are no current updates. I suspect the most recent update may have caused this? Or perhaps something else?",
