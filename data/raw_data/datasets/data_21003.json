    "content": "I've had the pixel 4 for about 6 mos and it has had issues from day 1. I have people on my same plan with different phones that have perfect service in areas that my phone does not. Just recently my phone stopped working all together. No wifi even when connected to a network. No data connection, which eventually completely dropped from my carrier. \n\nAfter contacting my carrier I was referred to Google directly as it was not an issue with the provider. Google troubleshooting said I had to perform a factory restart. After that the phone connected back to my carrier but is almost completely inoperable. Text messages take hours to send, if they ever go through. I always have pending messages that download hours after they were sent. The phone is absolutely the worst phone I have ever encountered. Google is completely unwilling to rectify the issue, I feel at a loss. I no longer have faith in their phones and just want to be done with this phone. \n\nWith everything going on in the world right now, my phone is a life line to my work. Not having a working phone is not only stressful, but actually affecting my livelihood.",
