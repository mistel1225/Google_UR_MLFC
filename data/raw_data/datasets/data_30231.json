    "content": "Hello - I'm having an issue where some pictures are not showing up in the google photos app or photos.google.com.  I saw another poster had a similar issue that was solved by checking the permissions to the camera, but I checked that and they are still not showing up.  I can see the photos through other apps (instagram, Facebook, email, picstitch). My OS is up to date (Android 9, automatic updates turned on) and I've restarted the phone. Any other suggestions?",
