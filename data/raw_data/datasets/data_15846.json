    "content": "Guys I just want you all to stay away from this piece of garbage they call Pixel 4XL. This phone is the most buggiest, unstable, glitchy piece of garbage I bought in my entire life. This is my third replacement phone I am using in 7 months and it is still glitchy!! The screen turns black suddenly and if any CSR now tells me to get another replacement I'll snap. The glitches and problems are everywhere, there are problems all over this phone. I would ask everybody to never buy this kind of garbage for so much money when they don't deserve even 50 bucks! I would say google needs 100 more generations to compete with companies we never heard of, they are in no where close to iphones or samsung. In terms of competition they should be the worst if I am not wrong",
