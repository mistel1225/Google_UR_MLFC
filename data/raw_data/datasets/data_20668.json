    "content": "I filled in the RMA form for the courier to pick, then saw a clear \"Please note faulty batteries are not accepted for carriage.\" in bold at the top of the form.\n\nI've been asked by Google Support to ship the phone anyway, but the battery has expanded to the point you can fit a ruler under the rear cover!\n\nAre others asked to ship despite the safety issue too?",
