    "content": "I bought google pixel 4a in Singapore and currently using it in Indonesia. I use the local cellphone carrier here and only work for few days before it disconnected from the carrier network and couldn't make any phone call or texting. \n\nI tried all the steps given:\nfactory reset\nSoft reboot\nRestart\nTurn on airplane and turn off airplane\nReset apn\nChange to 2g/3g\nTake out the sim and put back in\nManually select carrier only to get \"not able to connect\"\n\nAll no success to bring back the network. The phone now is in \"emergency calls only\" state. The phone can detect the carrier that I'm using but no signal at all. No connection to the mobile network.\n\nNot sure what to do anymore.\n\nAnybody got the same issue like me with pixel 4a? Any solution? I just bought the phone and really hope that I can use it. Now I'm only connect it to wifi. Can't use it for daily activities.",
