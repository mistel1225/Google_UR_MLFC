    "content": "Hello, I am trying to use a PD 3 fast charger (non-google) with my Pixel 5, but the problem is the charge connects and disconnects over and over, probably half second gaps in between. \n\nI've done as many debugging steps as I can, and I am certain this is a bug. \n\nRoot issue: charger connects and disconnects over and over. \n\nTests: Pixel 3 charges fine with same cable/charger. Wife's iPhone charges fine with her usb-c to Apple connector. My Pixel 5 charges fine with same cable but OEM charger. My Pixel 5 will not charge with OEM pixel cable but after market charger. \n\nI've tried to narrow down a bad charger or cable, but in all scenarios I am not able to do that. Everything works fine individually or with a different phone. The non-oem PD 3 charger simply doesn't play nicely with my Pixel 5, but works with all other devices. The cable I am using works great with the OEM charger block so I know the cable is good. Both new charger and cable work with my old Pixel 3 with no problems. \n\nThanks.",
