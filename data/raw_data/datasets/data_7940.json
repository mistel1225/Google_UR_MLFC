    "title": "Unable to swipe down notifications while in any app",
    "content": "Whenever I'm in an app I'm unable to pull down the notification bar. This also happens on my home screens if I have a widget taking up the full length of the top row. I've reset my phone completely (didn't restore anything) but it's still happening. \nI've installed an app (Tap Tap) where you can set actions for different tapping actions on the back of the phone and can get the notifications to open up with gestures but not just by swiping down (I installed the app AFTER the problem started so I know it's not the source of the issue)",
