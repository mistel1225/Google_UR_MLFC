    "content": "Re: Night Sight, I'm wondering . . . if your Pixel 4 is on a rock, a stationary surface, or mounted on a tripod, with the rear lenses, and best photo sensors, facing the sky in preparation for the long exposure shot it seems impossible or very inconvenient to press the shutter button which would be facing down.  Are night sight photos only shot with the selfie camera which would allow the individual controlling the camera shutter button to easily touch the shutter button while the phone's screen is facing the sky?",
