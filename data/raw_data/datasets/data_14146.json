    "content": "I've searched on this forum and found other similar posts. The Google Support Chat is currently closed which has prompted me to post here first. My Pixel 3XL had it's battery swell up to the point that it raised the back of the phone, exposing the insides of the phone.\n\nShould I stop using this phone until I can get a replacement from Google? I worry about potential for the battery to explode like those news articles about Samsung phones a few years ago..",
