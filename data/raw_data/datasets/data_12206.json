    "content": "When I pick up my Pixel 3 the assistant starts talking and I can not get it to stop. Any button I push the \nassistant says, \" Double tap and long hold.\"  Then when I do the double tap it will not pull up any button I touch. It just keep saying \" Double tap and long hold\" which is driving me crazy. Has anyone had this problem and can help me fix it ? thanks.",
