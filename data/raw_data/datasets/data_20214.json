    "content": "Hi everyone, \n\nThe issue I have is that, just recently, (in the past week) when I try and use the USB-C headphones (or regular headphones with the USB-C > 3.5mm jack adapter) my Pixel 3 won't recognise that the headphones are plugged in, and continues to play audio through the phone speaker (this applies to audio playback in all the apps I've tried and phone calls too).\n\nI've read a LOT of other posts here on this topic, but the solutions all seem to suggest that it's caused by either, fluff/lint in the USB-C socket (I have carefully cleaned the socket out), or suggest booting into safe mode as a fix (the problem persists in safe mode).  So none of these have worked for me.\n\nThe socket seems fine - I have had it plugged into my computer to transfer files across without any issues whatsoever, and the phone charges without issues. The headphones and dongle all work as they should in my partner's Pixel 3XL.\n\nTo add to my frustrations, the issue seems to be intermittent.  At one point when I plugged the headphones in BEFORE trying to make a call they worked, only to drop out mid way through the call, and then refuse to reconnect. I haven't been able to get them to work again.\n\nI also randomly get the USB-C android system notification popping up from time to time, prompting you to select how you would like to use the USB-C connection, as though the phone had just been connected to a device.\n\nI'm fairly technical, and my feeling is that this is a software issue, does anyone have any ideas?  I'm contemplating a factory reset at this point.\n\nThanks in advance for any input.\nG",
