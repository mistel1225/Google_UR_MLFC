    "content": "It has been 4 months I have my Pixel 4a. Was very happy with it at the beginning but now I only have issues with it.\n\n1. Liquid /Debris detected notifications received frequently when the port is clean. \n2. When the above is cleared, started to receive  notification \"Charging connected device via USB\" when there was no usb cable plugged to the phone.\n\nI thought it must be some kind of software issue.  I took the pain to factory reset my phone. After reset, no improvement noted and was still receiving the above notifications. \n\nToday i received notification about \"Analog audio accessory attached\" when there was not any device connected to the phone and when i plugged my pixel 4a power adapter - it was not being detected.\n\nAgain, I could not also switch the usb connection preferences from controlled by \"Connected device\"  to controlled by This Device.\n\nFinally , my phone ended with 0% battery and is no longer charging and working.\n\nI tried several adapters/usb cables - still not charging.\n\nI am on google help/support page trying to find a contact number /email address to file for a warranty claim and it got me here.\n\nThank you Google.",
