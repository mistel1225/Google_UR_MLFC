    "title": "Cannot use phone though aux input for pixel 4xl.",
    "content": "I have a pixel 4xl only two weeks old. My truck does not have Bluetooth only aux input. I have a usbc to 3.5 cable. I can play music and videos through input. However what I really want to do is use it to make calls. When I make or receive calls I can hear other end of call from the trucks speakers but they cannot hear me.\n It is like the mic does not work. When I pull the cord out phone works as it should. Is there a setting for what I want? Or do I need to look for a Bluetooth adapter? New to pixel coming from Galaxy. Thank you.",
