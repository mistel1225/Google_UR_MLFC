    "content": "When I try to play music on Bluetooth devices connected to my phone, and I am playing music as it is connecting, the audio starts playing for a second or two, then suddenly cuts out. The volume of the audio seems louder than the device intends, then cuts out to compensate. \nOn the apps I am using (generally YouTube, Spotify, and pocket casts) the playback is going as normal, and in the Bluetooth information, there is nothing abnormal (still connected, and audio playback allowed)",
