    "content": "Pixel 3 Updated to Android 12 (developers veersion), uninstalled and updated system back to android 11.\nPhone did full restart and clean up however now I'm in a loop with the setup, I select \"Don't copy\" (On page: Copy apps and Data), Verify the security pattern and sent back to the \"Copy apps and data\" page, no way out of this loop.\nNeedless to say, my phone can't function at all.\nAny ideas how to solve this one?",
