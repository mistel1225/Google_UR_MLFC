    "content": "After OTA update there is a problem with a phone: it looses wifi connection nearly every minute, if I turn whe wifi off and use only cell data, it looses network every 1-1.5 minutes.\n\nI've already tried:\nforget network and re-add id\nuse different wifi network, different frequency, different wifi security \nreset network data \nchange network mode (LTE, 3g)\ndifferent sim-card\nfactory reset\nflashing the previous firmwares\nrebooted hundreds times\n\nEven on clear install on the second step (after language choosing) it's still problem after wifi connection established: it just keeping dropping and restarting.\n\nAny ideas how to fix it ?",
