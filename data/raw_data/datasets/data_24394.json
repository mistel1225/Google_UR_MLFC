    "title": "Why is Google support such a joke? (Pixel replaced with damaged unit)",
    "content": "I purchased an original Pixel unit a year or two ago.\nThe first unit had a microphone failure, it was replaced with a unit on which the power button failed. (the camera also had issues, it was never the same as my original unit)\n\nGoogle have now replaced the unit again and the device they have sent me is damaged.\nThey first offered me $15 to keep this damaged phone and asked me if I was \"good with that\". They then stated that they cant guarantee any subsequent replacement device wont also be damaged because they \"dont have much stock\".\n\nCurrently, im waiting for a call from them, ive been waiting for days. Ive been without my own since before Christmas.\n\nAll up, youre a joke Google. Is anyone likely to contact me and make this right?\n\nLong term Pixel/Nexus owner now frustrated and angry with Google.",
