    "content": "I have been using my Google Pixel 4a 5G for a while. One thing I have noticed is that I am not able to switch between personal and work profiles on the Google App.\n\nI want to be able to use google discover (which i can't get work) but I want to be able to switch between my person and work profile but there is no way to switch between the two.\n\nIf I try to add another profile, it deletes my work profile and takes me through the whole process of adding my work profile all over again.\n\nIs it not possible to use the google app on both profiles? \n\nFor every other app on the phone you have to install it twice, one for personal and one for work mode.\n\nBut this seems different? \n\nAny ideas what I am doing wrong?
