    "content": "I filed a claim to get a replacement for my cracked phone. The claim was approved and got my phone very quickly. That was the easy part. I never received my shipping label to send back my damaged phone. I called the number that was listed in an email. It specifically said to call this number if you have misplaced your shipping label but the Assurant agent told me that he can't help me and I need to go here. Searching through the forum, I see quite a few people who have had the same issue. P\n\nPlease, help me out. I don't want to be charged for not returning my old phone.",
