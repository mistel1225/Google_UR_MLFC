    "content": "Why Google is not giving in build app locker in Pixel Devices nor Google have App Locker by then in play store. Is there any specific reason for not giving inbuilt or official Google app locker?\n\nMoreover I am afraid of using these third party apps because every next day these kind of apps are getting removed from Play store due to malware infection. What can we do..??\n\nHow can secure our individual apps in Pixel Devices?",
