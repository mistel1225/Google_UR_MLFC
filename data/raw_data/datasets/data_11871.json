    "content": "Basicly if you do multiple things at the same time  or just watch YouTube it resets or shuts it down. It doesn't misbehave constantly. It stops working and different % at times, at others it stops on use of different apps. But in general it seems that when there is a lot of battery drain it failes. Overheating is not issue as its cold here. Phone is updated. It has issues for a year now. Google assistance checked settings and batery and said its OK.",
