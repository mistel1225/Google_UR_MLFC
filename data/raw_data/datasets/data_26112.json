    "content": "I was trying to retrieve my call forwarding settings in the phone app (Settings/Calls/Call Forwarding) and received the message \"Call Settings error. Network or SIM card error\".  A quick internet search turned up the same thing happening to others (using the Nexus) a few years ago but nothing very recent.\n\nI resorted to going into Tips and Support and tapping \"Chat\".\n\nLong story, short, the nuff-nuff operator who wasted more than 10 minutes of my life exchanged some pleasantries with me, asked me the steps to repeat the problem and, when they finally came back, asked me if I had a sim card in the phone.  Really?\n\nI don't have time to deal with under-trained 1st level support people.  If I wanted to deal with a call-centre monkey following a script, I could have called my telco.\n\nI expected more from Google.",
