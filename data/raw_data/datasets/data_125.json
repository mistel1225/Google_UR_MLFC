    "title": "Pixel 4 phone does not respond to simple commands (exit, end phone calls, etc.)",
    "content": "Does not respond to simple commands, such as \"to cancel call press *\", or to play voice mails,  doesn't allow me enough time to press the speaker option when dialing out. and a number of other command  issues. It simply doesn't respond to a command when it has told me which button to push. Very frustrating. Has always been a problem. The layout and functioning of this device is not logical. I bought it to save a few dollars over the IPhone about a year ago. I regret my decision.",
