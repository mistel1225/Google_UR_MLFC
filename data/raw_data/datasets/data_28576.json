    "title": "Pixel 2 Forgot all Bluetooth Devices",
    "content": "I'm not exactly sure what might have caused this, but my phone no longer has any \"Previously connected devices.\" I listen to audiobooks every day in my car, so this morning when I tried to start listening again, it wouldn't pair because it forgot all bluetooth pairings. Has this happened to anyone before? \n\nI have tried restarting bluetooth and restarting my phone, but it looks like they are permanently gone. The only thing I can think of that may have lead to this is that my phone mysteriously turned itself off the night before while at 9% battery so maybe something malfunctioned there?",
