    "content": "My other phone the pixel 4a has been dropped in curry and we had the liquid or debris notification. We've kept in rice since yesterday but the notification is still there\nIs it possible to get fixed. We purchased at carphone warehouse. The phone itself has no functionality problems but because of the notification I've avoided charging it. Would it be possible to fix it if we sent it back to carphone warehouse?",
