    "content": "When bluetooth headphones are connected, notifications repeat endlessly. I have a set of Bose bluetooth headphones that are Google Assistant capable. When I get a notification (for example a WhatsApp message), the notification repeats ad-nauseam. Turning off the headphones does not help, the phone's speakers will continue the sound. Placing the phone on vibrate or do-not-disturb has no effect, sound goes on and on. Only restarting the phone makes the problem go away (until the next time, this happens every time).",
