    "content": "I was using my Pixel 2 XL and suddenly the seen stopped responding to touch. I rebooted the phone by long pressing the power button, but it didn't help. I also tried safe mode, but no luck there either. \n\nThe support site suggests factory resetting the phone, but that's difficult without touch! \n\nDoes anyone have any suggestions on what I shouldd do next?",
