    "content": "Pixel won't turn on, and won't charge. The screen is blank, I tried pressing the power button for 30 seconds, I even tried to wipe it, but nothing comes on the screen. When I connect it to my pc it gets recognized as: QUSB_BULK_CID:0402_SN... I've been trying to contact google support, but I don't get any number to call or chat.",
