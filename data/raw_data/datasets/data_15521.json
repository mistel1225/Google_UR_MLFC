    "content": "Hi,\n\nMy Pixel 4 will always be in landscape mode when auto rotate is enabled.  When disabled, there is no issues and will be in portrait mode all the time.  With auto rotate enabled there is no auto rotation what so ever.  \n\nHowever when disabled, any picture i take in whatsapps and messenger will post in landscape mode so i need to rotate pic 90 degrees to get a portrait picture.\n\nThis is super annoying.  I have run sensor tests and no issues with gyro.  Tried safe mode and still same issue.\n\nI am trying to avoid a factory reset as last resort.\n\nAny ideas please??",
