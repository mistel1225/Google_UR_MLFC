    "content": "This may not be the correct place to even ask about it, but it's Google planning on doing anything for Pixel 4 buyers when upgrading to the pixel 5? Apart from Pixel 4 pre-orderers losing out on a $200 deal, they discontinued the phone less than 1 year after release... We are missing 5g compatibility, and it seems that we are just getting screwed over constantly.\n\nI think pixel phones are great, but I'm getting the feeling Google doesn't care about loyalty/pre-orderers and it's kind of a shame.",
