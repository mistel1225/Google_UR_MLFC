    "content": "My pixel3 usb-c earbuds stopped working **with Google Assistant** week ago or so. Restarting obviously has no effect... They still play sound and double-clicking the middle button will skip to next song, but I cannot get any Google Assistant features to work (e.g. holding down top button to get time & messages read aloud)... Additionally, in settings>connected devices, the headphones only show up as \"USB / Charging connected device\" instead of \"Pixel USB-C earbuds\" as described in the \"Set up & use your Pixel USB-C earbuds\" help document.\n\nI've already tried using the tip of a very small zip tie to clean/scrape out the inside of the phone's port as well as the earbuds' plug. To the best of my recollection, this started shortly or immediately after I last had to reboot my phone for a system update.  *suspicious*",
