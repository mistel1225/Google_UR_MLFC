    "content": "I've had a pixel 4 for a while now, my partner has just got a pixel 4a. And since he's been using his phone (set it up yesterday) we have both been experiencing very slow phones on apps that use internet. We have checked our router internet speed and that seems fine. Anyone else have this issue in a multiple pixel household? \nThanks!",
