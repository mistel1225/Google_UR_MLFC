    "content": "Hey,\n\nSince the Android 11 update was installed, I wasn't able to play any games with my controller anymore (I mainly play Call of Duty mobile). It still connects to my bluetooth and the touchpad works, but the games don't \"see\" the controller. \nI already facory reset.\n\nThanks",
