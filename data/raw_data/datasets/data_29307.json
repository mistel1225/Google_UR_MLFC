    "content": "Hi,\n\nabout 3 weeks ago my pixel 2 screen turned black all of a sudden but the phone was functioning fine with everything else like Mic, speaker etc.\n\nI raised a ticket and my phone was picked up in 2 days with an assurance to have it returned in 7 working days.\n\nIts been 3 weeks now and neither the service team nor customer care team have a proper understanding of the issue or they are just holding back to find excuses every single time I interact with them on call or emails.\n\nThey exclaimed that my phone has screen damage, water damage, display chip faulty and what not. And when I questioned they said it was erroneously typed.\n\nThere are about 20 mails back and forth (until today) in which there are different sort of judgements and procrastination from the google support team.\n\nThey keep on saying that 'we have sent you the estimation of INR 9,500' but i never received any such email until this day even after checking my spam mailbox. \n\nMy only question is that if there is a physical damage which has happened internally it should be covered under the warranty terms. I even shared a video with my technician who picked up my device and there is no physical damage on the phone to which even he agreed as well.\n\nI am facing a lot of issues with my phone gone away. Please Help!!!\n\nMy initial service ticket number GL0074545\n\nAdit",
