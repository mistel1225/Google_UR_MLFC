    "content": "It seems there have been a lot of instances where the back of the phones coming apart. From what I've read it's an issue with the battery. If it's an isolated incident I can understand Google saying it's not their problem. But there have been a lot of complaints shit the same issue. I'm having buyers remorse right about now. I've been a loyal Google customer for years. If this is the path they're going down then I can't follow them. The warranty expired back in Feb. It's pretty shitty they won't fix what seems to be an issue with their hardware. Guess they haven't learned anything from their class action lawsuits",
