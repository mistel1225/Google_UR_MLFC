    "content": "I bought the pixel 4a recently, initially I would swipe up and hold for a brief moment to activate the application switcher. In the past few days (maybe since Android 11 update?) I have to swipe up and hold for at least 5 to 10 seconds before the app switcher activates. It has become very cumbersome to switch efficiently between apps.\n\nCan anyone shed light on this? Is there a setting that could be adjusted to make it quicker?",
