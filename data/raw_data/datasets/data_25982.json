    "content": "I have a Pixel 3 and a connected USB SD card reader/writer. \nI can see the card in Files, however can’t figure out how to copy or move my photos to the card. \nI’ve downloaded a couple of apps, however none recognize my reader. \nI am off-grid with limited data connectivity, so uploading to Drive is not an option as I have more than 20GB of photos I want to move.",
