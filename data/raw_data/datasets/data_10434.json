    "title": "\"These notifications can't be modified\" when trying to answer phone calls from home screen",
    "content": "I have a colleague who just got a new Pixel 4a, and whenever she's using her device (the screen is not locked) and a call comes in with the pop up notification, she gets an error when she taps 'Answer' saying \"These notifications can't be modified\". She's unable to answer the call until she taps 'Done' after which the call answers. \n\nI've worked through all of the notification settings with her and haven't been able to figure out why she's getting this message whenever she tries to answer a call, and can't find anything online after hours of searching. \n\nDo we know why this message might be popping up?",
