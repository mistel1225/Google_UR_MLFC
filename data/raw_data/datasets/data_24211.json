I did not notice this while I was there.\n- I am in Japan, where motion gestures are disabled. \n- I was recently on a trip to Australia, and also could not get the motion photo function to turn on.\n\nBelow is a photo of what I see in the camera app:\n\nhttps://photos.app.goo.gl/VWS3TqLDMaU9Ze897\n\nHow can I get this enabled?",
