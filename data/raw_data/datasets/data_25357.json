    "title": "Cannot load android system after reboot",
    "content": "I had two accounts on the device. I decided to remove secondary one and reboot the phone. After that, whenever I try turning the phone on I get message that says \"Cannot load Android system...\". I've unsuccessfully tried sideloading latest OTA for Pixel 3. Sideloading goes OK but issue remains. \n\nIs there any way to rescue data on the device?\n\nI noticed there is a \"Rescue Mode\" option in bootloader and that adb on my PC shows device as \"host\" when it is enabled. Can that mode be used to somehow rescue data? I haven't found any info on using that mode.\n\nIf anything else fails and I choose to do factory reset, is there any way to recover data after that?\n\nNote that bootloader is locked.",
