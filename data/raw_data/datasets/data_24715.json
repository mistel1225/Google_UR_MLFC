    "content": "This phone sucks!! Its stuck in the setup part of the phone for over an hour called “checking for data” its not frozen but it will not move to the next screen which would be “choose what to copy” customer service did not help after talking to them for 40mins all they did was read the directions to me even though i am capable of reading them myself online which i did prior to the phone call. I see another forum with the question but no answers!! I turned off what i had too, i am on the same wifi, they are charged, i am using the cords, i have done everything i had to",
