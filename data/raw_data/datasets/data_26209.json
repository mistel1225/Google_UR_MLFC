    "content": "I just bought a pixel 4, and when I was in a country which I can use the motion sense, everything is smooth and easy to unlock my phone. But when I travel to somewhere soli restricted country, the phone just lost their promoted function, is there something Google can do to make the chips activate all the time after I already activated that? Or at least they can make more country available even they didn't release on .",
