    "content": "My touchscreen seems so have some spots that are unresponsive. It is most noticable when using the keyboard. The problem is around letters \"R\" and \"T\". That general area. I can still click those letters after a few tries but it's getting annoying. What can I do? Is my screen broken? Any help is appreciated. Thank you.",
