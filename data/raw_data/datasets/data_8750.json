    "content": "I'm posting this here because I couldn't see anyone mentioning this exact problem anywhere. Cellular data is in general unreliable as sometimes it stops working and I need to restart the phone. But this is quiet rare and the main problem is as soon as I turn on the hotspot, 4g starts to stutter. The connection comes and goes for periods of a few seconds which causes frequent cuts on connected devices. I have already tried to deactivate the adaptive connectivity and \"turn off hotspot automatically\". My SIM card is fine in other phones in terms of wifi hotspot.",
