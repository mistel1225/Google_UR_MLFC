    "content": "All of a sudden the touchscreen stopped working. The turn on/off button, and volume are working fine, however when i use the touchscreen it does not respond. I've made a hard reset already, and now i can't use the phone. If i try to put volume up or down the screen shows the pop up and it works, but touchscreen is not working. Have you experienced something like this before?",
