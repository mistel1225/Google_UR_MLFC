    "content": "I have a buzzing/Static/Crackling noise from thr top speaker of Pixel 3 - this can be heard on any call but can also be heard when the phone is not on a call when my ear is pressed to the top speaker - it can be heard when the device is in standby too as well as safe mode. \n\nI have spoken to google who have RMAed my device and sent me a replacement with the same issue. My partner has the same Pixel 3 with the same issue. \n\nWe are both on the Optus Australia network + I have read numerous reports of this online. Is it worthwhile exchanging the device again or simply returning both of them. I doubt it's a fault if 3 devices are doing it.\n\nDoes google recognize this problem and can it be patched or should I return the device for a refund? \n\nThanks\nJosh",
