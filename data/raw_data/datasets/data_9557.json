    "content": "I've been using my Pixel 5 for 2 days now and it is has an average battery life of 12.5 hours, with around 4.5 hours of screen time. I do not have Smooth screen turned on and have had night mode turned on! With adaptive battery running at all times. Surely this is not normal? Every review I have read reports a battery life that goes well into the next day? Mine is barely lasting me one.",
