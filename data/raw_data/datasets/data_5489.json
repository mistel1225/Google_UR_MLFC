    "title": "Adaptive Sound kicks in when connected to car audio, is there a way to limit this behavior?",
    "content": "I have adaptive sound turned on and connect to my cars bluetooth, when I listen to my music, the volume lowers to the point I can barely hear it without turning up the cars volume, but then it lowers again.  Turning off adaptive sound and restarting the device fixes the issue, but I prefer adaptive sound normally.",
