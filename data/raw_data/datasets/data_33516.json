    "title": "Brand new pixel 3XL super slow, always freezing, terrible mapping guidance, generally glitchy",
    "content": "I just got a new Pixel 3XL in December and was super excited to switch from Apple because my brother had a pixel and the quality looked so much better. However I am so dissappointed as the brand new pixel is constantly freezing while typing, certain apps don't even work (Snapchat will always say not responding, wait or close the app), the mapping system says I'm places that I'm not, and clicking links from messages almost never works. It also takes forever and a day to load almost anything on both wifi and LTE. is the common to pixels or is it an out of the box manufacturing error? I am an EMT on an ambulance and rely on quick mapping guidance to calls and the freezing problems and slowness have caused huge issues at work.",
