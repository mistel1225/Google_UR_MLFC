    "content": "I have the Pixel 4XL and the mic on my bluetooth headphones will not pick up sound outside of phone calls. Phone calls work as expected but if I try to use the assistant the phone defaults to it's onboard mic (it will not use the headphone mic). My headset and it's mic worked just fine with my Pixel 2. I'm running into the same issue with the bluetooth connection in my car. Anyone run into this and find a solution?",
