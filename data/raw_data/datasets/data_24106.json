    "title": "Since Android 10 my lock screen occasionally flickers on and off",
    "content": "Especially shortly after sleeping the device, when Ambient display is on, the time/date and battery percentage at the bottom of the screen may start flickering on and off, irregularly for several seconds. Its not waking up at this point so the rest of the screen remains black and the live wallpaper doesn't appear at all, just the ambient display is flickering. Usually if I wake the phone up with the power button and sleep it again, it stops. But this happens quite frequently. Only noticed it since 10/Q and have seen others mention it on reddit etc.",
