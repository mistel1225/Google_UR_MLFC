    "content": "I have 3 pairs of USB-C Pixel earbuds. They've worked without issue since I bought them a couple months ago. Suddenly yesterday they stopped working as headsets. They work as headphones but when I'm on a call the dialer no longer shows the headset as an option - The button only lets me turn speakerphone on and off. I've tried booting into Safe Mode with no change in behavior. I then found the settings deep in Google Assistant that listed one pair of USB-C headphones but they showed as disconnected. I removed them from the Google Assistant and now when I plug in the headphones nothing happens - Previously the Assistant wizard would fire up. What else can I do?",
