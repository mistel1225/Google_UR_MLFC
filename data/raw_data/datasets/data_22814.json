    "content": "When using bluetooth on my Pixel 3XL (Android 10) I don't receive Google Messages sound notifications through the phone speaker (but ringtones do come through the phone speaker). The sound notifications for Google Messages come through my headset. The issue is, I don't wear my headset unless I'm on a call. Is there a setting I'm not finding to turn on Google Messages notifications so they can be heard through the phone speaker, so I don't miss notifications when I'm not wearing the headset?",
