    "content": "So after updating to the Q beta my Pixel 3 XL soft bricked. As the bootloader was unlocked I could not reflash the factory image or enter recovery mode. Google accepted this and I was given the RMA instructions. I sent my device off straightaway to their warehouse in Poland. 4 days later I received a notification that it had arrived at the warehouse and had been signed for. All good, I waited for the shipping notification for the my replacement. 10 days passed and nothing. I contacted support and they said it had been signed for but it had not been checked into to the warehouse system. Oh dear. It would need to be escalated to their 'higher tier support' for investigation. 4 days pass and still nothing, on speaking to support again they say they have no way to contact the 'higher tier' and I just need to wait. This could go on and on. I think is crazy as if they have issues with their warehouse they should deal with them internally. it isn't my issue. I just need my phone. Would appreciate any advice from this sub on what I should do next?",
