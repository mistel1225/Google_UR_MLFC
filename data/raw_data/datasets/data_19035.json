    "content": "Pixel 4 was never launched in India.\nI am an avid user of Google pixel, all coz of its benchmarking camera quality, unlimited photo backups and early updates.\n\nNot much of a lag I face, many prompt services.. all smooth and nice.\n\nAlready 2 yrs gone, planned to buy a new phone and pixel 4 haven't yet launched although coz of its pros that helped to capture it's business, but seems like it was removed and had become it's cons. \nEager about Pixel 5,\nI hope there is some development or wondering, if it will ever get launched ? If Google has dropped out of the market probably I should look into buying something else.\nHoping to see pixel launch again successfully.\nPlease keep the updates on pixel 5 but plz don't do any leaks like you did with pixel 4&4xl.\n\nRegards,\nRoopa",
