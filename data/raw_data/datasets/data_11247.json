    "content": "Hi,\n\nSince I switched from my Pixel 4 to the Pixel 5 I had some Problems with BLE.\nIn a App used to see all BLE devices that are near the phones I see a big difference between the two phones (Both phones on Android 11). I tried multiple apps and I always see the same difference between the phones. Even in my own App with debugging active I couldn't see the reason for that difference.\n\n\nNow my question: Is that a hardware/Firmware issue on Google's side or is thee something major that changed between the two phones?\n\nWhat I tried:\nRestarting the Phone\nTurning off/on Bluetooth (as far as killing the Bluetooth Service)\nDebugging with Android Studio to see if the Logs would help identify the issue",
