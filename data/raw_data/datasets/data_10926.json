    "title": "I've seen alot about this, but maybe someone had success. Pixel 3xl will no longer charge by cable.",
    "content": "Looks like this is a common issue with 3xl, but has ANYONE found a solution for phone won't charge by cable. I've factory reset several times, of I try to switch the usb , I get the analog error message that never goes away. I've tried multiple, multiple cables. It's not like 3xl is still under warranty and I find it funny it started doing this the month the 5 dropped. We don't all work for Google and have just extra money lying around. I'd be more willing to upgrade I'd they could fix this issue that seems to be rampant.",
