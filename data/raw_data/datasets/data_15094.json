    "content": "I tried forget network , then forget network settings which didn't help so I had to factory reset. Which worked fine untill few days and again same issue all of a sudden .. again I followed same steps and did factory reset as last option and now it's working fine.. need to know why it's happening. It wastes lot of time to reset everything again.",
