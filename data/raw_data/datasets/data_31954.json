    "content": "Strobing while in use. Raising the brightness seems to give temporary relief. Will a software update fix this? (Or shall I give up and take my phone back - is only a few months old). Is this a problem with all pixel 3s? My eyes are still hurting nearly 10 mins later. I'm pretty annoyed with this now as I had to turn off the ambient display the other day to stop it flashing when being locked. What's the point of having a pixel 3 if I have to start turning features off / wasting battery on screen brightness.",
