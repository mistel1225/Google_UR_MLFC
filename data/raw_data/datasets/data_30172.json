    "content": "I am trying to set up the Google Pixel 3a XL SIM Free, so can we really connect to a wireless service, or is this a joke?  The US Military Fiber Chaff, spider webs dropped from drones doesn't help my connection get any better, & just makes my allergies worse!  I don't like this kind of fiber!  If you want to drop maryjuana bud from the Air Force Jets, it won't help my connection get faster, my price won't get lower, it won't help free communication service but it can serve a practical purpose with maryjuana bud fibers dropping out of the sky, tens of thousands of WEED MAN BUD parachuting out of airplanes, so I can't smoke them!  People will be happy with legal flower fiber buds!  I don't know how to connect if this is not a joke of some sort!  Please help!",
