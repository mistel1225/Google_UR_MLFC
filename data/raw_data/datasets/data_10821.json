    "title": "Pixel 5: All sensors have stopped working (Proximity, Light intesity, compass, gyro...)",
    "content": "The sensors have worked in the beginning (I am sure because I can see photos being taken the right way round at first). After a couple of days the phone rebooted a few times consequently. When it stopped, all sensors stopped working:\nI have no more compass on Google Maps,\nOrientation is not changing in any app, photos are stored wrong way round\nProximity during a phone call does not work at all (phone next to ear does not switch off the screen, have to manually do this)\nScreen Brightness is no longer auto adjusting.\nI now get system UI stopped working errors quite often. I assume something software is now affected by this defect, too.\n\nI did nothing to this phone. When the reboots happened, it was lying on the coffee table not being touched. I can only think of two things: Some big software issue but can't find clues to that anywhere else on the web so I actually assume the sensor bar is not correctly attached or broken in my hardware.",
