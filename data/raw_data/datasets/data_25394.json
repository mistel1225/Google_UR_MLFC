    "title": "Android 10 latest update bug: my phone now restarts itself constantly and opens the camera by itself",
    "content": "The latest Android 10 software update released last week (I think) has forced my phone to restart (I had been ignoring the update request as I am travelling for 6 months and didn't want any issues), since doing the update it now opens my camera and restarts constantly. Does anyone else have these issues? Does anyone have a fix or shall I reset to factory settings?",
