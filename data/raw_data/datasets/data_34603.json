    "content": "My Pixel 2 will shutdown randomly when it hits 30% or below. I have factory reset the phone. Received a replacement phone from Google but the issue has surfaced back after installing Android 9 updates. Will be factory resting the phone one more time and setup the phone from a new state instead of copying down my backup.\n\nHas anyone else run into this issue?",
