    "content": "Using Android 11 on a Pixel 4. I first noticed this problem about a month ago and it has been happening constantly ever since. While in the middle of typing, if I accidentally touch the bottom of the screen the keyboard will retract down and whatever I was typing will often be lost. Note that I'm not talking about the arrow at the bottom left of the screen, this happens from contact at any part of the bottom of the screen. On further inspection it seems that just touching the bottom of the screen doesn't do it, but any amount of swiping in any direction will cause it.",
