    "content": "Sometimes I can't hear people when they call and I think it is a pocket call and hang up. (Google Pixel 3A) Recently, I have lost calls while talking to someone. They can hear me and I can't hear them so I hang up. There is no problem with the signal.  I bought the phone in the spring this year, so it is fairly new. I have had two other Google phones but never this issue",
