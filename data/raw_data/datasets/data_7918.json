    "content": "I keep getting a message that the attached device is not compatible with my Pixel 5 when trying to connect headphones. Tried in Safe Mode, no result. Tried with different headphones, other usb-c to 3,5 mm adapter and no result, I get the same message and no sound through the headphones.\nIt seems like a hardware issue with a brand new Pixel 5 phone.",
