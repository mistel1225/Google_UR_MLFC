    "content": "If I firmly press parts of the screen I get pink bands\n\nSometimes the screen takes a few seconds to light up. Sometimes it doesn't light up at all. Firmly pressing near the middle of the screen turns the screen off\n\nRestarting my phone seems to bring the screen back until the problem comes back again\n\nIâ€™ve also gotten a weird glitch where the screen looks like a nuked meme or is all staticky with a blue tint",
