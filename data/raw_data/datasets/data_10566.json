    "content": "Hi, after the update to android 11 tha audio via the audio jack is extremly low compared to android 10. The audio via bluetooth seems to work correctly.\n\nAlso, street view in Google maps lags like hell and is barely usable.\n\nI've already tried to enter safe mode but nothing changes. Any help?",
