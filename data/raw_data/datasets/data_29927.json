    "content": "My phone was having issues, where I couldn't charge it unless I did a restart first. Today, my battery drained to zero, when I plugged it in, it won't charge now.  When I plug it in, there will be a grey charging icon, but that goes away to a flashing circle of white dots.\n\nIf I hold the power button, it will turn on to the lock screen and then immediately crash. If I unplug it, it will have a red power icon showing insufficient charge.",
