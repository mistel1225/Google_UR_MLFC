    "title": "My pixel3a isn't able to do video on whatsapp, connection is always poor, regardless. Solutions?",
    "content": "It seems pixel 3a cant keep up with video. It happens regardless of the location and others next to me are able to connect fine with their phones. Very frustrating since I use whatsapp to talk to remote family. I shut off other apps and dont use that many to begin with. It sends my camera video to my family but doesnt show me their video, just voice due to alleged \"poor connection\". But it happens on my fast home network as well as my GF network.  Meanwhile GF phone (non pixel) works fine as well as other devices. Any solutions?",
