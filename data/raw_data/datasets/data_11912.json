    "content": "I am from Kochi, Kerala. I have been unable to place an order of the Pixel 4a.  I tried a few pin codes in the hopes of getting it delivered to my friends in Delhi, Bangalore or Mumbai which is counterproductive activity to get my hands on a phone. I tried to purchase it on the launch date and today also. \nI mostly tried the other pin codes to know if the delivery issue was an isolated event, but turns out it is not. \nThe Pixel 4a Flipkart page has around 100 or so reviews, some from places close to my area and now these pin codes seem to be 'undeliverable'.\nThis is some serious lapse on Flipkart's part or they're just botching the numbers of sale.\nIt is even more disheartening to see that after reading similar complaints on the Google help page, Google seems to have completely written off this situation and no accountability has been demanded from Flipkart.\nA message such as one above does no good on someone else's thread.",
