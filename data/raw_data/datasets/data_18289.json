    "content": "My wife’s pixel 3a has a weird problem where the microphone doesn’t work but the speaker does on phone calls, but for video calls, speaker phone, etc, the mic works but the speakers don’t.  Tried on normal phone and multiple apps (WhatsApp, Facebook, etc). Video recording is able to pick up sound and playback. And it sounds like the sound is coming from both the earpiece and  the bottom speaker.  \n\nAll the info I have. Tried updating software, multiple restarts, start in safe mode, and holding out for factory reset.  Any thoughts would be appreciated.",
