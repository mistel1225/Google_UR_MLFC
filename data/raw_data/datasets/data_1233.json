    "content": "Hi, just took my new Pixel 4a out of the box and was copying data, apps etc from old phone to new. Old phone's battery died during copying, so only half the data got copied over. would like to copy the rest -- call history, SMS history, etc -- but can't. the google help page says i should see `finish setting up Pixel' in settings but it's not there. do i need to do a factory reset? thanks",
