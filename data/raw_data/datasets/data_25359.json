    "content": "I have a pixel (1) and just upgraded to Android 10. The keyboard is totally on the fritz now. Typing will open apps, pull down the top menu bar, the back or home button will open. Gestures are impossible, I can only type one letter at a time. The cursor will jump up or down lines. I did a factory reset and it's continued. Is there a way to back to 9?",
