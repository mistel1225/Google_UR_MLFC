    "content": "Hi, so I dropped my Pixel 4a into water 3 days ago. I had a notification that there was liquid or debris in the USB-C port and that it was disabled. I left it to dry, checked it yesterday and the notification was still there. A few minutes later I got one saying that it was okay to use the USB port.\n\nAssuming everything was ok I started to use the phone again. I was playing a game on my phone and as i was playing the screen wouldn't register more than 1 finger on the screen at the one time. I downloaded a multitouch tester app and that also on registered 1 finger when i had 2/3 fingers on the screen. \n\nThe portion of the screen not working is at the top. Below the notification bar and a few centimeters below that. The rest of the phone is fine. When I try to press this part of the screen, for example, posting a tweet or pressing the settings on apps like Google Chrome, it either does not register or the notification bar pulls down.\n\nIs there a way to fix this or is my Phone done for?\n\nThank you.",
