    "content": "My Pixel XL serving by Verizon is just more than 2-yr-old and I have no problem other than the one below:\nI notice that my phone always shows a notification “WIFI DISCONNECTED” but re-connects within a second. As it never causes me problem, I just ignore it until I used it abroad last year.\nAs I had a local phone there, I disconnected the DATA usage in my Verizon Pixel XL and only used it inside the hotel room with free WIFI. After I came back home and received my Verizon bill, I was charged very small amounts of data usage everyday there.\nAt first I did not know what happened as I was sure I did not use any Verizon data and the usages were very short time. Then I figured out the data charges should be caused by the short interruption of free WIFI connection inside the hotel which it was the only source of problem.",
