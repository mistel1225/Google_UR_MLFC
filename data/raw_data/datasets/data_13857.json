    "content": "Before upgrading to Android 11, icons for my running apps would be displayed in the status bar. Ex: if YouTube Music is open in the background and I'm listening to music, there's no notification icon at the top when I swipe down to quickly go to the app or manage playback controls in the banner. Same with Waze -- Waze is running but I can't quickly get to it from the notification bar or banner. This all changed with Android 11 and I can't figure out how to get them back! It's like I have to bring up all running apps and scroll through to get to the one I want to control playback.",
