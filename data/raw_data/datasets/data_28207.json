    "content": "Dear Googlers,\n\nAfter updating my Google Pixel 3XL my phone wasn't working right. I had to Factory Reset and it worked, but now it turned off and I'm still struggling. I understand this is a space for the community and volunteers to help, but if you know there is such a big issue with your latest update, I'd expect an official warning and detailed instructions on how to fix it. I've been searching on the web and this is not an isolated issue. Please help.",
