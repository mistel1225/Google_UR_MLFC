    "content": "Yesterday my battery suddenly started draining extremely quickly, going from 50% to shutdown within a minute. It has never happened before, but now has happened multiple times in the past 24 hours. When I plug it in to charge, it won't charge above 10% or so. Here (https://postimg.cc/PvnTnGV1) is a picture of my battery usage graph. There is a sudden drop to zero, and then when it climbs back up it quickly plateaus.",
