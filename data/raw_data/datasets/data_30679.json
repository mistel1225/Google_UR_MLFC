    "title": "Returned Pixel phone - Google not crediting account",
    "content": "Has anyone returned their phone due to damaged packaging or device, and Google won't provide a credit to the account because their warehouse can't figure things out?\n\nI received a nice FedEx box with my new Pixel 3 phone but inside the box was a damaged box. FedEx clearly was covering it up. I returned the device to Google and then ordered a Pixel 3a. It's been over 4 weeks and I still can't get Google to credit my account because 'their warehouse hasn't verified the package contents'. I'm now having to make a payment on a device I never even touched and did return immediately, with pictures and tracking #s to prove it, but Google doesn't care. AND, I worked at Google for 10 years -- I'm a huge fan -- but this is ridiculous. \n\nLongshot but wondering if others have experienced this and how did you/they get it resolved. \nfrustrated",
