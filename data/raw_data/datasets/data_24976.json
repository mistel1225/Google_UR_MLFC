    "content": "So, I got a Pixel 4 XL for myself for Christmas as I've needed a new phone for quite awhile. But for whatever reason during the setup process it mentions needing Xfinity Mobile, even though it's an unlocked phone, and I'm a Tmobile user. For a bit I wondered if they sent me a 4 XL that WASN'T unlocked, but their team swore it IS, it's just some apparent software issue. Their support team is aware of this issue and that \"it's being worked on\", the thing that sucks is that I've seen people complaining about this issue for the past two weeks and it still isn't resolved...\n\nHave any of you experienced this yet? Have you heard of a projected time frame? This whole thing is pretty damn awful. It's like I'm financing a $800+ tablet since I can't even use it as a phone, haha. Thank goodness I still have my previous phone to use in the meantime.",
