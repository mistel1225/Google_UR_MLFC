    "content": "I have a Pixel 5. Very happy with it so far - for me it's seems like my perfect phone (although early days).\n\nI just applied a Spigen Camera Lens protector. However it isn't very well designed as it doesn't line up exactly right, therefore I will most likely return - BUT now I need to know...\nWhat are all the induvial sensors on the rear camera module?\nI can tell it's main sensor, ultra wide & flash. Then top left (as pictured) would be microphone? \nThe bottom one is what's mainly obscured by the protectors design - and I cant find anywhere online what it is! And therefore I've no idea how much it matter that it's ever so slightly covered?!\n\nLike I say I will probably return them as it's not the standard I expect from Spigen - but I need to know - thanks in advance!!",
