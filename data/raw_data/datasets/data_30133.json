    "content": "Over the last few months my Google Pixel has started randomly powering off. The unit does not go through the shutdown process it just goes dark. This happens in all apps but seems to happen most often in the camera app. (That might be because I use that app most often) If I wait for an hour or so the Pixel will reboot and be ok but until then it will not finish start up before going dark again.\n\nAny ideas?",
