    "content": "Music keeps pausing for no reason! I keep researching as to why, try all the fixes, wait for updates and it still persists across all music-playing apps including Google's own Youtube music which I pay extra for!\n\nIf this doesn't get fixed ASAP, I'm going to have to leave the pixel and Google Fi family!\n\nPlease help, I'm losing my mind!\n\nWhy can't this fancy expensive phone just play music?",
