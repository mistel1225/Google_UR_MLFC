    "content": "I've been using WhatsApp normally but since 2-3 months ago I haven't been able to tap the app and open my chat list. Whenever I do it just shows \"WhatsApp keeps stopping\".  However, if i use widget to open individual chat box, I am able to chat with specific person/ group normally.\n\nIn this sense, I'm not able to backup/ manage my chats since these functions are only accessible on WhatsApp main screen. I really want this to be fixed!! I tried clearing cache or uninstalling the app and reinstalled afterwards, none of them have helped!!  However, I don't wanna uninstall nor \"clear storage\" at app info since my recent chats will all be vanished after last update around 2 months ago.\n\nI've sent crash reports to WhatsApp a few times but they never replied me!!  Anyone have faced similar issues and teach me how to fix it? Would be so much abliged!!!",
