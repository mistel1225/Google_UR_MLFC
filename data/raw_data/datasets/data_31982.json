    "content": "Hello, I'm having a major issue with my Pixel 3. My carrier Vodafone UA does not support VoLTE, only LTE. When I pick LTE the mobile data works perfectly,but to make calls and receive calls is not possible. iTs automatically switched to 3G mode, despite the calls still can't be made. So the primary function of phone is not working. Only when I switch manually to 3G in settings I can call and receive calls.\nI kindly ask you to check this issue and help me to solve it.\n\nThank you in advance",
