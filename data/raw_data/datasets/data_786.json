    "content": "I have photos of 2019 on my phone. When I go to email them to my computer from my phone or upload the photos to a printing service not all of the photos show up in order to be included. I have also used a USB to download directly from my phone to my computer and same problem, not all the photos are showing up. I can scroll through the photos and see the pictures are there.",
