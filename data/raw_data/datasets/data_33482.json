    "content": "My phone is 2 months old. I am currently traveling in Sweden and my phone keeps freezing and crashing while it is on roaming. I have done roaming in 2 other countries without this issue, and definitely does not happen while I am in my home country. The roaming partner has a poor network but still, the phone shouldn't freeze and restart every 15 minutes. It is fine when it is on WIFI, only when I am out and about / using the network roaming data. Anybody else has this issue?",
