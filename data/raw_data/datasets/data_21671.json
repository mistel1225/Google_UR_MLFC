    "content": "I can't pick up incoming calls. I can hear them, and at one point (but no longer) I could answer from the drop down notification window, but I cannot answer them. Sometimes the problem has gone away, but quickly recurs. At the moment, for a period of weeks, no incoming calls at all seem to be answer-able. This problem has persisted for over 6 months. I have already tried un-updating the phone app, clearing its storage and cache, and restarting the phone. Can anyone help?",
