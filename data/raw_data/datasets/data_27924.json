    "content": "Hi,\nI have a pixel 3 and I have multiple complaints that I need to reach support about, however I cannot reach support, I use the \"request callback\" method and it says someone will call me back but no one called in the past 15-20 times I used this method.\n\nThis is really frustrating, the last time I was able to reach support was through chat (in the webbrowser since the chat option does not show in my phone) but it seems that the option for chatting from the website is gone.",
