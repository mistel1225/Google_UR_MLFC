    "title": "Android 11 bricked my phone and Customer Service just told me to buy a new one - advice?",
    "content": "Since the 11 update, my phone started randomly crashing and going into hours-long boot loops - it happened at exactly the same time on two consecutive mornings, then twice more on the second day and now it's not even looping, it just hangs at the Google logo then shuts off.\n\nI contacted CS and they assured me it's a hardware fault, in spite of it being perfectly fine before the update and multiple others reporting the same issue - kinda feels like someone sold me a car, waited til the warranty ran out, then smashed in the windows and billed me for repairs.\n\nDoes anyone know how to get this sorted, or at least get Google to accept some culpability? I've always had good experiences with their CS before, it's why I stuck with Nexus and then Pixel for so long, but this is atrocious.",
