    "content": "Hi, After my partner having a pixel 3XL for a couple weeks, she got sent a replacement due to a fault in the speakers during phone calls. The new device has a clear battery drainage issue. From a full charge, the battery drains extremely quickly even when in a bag, or just being used in the car for spotify. \n\nWhen we look at the battery usage since last full charge, the % shown for each app doesnt add up to the total battery loss. For example if the battery is at 50%, the apps show a total of 15% used but there is an unaccounted for 35%! The phone was taken back to the shop she bought it from (Carphone warehouse) who sent it away, they run a diagnostic test, which showed no faults, and they completed a factory reset (Which had been done several times before to try and fix the issue). And no surprise to us, the phone has been returned with the same battery issue. We've spoken to Google on the phone who suggested to factory reset, check through apps battery drainage % and to delete and apps that may cause it. \n\nAfter doing all steps, still the battery drains way to fast. My Pixel 2XL Battery lasts longer which I've had for 1 year and 7 months, and her Pixel 3XL she's had for a few months.\n\nAlso on top of that, the USB-C port doesn't work with the earphones that came in the box, or the USB-C to AUX converter, which is also an inconvenience. Not sure if these issues are related.\n\nPlease could anyone assist? \n\nthanks in advance\n\nJack",
