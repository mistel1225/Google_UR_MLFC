    "content": "Incoming calls are not overlayed on the screen. In fact I can't even see the incoming calls! \n\nI only see the missed call notifications and even then I have to click the phone app to see if I've had any calls to begin with. I've missed some very important calls and this is worrying me deeply now. How is something so ridiculously simple and fundamental not working? My old Pixel worked fine.\n\nCan you provide some detailed steps please to get this working as normal?\n\nThanks.",
