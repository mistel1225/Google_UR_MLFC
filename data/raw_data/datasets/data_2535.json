    "content": "I recently moved into an apartment building that has a phone number in the intercom system so that someone who shows up could click my name, it would call my phone, I would answer and press “9” on my cellphone and it would unlock the front door for them. Pretty straightforward. \nExcept that it doesn't work on my phone :(  the intercom will call my phone, and I can answer the call, but when I press \"9\" it won't unlock the front door. The Apartment Manager isn't sure what's wrong because this has never been an issue for him in the 5 years he's worked here. I have the VoLTE disabled on my phone and it still doesn't work. No 5G on my phone... I'm not using 3G or 2G either....I really am at a loss as to why this isn't working. Would someone be able to help me out?",
