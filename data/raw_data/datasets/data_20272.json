    "content": "Want battery to last longer than it has been.\nI've been using battery saver mode and adaptive battery mode is on as well and phone drains 5x faster than it used to. I got rid of any apps that could drain battery and changed settings to only have apps use my data when I have them open.\nThis issue started 4 months ago and I kept trying different things to fix the issue with no luck",
