    "content": "Hi,\n\nWas out of town and left my charger.  It will be a few days before I get it back.\n\nI found an old Nintendo plug in/charger which fits as it has a USB-C connector.  It works. It says something about 5.V and 15V.  \n\nI also have an Apple 87W charger with a USB-C.   \n\nBoth ok to use (in the meantime).\n\nThank you!\n\nTom",
