    "content": "I have google contacts (that uses fields) and Verizon contacts (that uses groups). On my samsung I had the ringtone set to silent so I didn't hear any ring for people not in my contacts. I've tried changing the \"account\" to Verizon only and not showing my many duplicate google contacts (merge doesn't really merge), so that I could go back to setting a ringtone for my 4 groups and silent for anyone not in my contacts. I've had the phone a week today and cannot find that this is doable on the pixel 4.",
