    "title": "\"Google keeps stopping\" message appears and the screen flickers every time I unlock my Pixel.",
    "content": "I recently updated to Android 10 and have been receiving the \"Google keeps stopping\" message any time I unlock my Pixel or try to navigate to any apps on the device.  The screen also flickers while this message is displayed.  Clicking \"close app\" does not clear the message, nor does \"view app info\".  I've sent feedback several times.  Any updates on how to resolve this issue would be helpful as it's extremely annoying.",
