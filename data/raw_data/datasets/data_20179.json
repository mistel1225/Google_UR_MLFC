    "content": "It's been 5 months and 10 days, since I got my Pixel 3a xl from FLIPKART. Am in love with the device. Today I was extremely disappointed to notice BLUE spots (irregularly shaped), on bottom and bottom right of my screen, when in use.\n\n\n2 Pics here....\n\n\nDon't know how it happened. Never dropped phone, never overcharged, never any moisture.....etc..Took care like a prize.",
