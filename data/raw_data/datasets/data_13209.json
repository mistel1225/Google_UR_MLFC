    "content": "I am using my Pixel 4 since August. Since the very beginning, the screen stopped working for short period of time, but then eventually worked. I saw many people had similar issues with the phone. Last time it turned black and never started to work again (more than a week ago). It charges, it vibrates, but the screen is black all the time. The website has not been of any help to me. It should still be under warranty as the phone was purchased few months ago. I tried to reach out to customer service, but nothing seems to work. Please, help.",
