    "content": "Pixel 3 fingerprint won't work! I've made sure the sensor and my finger are both sparkling clean, I've registered the same finger twice, reset my fingerprint a couple of time. It works at the beginning (right after deleting fingerprints and setting them up again) but after about a day it stops working. And without the face-id I've got to use the pin which is frustrating, especially after the last Android 10 update which made it harder to swipe up the keypad to enter the pin (if you don't swipe it all the way, it jumps back down)\nVery annoying. Starting to regret my choice of device, although I am very satisfied with my other Google devices.",
