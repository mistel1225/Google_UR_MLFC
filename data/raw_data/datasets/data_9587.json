    "content": "A hail mary, but what the hey.\n\nHave a Pixel 1 that's been sitting in a drawer for a year.  Want to give it to my kid to play around on.\n\nTHe screen appears to be dead.  I've done all of the charging troubleshooting.  \nI've connected the Pixel to my laptop, and Windows recognizes it as a device.  If I do a hard reboot (hold down power button) or factory reset (power + volume down) the laptop seems to recognize the Pixel disconnecting and reconnecting.\n\nBut the screen is dark.  No charging icon, no nothing.  Is this phone a brick?",
