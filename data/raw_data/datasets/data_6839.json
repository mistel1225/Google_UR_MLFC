    "content": "I am trying to uninstall an app. It was installed by accident. It was supposed to be a radar weather app and now I have something called southern gateway all over my phone. When I pull up the app it does not allow me to uninstall. I can only force stop but that doesn't remove all the excess stuff it's left all over my screens.",
