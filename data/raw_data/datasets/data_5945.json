    "content": "Restart phone, safe mode, another Sim card do not fix the issue. Raising volume during call makes echo worse, dropping till minimum reduces it, although still annoying for the other party. Using headphones fixes the issue. It seems that the microphone picks up the speaker sound during a normal phone call.",
