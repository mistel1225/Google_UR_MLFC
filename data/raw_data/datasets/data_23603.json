    "content": "I have a Pixel C 10.2\" tablet. I have been using it for about 2 years until a week ago that the display suddenly stopped to show anything. I successfully rebooted it by pressing the Power button and tapping the screen randomly (because the screen was all black).  The next day it happened again.  This time I found the screen was actually very very dim and I was not able to make it work again.\nDoes anyone know how to fix it?  I wanted to let Google to repair it but was unable to find any contact information on Google's website.\nThanks in advance.",
