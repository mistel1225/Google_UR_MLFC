    "content": "I forgot my screen unlock PIN on my PIxel 4XL and had to do a factory reset. When I loaded the new system I was asked to back up from Google account, however it asked me for my PIN from the old device. I dont have the pin, is there any way I could restore my back up from Google Drive or any other way without having a PIN? Thanks in advance.",
