    "content": "Replacement phone not being shipped despite repeated conversations with customer service\nI'm fed up with great service and I regret for buying this useless device spending 950$. Its been almost 3 weeks and had almost 20 to 30 emails and everytime I get the same response which says the order is in place and you will get an email with shipping information and never received any email. Initially they have sent a replacement to some where else and they have charged me on my credit card today for not sending my current device but how can I send my current device without receiving the replacement one?\n\nFed up and if possible provide refund atleast I can switch my device!!",
