    "content": "Just a comment;   The process of taking a photo and attaching it in an intelligent way to a reply e-mail in an existing mail thread is a PITA in the pixel 3xl current release.  I want to simply copy a picuture from album, paste as properly resized image into the e-mail and send.  Instead the pixel forces me to attach a massive image to the e-mail.  F- on usability / ease of use android/pixel/gmail team.  Booo.",
