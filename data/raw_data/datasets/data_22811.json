    "content": "After updating to Android 10 yesterday, my Pixel stopped sending and receiving audio during phone calls. This was the case both when using the phone itself and when using Android Auto through the USB connection in my car.\n\nI was, however, able to send and receive audio on a call using a Bluetooth headset.\n\nThus far I've tried resetting my network settings and clearing all storage in my Phone app.",
