    "content": "Woke up to my phone not on. Thought it might be an issues with the cord, so tried many different charging combinations and nothing will work. Tried connecting to a computer and computer doesn't recognize the phone. I tried holding the power button for over a minute and nothing. I bought a new battery thinking it was an issue. Installed the new battery and nothing. I don't see any charging lights and if I try to call the phone, it goes straight to voice mail. Phone is out of warranty. Is there anything else I can try. I still have the back cover loose, just encase there is a solution I can try on the inside. Loved the phone up to this point. Any help would be appreciated. If this is a known issue, Android needs to fix it.",
