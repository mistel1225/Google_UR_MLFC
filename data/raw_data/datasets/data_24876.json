    "content": "Hi,\n\nI got my Pixel 3A working with esim on T-Mobile. I want to use my work's ATT physical sim card at the same time with DSDS but the option os not available on my 3A running Android 10. I can only use one active network at the same time not both of them.\n\nIs there a way to fix this, to enable DSDS?\n\nThanks",
