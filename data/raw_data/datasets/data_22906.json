    "title": "Low Volume/Audio when connected via bluetooth",
    "content": "Ever since the January 1, 2018 patch the volume on my phone is much lower than it previously was when the phone was new. Especially in my car I now have to crank the volume up about 80% to get the same audio output I was getting in Oct-Dec at 55-60%.\n\nAlso watching video or playing any audio out of the phone speakers is now substantially lower. I know Google created some kind of patch to lessen a \"vibration\" issue people claimed to have but the speakers within the phone have a much lesser output as well. This is disappointing.\n\nAnd let me save you some time, no it's not network settings. It's not the connected device, yes the volume is up at 100% on the phone, yes certain settings have been reset, yes the phone has been tested in safe mode, etc...\n\nI'd like to see how widespread this issue is without the post getting shut down like others complaining of the same issue.",
