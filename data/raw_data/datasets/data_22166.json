    "content": "Hello, my Google Pixel (bought it <2 years ago). Won't charge anymore. I tried two different (working) cables. It is turned on yet and working, but will soon die. When it is plugged in, it heats up, but the battery is not being charged.\n\nThis is very urgent, because I am in Thailand right now and am flying back to Germany on tuesday. So I need my phone, because due to Corona, plans might change.",
