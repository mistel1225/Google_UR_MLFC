    "content": "Left picture is from my Pixel 2. Right picture is from my wife's Pixel 4. These photos were taken at the same time, with my Philips Hue lights set to red. Taken without night sight. With night sight, the Pixel 4 is kind of a pale yellow. So still not displaying the correct color. So far, red/orange seems to be the only color(s) that aren't displayed correctly. They are turned to yellow.",
