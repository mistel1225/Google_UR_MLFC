    "content": "Just now Google has announced Android 10 and release to the pixel phone. I have upgraded to Android 10 through OTA and found that there are some bugs on my phone and the battery life is very poor as well. Hence I would like to downgrade to Android 9 through sideload the factory image. However when I was going to toggle \"OEM unlocking\" option, the toggle is greyed out and I could not unlock my bootloader. According to the screen it said \"Connect to the Internet or contact your carrier\". So I contacted Verizon and they claimed that they have no responsibility to help me on this. What should I do now in order to downgrade my device back to Android 9 because the user experience is very poor and it is unacceptable.",
