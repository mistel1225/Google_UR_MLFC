    "title": "Volume slider randomly appears when viewing websites with videos in the by (YouTube/Reddit/9gag etc)",
    "content": " I don't know when it started (probably with the update?) But whenever I'm scrolling through YouTube/Facebook/Reddit or any website that has a video showing in the background (muted or not) the volume slider keeps on popping out. It's irritating because I can't replicate it. It just randomly does. Sometimes, it happens when I connect my Bluetooth headphones, or when I skip to the next video on YouTube or just randomly at times. What's causing this? Any way to disable this?",
