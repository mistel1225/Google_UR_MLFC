    "content": "Hey guys! \n\nI had a quick search but couldn't find any similar posts - is this a known bug? \n\nWhen I'm in Google Maps and try to share a link for a location, no contacts or apps are selectable after clicking Share. \n\nYou cannot slide the tray to see more contacts or apps, you cannot click to select, you can only close the pop-up using the X or going back to close. \n\nI previously had a Pixel 3 and this worked fine, but have since experienced when moving to the Pixel 4.\n\nAny help appreciated as it's a very annoying bug! \n\nThanks. \n\nNote: I've deleted the email contacts in the screenshot below for privacy, but these are displaying fine on my phone.
