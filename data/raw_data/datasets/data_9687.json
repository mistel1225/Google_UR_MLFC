    "content": "When I try to connect my phone (Pixel 4a) to the car's multimedia system (Sync 1), the phone shows an error when connected via Bluetooth, and at the bottom is a hint to restart the phone, after rebooting the phone does not connect to the multimedia system.\nI checked on phones from other manufacturers (Samsung, Apple) they connected to the system correctly and without errors. Then I took the model (Pixel 1) and it could not connect to the multimedia system, as well as my Pixel 4a, so this is not a problem with the multimedia of my car, other manufacturers' phones successfully connected, and Pixel 1 and Pixel 4a failed.\nMaybe you can send me an update for Bluetooth so I can connect to multimedia.",
