    "content": "Since upgrading to Android 10 my settings page is cluttered with useless Android 'slices'.\n\nI have every setting checked to disable WiFi scanning, yet if my WiFi is on and I open settings it shows me available WiFi networks to connect to.\n\nIf I turn off WiFi to get rid of the slices I then get a slice informing me that WiFi is turned off? I know its, I turned it off.\n\nPossibly the worst part is the slices don't actually render straight away, so I open settings and click the option I want, then the slices render and push everything down and the option I have already pressed is replaced with something different so I get taken to a screen I never wanted. Pretty good efficiencies Google.",
