    "title": "Prevent calls from ringing through BlueTooth headset while on a call",
    "content": "I have a Google Pixel 4.  When I'm on Bluetooth and in the midst of a phone call, it cuts the audio from the call and plays the phone notification \"Call From **NAME**\" - completely blocks out the conversation I'm in the middle of, for both me and the other party.  I have to cancel the call and then it connects back to the discussion.\n\nThis is incredibly distracting and frustrating - if I'm in the middle of a call, I don't want to be interrupted by another call.  A beep in the background, a vibration, or even give me a notice but let me still hear what the discussion is.\n\nI've searched for settings or ways to fix this, but there's no solution.  Any help?",
