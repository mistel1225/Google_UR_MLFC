    "content": "Whenever I play media, whether casting to my TV from itv, 4od etc or just watching embedded videos on Chrome or even Google play store showing % of an update, my phone blows up pointing constantly on every update to the notification text.\n\nI only got the phone a couple of weeks ago brand new. I've searched and searched and tried to get rid of media notification and change settings for it, but no joy.\n\nThis is so annoying! Any advice?\n\nLiam",
