    "content": "Hey.\nI know there've been a lot of threads on this but none was recent so I thought I should ask.\nToday my phone's battery went off normally. I got home to charge it and when I opened it I got that \"Cannot load Android system\" error, that says \"Try again\" or \"Factory reset\". I didn't have much important stuff on it so I chose factory reset. Things are working well right now. I contacted live chat support from Google and they said it \"will not happen again\" and it was \"probably some glitch from apps\".\nIs this true? What do you guys think? May something hardware-related have happened? I didn't drop it or anything and it worked perfectly before this error.",
