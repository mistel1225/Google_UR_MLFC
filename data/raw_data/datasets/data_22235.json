    "title": "Urgent: stop deletion of old backup, restore data",
    "content": "I used to have a pixel 3 a XL. I got a new pixel 3 a XL. I never fully restored my old pixel. Now, I realized that I have data that I need from my old pixel. when i go to the backups tab on google drive, i see the backup for my old pixel, but it says it will be deleted in 7 days with no options to prevent this!! Whatt?? When I go to settings > backup > restore it doesn't give me the option to restore my old pixel, just to resave the backup of my current pixel. Why can't I have my own data and prevent it from being deleted? This is like a horror movie haha. Please help!! Thank you. I only need the data from one app so ideally I would just be able to save it and prevent it from being deleted.",
