    "title": "After Android 11 Status Bar Notification Info Missing",
    "content": "Since I updated to Android 11 information that I typically keep on status bar won't show. For example the temperature from my weather app and sky conditions. I thought it was probably just the app not being as  compatible with 11 but then I noticed I'm also not receiving text notifications from non priority conversations or email notifications. If I pull down I can see the email and text notifications like I used to, and the dot notification on the app on home screen, but not in the status bar (it is visible on lock screen, however). And bubbles don't work at all. Bubbles are on in settings but I've never seen a single bubble yet. And I'm also quite upset that the recently used app options are gone from the overview screen (drag up and hold).",
