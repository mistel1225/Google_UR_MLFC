    "title": "Extreme Screen Sensitivity",
    "content": "When attempting to select letters: I, K, M, or \".\", the keyboard/screen recognizes the character(s) on either sides of those characters.  I  have downloaded a different keyboard other than the Gboard.  I have downloaded a third party screen calibration app.  I have also enlarged the keyboard to as large as it can go.  I still experience this issue.\n\nI am coming from a slightly larger phone (HTC U11), but never had this this problem.  I have tried calibrating the screen twice using TouchScreen Calibration, and have downloaded SwiftKey Keyboard.  Has anyone else had a hyper sensitive screen/keyboard, and what recommendations do you have?\n\n-Vance",
