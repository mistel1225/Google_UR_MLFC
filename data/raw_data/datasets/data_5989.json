    "title": "Messages is adding \"044\" to contacts when group messaging within the United States. HELP!",
    "content": "When I send group texts, either SMS or MMS, I'll receive replies where my contacts names have been replaced with \"044\" and then their phone number. For instance, I'll text Jane (408) 555-1212and Joe (510-555-2121) and the reply back will not show their names but show 0444085551212 & 044510555212.,   We are ALL within the US, so there is no international country code issue here.   When I try to reply back to the \"044\" numbers, I get an error message that the number is invalid.",
