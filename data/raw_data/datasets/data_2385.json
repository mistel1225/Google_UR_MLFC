    "content": "I've recently switched from using a Bluetooth headset after purchasing the pixel 5 in February. I never really noticed the terrible call quality on the pixel 5. After searching I noticed that there are tons of posts complaining about the speaker behind the screen. I personally have a hard time hearing even when the volume is on full. The voice is sound mumbly and like they it doesn't come through. Is there ever going to be an update to fix this or is this just one of those issues we have to deal with? Is it possible to return a pixel phone after 4 months of use?",
