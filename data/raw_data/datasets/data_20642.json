    "content": "I recently got this phone and I haven't used much of the camera. Today i gave the \"time lapse\" option a try for a lightning storm. \nI got a few great shots in the time lapse and wanted to export original images from the time lapse itself. However, the time lapse moves a lot faster than I anticipated. I don't know how to slow it down! I've tried everything, from using edit mode to try and capture it, timing the pauses by the second... I just can't seem to get it. Is there a way to modify the speed after it's been created, or can anyone suggest a third party app that will allow me to slow this file down so I can extract still images from it? Thanks!",
