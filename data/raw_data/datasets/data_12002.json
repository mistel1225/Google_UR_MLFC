    "content": "Hello!\n\nMy wife's phone (Pixel 3) recently (within the last week) has had major issues with overheating and not keeping a charge.\n\nShe doesn't have the TuneIn app (I've seen be an issue). I have her up to date with the latest updates (Android 11 and security updates)... I have tried multiple factory resets. Is there anything else to troubleshoot? Seems like it's related to the latest update... which is odd. No Apps are showing over 5% of battery usage.",
