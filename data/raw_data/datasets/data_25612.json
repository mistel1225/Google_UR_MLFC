    "content": "my pixel's microphone just stopped working for no apparent reason, this is a very weird situation because the mic was working just fine last night, but today i tried recording a video on snapchat and there was little to no audio, but when i put my mouth directly on tbe microphone you can only hear my voice faintly, this also applies to instagram and even the camera app, and to make things even weirder i can record voice messages on instagram just fine but when it comes to videos you can barely hear any sound, ive tried cleaning the mic and no luck, im pretty sure this is a software problem because ive deleted snapchat and instagram and reinstalled them and the issue continued, i doubt other users are having this problem but this is a very strange situation and im hoping someone here can help",
