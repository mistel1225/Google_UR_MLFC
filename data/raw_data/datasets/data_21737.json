    "content": " received my Pixel4 XL today from a pre-order and unboxed it with over-excitement only to find out the screen has welcomed me with  a green vertical line on its display. \n\nUpon talking to support they wanted me to place a new phone order again and return this defect piece. What if I get a similar device again?? Did I just spend 2500 CAD on my Pixel4 xl purchase?  So much for a pre-order purchase. Did I trust the teampixel too much? ",
