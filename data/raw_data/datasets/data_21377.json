    "content": "Dears at Google community,\n\nMy pixel 2 XL is crashing weirdly lately.\nThis is the 4th time this happens.\nThe screen started to turn on and off in a loop, provoking any touch feature and the unlock finger print sensor, plus the power button only works to lock the phone (and turn off like in normal situations). However, whenever I push the power button once again, the same loop goes on again. I tried several times rebooting and entering safe mode to check if any application is doing so and restating it using the power button as well, but all came in for nothing. The phone was still looping with turning the screen on and off. Furthermore, whenever I leave my phone without doing anything, it takes me to a Android recovery mode after few minutes, then it shows 2 options to select, retry and factory reset. Pressing on retry took me to the same issue, but factory resetting the phone was the only way to turn on the phone once again without the loop issue. Therefore, this is the fourth time I had to factory reset my phone to make it work. \nPlease I need your help figuring out how to fix it.\n\nThank you so much for your time.",
