    "content": "Been 13 business days now since my Pixel 3 64 GB has been sitting in their warehouse dead, confirmed by UPS tracking. Had to buy a used iPhone 6 to get my by. A multi billion dollar company and this is the wait because they don't have enough refurb's. I guess just shipping a new one would get into the bottom line too much? Meanwhile you can go to the official Google store and get one shipped in just a single business day if you pay $14 for faster shipping. This is why Apple's phones are worth their premium, you have local stores. This type of thing would have never happened with them. They'd on the spot give you a new replacement phone. These aren't toys. People use phones for their business. They don't have time to be countless hours trying to push things along.\n\nPointless to give my RMA number here. Talked by text, phone and email support many, many times. The standard line is \"it's been escalated.\" And if you're like me and you bought the phone through a carrier and not the Google store they can't send you a brand new unit instead of a refurb. After tirelessly pushing them to know why things aren't moving along I FINALLY find out they're out of stock. One of the worst customer support experiences I've ever had.",
