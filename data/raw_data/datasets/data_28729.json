    "title": "My First Generation Google Pixel is Constantly Restarting. Please Help Me!",
    "content": "Hello! So my first generation Google Pixel has been shutting down and restarting in a constant loop. This can last up to three hours, until it dies, or when it finally opens up the lock screen. It heats up when it does this, and the only time I know for sure that it will restart is when I plug it in to charge. It seems to be getting worse lately. If I'm lucky enough to have my phone start up all the way, it lasts an hour before doing it again on a good day. It has been occurring almost every two minutes. I've had this phone for less than a year. This is the shortest period of time I have ever had a phone before I needed to replace it. Please help me.\nI have seen many posts about this same issue, and I have done all the things listed to do.\nI have tried putting it in Safe Mode. I have done a Factory Reset. I have tried every option that comes up when the screen with the android with its chest open comes up. I have let my phone die and plugged it in. Every time I try to contact help support from it, my phone crashes again. I closed and cleared all my apps. I made sure it had the latest update. I took off the case just to see if that was the issue. I updated all my apps. I deleted all my apps. My storage space was not full. I did not drop it or dunk it in water. This issue began this last May/June. As far as I know, I have done nothing to damage the phone, and it is getting worse with each passing day. Is this a virus or a faulty update?\nThanks so much!",
