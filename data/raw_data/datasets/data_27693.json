    "content": "I'm having a problem that started basically a month ago. But this doesn't happen often. At the beggining, I thought it was a battery issue but to keep it simple. \n\nMy Pixel 2XL freezes randomly when is connected to the car charger. \n\nThis charger (I'm not in the UK but this charger is not available anymore )\n\nThe phone can be at 20% or 90% and it doesn't matter. It freezes, and this is random but maybe 5 out of 10 times the phone freezes and I need to just let the phone be for about 5 minutes. It doesn't get hot, nothing strange. \n\nI haven't seen the behavior with the phone charger or my laptop charger (Lenovo USB C 65W). Chargers nowadays are supposed to be smart and regulate the voltage. I've tested this with the Ampere app\n\nHas someone encountered this problem?",
