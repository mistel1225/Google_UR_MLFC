    "title": "Pixel 5 Offer Bose Headphones not delivered. Claim submitted 29/10/20.",
    "content": "Submitted claim for Bose Headphones offer from pre-order of Pixel 5 on 29/10/20. Claim validated same day. \nRecieved email 27/11/20 from Google saying IMEI number was required, despite the fact I provided this in the original claim. Provided this with picture of the box same day. \nRecieved another validation email 14/12/20. \nStill no updates and it is now 3 months since my original claim since submission. This is well over the 60 days stated for dispatch. \nNot able to speak to a real person when I call the claims helpline, no reply to email sent to helpdesk and chat helpline unable to help. \nHow do I resolve this issue? Has anyone actually recieved their headphones? \nVery dissapointed in the service, won't be buying from Google again.",
