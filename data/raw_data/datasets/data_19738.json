    "content": "Please reference photo below and video in the link as I'm not sure of the best way to describe my phone's problem.\n\nMy Google Pixel 2 XL phone has a screen issue where horizontal lines are squigling across the phone screen. The lines are wider on the right side of the screen and change colors between green (when locked) blue (on notification bar when phone is locked and black when phone is unlocked.\n\nPrior the incident, the phone had not been recently dropped or exposed to light such as the sun. Phone also wasn't hot. I literally pulled the phone out of my pocket to check a text message and all of a sudden I noticed the lines. I then deleted 2 recently installed 3rd party apps thinking maybe that was the issue (although it isn't as you'll see in the list below).\n\nI've tried troubleshooting by doing the following:\n\nRestarted device............Result: Lines still visible\nShut down device, waited 10 seconds and turned phone on.........Result: Lines still visible\nShut down the device and restarting in safe mode.......Result: Lines still visible, so not the result of 3rd party app.\nRe attempted restart.......Result: Lines still visible.\n\nAny fix to this, or has my phone bit the bullet?",
