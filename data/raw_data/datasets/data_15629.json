    "content": "Ok, guys here is the situation.  I had a Pixel 4XL 64gb and gave it to my dad.  I ended up buy another Pixel 4 XL 128gb.  The new Pixel I got for myself has horrible focusing issue on the selfies.  The selfies come out blurry.  This was never an issue with the previous Pixel 4 XL.  I thought this was probably an issue with previous Pixel as well!  So I went to my dad's house and took selfies with each!  His is perfect sharpness and focus!  The new one I got for myself is out of focus!  No matter what I do to focus on my face!  I got the phone recently and I took a trip and when I got back I was looking at photos and noticed they were all blurry.  The front camera is perfectly fine! It's just the selfie camera!  So then I tried to compare the selfie camera under good lighting at the actual hardware and I think during assembly there was a fuck up somewhere. Because one is pushed further out, deeper and my dad's Pixel 4 XL is much closer to the glass. I think the assembly wasn't perfect and therefore causing this issue.  Have any of you experienced this? And what has Google done to fix it?",
