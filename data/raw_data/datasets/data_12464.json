    "content": "I have a Pixel 5 running the November update. Is it still possible to take a screenshot using Google Assistant by saying, \"hey google, take a screenshot\"? It doesn't work on my phone, but I've found numerous references to it on these boards and other help sites. Has that skill been removed from google assistant? Do I need to enable some obscure setting buried deep? Thanks!",
