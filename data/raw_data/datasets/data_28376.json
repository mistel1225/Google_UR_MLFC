    "content": "My pixel2 was almost dead so I plugged it in. It still died while I was using it. It has been plugged in for a couple hours now. When I try to start it the battery symbol with the lightning bolt pops up but it doesn’t turn on.  There’s no light when it’s just sitting on the charger. When I try to power on it’s a solid red light.",
