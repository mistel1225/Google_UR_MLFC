    "content": "So, sometimes when i turn on the screen of my phone i see a little black human shaped figure in the main screen before you unlock it. I have been wondering what the hell is that, is it a feature or the screen when u turn the screen on or something? I can't take a picture because the figure shows up less than a second and its random. Sometimes it appears and sometimes it doesn't.",
