    "content": "My phone was experiencing an odd issue with the December update. I would sometimes see the bottom of the screen stuck like it had been activated by a touch but it had not and I could not make it go away without a restart.\n\nAfter the January update my gestures at the bottom of the screen do not work anymore and when I switched back to the old button navigation they are complete hit or miss. I need to press them at an exact location or they do not respond. Sometimes having to press 20+ times. I went back to the gestures out of pure frustration as at least I can somewhat navigate with the side gestures.\n\nI've seen other posts suggesting it's a case or a screen protector causing the problem but I do not use either.",
