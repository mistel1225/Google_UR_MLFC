    "title": "How can I reset a phone without the screen, and when Device Finder isn't working..",
    "content": "I'm sending in my Pixel 5 for repair because the LCD is damaged. Because the LCD is damaged, the screen doesn't respond in any way to touch. The volume & power buttons all work, but that's it.\nTo send the phone in, I need to reset it to factory default. This obviously isn't possible to do from the phone as I can't even unlock it.\nI've tried using Device Finder to erase the phone but it simply says that it is indeed 'scheduled' to be deleted. The phone is connected to my wifi network, but I believe the problem is that it is locked. The phone, having restarted, won't unlock with fingerprint access even.\n\nSo I have a phone at 91% battery, that can't be turned off (you need to confirm it on the screen, and crashing it only soft resets it), has intermittent alarms that can't be shut off (only have their volume reduced), and can't be factory reset.\n\nDoes anyone have any ideas?\nMuch appreciated!",
