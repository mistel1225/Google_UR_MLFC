    "content": "Hi,   I opted to keep my previous phone number and was told the PAC had all been sorted and I was ready to start. I .transferred data from my android phone to my new google 4a. WhatsApp, texts, emails and google are all working but I cannot make a phone call or receive a phone call.  Went to settings to About phone and under Phone number it says \"unknown\". When I try to phone a number it says \"mobile network not available\"",
