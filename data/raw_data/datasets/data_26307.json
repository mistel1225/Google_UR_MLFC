    "content": "When I'm trying to unlock my Pixel 2, after entering my pin and hitting the button to submit it, the screen locks up entirely, and the phone becomes entirely unusable. It causes System UI to stop responding, as I get a pop up asking if I'd like to stop it or wait for it to respond. I've gone through recovery mode to no avail after a full wipe.",
