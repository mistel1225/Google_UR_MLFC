    "content": "Bit of a head scratcher here. The power button on my 2XL won't respond to single presses or to long presses. I hesitate to call it a complete failure because I can still double tap the power button to open the camera. The device is perfectly fine otherwise but when this happens it prevents me from powering it down or even powering off the display when I put the phone in my pocket. Any idea how to fix it?",
