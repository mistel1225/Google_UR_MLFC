    "title": "After updating to Android 10 my phone constantly is getting stuck with a black screen, unresponsive.",
    "content": "After updating to Android 10 my proximity sensor intermittently works. If I try to wake my screen it stays blacked out. I can feel the phone vibrate when touching the fingerprint reader and when I hold the power button. I've tried cleaning the screen, holding the screen up to a bright light, and even a factory reset! The only thing that works is by doing a hard reset, holding down the power button until I see the Google icon. I have had EVERY PIXEL XL pre-ordered but this has me extremely angry!! Please fix this and restore my faith before the Google event or may jump ship.",
