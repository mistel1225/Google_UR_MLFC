    "content": "I get it, they're slow compared to today's UFS storage. But it's a cheap and convinient option to add more space for your photos, videos and music. Plus, you don't lose everything if your phone is broken. Google Drive has only 15GB of space available, and you'll need a paid subscription if you want more. Also internet may not always be available, and can be expensive, especially mobile data. If Google made a pixel with a card slot I'd totally buy it. Please add one!",
