    "title": "Pixel 3a Issues with call quality, switching on options like \"hold:\" during phone call, others",
    "content": "Call quality is poor when receiving calls both locally and long distance. I cannot hear people I have called unless on speaker phone although they can hear me. This is very sporadic. Phone often selects setting such as Mute or Hold without my help. Phone will not answer Google Duo calls, a change from 2 months ago. Phone sometimes turns off in middle of conversation. I have not received some phone calls (I use voice to text) or texts (using signal).\n\nI am up to date on software (running Android 10). I have both rebooted and turned phone off many times. I know where my microphones are. I have cleaned the C area with soft cloth. I have a screen protector (Gorilla Glass) and phone case (just for back, Spigen). I have not taken those off. I have called people back for better connection. I use headphones and sometimes they are very helpful for callers and sometimes not. I have cleared Chrome cache, closed tabs both in chrome and those open on phone, cleared phone cache.\n\nI have read the Gottabemobile discussion and do not find that any of the common problems apply in my situation. I have been through the Google pixel forums, read articles in the common problems sections and tried to find solutions in various threads that have been started.\nMy apologies if I have repeated issyes,",
