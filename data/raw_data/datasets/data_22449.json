    "content": "My Pixel 4's microphone does not work in any application, unless I swap it to speakerphone. I have tested this on call and messenger call, where the other person can't hear me unless I have it on speakerphone. The recorder app doesn't pick up sound either.\n\nI've reset my phone about 8 times now and it still has not fixed this problem.\n\nI've had this problem one month ago but I fixed it with a factory reset, but now it won't go away.\n\nIt does not work in safe mode either",
