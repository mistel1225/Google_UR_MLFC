    "content": "An update came through in the last while and the System Ui failed, then wi-fi, then everything else (Android 11).  Can still restart phone to get back to desktop, but all UI's fail again.  Have had to plug into computer and attempted a full flash to Android Beta 12... exact same issue.   Reedit going nuts with Pixel 3 Xls all over having the issue/bricked.  No response from Google as of yet.",
