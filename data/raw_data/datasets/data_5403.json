    "title": "Navigation Buttons Not Hiding in Full screen (Chrome)",
    "content": "When watching videos and entering full screen, normally the navigation buttons hide and if you swipe up, they will reappear so you can use them however this no longer works. Videos cannot be watched in full screen as the navigation buttons do not disappear. I have tried resetting my phone, reinstalling Chrome, and changing every setting that could possibly be relevant and have found absolutely no way to fix this. It's making my phone unusable.",
