    "content": "My phone broke down and it won't power back on. \nI bought it from someone else that was selling it because she preferred Iphone. Unfortunately I have lost contact with this person and she won't reply to me. I am still under the warranty and I deserve a new phone since it broke out of nowhere. The employee from Google (clearly a computer and not an actual person) keeps telling me that they need the order number to be able to help me, but I do not have the order number and as I said, it is impossible for me to have it. Is there any way I can track the order number with the IMEI or do something else. I paid 1000$ for a broken phone and I just feel scammed.",
