    "content": "My youtube app keeps freezing after the android 11 update on a pixel 3a. It will freeze and not respond for about 5-10 seconds some times I get the crash report pop up but then it will start running again behind the crash report. I was living with it but it has started to get worse. It will do it 4+ times in a 20 min video now. Does it both on WiFi and cell service.",
