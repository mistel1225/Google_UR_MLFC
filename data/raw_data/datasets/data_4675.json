    "content": "If I try to access my gmail app, it appears maximized for less than a second and then minimizes. It appears in the launcher but if I try to select it from the launcher it does the same thing, briefly maximized then minimizes itself. Gmail is unusable. Actually the Amazon Shopping app does the same thing. Other apps work just fine. Any ideas?",
