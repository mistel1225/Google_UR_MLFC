    "content": "My boyfriend and I bought a pixel in January 2017. Since Monday his pixel kept on bugging, doing action without touching the screen, shutting off by itself. He updated the Android software , thinking it must be due to the malfunction of Android, but the cellphone kept on bugging and microphone doesn't work anymore. That was on Monday 22nd April.  \nPersonally I always get my Android software up to date and today I'm having exactly the same problems. Cellphone crash, freeze, no more microphone...  I tried starting on safe mode.  It worked normally for a few hours so I deleted few apps thinking that was it. But the malfunctions came back, even on safe mode. \nIs it a problem with Android ? Is the pixel program to stop working after a certain time ? Can you help me please ? Should I do a factory reset ?\nThank you",
