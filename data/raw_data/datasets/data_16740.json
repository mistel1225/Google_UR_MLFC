    "title": "Pixel 2 and 3a XL Sensors STILL NOT working with Android 11",
    "content": "C'mon Google, this has gone on WAY TOO long. I previously had a Pixel 2, the model my wife still has, and now have a 3a XL. All of our sensors stopped working several updates ago during Android, including auto rotation, proximity, active edge, all of them and I've watched one thread after another die on here without any solution being offered from Google for those of us with the same issue. This is ridiculous. Now we've been updated to 11 and no fix. REALLY disappointing to have Google just ignore this for so long. I have otherwise loved my Pixel phones, my Stadia, and my NEST but this may push me away from Pixel phones going forward. Nothing offered in the past has fixed it. It really is time for Google to acknowledge the issue and make it right.",
