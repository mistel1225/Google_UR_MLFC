    "content": "I bought this Pixel 3 in Nov 2019. It's not even been a year and a half. The rear panel of the phone is cracking off because of the swollen battery. The overheating issue due to any video-intensive app (like Snapchat, Google Duo) is persisting from the very month I bought it. The phone shows the \"Device too hot\" notification very often. The battery has gotten worse exponentially in the previous one week. Device abruptly switches off mid-use even when at 70-80% and lasts only 2-3h on full charge and is extremely hot all the time.\nConsidering the battery bulge, this is a very serious issue. I'm skeptical about the device exploding.\nGoogle should do something to solve this ASAP. I am seriously considering switching to an iPhone.\nAnybody faced a similar issue? What did the Google Support Team do to resolve it?",
