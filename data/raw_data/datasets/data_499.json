    "content": "My new Pixel 4XL drops my favorite contacts each day. It retains three of them, but drops all the other favorites that I have designated each time my contacts sync with my Google account. I've reviewed both the Pixel and Gmail forums and have not found a post directly dealing with this issue. Any suggestions would be appreciated.",
