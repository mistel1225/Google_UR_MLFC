    "content": "Hello,\nEarlier today we had some snow/rain hit us and I was out and about, I assume rain got into my pocket and the port was facing out and hit it. I got home and saw the message that water/debris was in the usb port. I took a blow drier to it a good distance away and started blowing, and the message went away and I left it sitting for 3 hours. By that time my phone got low and I went to charge it, however thats where the main problem comes about, the phone was powered off and it was blinking with 1%, then the battery icon and it would go back and forth not charging at all. I do not have any compressed air or I would have tried that, but I'm without a phone right now and its a Blizzard :/\n\nI've tried pretty much all the step on the troubleshooter that I can, but now my phone is dead and cant do some of the other options. \n\nIf anyone has any help, that would be great.",
