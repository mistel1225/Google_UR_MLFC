    "title": "Pixel 2xl Screen Replacement (in Vietnam)",
    "content": "I have a Google Pixel 2xl in warranty that I bought with preferred care. Recently, the screen broke, and I need to get it fixed. The complicating factor is that, while I'm a US citizen and bought the phone there, I'm in Vietnam for the next year. Google won't send a replacement device to Vietnam, and while I could have one sent to the states and then shipped to me, that'll take too long - Google doesn't allow more than a few days before they require my phone be returned after they issue the new phone.  I'm also planning to trade the phone eventually when I get a new Pixel, and don't want to void the warranty on a non-Google repair store (i'm assuming that'd void the trade in but don't actually know). Any ideas?  Advice?",
