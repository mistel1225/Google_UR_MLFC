    "content": "I updated my Pixel 4 to the latest security version this morning and now every time I go to the Home screen it says `Pixel Launcher Keeps Stopping'. I have tried restarting etc but no luck.\n\nMost issues seem to be about the Pixel 2 or 3 but mine is a 4!\n\nI tried clearing the cache etc but it is still not working!\n\nI installed a 3rd party launcher and made it the default but it seems to defeat the purpose to not use the original launcher!\n\nHas anyone else had this issue?\n\nIs so is there a fix?",
