    "content": "For the last few days, notifications from any app aren't appearing like before. The bubble at the top with the preview still appears however it only shows for a split second and then my phone vibrates. But it's not even a proper vibrate. Almost like a bug. I reset the settings with Google support. Fixed the issue for a few hours and then started happening again. Google claim it's a new feature with the phone that you can't get the previous bubble back but it doesn't seem right. Works on my friend's phone so it's a bit odd.  I'm up to date with all apps and software.",
