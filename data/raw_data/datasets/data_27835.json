    "content": "Apparently my old post regarding this slipped off the English support forums, though I can still find it on some of the other language versions of support.google.com.\n\nBasically, I would like to turn off the visual effects of the lock screen keyboard - the big circular animations that look like radar pings when you type in your pin code to unlock.  They pretty much defeat the purpose of not displaying your pin code by telegraphing exactly where on your numeric keypad you just typed.\n\nI originally posed this question back when we were at Nougat (or maybe Oreo) and there was no solution then.  \n\nI'm wondering if the ability to turn off this effect has been added yet.  I suspect not.\n\nJohn.",
