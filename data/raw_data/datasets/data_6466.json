    "content": "I am thinking of buying a phone with dual sim support, and due to wide spread of eSims I want to have more than 2 sims in my device.\nBecause my points of life interests are in 3-4 different countries I want to store all sims in one device, and change them when needed.\nI am even ok with having only sim working at the time, but with possibility to switch to another when needed.\nI found that some Pixel phones support dual-sim.\nBut I could not find any information if these phones can store more that 2-3 esims?\n\nThanks",
