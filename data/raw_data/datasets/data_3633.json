    "content": "I have a fast internet 300 at home and playing video on the YouTube app is no problem. The weird thing that I just noticed is randomly the preview video images on the YouTube app would be pixelated or blurry. It happens very randomly. I attached a screenshot as an example. Please see the 2nd image below the video player in the screenshot. Is anyone experiencing this issue and do you have a fix that you can share?",
