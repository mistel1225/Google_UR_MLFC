    "content": "I have a Pixel 4a5G phone and a SIM only contract with SKY Mobile in the UK. My contract has 5G enabled and I live in an area with good 5G coverage, but the phone doesn't get a 5G signal. It would seem that Google and SKY aren't talking to each other to enable the necessary soft/firmware. \n\nI doubt anyone on this forum can help (unless a Googler passes it up the chain) so this is really just a warning - if you're in a SKY contract don't buy a 5G Pixel",
