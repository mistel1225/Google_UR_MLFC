    "content": "I just purchased a Pixel 2XL yesterday.  It came from the store partially charged.  I asked about initial charge settings and was told it only \"needed to charge for 15 minutes due to rapid charge.\"  (not true).  After charging to 100%, I let it sit for the night.  I seem unable to turn off the low-light clock, but after 8 hours with no usage other than the clock it was already down to 91%  I have two questions.  1.)  Is there a way to actually turn OFF the clock so there's relatively no batterly usage?  2.) Is this kind of drain from zero usage normal?  I bought the insurance but I don't want to send in a brand-new phone immediately due to batterly life issues.",
