    "content": "My Pixel 2 XL (running Android 10) is having the boot loop problem where the G symbol's progress bar loads over and over again. I have been running Android 10 for a while now and have no idea how this happened.\n\nI have Google Authenticator and photos that I need to recover, but I can't get past the boot loader.\n\nAny help? I really don't want to factory reset my phone.",
