    "content": "We have 2 new pixel 3 phones, 1 is standard size and 1 is an xl. Both phones have the same problem. Our wifi works great as long as we are closer than 30 feet to a router, not just our router, any router. All of our older phones work great at distances of 100 feet away from any router. Any help is appreciated.",
