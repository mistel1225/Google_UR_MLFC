    "title": "Password Required After Upgrade",
    "content": "I've always logged into my phone using a pattern or fingerprint, but after a recent patch it started to ask me for a password. As far as I know I've never setup a password on the phone. I tried to change the security settings back to a pattern but it asks for a password.  Assuming it wanted my Google password, then trying other passwords it may have been, but none work. The phone is now locked.\n\nWhy did the phone start asking for a password rather than a pattern when I didn't change the security settings?\n\nIs there anyway of recovering the phone without doing a factory reset?\n\nThanks,\nRoss.",
