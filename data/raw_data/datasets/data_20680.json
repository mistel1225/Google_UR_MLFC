    "content": "Response of the touch screen of my Pixel 3XL is very slow (about 2 seconds) and sometimes doesn't work at all.  \nAbout 5 mm on the left hand side of the Mon doesn't work at all and I have to turn it 90Â° and hope the same icon is not on the bad side.\n\nDo I need to replace the screen, or the chip is not receiving signal from the screen or other problem?",
