    "title": "Pixel 4 Camera Overrides App camera",
    "content": "On apps that have their own separate original camera filter when in selfie mode such as snapchat or Instagram my phone will show the filter (not filters as in bunny ears but just a general filter that's taken over every picture) before it's taken but after I take a picture it immediately reverts the picture back to the phone camera quality. It only will stay the same if I take a picture with the flash on. How can I stop the camera from overriding the app camera?",
