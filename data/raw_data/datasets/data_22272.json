    "content": "Hello. I'm the Pixel 3a user from Poland and I'd like to ask You for help. I've bought my Pixel from a private person, who had bought it in Germany, because it is not officially available in Poland. The phone was new, I was the first one to open the original box. But the previous owner hasn't had any documents of purchasing. As I already know, the first buyer should have received it via email, right? But the problem is that I didn't know that at the time I've bought the phone... So I don't know who, when and exactly where have bought it and I don't have any documents neither. Is there any way, for example by IMEI or serial number, to get a copy of receipt from Google, or check the warranty? Thank's for any help!\nBest regards,\nBartosz",
