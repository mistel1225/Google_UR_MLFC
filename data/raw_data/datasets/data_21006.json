    "content": "It all started with the flickering screen and we've been convinced that it's a software issue.(Also the reboot issue is annoying) But now once again my Pixel 3' screen flickers \"every night\" when the brightness is below 80%. (Yes, it's the Cinderella in Pixel community) \n\nMethods that I have tried: \n1. Turn of the ambient display or developer options \n2. Safe mode \n3. Factory reset. \nYet, none of them worked. \n\nSo now, my phone is bought in Jan, 2019 in Canada but I'm back in Taiwan. Google support in Taiwan asked me to contact Canada's Google store. Canada's Google store told me they only work with Ubreak in the US or Canada. \n\nPixel phone is basically an abandoned kid once its warranty expired. \n\nIn addition, would you pay $420 for a fix of your pixel 3?",
