    "content": "I have never had a problem installing obb data files for apps before, but suddenly, today, no folders are appearing inside the Android folder. But if i try to create it, it says that the folder already exists. I also cannot move any files to the folder. This has been working from the moment I bought the phone (without root), why is it not working now? I am not rooted, bootloader is locked, Pixel 3 XL, Android 11.",
