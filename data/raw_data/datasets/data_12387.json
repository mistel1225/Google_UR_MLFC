    "content": "I submitted my pixel for repair under warranty on 16th October. Google confirmed it has been received on 17th, and have now said that is a mistake and it was never received.\n\nI am now approaching 4 weeks without a working phone and all I keep getting are e-mails to confirm 'they are looking into my issue'\n\nIn the meantime i have had to purchase a new non-pixel smartphone.\n\nDoes anyone know how to escalate my issue to get a resolution?",
