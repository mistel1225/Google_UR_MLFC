    "content": "Photos app can't view any camera images on the local device. New camera photos when previewed show \"processing\" and then disappear. All my old photos that were not uploaded to Google Photos disappeared/aren't viewable, though they are still taking up storage space. However, screenshots are viewable in Photos. This suggests to me that the main DCIM folder isn't viewable but the subfolders are.",
