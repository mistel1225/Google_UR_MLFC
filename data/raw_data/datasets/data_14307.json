    "content": "I have contacted the app developer, and the developer stated that these are mobile phone system problems and have nothing to do with them. Meanwhile, the \"Quick Application\" function of Huawei Appgallery cannot be used normally, and a dialog box will pop up prompting \"please grant shortcut permission in the settings\", but I did not find this permission in the settings, nor can I solve this problem. What should I do?",
