    "content": "I have been having intermittent issues with my Pixel 4 XL and wanted to see how common it is. Firstly I have had some problems with face recognition to unlock the device - it tells me to clean the sensors but also won't let me swipe up to enter my PIN. I end up having to restart.\nSecondly I have had two occasions where the screen has gone completely blank and unresponsive even though it is still on - buttons still work so again I have to hold the power button to restart.\nI've logged it with Google support today but I wanted to know if this has happened to anyone else?",
