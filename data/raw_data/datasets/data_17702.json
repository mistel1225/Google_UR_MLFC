    "content": "Pixel initially started freezing up unexpectedly this morning - camera app was repeatedly unresponsive \nMultiple resets did not fix the issue\nScreen remains stuck at the G screen\nSafe mode is not appearing as an option\nThis is the second time that this has happened - original issue occurred on the Pixel 1. I would prefer not to have to factory reset as that previously didn't fix this issue on the Pixel 1.",
