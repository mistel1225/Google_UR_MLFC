    "content": "Very soon I will be switching from a Google Pixel phone to a different brand Android phone. I'm looking for advice on my plan to migrate all my apps, settings and data from the Pixel to the new Android phone.\n\nI have removed all personal files  -- photos, music, documents of all types, wallpapers and ringtones - from the Pixel phone; they are backed up to my Google Drive.\nI have backed up everything that Android makes it possible to backup.\nI have separately backed up all calls and messages from all such apps.\n\nIt seems to me that all I need to do on the new Android phone is to sign in to my Google account, which will recreate everything on the new phone, and then restore my backups, and I am done.\n\nWill this successfully migrate me to the new phone?",
