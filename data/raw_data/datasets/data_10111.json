    "content": "Adding users is described here: https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/2865483?hl=en\n\nThe question I'm having trouble trying to find an answer to is how many user accounts can you have?  \n\nWhat we are trying to solve:  We have a phone and number that is to be the shift number for a position.  There are things they need on the phone that we don't want them all to have equal access to (apps, apps with different accounts, email, etc).  \n\nWe've been getting by with the Pixel 2 XL's four user limit (technically 5, but one is hard programmed to be a guest account).  So I want to be sure the Pixel 5 has at least four users (preferably five) still.  That the limit wasn't dropped.",
