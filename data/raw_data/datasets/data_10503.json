    "content": "Hi I'm a fan of the Joe Rogan experience and as it moved to Spotify so did I my experience of Spotify was as a person of disabilities I cannot use my phone in portrait mode as this causes seizures for me Spotify wasn't and still isn't working properly to view Spotify in landscape mode I found I'm having sign in the close the app then open it to get the app to orientate itself into landscape mode I chose to leave a review stating this in the play store after that I started messing around with Spotify trying to figure out how to get it to display in landscape mode and found there are NO VIDEO controls whatsoever I emailed Spotify there response was to blame the creator after that I watched 33 minutes of can't remember the episode number the guy's name is moxie he developed an app called signal after pausing the episode I checked how much data it used I was surprised 440mb ok Spotify is a data whore I went back to the play store to find my post had been taken down Google have not responded in anyway shape or form that could be considered as human blaming anyone but themselves as Spotify did blaming Joe Rogan for themselves having no video controls does anyone at Google know how I make I direct complaint to them about this I guess Google hates disabled people",
