    "content": "When I turn on hotspot on my google pixel 3xl, wifi which is shared (name) is visable as huawei. it is strange because when i have first turned on wifi on my newly bought Google pixel, from the very begining it had this issue. I have not changed name or anything. I know that I can change the name but why it shows up as a huawei and not as google pixel?",
