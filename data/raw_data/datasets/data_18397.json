    "content": "Long story-short: I swipe a notification that I've read from the notification drop down and it notifies me of the same message multiple times. \nLong story: I receive a text, I read the quick \"lol\" or \"okay\". No need to open, respond, etc. I swipe to remove the notification. I receive the same text message, notification sound and/or vibrate immediately after swiping it. Swipe again, 50% of the time it comes in again. This is incredibly frustrating as it defeats the purpose of swiping notifications for removal. Any thoughts?",
