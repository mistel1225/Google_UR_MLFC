    "content": "My pixel 4 device keeps automatically engaging the do not disturb function. I'm not using any routines that engage the function, except the well being overnight function. I've played with turning this off and the issue still persists. The do not disturb function is turning on without being prompted and causing me to miss phone calls and notifications. This began with the September 2020 firmware update. Any suggestions as to why this is happening or how I can fix it?",
