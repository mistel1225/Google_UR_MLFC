    "content": "I have a Pixel 2 phone and it's been sitting on my desk for the past few months.  It's been plugged in on and off for the past few months.  Today, I picked up the phone and it's not working.  When I picked it up, there was a picture of a battery with a lightning in the middle.  When I tried to turn it on, the screen went black.  I followed the directions to do a reset (hold power button for 30 seconds) and a hard reset (hold power button and volume down), but nothing is happening.  When I hold the power button, I can feel it vibrate after 30 seconds, but the screen is still blank.  It's been plugged in overnight so I know the battery should be fully charged.\n\nThanks for any suggestions.",
