    "content": "I have tried to reset the Phone, I have cleared camera memory and Cache, deactivated the Camera App, deinstalled Camera App Updates, booted in Safe Mode, installed alternative Camera Apps... Even tried the Magnet trick suggested on YouTube.\n\nHow did I get here?\nA few weeks ago the Camera App randomly crashed sometimes rebooting the whole phone. Then suddenly last week the Camera App started to crash 1-2 seconds after launch. Once in around 30 starts it suddenly works again - sometimes perfectly and sometimes the focus does not work. The next time it does not work at all again.\n\nI am very frustrated that an 800$ Phone which prides itself with one of the best Cameras, unlimited Photo Cloud storage till 2021 and years of Google Updates is now rendered pretty useless to me and completely lost any resale value - possibly by one of the official google Updates itself.\n\nFrom what I've found Google pretty much ignores the issue voiced by many Pixel users since late 2019.",
