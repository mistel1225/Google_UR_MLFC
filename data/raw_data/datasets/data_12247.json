    "content": "The front camera takes utter abysmal pics from front camera,they are soft ,even as suggested from 16inches and away,this is mentioned by so many people and reviews,infact pixel5 has the same issue,what is the solution for it , replacement and repair is out of question since this is not a one off device issue,for reference check gsmarena review, dxomark reviews for p4 and p5 ,really pathetic,uploading a screenshot since this site doesn't allow full image ",
