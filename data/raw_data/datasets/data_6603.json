    "content": "The front facing speaker on the Pixel 5 cuts out intermittently on volume bars 1-3 (3 clicks on volume rocker from no sound). I have had a replacement device and it has the same issue. I have noticed the issue while streaming on Netflix and it is more frequent on YouTube. I haven't noticed the front speaker cutting out on levels above volume 3. I'm just curious whether others have had this issue and whether it is software related.",
