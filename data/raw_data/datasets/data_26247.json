    "content": "Hi folks,\n\nA while back I changed my preferred input for Assistant to keyboard on my Pixel phone. I've recently upgraded to Pixel 4 and want to try it with voice again, however the preferred input setting has disappeared.\n\nHere it is on Pixel:\n\n\n\nAnd here it's not on Pixel 4:\n\n\n\nAnyone on the inside know what's going on? Is this a bug?\n\nIf it makes any difference, I'm in the UK where the \"new\" Assistant with the minimal black background is not yet available.\n\nThanks,\nChris",
