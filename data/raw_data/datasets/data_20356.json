    "content": "I have a Google Pixel 3 XL, and about 3 hours ago my phone no longer played audio through the USB-C adapter, that came with the phone, to my headset.  I have had the phone for about 3 months now, using the same adapter and headset, and the phone just stopped sending audio from my phone to my headset.  Now, when I plug my headset, a notification pops up saying \"Android System Charging connected device.\"  I have restarted my phone 3 times.  After the third restart, it no longer shows anything when my headset is plugged in, and it doesn't give me the option to switch what the phone does with the headset.",
