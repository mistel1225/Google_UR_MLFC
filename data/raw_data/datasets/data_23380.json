    "content": "The last two mornings after dismissing an alarm and having all apps and notifications cleared I have had my alarm music just start playing. I don't have any overlaps in snooze and alarms but music will play if I dismiss one alarm with the one song and then if I dismiss the next with another that too will begin to randomly play. Any suggestions on if I need to revert back to and old version of the clock app?",
