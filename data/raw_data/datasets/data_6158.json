    "content": "about 8 days ago my phone all a sudden turned off and now when I start charging it the battery symbol shows a ?. I have to keep my phone in the wall socket to keep it on and use it for work. Google support offered me a regular exchange where I need to send my phone in and wait for a replacement to be shipped back = 10Days. I can not be without it for 10 days due to work and asked support if I can do an advanced Exchange. The support mentioned they need to check with their level 2 support or so. Fast forward 8 days I finally got a response that they can not do an advanced exchange \"they are not able to grant our request for Advance Exchange exception since it didn't fall under our exception guidelines. We can only process replacement through Standard Exchange.\". i am really not sure what that exactly means and not sure why this needs an exception and what the guidelines are? i can not be without the phone for 10 days. Google is a tech company and should understand how dependent people are these days on their phones in particular during covid for their work. They do not have a store where I can go and exchange. I can understand that there is a lot of demand at google for their attention but still. Whoever is part of that second level support team is out of touch with customers. Sad to be honest. That said does anyone have any ideas other than moving to a phone where I can actually go to a \"genius bar\" if needed and get it replaced same day if needed.",
