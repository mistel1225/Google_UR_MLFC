    "content": "Recently been having focusing issues. I made sure lens and laser were clean. I cleared camera cache and any apps using the camera. Rebooted in safe mode and still very bad focusing issue. I read up this may be a hardware issue and I would like to get a replacement since I am sure I am still under warranty.\n\nThank you,\nChris",
