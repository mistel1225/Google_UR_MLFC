    "content": "My Pixel 3's Wifi becomes unstable after upgrade to Android 11. The Wifi icon disappears in the status bar frequently while the AP name still displays connecting in the Wifi settings menu. I have to disconnect the Wifi and reconnect it again. It works for a while, then the wifi icon disappears again.\n\nThe wifi has no problem before the upgrading. I have tried to \"forget\" the connection, but it still not working. \n\nPlease help. Thanks in advance.",
