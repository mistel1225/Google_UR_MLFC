    "title": "Google Pixel First Gen Battery Life",
    "content": "My wife has the first gen pixel phone and her battery life has changed dramatically in the past few months. This morning, she sent a couple text messages, nothing else, and her battery drained 26% in less than an hour. Location is off, bluetooth is off, most apps are uninstalled. I have read that a patch that Google pushed out in April could be the root cause. I've turned off battery optimization (based on a user post) and it had zero impact, I also turned off \"Adaptive Brightness\" per another user suggestion, zero impact, I've also reset her network settings (based on another user recommendation) with zero impact.\n\nAny other suggestions other than trying a factory reset? She uses three different chat apps that all are encrypted, if she does a factory reset, she's losing all of that (years of text messages and associated media). \n\nI reached out to Google Support and I have to say it was one of the worst experiences I've ever had on tech support. Essentially they sent me a link to this forum and said \"fend for yourself\". They admitted on the phone that \"many users\" have reported the issue but couldn't tell me whether Google has determined the root cause or is planning on pushing a fix. They said if we're within the first 2 years of purchase we can get a refurb replacement, else, despite it being clearly their fault, we're SOL.\n\nI also am a Pixel owner (Pixel 2) and after this experience am unlikely to ever buy another Google product. It's unfortunate as I generally like the phones.",
