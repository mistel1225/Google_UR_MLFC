    "content": "I access private email accounts on my phone. These have worked perfectly for 3 years. Now I am suddenly getting a \"certificate has been changed\" error. I have spent an hour with my email service provider, but they say the certificate is fine. The problem is that google/gmail is not recognizing it as valid. Any suggestions to fix this?",
