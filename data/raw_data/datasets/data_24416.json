    "content": "Screen randomly will turn green for about 75% of the screen from the bottom up. I've tried \"Safe Mode\" and the phone rebooted in \"Safe Mode\" with the same flashing green screen. This phone is new and shouldn't be developing this issue. The phone has not been mistreated, always been in a protective case, and not in constant use as many others are......because I have a laptop and a large tablet for games, internet, email, and so on. After reading in this forum and others, I have learned that this is a wide spread issue with this model. \n\nHas a fix for this issue been discovered, or has Google stepped up to acknowledge this issue?\n\nAnd please do not suggest a complete factory reset......this will not change the issue. Numerous others have reported on the forums that a factory reset was only a waste of time.",
