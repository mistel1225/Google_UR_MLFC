    "content": "I've had this device for less than a month, working great. Last night i charged the phone to 100% around dinner time. The device felt warm in the evening..I did not use it much. Woke up this morning with the phone battery totally drained... Took about 60-90 min to recharged. Been ok since.. what could have caused this? I close all app before bed and put the phone on airplane mode.  Thanks.",
