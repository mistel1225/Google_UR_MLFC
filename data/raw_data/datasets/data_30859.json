    "content": "I received an update on my phone around a week ago. After updating it, my phones' theme changed to black (the quick access bar+the contacts background+the call background+ the volume bar), just like when my phone is on battery saving mode. I have tried everything to change this because I am used to the white background and I also prefer it. \n\nCan anyone please help me with this problem? I do not know how to fix it, I don't even know whether it is fixable at all?!!!!",
