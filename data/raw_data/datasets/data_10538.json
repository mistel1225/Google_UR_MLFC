    "content": "So i have ran geekbench,cpu -Z and a few others to check hardware .. i have only used the phone 3days and have only 3 downloaded apps. However all the benchmarks are showing 5.46gb ram total  with 1.5bg free and not 6gb. Just wondering is that shoddy hardware or something like a system reserve",
