    "content": "The double tap and the push notifications no longer showing both stopped working at the same time. I turned the double tap on and off and restarted the phone. It still didn't work. \n\nWhen I receive an email or message it still vibrates but it doesn't show the notification on the lock screen anymore. I haven't changed any notifications settings.",
