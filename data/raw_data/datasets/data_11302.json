    "content": "Just received my pixel 5 and the first thing I noticed was the quality of the calls. The other party can hear me fine, however, on my end it sounds like I'm talking to a robot and the quality of the call is terrible. I exchanged it for a new phone however the problem is still present, either on wifi or mobile network, the problem is still the same. I'm not sure if this is a software issue or if I should just exchange it again.",
