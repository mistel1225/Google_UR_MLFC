    "content": "I'm trying to call an automated menu system to schedule a car appointment, and when I take the phone away from my ear to access the dial pad and enter numbers, I can't get the screen to wake up. \n\nThis worked just fine last week, i'm not sure what's happened in the interim other than a phone update was applied. I have to assume this recent update has precluded my ability to access the dial pad menu when on a phone call. I also can't hang up a phone call because the screen doesn't wake up. I'm at the mercy of the other caller hoping they decide to hang up the phone in a timely fashion.\n\nHow do I fix this, this is unacceptable behavior for a phone and makes it useless for me.",
