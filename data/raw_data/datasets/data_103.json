    "content": "It's actually not an issue but am a little confused about this feature \"adaptive battery charging\".\nIt was around 2 pm and i set an alarm at 5 pm. Then i switched on the adaptive charging mode and it appeared like it trickled charged my pixel 5 as expected. All good so far. My only question is that in many other documents i read that adaptive battery charging works only with certain parameters i.e only if i charge my mobile at night(after 9pm) and set an alarm between 5 to 10 am. Then how did it work for me because i did all of this in afternoon. Am i missing something?",
