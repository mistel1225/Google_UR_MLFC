    "content": "I have a Pixel 3 and I have a Tesla Model 3. I am using the Tesla App which enables me to control my EV. My google assistant and phone in general  goes mute when I enter my car (phone & calendar are synced to the car).  I. can ask a question of Google Asst and it responds on the screen but there is no audio.   When I exit the car and the car goes to sleep, my Pixel 3 is no longer mute.  I am unable to unmute the phone while in the car and the phone unmutes itself once I leave the car.  I DO NOT believe that this is a Google Assistant issue, I believe this is an issue with the Pixel 3 and Bluetooth.",
