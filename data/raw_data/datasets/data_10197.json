    "content": "My Pixel 3a XL screen stuck at 'Phone is starting' after I restarted the phone. I've tried to restart in recovery mode, but the problem still remains. I don't wish to perform factory reset because I haven't backup my pictures. I tried to transfer the pictures but my PC doesn't detect the phone now. Could anyone please help on this matter? Thank you. ",
