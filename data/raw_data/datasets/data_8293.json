    "title": "Where is the setting to display \"pm\" and \"am\" on Pixel 4a lock-screen and top left clock?",
    "content": "How do add the \"pm\" and \"am\" to the digital clock on the top left corner? and how do I add \"pm\" and \"am\" to the clock on the lock-screen? I always have to log-in, then open my clock application program just to see if it's \"pm\" or \"am\". Yes, I live in a sewer and never see the sunlight, so I need to know if it's \"am\" or \"pm\". It seems that the only way to know if it's \"pm\" or \"am\" is to open the clock application program. And I can't use a 24-hour clock 'coz I have a phobia of the 24-hour clock; I need a 12 hour clock with \"pm\" and \"am\" displayed. Thanks.",
