    "content": "I'm trying to connect a wired microphone to my pixel 4a 5g and it simply doesn't connect and won't pick up any sound. I've also tired a 3.5mm port to Bluetooth adapter and connected it to my phone and I still can't get any sound from the microphone. I have 2 microphones I want to use and neither want to work\nIs there a setting in my phone I'm missing? Is there an app that'll force my phone to use them? I'm stumped on what to do.",
