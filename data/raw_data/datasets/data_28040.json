I can no longer swipe down for the notification screen, the phone is jumping in and out of apps, flinting around in calendar, and its like the top half of the screen doesn’t work. It’s becoming more and more unusable. I now cannot even unlock it. The screen is bouncing and non responsive. What is going on?!",
