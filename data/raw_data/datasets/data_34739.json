    "content": "I just got the phone yesterday switching from note 8 and yes i can feel the issue, i have been reading online and i am shocked with the hundred of people and topics i found facing the same issue\n\nSwiping and scrolling feel sort of sluggish as well, even a little choppy at times. Sort of like the phone isnt registering the full swipe or its intentionally slowing down the scroll speed. It also takes multiple swipes up to unlock..at times as many as 5 times I have to swipe up to unlock the phone, more often its like 2 or 3 and nearly every time I unlock it. Maybe not a huge issue but it definitely start to become very annoying after a short while. \n\nAlso the overall touch sensitivity on the phone just seems bad. It sometime registers odd touches, seemingly when I'm not touching it or just holding it. Other times it doesn't seem to register the touch in the right place, sometimes it off just a little, sometimes its a lot.\n\nThis is very disappointing coming from my Note 8 which had none of these issues. I expected to come to the google platform for the pure google experience and in this case at least I have found it incredibly lacking.\nThere are for sure a lot of things I love about this phone but the touch issues it has are annoying enough to kind of may me want to get rid of this phone and try something else.",
