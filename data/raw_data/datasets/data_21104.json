    "content": "When I swipe left from my homescreen to activate my Discover feed, I repeatedly get the error that \"It looks like there was an error signing into your account.\"\n\nIt works fine when I switch it to another account associated with the device.  I've already cleared cache for the Google App, cleared data for the Google App, uninstalled updates for the Google App, and reinstalled updated for the Google App.\n\nThis looks like it was an issue around this time last year that automagically resolved itself with an update?\n\nIs anyone else having this problem, or is it just me?  Does anyone have any suggestions for fixing it that I haven't already tried?\n\nThanks, -R",
