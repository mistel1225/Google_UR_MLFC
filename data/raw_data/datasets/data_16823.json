    "content": "Hi, I have checked and found that the delivery dates for pixel 4a is 15th october if i pre-order it now. That is more than 1 month for delivery. Is there a way I can buy them and get it shipped faster than that. Will they be available in a physical store where I can go and buy it faster than delivery in one month.\nLocation: Sydney, Australia\nThank you",
