    "content": "I am attempting to access the motherboard schematics for a google pixel 2 xl, and was not able to find any assistance on how to obtain these. I could not find a support number for google, nor could I receive assistance from lg who actually were contracted to manufacture the device. I have a phone that powers on but no screen and no back light. Any assistance or directive would be appreciated.",
