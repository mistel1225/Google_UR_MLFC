    "content": "When I view call history, calls in the recent past show the day, but not the date of the call. For example, calls from yesterday show \"Monday\" but not \"March 22, 2021.\"\n\nFor business reasons I need to always show the full date in case I need to send a screen cap to prove I made a call.\n\nIs this possible? TIA.",
