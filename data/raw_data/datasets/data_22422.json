    "content": "So I just realised today that my Pixel 3s Google Assistant wasn't working, here's my issue:\n\nIt acts like my microphone is broken (Not recognizing any noise at all but it's working whenever im recording videos)\n\nIt just works if I change the \"assistants voice\" into another color ask it a question then it'll stop recognizing my voice or there's no sound reaction at all.\n\nI can't retrain my assistant because the microphone doesn't \"work\" whenever i try to.\n\nI tried rebooting/reinstalling google assistant and the issue still persist..\n\nAny solutions for this?? Thanks!",
