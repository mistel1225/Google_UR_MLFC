    "content": "Hello!\n\nI have an interesting issue that happened spontaneously and has not been remedied. This device was replaced as my original device had a rear camera issue. I've had this for about four months with no issues until last week when I plugged my phone in before going to sleep. When I awoke there was a pink line down the display. The phone has not been dropped, there is no damage anywhere on the phone or screen. The phone maintains all functionality, including in the area where this pink line has formed.\n\nI've searched on google's support documentation for screen issues. The troubleshooting guide I used was \"Fix a Pixel screen that isn't working right\". (https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/6010316?hl=en&ref_topic=7084009)\n\nI've performed the restart which did not remedy the situation. Afterward I started the phone in safe mode, as instructed in the above guide which also did not remedy the issue. I have since removed the protective case, and also the screen protector which has made no difference.\n\nI'm looking for any other advice on how to fix the issue as it makes reading on my phone in the affected area impossible.",
