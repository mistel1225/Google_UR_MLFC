    "content": "My Pixel stand has stopped working with the Google USB C cables. I have tried different ones and they work if I plug into phone, however when I connect to the stand it gets no power. Have tried a 3rd party cable and it works just fine. Even ordered a new cable from the Google Store and it does the same thing. Tried different power bricks and outlets and all the same. Gets power and will charge phone only from the 3rd party cable not any of the Google ones. Any one else seen this issue?",
