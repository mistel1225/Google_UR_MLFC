    "content": "Hello everyone, got a Pixel 4 last day. When setting up some black backgrounds, I started noticing something annoying/weird. Let me start by saying Motion Sense is turned off, so that's not the problem. Basically, while I'm in the lock-screen, the screen is completely full black, as it should be (and as the wallpaper is too!).\nThe problem produces instantly in the moment when I unlocks it and get in the home-screen. Suddenly, two annoying soft, grayish gradients appear, one from top, the other from bottom. What kind of sense does this make? I'm guessing this can't be an hardware issue, cause if it was the case, the problem would be there constantly, in the lock-screen as well, right?\nI thought it might be some google launcher's feature?\nCan anyone provide help? Should I get it replaced?\nThank you!",
