    "content": "My phone seems to get warm, or hot, rather quickly. I have never noticed any previous phone of mine to ever really feel warm unless I was charging it and using maps or something like that. But my pixel 3a gets pretty toasty with even light work, like typing this up. And it gets extra toasty when charging? Are these things normal for a pixel? Or, how do I even know how hot is too hot or just being a phone? Bc I am aware this may not even be an issue. Thanks in advance.",
