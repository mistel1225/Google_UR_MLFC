    "content": "Hi all.  Had issues with my Google Pixel in recent months.  It started off just freezing occasionally, causing me to force restart it.  Then a few weekls ago, this freezing increased to 4 or 5 times a day.  The following day it became a permanent problem which allowed me to trouble shoot what was happening.  If my phone was called, it would give a failed signal.  About 20 seconds later, my phone actually rung.  i would answer and there was nothing there and my phone was frozen.  I factory reset the phone but that didnt work.  i changed the sim card and that got it going.  This week it has started again.  Freezing, some delayed calls as before.  Sometimes after restarting previously sent SMS messages are re received.  All other functions of the phone are working.  I'm with Vodafone and they blame the phone.  Looking at having to buy a new phone but looking for ideas before i do.  I have plenty of storage and have the latest version of Android.",
