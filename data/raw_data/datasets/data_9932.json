    "content": "I had a google pixel 4 which I loved like a baby. I have been a pixel user from the days of Nexus 4. My pixel 4 all of a sudden couldn't charge. Google recommended I take it to their contracted repair shop which they fixed for free. \n\nA few months later the phone couldn't charge again, couldn't read simcards or play through loud speaker. I took it back to the shop where it was fixed before but the tech recommended google to do an RMA since it was beyond repair.\n\nI open up a case with google, went through the basics and finally said they would send me a replacement after sending them my faulty device.\n\nI was supposedly sent instructions through email on how to return the phone. I have never seen any email with such instructions yet google say they processed the return. I have checked my spam, trash and every folder I could think of but nothing.\n\nEverytime I have reached out to google, they have  taken me through the same cycle of my case was escalated but nothing progresses on my end. I got lucky one time and got on a call with google. A lady did a screen sharing on my loaner pixel 3a and confirmed that indeed I didn't have the email she was expecting to see in my inbox.\n\nThe experience has been really terrible and at this point, I have given up on Google pixels. I feel like google is not doing enough to support it's customers like Apple does. \n\nHAS ANYONE GONE THROUGH A SIMILAR RMA PROCESS?\n\nI am disappointed and frustrated.",
