    "content": "I love my pixel 2 so much that i converted my wife from the iPhone to the pixel 3.  I have been having random network slowness issues with my phone starting last summer or fall where i had verizon replace my phone but i still have slowness randomly and sometimes i have to swap an app off for it to load.  Sometimes i will see chrome give me an error when trying to load a page that basically says there is no network connection be it on wifi or the verizon network.  In the past I have factory reset my phone, reset my network settings, changed random settings one at a time to see if that makes a difference but it seems to happen more often.  The other day i was listening to music (siriusxm or pandora) the phone crashed and rebooted and now my phone doesnt always charge like it had before.  I have been rebooting it throughout the week and that seems to help but i shouldnt have to reboot my phone a lot for it to work properly.",
