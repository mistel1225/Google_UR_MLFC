    "content": "I don't seem to be able to press the power button fast enough to launch the camera, is there any way to adjust the sensitivity?  I would say I'm only managing it about 75% of the time.  I'm new to the Pixel 3a and Android Pie, on my old Android phone I used the camera launcher icon on the lock screen.",
