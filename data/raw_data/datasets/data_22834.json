    "content": "For some reason whenever I am on my home wifi the notifications form Gmail, WhatsApp, GroupMe, Snapchat, and ect. are always slow up to half an hour. They usually pop up right away as soon as I disconnect wifi and switch over to data. I have tried factory reset, turning off adaptive battery, turning off battery optimazation for those apps and even checking the \"keep data always on\" box in developer settings. Nothing seems to help.",
