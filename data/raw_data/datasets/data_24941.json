    "content": "I bought my Pixel 4 XL to replace my Pixel 3 Xl that I am using on Google FI. I bought it unlocked from the Google store. During the set up process T-mobile software gets loaded automatically. I have reset the phone multiple times and even chose not to restore my old settings and the software is still being loaded.\n\nMy son has an iPhone 10 because our area does not have good reception we were sent a 4G LTE Cell-spot. This uses my current broadband connection to allow us good service in the house.\n\nHas anyone else experienced this??? \n\nThanks, \nBrian",
