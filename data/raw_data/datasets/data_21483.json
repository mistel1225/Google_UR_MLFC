    "title": "Pixel 3 with 2020 Sonata SEL plus won't receive Texts in car on Bluetooth",
    "content": "No notifications in car when texts come in when connected by Bluetooth. If streaming media, get pause for sound, but no notifications. Works fine when tethered for Android Auto, but that makes sense since a \"projection\" from phone. Really need full Bluetooth functionality. Have tried all trouble shooting, resets, reboots, clean reboot, reset car audio, even a second Pixel 3. Please help.",
