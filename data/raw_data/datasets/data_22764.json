    "title": "L2PT/VPN (PSK) Issues with Android 10/Pixel 4XL",
    "content": "I recently switched from iOS/Verizon to Android/Pixel/GoogleFi.  One issue I am having I run UniFi and I cannot connect to my L2PT VPN with the Pixel 4 on GoogleFi.  I still have a few iOS phones and other PC/Macs that have no issues connecting.  I opened a case with Google and they seem to want to redirect me to Ubiquiti for support, but since it works with other devices I am reluctant to think it is a UniFi issue.  Settings fields are the same regardless of the device (host name/network type/shared secret/credentials).\n\nI am not sure if this is a Pixel android issue or something Fi specific.\n\nAny thoughts?",
