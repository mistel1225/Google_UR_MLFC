    "content": "Have no doubt. Google is cheating us. I sent the phone for service with in three days of purchase regarding the low ring volume issue. After a week , they are saying that they have checked the volume and it is as per the standard. I asked them what is their standard decibels but they dont know about decibel and they dont have any standard over that. The person told me that when he hear the Ring Tone it seems to be ok for him!! now they are sending back my phone. No replacement. My God! what a fool i am.",
