    "content": "Hi, \n\nTwice in the last month my Pixel has all of sudden stopped connecting to Google. Under Google Account on the phone, it  will just show \"unable to connect to the internet\". Backup stops functioning, I get Google Play Services errors keep popping up and also GPS doesn't work at all. \n\nMy browser and all my other apps with internet connection will work fine still so it's not an issue with the network.\n\nBoth instances of this, have happened whilst I've been playing the Pok√©mon Go game. (Therefore is most likely the cause). \n\nThe only way I've discovered of fixing it, is to factory reset my phone. \n\nDoes anyone know why would this game would be causing this to happen? My partner uses an S9 and has no such issues.\n\nAny help would be amazing. Thank you.",
