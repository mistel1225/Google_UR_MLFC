    "title": "Pixel 2 XL random reboots being unused (even locked) after updating to Android 10",
    "content": "I have huge problem on my Pixel 2 XL device (and I have found that the problem concerns also Pixel 3 and Pixel 4 devices) since installing Android 10 - device is randomly rebooting being unused (locked) a few times per day (sometimes twice, sometimes five time or more) in my pocket, lying on the desk, etc.\n\nI have performed hard reset a few weeks ago (and configured my device totally from scratch) which has helped me for only 1-2 days (after that it went back and device started rebooting again).\n\nI love my Pixel (and I can't find any better device which should be fitting my expectations) but it seems that Google has released one of the most bugged OS in their history.",
