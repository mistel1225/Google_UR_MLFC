    "content": "I have the original pixel 1 and I tried clearing storage data and cache, cleaning lenses, restart the phone on safe mode, uninstalling updates on the camera app but nothing works. The photo look greenish. I tried to touch the subject while shooting but I was not able to get the shot like before. Any suggestion?",
