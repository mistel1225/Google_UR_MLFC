    "content": "Hey guys,\n\nI can't find anything about it on the internet, but it seems (at least for me) that there is no action suggestion anymore. That was the feature I was most excited about, like time for work, just swipe up and it shows you navigation to work place.\nAm I missing something or why does pixel 3 has it and pixel 4 doesn't?\n\nSorry for German screenshot. Shouldn't be necessary but maybe you know what I'm talking about better.",
