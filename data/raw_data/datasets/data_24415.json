    "content": "I tested with Google On Device Speech Recognition (offline mode) in \"Korean\", but it seems that error rate is high. Is this a normal phenomenon?\n\n1. Why the google onDevice asr (offline mode) performance is not good in Korean?\n2. Is there any results for Korean (on device ASR performance etc)?\n\nThanks,\nJiyeon Kim.",
