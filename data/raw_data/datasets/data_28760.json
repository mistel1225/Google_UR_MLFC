    "content": "I have recently received a unlocked Verizon model of the Pixel 3 XL. After discussing with support, I initially came to find out that esim functionality was not available but I could utilize a Fi sim card on the device without losing any functionality. Specifically asked if carrier switch functionality would continue to work - was advised that it would. \n\nI have come to find out that carrier switching is not working on the device, and currently I am only able to receive T-mobile tower coverage. This is clearly very undesirable, as the biggest selling point to Fi is the ability to switch through multiple carriers. Extremely disappointing that I've lost this feature as it worked perfectly fine on Verizon's Pixel 2 XL model. \n\nIs there any way to enable carrier switching on this device?",
