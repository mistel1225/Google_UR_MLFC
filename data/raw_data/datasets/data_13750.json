    "content": "I have \nXiaomi Redmi Note 8 Pro - Latest available update\nI added my mother mail to phone because I need to use and administrate her youtube account.\nHer contacts are not copied to my Google Contact app and my primary account is used as default contact mail. \nBut when I call my Dad, I have message \"Calling My Darling\" ðŸ˜†\nI cant see, or find that in settings to change contacts mail in that app.\nBiggest problem is, because my english is not the best, and app is called \"Phone\", so when I Google it, Google think to I search my problem for any phone who has app for any contacts app. Something like that. \nSometimes, simple names are big problem ðŸ™„.\nSo I ask you here, I dont know what or how to google this to find correct answer.\n\nEdit: Now I see to this is Pixel Help Community.. Sorry for this.. Didn't realize until send this message and go to home page of community.\nI find this through search..",
