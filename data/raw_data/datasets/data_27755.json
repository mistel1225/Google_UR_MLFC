    "content": "Hello all, my main issue is that I just received my 3rd Pixel 3 and my back ups are not showing up. When i had my first Pixel 3 running Android Pie i backed it up and upon receiving my 2nd Pixel i was able to use that back up and restore the 2nd device with no problem. During my time with the 2nd device I installed the Beta 10 Android Q and used that for a while and did all of the updates. On Aug 26th I checked that all was being backed up as normal since auto backup options are defaulted to be on and everything looked good to go. I then reset the phone to google and i just received the new device and tried to to a restore but there are no back ups in my Google Drive. An agent from google suggested that because my most recent back was done while i was using Android Q that I should install Android Q on this device and that should work but I've done that and my back up is still missing. The most important thing i wish to recover is my messages. There's has to be somewhere that the info is stored. Please help!",
