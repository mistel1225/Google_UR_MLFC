    "content": "After getting the update to Android 11, my pixel 3 is now incorrectly complaining that I'm over my data limit (notification is \"High mobile data usage\".  When I tap on it, it thinks my plan is only ~541MB (it's much higher). When I tap \"view plan\" to try to correct it, the screen flashes then comes back to the same screen (as if the \"view plan\" screen crashed).  Rebooting did not help.",
