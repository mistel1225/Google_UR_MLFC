    "content": "This is a fairly recent phenomenon. In the past, if I delete all voicemails, Phone doesn't give any new notifications for voicemail.\n\nRecently, this has changed. I restart my phone every day (which prevents certain problems). However, now, every time I restart, Phone gives a notification that I have voicemail. I have checked, more than once, and I really don't have any voicemail! (I always delete voicemail once I've listened to it.)\n\nHow can I stop Phone from giving me this spurious message when I restart?",
