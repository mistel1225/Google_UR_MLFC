    "title": "Pixel 4 plays media (Audible) fine with Google Home, but forces volume to 0 in car.",
    "content": "My Pixel 4 will play media (Audible) through my Home speaker without problem. But when I try to connect to my car or my wife's (Prius, Prius V) it starts then cuts out the sound with volume forced to 0. Using the volume key or the settings to raise volume doesn't work...the volume shoots to 0 immediately. \n\nIf I turn off bluetooth it plays through the phone speaker. \n\nI've looked for settings to change but can't find any.",
