    "content": "Three intermittent issues, not sure whether they're related.\n(1a) In camera app, screen occasionally gets a weird \"shimmer.\"\n(1b) In camera app, phone occasionally emits a strange buzz.\nBuzz is always present during shimmer, but not vice versa. Each is relatively rare, happened perhaps 6 times this month.\nPutting the phone to sleep solves both problems (i.e., an extremely quick fix).\nHaven't figured out what triggers either phenomenon; they seem quite random.\n\n(2) Folks almost universally complain that my speakerphone is giving them an \"alarm\" sound or is entirely inaudible.\nThis is fixed by switching to either the handset or the headset.\nWhen I test this myself by calling my wife's iPhone X, we're unable to replicate the error.\nHowever, everybody else -- from my Dad's iPhone X to a restaurant's land line to Bank of America's call centers -- pretty consistently complains about it.\n\nPixel 3, Verizon, Android 9",
