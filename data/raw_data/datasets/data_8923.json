    "title": "Pixel 3a XL having all kinds of issues after Android 11 update",
    "content": "First off, the android 11 update sucks!  Right after the update the phone went into the black screen of death.  I was able to restart the phone and everything seemed to be working fine until today.  The phone stopped responding to normal touch commands and swipe commands.  I am barely able to get to the home screen as  I can't swipe and the apps I can see on the home screen require one press to select the app and then a double tap to open the app.  All the while the google assistant is talking over every action that I can perform (not much at all) but not even in English but in Spanish or Italian, I'm not sure.  I have tried rebooting multiple times but nothing helps.  I can't get to any info for the phone, no IMEI number nothing.  Please help.",
