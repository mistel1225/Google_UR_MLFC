    "content": "Right now, photos seem to save in different folders on my phone. For example, photos from text messages save to a Messages folder and photos from Snapchat save to a Snapchat folder. Ideally, all photos would save to a single folder called Camera - and this is because my photos from that one folder automatically upload to Dropbox (the other folders do not, and I have to physically move them over for the download to start). Is there a way to force photos to save to one single location?\n\nThanks for your time!",
