    "content": "The white column on the touchscreen doesn't respond to touch. I have used Google Keep to colour the screen and identify the area which doesn't respond. I have done a factory reset but still it isn't working. A ticket was generated on 15 August 2020, but Google is not picking up the device even after the lapse of 7 days. How long should I wait? I tried to contact the courier company but they didn't respond. Till now I have chatted with seven Google representatives but I am not getting any viable resolution. I have read that others have got their phone replaced because the issue was caused by a hardware failure. Is it true? Is anyone else facing the same issue? My device was bought in November 2019 and in warranty.",
