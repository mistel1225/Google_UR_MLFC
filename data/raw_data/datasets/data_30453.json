    "content": "Last evening my phone was working normaly and I was charging it throughout the night. In the morning my phone wouldn't react to anything. \nI have tried holding the power button for 30sec or pressing the power button and the volume down button at the same time. Both Actions didn't do anything. \nThe only response I get is when I connect the phone to a PC. The phone then shows up in the Device Manager.",
