    "content": "Hey, Anyone facing multi touch issue in pixel 2 xl ? I have noticed it while Playing PUBG. When i do multi touch and i move my finger very slowly then it has a huge delay in touch response. Couldn't even do sniping in PUBG cause it needs accuracy and when i move my finger very slowly then it doesn't register my touch rather it cause some huge delay so touch shifts to a different point rather than where i want to shift it. Then after i checked with multi touch application to cross verify it and i found out that the issue is with the screen.",
