    "content": "So for the last 2 days I have turned my phone off while at work.  At the end of my shift when I try to turn my phone on it won't power up.  I have to plug it into a charger to power on and it's at 1%.  Both days it was turned off with 80+% battery life left.  Also when I try to turn it on I have to hold the power button for 30 sec.  Additionally I've noticed the power has been draining excessively with power save turned on and adaptive power turned on.  Any thoughts?",
