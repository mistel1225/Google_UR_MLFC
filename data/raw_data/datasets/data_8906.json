    "content": "Where do I go to learn how to use this phone? Downloading images, copying and pasting images, going forward in the browser, and many more things I could do with my previous iphone and Samsung no longer works, and given I haven't found a single guide on how to do these actions I assume Google is wanting me to get a wizard and do some incantations or something. I need a tutorial to basic functions on how to use the OS for this phone I bought or I have a paperweight.",
