    "title": "Lowest volume on Pixel 5 system sounds is very loud",
    "content": "I have my volume set to the very bottom and my system sounds are very loud (screenshot sound, camera shutter, dialer tones, etc).\n\nMany others have posted about this on here and Reddit but I have yet to see an official answer from Google. I really want to see this fixed in a software update ASAP.\n\nEDIT 2: I'm noticing some notification sounds are shockingly loud, too. Such as a notification sound that it's my turn in a game (Star Realms). And the text notification sound. This is the case even with all volume sliders set to the very bottom.\n\nEDIT 3: This is a volume bug, plain and simple. We deserve an answer from Google about why this is happening and whether they can fix it in a software update. This never happened with Google Pixel 1, 2, 3, or 4. I am FED UP with the lack of response from Google Support representatives, who consistently tell us that \"no one else has reported this issue,\" which as you can see from the MANY posts about it, is clearly untrue. I have begun contacting media about this issue to hopefully cause Google to finally give us some answers.\n\nHere are other threads about the same issue:\nhttps://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/79219514?hl=en#\n\nhttps://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/77479730?hl=en\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/jm8yzm/lowest_volume_on_pixel_5_notifications_is_very/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/jnpwhd/pixel_5_users_volume_issue_on_some_systemapp/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share",
