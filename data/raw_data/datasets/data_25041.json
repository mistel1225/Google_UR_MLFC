    "content": "I've seen many, many posts about Pixels that will not boot up and continually restart before booting up. (all were locked or I would have posted on one of those)\nI just suffered from this issue for the last 12 hours. I could not even get it in safe mode and did not try Factory Reset since so many had reported it NOT fixing the issue. Basically my phone was a brick restarting over and over and nothing worked. Fully charging it, etc.\n\nFirst, what used to work was fully powering off from the screen where you get to factory reset, then wait 30 seconds, then full on until I hear the vibrate in the power button (only with no charging cable applied - if cable was connected it would not work). Well, this did not even work today.\n\nWhat finally DID work for me today was the same dropping of my phone flat on it's back from 12\" to 18\" on a carpeted floor... just as I write in my posts in this thread (GatorAndroid):\nhttps://productforums.google.com/forum/#!topic/phone-by-google/usWaieQt_7I\n(be careful, I'm not responsible if something goes wrong)\nI did it this time while powered off, and on my next power up, it FINALLY allowed my 12-hour bricked phone to come out of the repeated reboots.\n\nI'm on my way out of this Pixel. I have it for 2.25 years and just too many problems to list and self-debugging like this. Easily 80-120 hours of my time over the 2 years. Unfortunately could not even consider a Pixel 3 because of the issues I've had over the past 2 years. Good luck.",
