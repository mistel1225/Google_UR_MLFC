    "title": "Android 11 update on Pixel 3xl caused battery overheating/expansion, splitting the case",
    "content": "I updated to Android 11 on 9/5, according to the System->System update.  In the following days, I noticed the phone seemed a little warmer than usual.  Also, I usually plug my phone into my laptop's USB-C port to charge.  A few days ago it would constantly notify me it was charging, stop charging (according to the charge status icon) continuously.  I eventually stopped keeping it plugged into my laptop.\n\nA couple of days ago the phone started getting much warmer.  Today, I took it out of my protective case and noticed that the right side of the case where the power button and volume control are.  It looks like the battery has expanded from the heat, splitting the seal on the case.  The phone is still working, but I don't think it will be working for long if I can't reseal the phone case and stop the overheating.  Here's a picture of the split phone case:  (couldn't add a link to my picture in Google Photos of the split phone).",
