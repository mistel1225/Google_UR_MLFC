    "content": "In my \"pull down\" notifications I seem to have a \"media\" section at the top where my podcast player (Castbox) and my audiobook player (Smart AudioBook) always show up (once I have started them). But, my mp3 player (MediaMonkey) doesn't ever show up there. I was hoping to change my settings so that MM appears there as well. Any help you can give is appreciated!",
