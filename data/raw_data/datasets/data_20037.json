    "content": "Whenever a charging cable is plugged in or unplugged on my pixel 2, the current open app will refresh i.e. for chrome, the web page will refresh, for Facebook it will take me to the top of my timeline and refresh it. This has only started happening since the Android 10 update, and also seems to be affecting \"dark mode\", which also toggles depending on whether the cable is plugged in or not (not sure if this is related to battery saving being turned on or not.",
