    "content": "Hi, I'm using classic old headphones with wire, and they have the 3 typical buttons: Play/Pause, Vol Up and Vol Down. The play/pause works when I'm listening to music or want to start/finish a call, but I cannot change volume in any app I'm using. The headphones work perfectly on other devices. Any ideas/solutions?",
