    "content": "I have a new pixel 5 and with the input the keyboard doesn't swype, the microphone icon is gone so there is not voice to text conversion, spell check/correction is gone.\n\nRandomly when pressing keys on the keyboard it just stops working. I've reset my phone and tried two different users.  Same issues.\n\nI've been trying to get support for 3 days now and I can't speak to anyone.  First, it's 3pm CST and support says its open until 11:50pm but can't get support because it says close with a greyed out icon.  When I can get through, I start a chat but can't continue them because of these issues where the keyboard stops inputting into the chat box.  I ask for call back and nobody calls me back.  Finally in a chat someone gave me the direct number for pixel support and when you call that number is says support staff are working from home and support is closed. \n\nSeveral years ago we had a similar issue with a test phone and Google lost a sale of 135 phones due similar dumb issues.  So yeah - with this test, Google has failed miserable again.  Our businesses are not going to refresh our phones to pixels.\n\nIt amazing how Google repeated seems to shoot themselves in the foot over easily preventable items.",
