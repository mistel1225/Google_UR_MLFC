    "content": "Pixel 4XL portrait mode no longer working properly. When attempting to take a portrait photo it will still produce two photos like it should. However, neither photo has bokeh. I have noticed it will intermittently work like it should if the subject is close only. This was not an issue before the recent public android 11 update. It was not an issues when I was on Android 11 beta either. I have not confirmed if there are any other camera related issues.",
