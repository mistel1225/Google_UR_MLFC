    "title": "[Pixel 4a] Lock screen wallpaper isn't oriented like the offset set in the settings",
    "content": "Hi, I'm trying to change my lock screen wallpaper through the settings. When I choose one of the system wallpapers it shows a preview of how it'll look, and since the image is too big to be fully shown, it naturally let's you move the image to decide which part of the picture you want on your screen.\n\nAfter hitting the V button and saving the image as lock screen only, the image always seems to be offset, always showing the bottom left part of the original picture, no matter how I orient it in the settings.\n\nI have Nova Launcher installed, but from what I understand it shouldn't interfere with the lock screen wallpaper.",
