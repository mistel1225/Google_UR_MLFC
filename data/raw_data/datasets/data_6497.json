    "content": "My Google Pixel 5's battery is draining for no apparent reason. When I look at the battery usage graph, the amount of battery that apps and processes are using does not add up to the amount drained since the last full charge. I have heard that an update was released in December, and I have updated my phone to the latest version the settings app will show me, but the same thing keeps happening. (There is a possibility that I might have not received that update, so I can give details on what version I am on if needed.) My phone is also sometimes a bit warm to the touch, which I feel might not be good for it.",
