    "content": "I updated to the android 10 this morning. Ever since my ringtones don't work, not my call, my text or notification ones. If i use my camera it doesn't save the picture. I can't download pictures or take screenshots. I can't post pictures on fb, in messenger, etc. My battery has drained way more than normal. It makes a random beeping noise for a few minutes and idk why. And im sure there is more im forgetting. Can i go back to an old update or how can i fix this one!",
