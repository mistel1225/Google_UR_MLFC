    "content": "I called google support several times. They ask me to do all kind of things, reset, try to use safe mode. Didn't help. They told me that is need  to be replaced, since it is under warranty. They ask me for order id. I do not have it. They said that without order id they cannot proceed. However, I looked at the warranty and order id is not required. I bought the phone from the third party. When I was buying, I called google to verify that it is in good state and under warranty. Google confirmed. They didn't tell me that warranty works only if I have an order id. Now I need my phone replaced under warranty they google ask me for order id that i do not have.",
