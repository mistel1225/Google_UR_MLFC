Just AI behind the keyboard) and claim for a warranty..\ndiagnostics.. photos.. videos etc. etc. and they told me \"ok your phone will be repaired or replaced by another one\"..\ntoday 5 months further .. more than 50-60 emails.. phone calls etc.. \nthey not able to find a solution.. the emails seems are automatic responses.. and lie about everything.\n\nGoogle support team stop lie to your customers.. if you can't do your job correctly .. just don't do it.\n\ngoogle is just Waste of time and energy... never again.",
