    "content": "So as I understand it the Pixel 4 XL Google Assistant should be loaded locally on the device, better performance and overall \"assistant\" capability? This doesn't appear to be the case and my question is whether this functionality is linked to a full G-Suite account?\n\nCurrently I use my Hotmail ID which is registered to Google in order to sign in, that's the primary account on my device - does this make a difference? If yes, what is the solution? I could add a secondary Google ID but I don't want to use it as a primary account as my personal email etc. goes to Hotmail - unless you can provide a specific Gmail address to match my name !\n\nLooking for some advice really as I don't think I am getting the best from the device, and I've read posts that seem to suggest it really only works with a full G-Suite account.",
