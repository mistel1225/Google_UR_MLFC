    "content": "I am streaming to my Hearing aid in my right ear using ASHA on Android 10. Since I only have an aid in my Right ear and the protocol supports dual devices I was hoping/expecting to be able to listen to the left channel via the phone 'in the usual way'. But it seems it can only 'stream or not steam'. How do I get it to stream only the right Channel?",
