    "content": "My Pixel 2 doest charge when plugged in. This started 2 days back until then it was perfect. I checked charging in every angles but it didnt help. I booted the phone into safe mode to check if it was any apps causing the problem but it didn't charge even in safe mode. I restarted phone several times. I tried to charge when its powered off but when plugging in while its power off the phone powers on without being charged. What to do now.?",
