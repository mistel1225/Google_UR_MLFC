    "content": "Hello,\n\nI mainly use speakerphone when I am on calls.  I have been told since switching to the Pixel 4 XL that I sound muffled, or I sound like I am underwater on the other end.  My audio on my end sounds fine, I can hear the other person with no issues.  They have issues hearing me.  Is this a known issue? Would there be an RMA for this type of issue?\n\nThanks\nRory",
