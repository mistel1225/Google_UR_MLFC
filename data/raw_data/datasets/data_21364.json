    "content": "I’m having issues with my phone just going off or it being inactive. The phone is fully charged and it was working perfectly an hour ago. But the home button when pressed wont turn on the screen or using the finger sensor. It just stays black. So I restart it and it works for a few more hours before it does this again. I contacted google and they had me do a factory reset. Still having the same issues. I’m starting to think it’s the proximity sensor but I was told it only works when the phone is on call. The screen is perfect no scratches or breaks. So idk what’s causing it. Any ideas?\n\nThanks for reading!",
