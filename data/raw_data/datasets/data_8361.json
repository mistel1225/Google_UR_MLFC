    "content": "Hi. I found an issue. If device is connected to LTE without Internet connection it doesn't want change to 3G but 3G has good connection quality and has Internet. If i change to 3g manually (in Settings) i will have GSM and Internet but if LTE by default i will have GSM without Internet.",
