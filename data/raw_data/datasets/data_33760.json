    "content": " Phone was on 60ish% battery and working normal. Then all the sudden the headphones stopped working. Tried to turn off and back on and phone wouldn't turn back on until hooked to wall charger.  Now phone will only stay on if plugged in??  I have tried holding down power button to do hard reset as I've seen suggested and that didn't help either.  Even holding down longer than 30 seconds and it still won't flash the Google emblem that people say will happen. Phone is only a couple months old.. WTH?  Anyone have a suggestion on what to do?  Thanks in advance! :)",
