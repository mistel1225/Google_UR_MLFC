    "content": "For the last few weeks, the mobile data will not turn off on my pixel 4A and my wife's pixel 4a, even though the settings show that it's off. We also have the mobile data turned off in the developer settings. Now, if we turn the mobile data on and then turn it off or reset the APN, the mobile data will stay off for a short while but then automatically turns back on again, even though the mobile data settings show that it is off.  Meaning we have full internet access, websites, receive all online-based notifications, etc even though the mobile data is turned off in the regular and developer settings\n\nWhat is going on here? Anyone know a solution? Thank you very much",
