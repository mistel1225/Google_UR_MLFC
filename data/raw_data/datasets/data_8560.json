    "content": "I have had several pixel phones and google devices in the past. Most recently, switched from the pixel 3. The pixel 3's camera is fantastic! I purchased two Pixel 5 devices and so far the camera quality is horrible. In both the front and rear facing camera I am experiencing the same quality issues. Blurred photos, noise, no clarity or details, etc. It's comparable to the very first digital camera I ever owned in early 2000. I contacted support a few times, they suggested a few soft items and factory reset. This did nothing to resolve the issues. They then suggested to take it to be \"fixed\" at an authorized store (Ubreakifix). The store did not have parts or believed it would be a hardware issue they could fix. Finally, they offered to replace ONE of the phones? Ok. We will see if the replacement device is better, but I feel it's a fundamental flaw in the current hardware / design. I will come back with an update once the replacement comes, but I am not hopeful. At this point I would not recommend buying a pixel 5 - especially if you use it for your main camera like most people. Worst. Camera. Ever.",
