    "content": "I really liked how my IPhone showed me notifications on the locked screen. I now have to do SO MUCH to see the notifications I miss. I often miss calls and I don't see them until a day later because for some odd reason Google decided it's more important to see missed texts while it buries missed phone calls all the way at the bottom where you must swipe up for a while to see it. I want to change that. I also have to do a lot to see what the text said. It's a very ineffecient notifications system to me and it drives me bonkers daily. It makes me not want to communicate. Anyway to change the order things show up or how much of messages you can see? Or the decrease the amount of scrolling needed to see all notifications",
