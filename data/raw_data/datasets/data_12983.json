    "content": "I backed up everything to Google Drive, connected the two devices with the cable and everything is good but some of the texts for some people for October are missing... others are there, but none are complete where there was October activity.  It appears that the affected timeframe is somewhere in Sep-Oct but it is difficult to ascertain as they are all different.  I have been texting since setting up the new device yesterday and do not want to overwrite that -- is there some way to manually transfer for just those people whose texts are missing? Thanks for any help!",
