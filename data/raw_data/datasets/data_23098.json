    "title": "*HEALTH HAZARD* Google Pixel 3a Bluetooth headset volume increases to maximum upon screen unlock.",
    "content": "Since I first began using my Google Pixel 3a, upon turning on my headphones, the volume switches to maximum and nearly blows out my eardrums if I'm not prepared to turn down the volume before I play music. This happens about half the time. When I'm playing music at a low volume through my Bluetooth headset and I unlock my device, the volume again switches to maximum and nearly blows out my eardrums. This happens most of the time when I unlock my device with my headset on.\n\nThis is not influenced by other apps open on the device, as it still occurs when all other apps are closed. It still occurs when the device is started in safe mode. From what others have said, it still occurs with other Bluetooth headsets and others/myself have demonstrated that this does not occur using the same headset on other devices. This is absolutely an issue with the Google Pixel 3a and probably the 3 and 3XL as well.\n\nA temporary fix would be nice (for my safety and the safety of others), but there really should be a permanent update to address this issue. Google has been made aware of this issue in the past and I'm really concerned about Google's neglect to take action on this. Its only a matter of time before somebody files a lawsuit for permanent hearing damage.",
