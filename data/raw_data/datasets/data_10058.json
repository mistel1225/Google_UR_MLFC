    "content": "When AOD is enabled and you're outside, my pixel 5 takes 2-3 seconds for adaptive brightness to kick in to where I can see the screen.. so when I have a call I literally cannot see who's calling for like 3 seconds after I pull it out of my pocket. When AOD is off this problem actually goes away, the adaptive brightness kicks in as soon as you unlock it like it should. I'm guessing the issue seems like the AOD brightness lowers after a few seconds and when you unlock it, it takes a few seconds for adaptive display to kick in.",
