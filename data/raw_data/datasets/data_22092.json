    "content": "I've searched for adding a \"forward\" swipe on my Pixel 4 since the day I bought it, never successful. WTF? \n\nCurrently no matter if you swipe from left/right side while using Chrome (or any app for that matter), it just goes BACK. Why wouldn't it have a forward gesture I don't understand (just swipe right). A, what seems to be, BASIC OPTION IN ANY PHONE, is now messing my experience with the phone every single day.\n\nSo for example if I accidentally (or not) go a page back in Chrome or any other app, then I want to go \"forward\" to the page I was previous on, what do I do? (please don't say click on 3 dots in chrome and there you have an arrow, this is one of the most dumbest implementations I have ever seen on anything, and it does not work with other apps).\n\nSo often I find myself swiping from the right to go forward and it just messes up my whole application or just exits to the home screen and fully closes the app while not saving my previous session. Then I have to restart the app and look for the page I wanted to initially swipe forward to... (which can take up to several minutes if I'm searching for something more complicated).\n\nShouldn't swiping forward be one of the fundamentals for any app? Am I missing something here? I feel like I'm using some 90s beta software that doesn't have a CTRL+Z action...",
