    "content": "I am having problems with Bluetooth connectivity on my Google Pixel 3. When I am watching videos on YouTube and music streaming on my Bluetooth earphones, the problem I am seeing is bluetooth connectivity completely dropping in and out, or glitching for a few seconds, and reconnect after a while. Also the audio keeps skipping and lagging which makes it completely inaudible. The phone is typically in my arm, or in my pocket, just below the headphones bluetooth receiver (so very short distance, no blocking). I hope engineers at Google will fix this as soon as possible with a software update and help me and all the others who are having the same problem. Also the following link shows that many other Pixel 3 owners are dealing with the same problems:- https://thedroidguy.com/2018/12/google-pixel-3-bluetooth-connection-to-headphones-keeps-dropping-1094678",
