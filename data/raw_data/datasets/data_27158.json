    "content": "I have a question relating to the new Google Assistant which operates locally on the Pixel 4 device - which works much more responsively and smoothly.  My understanding is that this is currently limited to English (US).  However, I read on another site that it ONLY works in the USA.  If I were to order the phone from the USA (US version of the device), would this feature work in a place like Hong Kong even if I am using English (US) as the default language?  I am referring to this article:  https://www.androidpolice.com/2019/10/16/new-google-assistant-features-on-pixel-4-exclusive-to-us-at-launch-only-speaks-english/\n\nSo is this feature geo-blocked using software to the USA?  Or is it pre-loaded onto the US hardware?  My Google account and google play store is the HK playstore.  I need clarification on this before deciding to order (the device is not available for sale in HK).  I already know that some features such as motion sense will not work in Hong Kong already.",
