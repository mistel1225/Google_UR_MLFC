    "content": "I leave battery saver and dark mode on all the time. However, when I'm charging my phone, I think the battery saver goes off sometimes and the keyboard display is light mode again. But this usually goes away after I unplug my phone. The last time, though, the light display keyboard is stuck even after unplugging it and I cannot toggle between dark and light mode anymore (it's always stuck at dark mode for everything and light mode for keyboard no matter whether it's dark theme or light theme, or whether the battery saver is on or off).  \n\n Restarted my phone a couple of times but nothing worked",
