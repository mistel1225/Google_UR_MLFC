    "title": "when in a call, dial tone selection not recognised",
    "content": "When in calls (on cellular or wifi calling) SOMETIMES dial tones are not recognised when given a selection to choose (press 1 for, press 2 for etc). Sometimes swapping from cellular to wifi calling or the other way around will make it work. Sometimes i need to reboot my phone. This happens with various call centres (various companies and numbers) including Vmail (Vodafone), which works fine when i call from my Pixel 1. Can anyone help?",
