    "content": "At the startup of my Pixel 5 I connected the cable to my old google nexus 6P and my contacts, calender, and photos all came across but my SMS messages did not. When I perform a backup on my Nexus 6P and I look in google backups online I don't even see an SMS category to go download to my Pixel 5. According to all the Pixel 5 community posts and documentation it suggest SMS should be there. Is that false? Does the Pixel 5 documentation assume even the old phone is also a Pixel and this case since it is a Nexus 6P therefore the posted community and google documentation does not apply?\nThank you.",
