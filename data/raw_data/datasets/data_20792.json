    "content": "I dropped my old phone in a river today and lost it , so I had to go buy a new one. The old and new are both the 4XL.  In the past anytime I have bought a new phone and set it up my SMS messages always transferred over to the new phone. And I am pretty sure I have set up the new phone without always plugging it into the old phone and pulling the information over. But, for some reason, this time when I setup my new phone from the cloud it did not bring over my SMS, only my MMS. Does anyone know why this is happening? Can my SMS be brought over?  I tried to restore twice and both times only my MMS came over. And the second time I paid attention to the boxes I can check when I am restoring and there was only an option for MMS.",
