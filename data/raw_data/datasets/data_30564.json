    "content": "I had a charging issue with my Pixel 3 device, the C type charging port was no more working.  After using my phone with a wireless charger for a while I decided to send the phone back to google to get the replacement device.  I was living in Germany but bought the device from US, so I sent the phone back to US with a friend. Finally, the device was sent to Google back and the problems started. They first sent the refurbished device to the address that I provided. after 3 days of shipment period Fedex somehow did not deliver the phone and just returned it back to google without any notice. Then I asked them to send it again and the same happened. After this last delivery issue, they started to not send the device to me. A month has passed and no actions from google about the refurbished device. Each time it took a week to try to deliver the device and it gets returned to the warehouse once again. The only thing that they can say is to be sorry about the situation that I am faced. I already bought a new device after not having my phone delivered for a month. This is the worst experience that I have ever had with a phone and with customer service. They did not come up with any solution so I can get my device back. I decided to not even get back the device. I would prefer it to be sent to anyone who needs a refurbished google phone. This experience already teaches me to never go with google products to not face with this customer service experience.",
