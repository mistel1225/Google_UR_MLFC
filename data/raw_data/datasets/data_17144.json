    "content": "My Pixel 2 XL just recently started having issues with Wifi connectivity, (i.e. staying connected, internet  access, and new pages take so long that they timeout).\n\nI have started my phone in safe mode and still continue to have connectivity problems. \n\nI have done the Wifi, Bluetooth,  and NSF reset.\n\nI have deleted  all apps that had been acquired since the wifi issue began.\n\nThe only thing not done is the complete factory  reset, which I am hoping to find a solution before having to resort to  extreme measures.",
