    "content": "While recording video my Pixel 3a started to change the speed of the recordings.  I'd start with 1x and after a few seconds I'd see it was 2x.  I don't think I touched any of the settings.  Is there a way to prevent this?  \nAlso some of my videos had no audio, others were fine.  Is there a reason for this?",
