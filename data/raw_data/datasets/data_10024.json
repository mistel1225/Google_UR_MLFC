    "content": "What have you done to my phone. I had issues with Andriod 10 and then you give me even more issues with Andriod 11. I did not instruct the phone to install the new OS. It did it without request. And now the messaging component is stuffed. Hit the back button and all you get is a blank screen. Message in the drop down says messaging is working in the background. Only way to reset is to reboot the phone. Really do you guys do any testing before you roll out this software.",
