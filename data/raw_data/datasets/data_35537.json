    "content": " I shipped my defective Pixel 2 to Google last week.  I have been emailing since I sent it to get the status on my replacement and requesting information about the timeline and process.  I am given vague timelines and no details.  This is frustrating. I wish someone had told me it will take from 2 weeks to a month to have a replacement provided.  I would like my money back and will go to a different company and buy a phone that actually works. \nPlease help.\n\nAfter several emails and an hour on the phone to try to expedite the process, this is the unhelpful response I received from Google today: \nHi, \n\nWe have just receive your defective device today and you will be receiving the replacement device with in 3-5 business days. You will also receive another email with tracking number with in 24-48 hrs. to track your replacement.\nThanks for contacting Google Support!\n\nThanks!\nJeff\nThe Google Support Team",
