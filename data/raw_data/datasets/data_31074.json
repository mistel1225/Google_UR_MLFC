    "content": "I am unable to receive voicemails left by someone legitimate calling with a private number. I'm missing them because my pixel 2 automatically routes the calls to voicemail, and never notifies me of the voicemails. Documentation seems to say this is intentional, to protect me from spam. However, these are legitimate, and extremely important calls that my phone is incorrectly categorizing as spam. Is there some way to allow private numbers to ring like normal and have voicemails displayed to me like normal?",
