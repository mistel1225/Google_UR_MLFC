    "content": "Since updated to A11, problems galore. Battery cannot recharge among other problems. ubreakifix told me to contact Google for a replacement phone. Called the phone number and was told, by robot, that Google could not help me right now. Chat which is open 24/7 is closed. I've gone in circles online. I was going to buy a new Pixel, but this poor support has me questioning that decision. Anyone with an idea of what might work?",
