    "content": "My kid dropped my phone and the screen went bust. It was still on but while trying out different options that I found online I have restarted the phone (I think). I can feel the haptic feedback on the phone. I have some files which are on the phone that I need to access but when I connect through USB to my laptop, I cannot access the files on the phone since I cannot change the setting to allow transfer of files. Please advise how I can access the data on this phone. Don't want to change the screen because I plan on getting the Pixel 4XL when it comes out in October.",
