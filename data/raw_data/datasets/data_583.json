    "content": "In the camera, when I went to click on the circle with the last photo, the last photo disappeared.  When I went to Google photos, I realized that not all the photos that I've taken in the last 24 hours were there.  I made a backup to my desktop, and nine photos show as a \".pending...\" jpg file, which explains why I can't view them on my phone, nor are they backed up on Google drive.  I'm not sure why this is happening. Is anyone else having this issue?",
