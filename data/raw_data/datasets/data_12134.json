    "content": "Upgraded to Android 11 on my Pixel 2XL.  Afterwards, I'm unable to receive text messages.  Sending is fine and the occasional picture message comes in.  I've reset my network options, cleared the Messages cache, restarted the phone.  When I move my SIM card to another phone, send/receive messages works perfect.  Apps are all up to date.  Everything else appears to be working properly. \n\nUnfortunately, this was all working prior to the upgrade.  Anybody experience this?",
