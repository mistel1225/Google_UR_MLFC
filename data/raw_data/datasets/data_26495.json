    "content": "Can anyone tell me what is video on (from Gsam battery app)\nI notice the battery keep draining when this Video On time keep increasing. It never stop. Force close or clear storage doesn't help either. The only way to stop it is to reboot phone.\n\nWhenever any app has video on continuously running, it would top the battery usage list.\n\nIt could run few days nonstop!",
