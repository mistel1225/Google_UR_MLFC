    "content": "After the recent update, my 3a XL is hard to unlock. I don't use a gesture, pattern, fingerprint, or PIN to unlock it; I just swipe. Before the update, I could swipe easily with my thumb to unlock it, now I have to make a deliberate swipe with my index finger after several attempts.",
