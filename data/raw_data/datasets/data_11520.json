    "content": "Just upgraded (i hope) from original Pixel XL to Picel 5. The Pixel 5's screen behaves fine bare handed but i work in lab and have latex gloves all day. Sometimes when i have them on i hardly can get the phone to respond to my swipes and touches. I did not have this issue with the Nexus 6P or Original Pixel XL.",
