    "content": "Since the latest Android update (earlier today) my Pixel 3a has been stuck on the G screen. It's been that way for several hours. I've now tried restarting and the same thing happens. It's permanently stuck on the G screen. I'm wondering if I need to factor reset? If so how do I do this from the G screen?",
