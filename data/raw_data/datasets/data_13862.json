    "content": "tried to be too clever and downloaded an apk that I thought had the Pixel 5 Live Wallpapers in but it seems to have overwritten my existing Live wallpapers and my Themes; have lost the original live wallpaper and Pinball. The Pixel 5 Live Wallpapers are there and work. My themes icon is now a bit odd and leads to a black screen if i click on it. Is there any way to recover the original Live wallpaper and Themes for the 4a please? Ordinary wallpapers appear intact.\nI know I'm an idiot and promise to behave myself in future...  TIA",
