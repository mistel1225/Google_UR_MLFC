    "content": "I've been trying to install Android 10 on my son's Pixel 3a but the install screen keeps flicking quickly between 'Installing' and 'Download Paused'. I can't stop it from doing this. I've tried restarting, shutting down, clearing cache, starting in safe mode but nothing works. I did a screen capture video to explain what it's doing but it doesn't look like I can post it here. Any suggestions would be greatly Appreciated. Thank you.",
