    "content": "Moved all date from Nexus 6P (Android 8.1) to Pixel 3XL with data cable.  Pixel is running the two latest huge updates from Google after starting the phone.\n\nIn the Nexus,  device folders to be automatically backed up were Download, Google Maps, Hangouts, Messages, Textra (sms app), We Chat. WhatsApp Animated Gifs, WhatsApp Images, WhatsApp Video.\n\nThese apps are all on the Pixel 6P.\n\nHowever, the choice on the Pixel is restricted to  Textra, WhatsApp animated Gifs, WhatsApp Images, WhatsApp Video, and I cannot add any of the others listed above.  There is no option at all here on this screen. to make any additions.\n\nFurthermore, It appears that in any case, Textra is not backing up;  haven't tested the others so far, as minimal action in those apps.\n\nScreen shots hopefully can be supplied, if needed.\n\nAny suggestions as to how to overcome these issues?  Is there a setting hidden somewhere in the menus which didn't transfer across properly?\n\nAnd finally, apologies if this should be asked in the Photos forum;  posted here as first port of call.  Please advise accordingly.\n\nThanks in advance for the forthcoming help!",
