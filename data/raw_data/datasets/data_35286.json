    "content": "Last week my Pixel phone started freezing when making and receiving calls.  First of all it would restart and would work for awhile and then freeze again.  More recently it has been happening with every call.  I've tried a few of the suggested fixes such as uninstalling and updating the phone app, uninstalling the Digital Wellbeing app, running the phone in safe mode, and a full factory reset.  After trying these suggested fixes the phone was able to make a couple of calls and then the problem would return.",
