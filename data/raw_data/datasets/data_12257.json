    "content": "My pixel 3 is in a reboot loop since yesterday afternoon. \nI was using the camera and then it restarted, and since then it's stuck. Sometimes it gets into the homescreen, but usually not, and it reboots before I can do anything.\nI have tried using power & volume buttons to try to restart into a different mode, but when the menu comes up, if I press the volume button to cycle through options, it just restarts again. It's always on fastboot mode when I get into the menu, and I can't switch to anything else.\nI have had the phone since August 2019, so I don't think it's under warranty. \nI didn't download any new apps recently. There's no water damage AFAIK. In the past few weeks I was getting prompted to delete files to free up storage space (I think I had ~2GB left).\nAny suggestions on how to get my phone working again? \nTIA",
