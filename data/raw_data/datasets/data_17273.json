    "content": "I have issues with my Pixel 3a. \nOften my screen flips/turns as if I held my phone under a certain angle, though phone is still portrait mode, maybe just sligtly tilted one way. Same for when I use my phone in portrait mode, then put it on a flat surface and often it flips to landscape mode.",
