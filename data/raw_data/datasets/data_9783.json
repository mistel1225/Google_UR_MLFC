    "content": "Starting from yesterday, my Pixel 3a suddenly stopped being able to make or receive calls. \nWhen I try to ring out the phone says \"calling...\" (full mobile reception bars) but then it hangs like that for a while and then it disconnects. I haven't been able to receive calls either. \n\nI had no issues with the phone prior and I have tried taking out the sim card, checking to see if the sim was the issue(called phone carrier and tried the sim in another device- no issues there), rebooting into safe mode, and resetting Wi-Fi, Mobile & Bluetooth settings. I've tried these steps multiple times but I haven't had any success in fixing the issue. \n\nHowever LTE data and SMS texting work just fine which baffles me even more. \n\nDoes anyone have similar issues and any solutions? \n\nHelp is much appreciated.",
