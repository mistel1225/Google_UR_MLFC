    "content": "My pixel 3a won't connect to my hisense smart tv.\n\nI've read other forums and it's because google is blocking non-google connectors. So no chrome cast no connection.\n\nBut it works if the smart tv and my phone have the same app (re: Netflix)\n\nGoogle - don't be a bag of d*?ks, the whole point of android is to cross barriers that Apple uses.",
