    "content": "Sometimes I lose internet access over home wifi network.  I will get the message that wifi had no internet access.  Other devices are still connected and the internet works fine.  I have tried safe mode but still no internet.  After a few minutes or hours the internet returns and everything is fine.  Other times the speed degrades to nothing while on other devices will be 200Mbps.  Any ideas of the problem.  I only connect to WiFi at home so I don't know if it occurs anywhere else.",
