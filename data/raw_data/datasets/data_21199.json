    "content": "I have done a factory reset, among other things, per Google's instruction.  Long story short, I still have no camera, flashlight, and as of this morning, no QR Scanner in the phone's Messages app.  Therefore, I cannot get my Messages for the Web today or until the new motherboard can be installed a week from today. This is awful!\nThere needs to be an alternative way to get Messages for the Web.",
