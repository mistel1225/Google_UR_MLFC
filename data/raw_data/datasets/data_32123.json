    "content": "Around 5 days ago, my camera stopped working. It keeps crashing, along with all the other apps connected to it.\n\nI followed all the instructions - tried safe mode and it's definitely a camera issue not an app issue.\n\nTried clearing all caches and data, still nothing. \nEven did a back up and reboot.\n\nSomeone please help asap.",
