    "content": "How can I turn off the default microphone when I have a bluetooth microphone connected? The default, internal microphone picks up noise and I'd like to use only a bluetooth microphone. I have seen posts about giving permissions to external microphones but not about using only the external microphone. There are no relevant settings either. Please help.",
