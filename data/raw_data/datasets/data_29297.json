    "title": "Why does my pixel 3XL have terrible reception on Bell network in Canada?",
    "content": "Call quality and reception for me is ok but people I am talking to constantly can't hear me, I cut out on a regular basis and often sound like a robot. This is not improved by engaging wifi calling. When I called bell and complained, they are aware of the issue and attribute it to a Google issue and will only be fixed once Google fixes via update. Bells advice was that I buy a different phone, any handset except a pixel 3xl. This is incredibly frustrating as I use my phone for work and my clients can't hear me. I want to believe that I didn't spend $1000 on a phone that doesn't work as a phone! Help please",
