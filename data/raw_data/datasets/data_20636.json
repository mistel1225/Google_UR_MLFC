    "content": "While trying to watch IGTV on Instagram, or while playing some games and using some apps, it seems that I'm loosing a part of picture. Sometimes like in IGTV, a part of video (picture) is just out of phone's display area and I can not see like 10% of that all around the edges.\nIn some other apps like in \"Simply piano\" picture is completely in the borders, but the content of the page is mixed up or a part of it is omitted. It seems to be a problem with the pixel 4 xl's display size or aspect ratio since the apps are working perfectly on other devices. That Brid in the picture is supposed to be Bridge and the Chor in the picture is Chorus.\nAnd you can clearly see the omitted B of BBC in the other picture\nWhat is the fix ?!",
