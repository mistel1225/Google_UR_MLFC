    "content": "This issue is 100% repeatable on my Pixel 3XL, as follows:\n\nOpen the default \"Files\" app (Files by Google 1.0.297653579)\nGo to the downloads folder.\nTap on a PDF file.\n\"Open with\" panel slides up with only two options: Drive PDF viewer and Adobe Digital Editions. \n\nI want Adobe Acrobat Reader to also show up as an option, but it does not. How do I fix this? \n\nObservations: \nI've cleared all defaults in all three apps (Adobe Reader, Digital Editions, and Files). \nI can open the same file with Adobe Acrobat Reader if I first open that app, navigate to the file, and open it. \nA third-party app called \"Solid Explorer\" provides a more complete list of \"Open with\" options, including Adobe Acrobat Reader. Therefore, this may be a bug with the \"Files by Google\" app.",
