    "title": "Chrome issue on android 11 pixel 3a update.",
    "content": "Recent pixel 3a Android 11 update messed up Chrome.  When on Twitters webpage specifically.  When going back to edit a typed entry you move the cursor to a spot in the paragraph.  As soon as you let go an image of another tab pops up instead of Twitter.  Chrome still knows it's on the Twitter page but all you see is the other page. You can start typing or hold down to select where you think a word is and it comes back.\n\nVery odd and distracting.  Please fix it.",
