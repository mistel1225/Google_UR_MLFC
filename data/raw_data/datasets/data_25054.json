    "content": "My iPhone has officially reached the end of its life. It turns on, but the screen no longer shows anything except for a few colored lines, so I am unable to interact with it. I am considering making the jump and getting the Pixel 3. Is there a way for me to transfer my iPhone data and info to the new Pixel even though I can't see or interact with the iPhone screen?",
