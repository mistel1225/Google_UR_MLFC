    "content": "I am attempting to update Pixel 4 XL to Android 11. I have not received the OTA update and have no results when attempting to check System Update in settings. I don't want to attempt a manual upgrade nor to reset the phone. Does anyone else have this problem or know a solution? I have found no relevant information online, except articles about India's OTA updates being delayed, which seem irrelevant as I am in USA where there is none.",
