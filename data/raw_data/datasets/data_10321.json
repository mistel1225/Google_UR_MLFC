    "content": "I have nothing but problem starting from November with this app , messages app, and now it's crashing a lot sometimes 10 to 12 times a day and I try everything from reboot and then clear data and clear cache and carrier service same thing clear data and cache and then try to remove the update and reinstall the update still with no success. I end up doing a factory reset hoping that this will fix it and the phone was okay for a few days and now is back having this app crashing all the time. \nWhen you get this notification \"\"messages working in the background\"\" then you know up crashed again and then I have to restart the phone or force stop and it works for a while and then it's doing the same thing .",
