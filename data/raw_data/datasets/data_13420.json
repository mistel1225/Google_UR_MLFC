    "title": "Previously connected devices not connecting automatically via Bluetooth - Google Pixel 3XL.",
    "content": "I have a Google Pixel 3 XL and I am having trouble with this phone automatically connecting to previously connected and remembered devices. I have rebooted the phone and devices. I have deleted the paired devices from my phone and paired again. This is happening with both my Bluetooth headset and car forcing me to connect manually each time or turning Bluetooth off and on again. My previous Samsung phone always connected to saved Bluetooth devices seamlessly. Since I use this phone as my work phone as well, I use my wireless headset constantly and dread the \"headset not connected\" message that I get multiple times a day. This seems to be a known problem but I don't see any definitive corrective actions that have been posted as of yet.",
