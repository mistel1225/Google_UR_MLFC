Just a standard template response after 3-4 days that they dont have the spare available. My phone is in warranty but they are treating it as some kind of favour on customer. I have bern chsing them from 7 months to get the phone repaired but they were delaying it and now when they have picked the phone they are not returning it back. Can anyone help me with the escalation matrix.",
