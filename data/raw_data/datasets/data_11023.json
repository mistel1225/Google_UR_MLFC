    "content": "I'm experiencing issues with automatic reconnect for bluetooth devices.\nSometimes it reconnects as soon as i'm in range, sometimes nothing happends for 5 minutes.\nAny ideas?\n\nAlso, I'm having trouble disabling bluetooth. When pulling down the quick access menu, I can press the bluetooth icon, and turn of bluetooth, but it keeps reenabling itself after 2 seconds.\n\nI've got 4 devices paired to my phone.\nBMW X5 headunit (For handsfree)\nMMI Prime unit for BMW X5 (Android Auto)\nSaphe Link (For speedcams)\nJabra Headset (For office use)\n\nThis is my first android device since coming from Iphone for the last decade or so :(",
