    "title": "Why is my Pixel Stand inconsistent as a charger?",
    "content": "I have a Pixel 3XL and I have a Pixel Stand. Even when I take the case off of my phone, there is a great deal of difficulty getting my phone to connect and charge. As my USB-C port has stopped working, I purchased a Pixel stand hoping to at least be able to charge my phone quickly and wirelessly but I have to maneuver the phone and the stand that was built for the stand in order to get it to connect and charge. This is immensely unacceptable. I would say that at $79, this stand should at least work as well as a cheap stand from Amazon but it basically fails in all regards. What a POS.",
