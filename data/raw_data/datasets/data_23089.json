    "content": "I bought a pixel 3a in June and have had a great experience moving from IOS. However, since first setting up the phone I've had issues with it randomly crashing. I've checked each and every app installed and have gone through a couple of factory resets but the problem persists. In fact, recently the phone has shut down more regularly. Often when it's in my pocket when I'm away from home. I'm not sure what else to try to fix the issue? Anyone else with similar problems?",
