    "content": "Pixel 2 XL was briefly in water - for less than 10 seconds and was was not fully submerged. The screen had turned off and is now unable to turn on. Even after drying and placing it in a bag of rice.\nI thought the Pixel 2's were supposed to be water resistant up to a certain depth? My phone was not even fully submerged!\nPlease note that the screen had also been replaced by an authorised repairer (CDTI Australia) - I am not sure if they repaired the screen properly making it IP67 as I had to go back and forth with them as there was a chip in the glass.\nIs there anything that I can do now? As I would really like to get my device working again.",
