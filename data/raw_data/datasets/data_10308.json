    "content": "Been having issues syncing my fitbit with my phone for over a month now. I have lost over 2 weeks of data. Managed to get it working for just over a week and it's stopped again. I have tried everything fitbit has told me to do and nothing works. I am starting to wonder whether this is a Google Pixel phone issue rather than a fitbit issue? Useful to know as my phone is still in warranty for the next month.",
