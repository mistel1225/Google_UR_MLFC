    "content": "I'm having trouble simply making phone calls. With a signal, dialing over and over with no ringing and dead silence all around. Shutdown won't fix it, restart doesn't, cleared Phone app cache. What kinda crap product is this? Only had it a couple of months and treat it with care. Is there any solution to this or do I need to reach out to Google for a refund or replacement?",
