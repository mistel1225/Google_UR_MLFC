    "title": "Pixel 3 XL Extreme battery drain straight after July 2020 + Play Update",
    "content": "I've always had a Pixel and never experienced any issues after an update quite as bad as this (and no the good old fashioned \"Factory Reset\" doesn't fix it). There's an obvious issue with this latest update. As soon as I installed it my battery drained twice as quickly. Then it was stuck on 15% (I've noticed others mention this magic 15% figure after this recent update too). I tried charging it and it didn't move from 15%. I restarted again and now its very slowly charging by maybe 1% every 4 minutes & battery continues to drain twice as quickly. Something is seriously wrong here. It's not an app, it's not the charger, it's the update. Please look into it.",
