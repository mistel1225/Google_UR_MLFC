    "title": "Release the pixel 5 for use on ALL European 5g networks.",
    "content": "The pixel 5 is supported by virtually all European networks. Yet Google has CHOSEN to lock it artificially to certain networks. This is shameful. It has very very very little to do with quality testing. You can hack the phone, edit a file, and tadaaaaa it works on any 5g network. \n\nYou shouldn't have to hack your phone to make it do what it is advertised to do and what it is technically capable of doing.\n\nAnd no, this is not a case of buyer beware. Their disclaimer is hidden on their website. As a regular consumer you should be able to rely on what's on the box and in the ads. I checked frequencies, I checked my network. Heck, even the professional seller thought the phone should work and swore it was compatible. It is. Google just hasn't released it.\n\nLiberate my phone, Google. Stop being nasty. Or should I say stop being evil.",
