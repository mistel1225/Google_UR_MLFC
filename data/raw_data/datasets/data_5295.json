    "title": "Pixel 4 camera will not zoom",
    "content": "The camera will not zoom, either using two finger gesture or pressing the 2x screen button.  There is no zoom slide displayed.  I'm using the \"camera\" setting, not portrait or video.  It has worked fine in the past.  I haven't used it in a while so can't say when it stopped working.  I haven't added any apps since the camera was last working.  The phone was just updated yesterday.",
