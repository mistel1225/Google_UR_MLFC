    "content": "Every time I Google something, my phone sets my location to some county in New Mexico. When I turn my location on, it obviously fixes the problem, but I'd prefer to not have to keep my location on all the time because it uses data and the battery. \n\nThe other day I had my location on and I tried to get on the eBay app, but it locked me out because apparently it logged my primary location as New Mexico... But I live in Las Vegas.\n\nWhen I Google a store or restaurant, it gives me results from Albuquerque, NM. I'd like it to just default to Las Vegas.",
