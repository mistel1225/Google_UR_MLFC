    "content": "Since i've updated to the new android 10 OS, every time battery saver goes on it switches my phone automatically to dark mode.  This is very annoying as this switch will refresh any page i'm viewing while in chrome.   I was in the middle of typing something out on a web page and battery saver kicked on and it refreshed my page, completely erasing everything i typed.   I don't know how it effects other apps, but i don't want it to decide to turn on dark mode without my approval.  I have found nothing in the battery saver settings about disabling this.   Is it possible?",
