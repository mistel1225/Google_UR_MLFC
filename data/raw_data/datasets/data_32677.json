    "title": "When on Pixel Stand, Google Assistant on Pixel 3 is unresponsive while alarm is sounding",
    "content": "When the alarm goes off on my phone (Pixel 3) while on the Pixel Stand, Google Assistant cannot hear me over the alarm (it does not recognize me saying \"Ok Google\" nor \"Hey Google\"), despite being at most 1.5 feet away and YELLING. I have to physically reach the phone and swipe the alarm off just about every time. This defeats the purpose of me having a Pixel Stand to begin with, as I bought it so that I wouldn't have to put on my glasses to turn the alarm off in the early mornings.",
