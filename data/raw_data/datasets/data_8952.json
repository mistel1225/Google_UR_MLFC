    "title": "Pixel3XL won't charge unless I turn it off - or fiddle with USB settings... HELP PLEASE!!",
    "content": "I have been using Pixel 3XL for about a year and half. \n\nI cannot get it to consistently charge unless I turn the device off. \n\nWhen it is on, the phone will continue to charge if it was plugged in while the phone was off. \n\nIf the phone was NOT plugged in when it was originally off, then whether or not it takes a charge requires me to fiddle with the USB Preference Settings. \n\nIn this case, when I change \"USB Controlled by\" option from \"Connected Device\" to \"This Device\" it will sometimes start charging. \n\nHowever, recently, very often I get a message that says \"Cannot Switch Device\" and then the phone refuses to charge unless I turn it off.\n\nHow do I get help with this issue? The answers in the Help Section and the forums are unclear and I do not know how to request a call-back to help fix my problem. \n\nThank you!",
