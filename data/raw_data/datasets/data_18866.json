    "title": "My Pixel 4 XL is 6 months old and the back glass plate is coming unglued.",
    "content": "The black plate is coming unglued. It's never been in water and I haven't dropped it. When I contacted Google support they said it wouldn't be covered because it's considered physically damaged (even though there's no damage to the phone and they have no evidence that I've damaged it). And now they're saying it's not covered under warranty even though it's only been 6 months. I had a Pixel 1 and didn't have these problems Does anyone else have a problem with their glass backing on their Pixel 4? And if so, has Google addressed it properly?",
