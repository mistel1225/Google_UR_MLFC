    "content": "Successfully updated to Android 10 via OTA. However the update messed up the Always on Display. The screen just goes black after locking the screen.  Need to press the  power button again to turn the screen on. This happen most of the time after the update. Already did a factory reset once. Did not experience this while on Android pie. Any suggestions would be very helpful. Thanks.",
