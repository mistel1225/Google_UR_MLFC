    "content": "When I try to see the photos on my Pixel 3 from my PC, all I see are jpg icons (teal blue mtn with sun in the background) or mp4 icons.  On my old phone I could get the photos to display as thumbnails.  I think I have narrowed this down to a setting on the phone, not a windows thing.",
