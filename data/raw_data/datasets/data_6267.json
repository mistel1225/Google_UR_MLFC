    "content": "I've had this phone just over a month now, and this is the second time the battery indicator has got stuck at 100%. First time it happened, a restart resolved it. That didn't work this time, until I restarted it several times. I'm ready to send it back. I also heard Google is working on a fix for this. Who else is experiencing this on this same phone? And have you heard Google is working on it?\n\nWife and I got the same phone, she doesn't have this issue. It's my second phone, first one had a white line through the screen, right out of the box, so had to go back for an exchange. So far, not super impressed.",
