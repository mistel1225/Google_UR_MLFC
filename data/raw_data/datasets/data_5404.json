    "content": "Google Fi sent my a refurbished phone under device protection about 1 week ago.  Everything transfered over and was working perfect.  Then 2 days ago text notifications stoped making an alert sound, and they don't show up in the notifications bar.  I do receive text but I only know that when I launch the app.  Android 11 and all apps are updated. Emptied messages cache.  All notifications are active in the stock messages app.  Fi tech support said best bet was factory reset, but I would rather find the problem.  I can use web message to send text to myself, and when I do this I noticed that the notification appears for a split second in the upper task bar then disappears.  So the information is there.  Anyone want to take a stab at this for me?",
