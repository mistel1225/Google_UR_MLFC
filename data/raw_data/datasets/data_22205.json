    "content": "Since yesterday my phone has the same problem as multiple people with this device: my camera was first out of focus but now doesn't work at all, i.e. gives 'fatal error' and closes the app. \n\nI think something globally happened as I can see in this topic since multiple people are having the same problem since yesterday. \n\nI have done extensive research and tried every advice regarding this issue:\n\nforce close app\nclear cache\nrestart in safe mode \ncheck for updates in the app store\ndisable the app and re-enable it so that it resets to standard settings\nAnd finally, the ultimate one: factory reset. \n\nHowever, nothing helped. \n\nTo the experts/google staff:\n\nWhat can/do I do now? \n\nPlease help! \n\nP.s. I live in the Netherlands and I reaaaaally hope this issue can be fixed without sending it to repair..",
