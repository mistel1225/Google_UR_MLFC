    "content": "Hello, \n\nThis problem started after I updated to android 11 about earlier this week a specific part of my screen does seem to register press. Specifically around the w and 2 keys is where the area is affected. When I try to press either key it just presses q or e and 1 and 3 respectively. I have tried to boot into safe mode but didn't seem to work but I have not tried to hard reset the phone either. I am currently trying to charge the phone via computer but I doubt it will do anything. \n\nIf anyone else has encountered this issue please lmk.\n\nThanks,\nRon",
