    "content": "Couple of days ago I bought the brand new pixel 4a. From the Initial boot the display is kind of yellowish colour and looks little dull. Is it the display of the device calibrated to be warm or else a manufacturing defect? \n\nP.S:- Night light is turned off (even the schedule option in night light is set to \"none\").",
