    "content": "I dropped my phone underwater and after that, the screen turned off. I tried to turn it on, however, there were grids of yellow, red, gray, black, and blue on the screen. Now after turning on and off many times, the screen starts normally but then after 3s it turns reddish or greenish and the touchscreen doesn't respond. Is there anything I can do? Because I am currently in another country and won't be back to the US until January.",
