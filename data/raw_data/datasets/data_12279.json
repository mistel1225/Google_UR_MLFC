    "content": "Hello! So I have my pixel 1 xl on Android 8.1.\nI don’t really want to upgrade to android 10 because I’ve read about a lot of battery drain issues that come with it. Is that true?\n\nI would like to use portrait light and I’ve heard this requires android 11?\n\nWhat do you think I should do?\n\nThank you very much!",
