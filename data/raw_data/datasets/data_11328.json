    "title": "Bluetooth issues when connected to car and receive a group message - 4XL",
    "content": "Anytime my phone is connected to my Nissan Maxima SR via Bluetooth and I receive an MMS message, my phone disconnects from the car. This problem doesn't occur when I'm in my driveway and still connected to my wifi, but when I'm out driving and only connected to cell service, it happens every time. This is a fairly new development, only having started ~1 month ago. Never had any issues with connecting and staying connected to my car before that.",
