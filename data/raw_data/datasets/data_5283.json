    "title": "How do a set my Pixel phone's cast to disconnect from my Google home after 30 minutes of inactivity?",
    "content": "I cast 1 hour of sleep music at night but the device stays in cast mode all night and drains the battery by morning.\n\nI would like cast to automatically disconnect if there is no activity. Or, have the ability to set a timer to disconnect say 2 hours from now.\n\nThis gives me more control over my device and also does not unnecessarily drain my battery. I have missed my alarms because my phone died during the night.",
