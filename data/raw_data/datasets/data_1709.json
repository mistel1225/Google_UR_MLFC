    "title": "Why does my SIM only get recognised in safe mode?",
    "content": "My phone's SIM only gets recognised in safe mode with a few exceptions.\nOn startup it gets recognised, (not safe mode) and then after about 30-60mins my phone says: No SIM Card on the quick settings tile and all calling options are gone.\n\nIn safe mode the SIM has never disappeared or become unrecognised and I left the phone in safe mode for multiple 12hr+ stints with no issues.\n\nThis lead me to remove the \"phone\" permission from 3rd party apps (no difference).\nI also changed to two of my other SIMs (same problem again). \nInterestingly, if I take the SIM out while the phone is still on, I can make it appear again if I insert it very slowly but this only lasts as long as 30-60mins as stated before.\n\nIf anyone has any idea what is causing this, any info would be much appreciated, thanks. :)",
