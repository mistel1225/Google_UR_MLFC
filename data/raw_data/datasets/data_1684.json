    "content": "I have been facing this issue after May 2021 update. This issues usually comes suddenly and goes only after restart but comes again after 1-2 hr. I have restarted it several times a day. I have tried booting into safe mode to check whether any app is making this issue. Also i have removed some unused apps. My storage waa full upto 80% so i reduced it to 70%. My ram consumption is 3.6 GB out of 5.9 still facing this issue. No apps are running in the background. Please google help me. I am so irritated with this issue. Does anyone else facing this issue in Google Pixel 4a.",
