    "content": "I purchased my Pixel 2 in December of 2017. AT&T wireless for service. Recently, I have started having service connection issues.  Sometimes it will randomly drop calls.  Othertimes, it is the data connection.  In some locations I can go from full LTE to half bar H+ to none at all.  My phone can be on half bar H+ while my wife's Iphone 6S is on full bar LTE.  I cannot figure out if this is a hardware failure or a network failure.  I have not done a factory reset on my phone yet.",
