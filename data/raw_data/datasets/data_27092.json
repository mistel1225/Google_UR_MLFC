    "content": "I can be sitting in my car with my uconnect on and try to make a phone call and it's all scratchy and broke up. I can be sitting at home listening to my Google home with my Pixel 3 right beside it and as soon as I get up and walk in between it it starts cracking and popping and skipping. I've tried restarting my phone check for updates for both my Google you connect and nothing has worked.",
