    "content": "I just got a Pixel 4XL and it is missing the feature of a notification volume slider.  I want to be able to set my ring volume separate from my notification volume like I used to.  \nIn fact, if I silence the volume for ringer, and I go into settings to change notification sound I can still hear them, but if I go to change ringtone I can't hear them which suggests they are still being managed separately under the hood, but the controls are hidden.\n\nUltimately I want to be able to hear my ringtone for a phone call, but I want notifications to be visual only without sound or vibration.\nI sometimes turn notification volume up for brief periods and sometimes turn ringtone down and sometimes silent everything so suggestions I've seen in forums to use Do Not Disturb customization won't work or be convenient.\nPlease restore the functionality to modify notification volume separately and allow vibration to be toggled on and off in silent mode for notifications and ringer separately too.",
