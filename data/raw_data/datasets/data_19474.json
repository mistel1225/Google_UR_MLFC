    "content": "Phone worked great for several months, then the ringer speaker went out. Google troubleshooting had me factory reset it. When it started back up, there was no option to restore (or I overlooked it). So for a month a 2nd backup was created.\nI would like to restore/merge both backups but Android will only permit one to be restored at a time.\nIs there a way to get the SMS message data combined from the 2 backups so that my entire SMS history is available on my phone?",
