    "title": "Pixel 3XL poor call performance",
    "content": "I've been having repeated issues with my 3XL call quality.  The people I am talking to will either say that I sound robotic, catch every word, or lose me altogether for seconds at a time.  \n\nThis is something I've seen other reports of out there and seems to be a larger issue.  When I called Fi support, I was told it is not a known issue and was run through the hoops to reboot the phone, etc.  None of that worked and I am left paying for a sub-performing phone.  \n\nThey did offer to replace it under warranty, only they wanted me to send my phone back and be without until they sent me a new one, or wanted me to put down a massive deposit until I received the new one and they received the old one back.  I find both scenarios completely unacceptable.  I asked to be contacted by a supervisor and was promised contact but never received it. \n\nThis whole experience has soured me on the Pixel brand.  While it may be a great, camera, pocket computer, or whatever else, it is a lousy phone. \n\nHas anyone else had similar issues?",
