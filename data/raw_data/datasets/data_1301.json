    "content": "Woke up this morning and can't open Google Podcasts. I tap the icon, the background zooms in briefly, then nothing happens. I tried rebooting and force stopping the app several times, no luck. I'm also getting a message box of some sort that randomly flashes across the screen so quickly that I can't read it. Anyone else having this issue or know how to fix it?",
