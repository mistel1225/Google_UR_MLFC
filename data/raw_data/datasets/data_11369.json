    "content": "I spent well over an hour with no less than 4 Google chat agents about weird chimes after songs begin to play via Bluetooth. Each time I detailed problem and then after 15-20 minutes they passed me to a new tech who was \"dedicated' to these issues. Each time without warning. \n\nEach time the techs made me describe in detail what was happening. They would have me fiddle with the same settings then pass me off without warning to a new tech. \n\nThis sort of B.S. \"support\" is typical of Google for free apps and services but I bought this phone from Google.",
