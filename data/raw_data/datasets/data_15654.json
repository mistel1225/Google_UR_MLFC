    "content": "I've been having trouble with android 10 and 11. After screen recording, the screen because extremely sensitive, not allowing swipes. The issue goes away when I turn it off. The notification shade is now permanent, even in fullscreen apps and games. It never receeds and often is in the way. I'll continue seeing what options could eleviate the issue. The volume control widget does not allow for screen touches when it's overlay is active sometimes. It will not allow contact with any thing behind the volume control overlay when this issue appears. Happens most commonly on YouTube.",
