    "title": "Does the Fit app \"learn\" over time?",
    "content": "For the Fit app, I found that the step count is pretty accurate (compared to my Fitbit), but it doesn't understand that I have a long stride. So by the end of the walk, distance is off by a mile or more.  With Fitbit, you could tell it your stride length and that made it really accurate. I really wish you could do this for Google Fit. \nMy question: I did notice that if you \"track\" a workout, the mileage becomes extremely accurate.  I'm wondering if I did this on enough occasions, that google would eventually learn my average stride length and remember? once it's accurate enough, then it could just use the accelerometer and not GPS for mileage -- like a Fitbit.\nnote: I'm not trying to keep track of accurate steps / mileage all day long. I don't even wear my Fitbit all day. I just bring it on walks to see how far I went. but it's getting old and I'd like the phone to be a good replacement.",
