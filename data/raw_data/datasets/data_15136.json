    "content": "My pixel is under 1 year manufacturer warranty period. So, I have two issues with this phone, there is a damaged line of pixels on the screen; also, the glass back of the phone is peeling off. I was wondering as these issues seem to be common for most pixel 4s, can I replace this device for a new one using the warranty?",
