    "content": "Whenever I take the phone out from the original charger, it crushes/shuts down and I have to press a long time on the power button for it to turn on again. \nThe original plugged earphones as well as any other earphones plugged with the adaptor, do not work. I can only use Bluetooth earphones.",
