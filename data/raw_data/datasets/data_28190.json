    "content": "I have a Google Pixel 3a. Since the end of August, my Facebook account has been restricted (on and off, but mostly on). I've checked all my settings, made sure all follows \"community standards\", even scanned my Pixel 3a and macbook for viruses. No luck. Same problem. The one thing I noticed was this started about the time I had access to both my new Pixel and macbook together. I've made sure not to use Facebook from both at the same time, but obviously certain apps etc. stay logged into facebook from the phone. I am wondering if anyone else is having this issue and if by chance it could be a glitch with the Pixel 3a. Perhaps if you use Facebook on the Pixel and then from any other device in the same day you get blocked? Facebook also keeps saying they don't recognize the device and making me change my password as well. Anyone struggling with this shortly after getting a Pixel?",
