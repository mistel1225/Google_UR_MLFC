    "content": "I'm trying to see if this is normal or if any others have this problem. I may have had my battery replaced with another battery with a different mah count than the OEM 2770 mah battery which may explain the rapid drain from 100% to 90%. I'm running Pie with the security patch from March 5, 2019.",
