    "content": "It appears that the display gets every so slightly brighter when in 90hz mode as opposed to 60hz, and as the display frequently switches between those two modes, the screen noticeably flickers between these different brightness values. (More so on low brightness conditions) \nHad anyone come across this issue and knows of a way to fix it, maybe?\n\nIt's barely noticeable, but definitely bothersome.",
