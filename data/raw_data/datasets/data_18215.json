    "content": "New Pixel 4XL persistent voicemail notifications even though no voicemails exist. Have run through all trouble shooting steps including multiple factory resets, replaced sim card, had carrier disable voicemail as a feature, new Google account, and finally a replaced Pixel device. Going to the phone app and clearing data and cache temporarily clears the notification, only to return after a few hours or after phone reset. The notification even occurred with no sim card in the phone so seems to be android related. \n\nAlso am unable to deselect the show notifications for voicemail. Someone please help!",
