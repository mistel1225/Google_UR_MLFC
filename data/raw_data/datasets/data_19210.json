    "content": "Using phone normally, take my phone from my pocket and suddenly the screen is dead. The phone is working normally since I’m using it through the talkback function. It didn’t fall or bang. The screen has no cracks. Already removed case and protective glass and restarted it several times. Also force restarted it. Resuming I was using phone normally, check messages, locked it and putted  it on my jeans front pocket, ten minutes later screen dead. Always using a good case and a protective glass.",
