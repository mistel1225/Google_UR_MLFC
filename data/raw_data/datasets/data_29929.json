    "content": "My Pixel XL which has worked wonderfully for almost 23 months has stopped working. It seems to be stuck in the \"bootloop\" that I have read about. I tried a factory reset through recovery mode which didn't work. I can sometimes get to the set up part of the starting process where it asks for the wifi information and asks to put a SIM card in. I have tried getting into safe mode too but can't get that to work. Help me please!",
