    "content": "Warranty UPGRADE option:\n so (like so MANY people) my 4a has been reduced to junk status by its APPALLING WiFi performance.\nI'm sending back under a WARRANTY claim;\n given that;\na) SO many people are having this problem\nb) i bought this as first release direct from the Google Store\nc) am a loyal Google customer\n> WHY does Google not offer a warranty UPGRADE option to a new handset ?\nthis would go somewhere as an apology for what clearly is a very poor technically performance handset;\nthe offer of a warranty 'replacement' (ie by a 'refurbished handset') of the SAME known fault model is not acceptable.\nNB i would not object to paying a little extra for a new replacement model.",
