    "content": "I bought this Pixel 3 in Nov 2018. The device is out warranty but under the device protection plan. The back of the phone is popping off because the battery is swelling. I am not sure when it started to swell because I am using a phone case. I accidentally took the case off today and noticed the swollen battery. Glad it didn't explode or caught on fire while I was sleeping. Google should do something to solve this ASAP. I am seriously considering switching to an iPhone.",
