    "content": "Every time I call out, or receive a call, my notification sound will go off through the earpiece just as the call connects. There is never a new notification at the time this happens. Additionally, when I receive a text message, my notification sound will go off twice, simultaneously.\n\nI have tried restarting my phone several times over the past few days, to no avail.",
