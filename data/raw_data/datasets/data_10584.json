    "content": "Hi\n\nHad a pop up on my phone telling me that it's system is two days out of date. Click on the button to update system only for it to tell me that the phone is up to date with Android 10 and then does nothing. \n\nNot sure how I force an update if the phone won't do it's thing? Any suggestions? Happy to ignore the update for a while if there's issues with it but the pop up could get annoying if it appears regularly.\n\nCheers",
