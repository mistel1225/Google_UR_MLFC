    "content": "Pixel 2 128GB, latest system update (Dec 5, 2019), bluetooth won't connect to anything. Phone was wiped prior to problems occurred (before passing on to the kid). There also is no bluetooth icon on top taskbar, next to the wi-fi icon, after it's turned on. Tried everything except reinstalling the OS. Any suggestions before I send the phone back to Google for repairs? Thanks.",
