    "content": "I have been using Nova launcher since getting my phone 2 years ago. However, this morning whenever I press the home button it will pop up and request \"Use Nova launcher as home\" with the options of just once or always. I select always but immediately if I press it again I get the same pop-up.\n\nI have changed this directly in the app settings under default apps. It does actually appear to have Nova selected there. I have also changed it within the Nova app as well and anywhere else I could think of. \n\nAdditionally, even if I select the pixel launcher as my default I still get the pop-up. The only workaround  I have currently is to remove all other launchers and therefore it will default to the pixel one. \n\nI've tried factory resetting my phone as well. Not sure what else I can do?",
