    "content": "Entering my Google password does not work. Entering my PIN set for my phone does not work. I have no other password/PIN allocated for my phone.\nI have always used the fingerprint recognition or entered my PIN, so why is the phone now requesting for a password.\nMy phone had not restarted, I was just away from it for an hour or so and when I tried to unlock it I received the \"Password required after device restarts\"\nWhat is the password that it is after, really frustrating. :(\nAny solutions on how to resolve without a factory reset?",
