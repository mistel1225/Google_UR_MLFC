    "content": "I really like my Pixel 3aXL but this may be my last.  No SD card.  Very tedious and frustrating to download my photos from Google Photos.  It was so easy to just slip out the SD and put the photos on my PC and then to an exterior drive with previous phones.  I'm trying one more thing, ordering a USB-C thumb drive and see if I can download them that way.  Otherwise I risk having reached my memory limit and a rush horrific time downloading only 500 photos at a time from Google Photos.  Is there an easier less time-consuming way?",
