    "content": "Bought Pixel 3 XL earlier this year. No problem connecting via Bluetooth to Pixel stand, Car Bluetooth and Bose Sound Link. Unable to connect to my stereo receiver at home. While the device is paired, won't connect. I used to have a Pixel XL and never had this issue. I have followed all online troubleshooting and nothing seems to work.",
