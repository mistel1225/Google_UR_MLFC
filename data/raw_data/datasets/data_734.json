    "content": "After updating to the June 2021 patch on my Pixel 5 the battery is draining noticably faster. As I type this it has gone down 2% just putting in this question. I have rebooted the phone several times, adaptive battery is on too. I have read a few posts about this issue that others are having. I already had to factory reset this thing once because the battery was overheating from using the camera for recording short videos. I've only had it for maybe 2 months. The battery life was great until this last update (as described by others with this same issue).",
