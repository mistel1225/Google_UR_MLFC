    "content": "My Pixel 3 camera is jittering and moving from focussed to unfocussed and back rapidly whenever I open the camera app.\nI have followed the steps on support.google.com/googlecamera/answer/6306624?HL=en and cleaned the lens, restarted the phone, cleared the camera apps cache, checked for updates and gone into Safe Mode. The problem still persists. The autofocus goes nuts if I try to focus elsewhere, and blurs everything else bar the focussed zone.\nPlease can you advise? Is there a solution?\nI bought a Pixel 3 due to hearing about the exceptional camera quality. It is my primary camera solution and I would love this resolved as soon as possible so I can shoot pictures in focus again. \nI have performed a Factory Reset and Data Reset and this did not fix the issue.",
