    "content": "I'm on Android 11 and random apps crash immediately after opening starting today (3/18/21).  There doesn't seem to be any real rhyme or reason why specific apps are doing this.  Gmail, Maps, Netflix, Amazon (among many others) don't work, but Photos, Play Store, LinkedIn do work.  All apps are up to date as well.  I'd like to avoid a factory reset if possible.\n\nI've tried clearing cache and uninstalling/reinstalling and neither seem to work.  Any ideas?",
