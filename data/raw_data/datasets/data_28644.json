    "content": "Ok, had my pixel 3a for about a month now, it great....however, it's been doing weird stuff when in my pocket, I put up with it, but a minute ago it actually ordered a Uber Taxi, can't explain why this happen, as phone is supposed to be locked.  If this continues, I'll have to get rid of it, as I can't trust it at the moment !!  Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated.",
