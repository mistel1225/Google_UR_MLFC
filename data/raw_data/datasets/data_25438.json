    "title": "Is there any way to recover the applications I had on my Pixel 3 after a factory reset?",
    "content": "I did the factory reset, and only a minimal number of apps were restored.\n\nAlso, I lost all of my SMS message, none were restored. According to the documentation I had read, the SMS messages were to be retained.\n\nThe frustrating thing is that the factory reset was recommended by Google and Verizon to resolve an issue I had with charging. It did not resolve the issue, and I have to get a new phone anyway, it is just that in the process of this troubleshooting, I lost all of my applications and SMS messages.\n\nA big pain!",
