    "content": "When I try to cast my screen to my 3rd-gen Chromecast (either from the notification panel or from Settings), right after I hit \"Start Casting\" from the \"Start Recording or Casting\" screen, it immediately stops with a message on the bottom of my screen that reads \"Casting screen to TV has ended\". The Chromecast eventually returns to the wallpaper screen like when nothing's casting. That's it, can't get it to work.",
