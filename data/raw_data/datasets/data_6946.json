    "content": "Feb 2021 updates were applied today and phone is stuck in boot mode at G logo.\nTried to reboot, launched recovery mode -> reboot device, restart bootloader but its stuck in fastmode mode.\nAny help! I dont want to do factory reset.\nTried to use adb tools to apply jan 2021 update but laptop is not detecting the phone. I guess the required setting for adb to detect is not turned on the phone.",
