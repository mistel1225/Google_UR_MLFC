    "content": "My pixel gets rebooted whenever I try to open 'Photo sphere' option. I thought it's a bug of beta of android pie but even after the stable update is released its doing the same thing. Now I updated to android q beta programme and it's still the same case. I even tried downloading other apps like camera P23 by xda it's same case there as well. As a young photographer I got this device thinking it may help me instead it has a lot of minor issues like this. please resolve this issue ASAP. \n#teampixel",
