    "content": "Hello,\n\nI'm having trouble with my 2020 Google Pixel Buds. The charging case is recognizing both buds as charged but my right one doesn't work when i put it in my ear. my left one works just fine. I've tried \"forgetting\" from my Bluetooth and reconnecting twice and nothing has changed. I've tried restarting my phone but that didn't solve anything either. I'm not sure what else to do. Is there any way to fix this?",
