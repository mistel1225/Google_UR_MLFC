    "content": "My Pixel 3a was working fine, and it went black out of nowhere while using it.  Wonâ€™t respond to any commands using power button/volume button.  Tried charging it overnight and restarting but still not working.  Had only 7 months but cannot get warranty as out of officially supported country.   What do I need to replace on this POS to get it working again?",
