    "title": "No audio on Pixel through speakers or headphone jack",
    "content": "A few weeks ago my phone stopped playing audio, both through the speakers and the headphone jack, and it cannot record audio in videos, etc.\nI have tried restarting and factory resetting the phone multiple times, but this only momentarily fixes the problem, and within a few hours the audio will stop working again.\nI have read other threads with people with the same problem, and think it is something faulty with the hardware that needs to be fixed.\nI bought my Pixel in Australia less than 2 years ago so it is still under warranty, but I am currently living in Sweden so unsure of the best way to contact Google and repair my phone under warranty.\nAny help would be greatly appreciated thank you!",
