    "content": "My Google Pixel XL 128GB was working fine... I was making a film and suddenly the phone rebooted and start in a bootloop... After that night, it does not keep more than 5 mins without a restart.\n\nI tried to factory reset it and after each factory reset, the phone comes back (boot properly). But for a short period.\n\nI tested in safe mode and the reboot is still happening... It looks that the safe mode does not do any difference in my issue.\n\nI already did a downgrade of Android even with Android 8 (I was with Android 10). I tried several versions in https://developers.google.com/android/images\n\nI am from Brazil and I am really worried. Can anyone help me?",
