    "content": "Two phones in household are the Pixel 2 and the 3a. The Pixel 2 just does not perform as well at anymore on the Tmobile network. I am concerned that If I switched over to Google FI, the issue would not be resolved due to use of similar network connections. If it did fix the problem, then why is Tmobile being cagey or intentionally reduce the functionality of the Pixel 2. To clarify, the Pixel 2 works occasionally.\n\nCurrently having issues with connecting to the Tmobile network after their \"upgrades\" to the towers around July or August of 2020. Tmobile customer support says \"You didn't buy this phone from us so we can't guarantee it's function\". The phone worked well on their network from 2017 until late 2020.\nTroubleshooting steps taken so far:\nRestarted phone\nReset network settings\nRestored factory defaults\nChanged SIM card\nGot Tmobile to send an entirely new SIM card",
