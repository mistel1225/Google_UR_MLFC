    "content": "I have tried editing raw images from the pixel 3 using several programs and cannot get them looking anything like as good as the jpeg. It makes me wonder what the point of having the raw file is for this camera. Is there some way I can reproduce the look of the jpeg in software at least as a starting point? Is there something going on with this camera that makes it inherently impossible to reproduce the jpeg.",
