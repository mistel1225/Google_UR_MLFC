    "content": "I couldn't be any displeased with Google and its clueless customer care teams.\n\nI own a google pixel 4 xl which is still under warranty and its microphone has stopped working. I took my phone to the retailer, retailer did his checks and confirmed its defect. He wrote an email to google saying that he is happy to provide a replacement phone provided google can raise an RMA for his store. Google denied it, it was not interested in its customer having a phone as soon as poissble.\n\nContacted Google customer team, they did few checks and confirmed there was an issue and advised me that they will raise and Advanced RMA. The promise was i will get a new phone by 7 business days.\n\nMy RMA was raised on Sept 2 and I did not get a phone until sept 13, On sept 13 the google realised there was a bug in the RMA software and cancelled my existing RMA and recreated a new RMA. My ETA for the phone was pushed to Sept 22.\n\nTechnically, i am without a phone for 21 days and I am yet to get a tracking number for this phone.\n\nShame on you google for ignoring your customers, regretting my decision to switch from Apple / Samsung.",
