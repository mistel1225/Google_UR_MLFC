    "content": "When I swipe home from an app the screen automatically dims. I tried removing adaptive brightness to no avail. Is this a \"feature\" or is something wrong with my Pixel 4? The brightness increases again when entering an app. So basically my home screen and app switcher are always less bright than apps.",
