    "content": "Hi,\n\nAfter upgrading to android 10 on my pixel 3 I randomly loose internet access over wifi and SIM data.\nI doesn't seem to happen while I use the phone but when I pick it up  after idling.\n\nDisconnecting and reconnecting to wifi doesn't help. I have to completely reboot my phone :/\n\nIs there a fix for this besides a factory reset ? :/",
