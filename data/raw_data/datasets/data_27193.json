    "content": "Hi, I am wondering what is wrong with my phone.. I was listening to music on it, the device was locked and the music was playing off the device speakers from spotify. The phone made a very high pitch sound and shut down, taking 10 minutes to reset and finally turn back on. Is this a fault with the phone and should I take it in somewhere? I've only just had it a year. Thanks",
