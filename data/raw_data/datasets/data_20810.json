    "content": "Bedtime mode seems to have disappeared or stopped working with my recent security update on my Pixel 3.\n\nI was able to add it to my pull down menu from the top, but when I click it, it goes to an all black page where I am unable to turn it on or do anything other than go back. \n\nI saw that maybe it had been added to the clock app, but it isn't there either.\n\nIs it broken for everyone? Is there a way to bring it back?",
