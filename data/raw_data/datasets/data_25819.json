    "content": "My PS4 controller connects easily with the Pixel 3a via Bluetooth, but the phone does not seem to recognize any input. I cannot nagivate the menus and all of the apps I have tried do not register any input. The controller was able to connect easily to a Galaxy S6 and was used to play games and nagivate the menu. Could this be a problem with the Pixel 3a or the Android version in general?",
