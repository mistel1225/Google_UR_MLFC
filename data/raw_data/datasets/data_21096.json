    "content": "My phone was working fine until 5th May 2020 monthly update. Now,Battery Indicator stuck to 100%. \nEntire day it is at 100%(During charge & Use) and phone automatically shuts down when battery is over. One good thing, phone is charging but it starts from 100% and it keeps on charging even put for long duration higher than 2hr30min(max time for complete charge) . \nHave done soft and hard reset but nothing resolved. Battery is charging and after update it happened, so it is related to software only.\nAnyone Facing this issue....If resolved, kindly help?",
