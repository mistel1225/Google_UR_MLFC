    "content": "Every time my phone connects to my 2019 Subaru or 2020 ram with Bluetooth, I get message that untrusted device trying to access contacts and have to approve. If I miss the popup I can not make access any contacts from car. I have to approve every time, how do I fix to always work? I have tried marking the connection trusted but does not work",
