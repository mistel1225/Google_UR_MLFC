    "content": "My Pixel 2XL phone won't turn on.\n\nLast night I left it charging just as I do every night. Today, when I woke up the screen was black and it didn't turn back on. I tried connecting it again and it wouldn't charge. I tried using another cable and it wouldn't charge. I tried connecting it to my computer and it couldn't recognize it, plus, it wouldn't charge.\n\nI also tried factory resetting it (Power button + Volume down button) and nothing seems to happen. I keep those buttons pressed for over 60 seconds and nothing will happen.\n\nCan anybody help? thanks",
