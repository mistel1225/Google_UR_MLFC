    "content": "New Pixel 3, about a week old.  Running Android 11 beta 2.5. \nUp until this morning when I tapped the temperature on the top banner of the home screen the frog would show up with the current weather and forecast as it did on my phone I was using previously (pixel). \nStarting today when I tap the same temperature display it now opens up Google Assistant and does a search on \"weather.\"\n\nHow can I get the frog back without downloading a frog launcher shortcut from the play store. I'd like the old behavior back. \n\nThanks.",
