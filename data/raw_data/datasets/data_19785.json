    "content": "I've read the other threads about this but they're 8 months old and there is no definitive answer. When recording a video on third party apps, there is an annoying clicking noise every half second. Almost like someone is tapping on my microphone while I'm recording. Is there a fix for this? I got this phone less than 48 hours ago.",
