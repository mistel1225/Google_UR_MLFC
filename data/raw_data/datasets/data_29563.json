    "content": "This has been been an on going issue that I have had since I got the phone in November. Initially the sound was very low and irregular, also did not interfere while on Bluetooth or speaker. Now its there in almost every call and as well as using the phone speaker & Bluetooth. At times the call itself cuts out for a few seconds as if it has disconnected and then comes back.",
