    "content": "When searching Google via the home screen search bar, video results linking to YouTube will redirect to a new Google search page, rather than opening the video in the app. First noticed this after the update to Android 10 but cannot say for certain that the issue was not present prior to the update.\n\nThe images below show what each screen looks like. I can provide a screen capture of the issue as well if need be.\n\nHas anyone else encountered this issue or know what is causing it?",
