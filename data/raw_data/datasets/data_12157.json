    "content": "Hi,\nMy Pixel 5 have a yellowish screen compared to my previous Pixel 3. I have already returned 2, because they had the same issue.\nI tried all the different screen / color settings, with no success.\n\nI can't believe it's intended: it's hardly usable as it is, and a true downgrade compared to the Pixel 3.\nIs there a way to fix it?",
