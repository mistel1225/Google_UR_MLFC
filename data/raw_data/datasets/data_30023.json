    "content": "The cord connection never worked between my 2 devices so I used the option to transfer via Google account and confirmed the shapes on both devices.\n\nUnfortunately, I only got text messages from 2 months ago and back to 2017, not the text messages from 2 months ago to today. \n\nHow can I fix this? (it even seems the arrangement of my apps are outdated to what it looked like a few months ago)\n\nThank you",
