    "title": "Pixel 2 useless after Android 11 update",
    "content": "Wish they would break update into updates for security patches and update for new functionality.  Don't need forced functionality updates, happy with what I had.  DO NEED security updates.\nBroken - \n1. Gestures - why - don't want it, don't need it but can't turn off\n2. Soft buttons to minimize or close apps no longer work\n3. Squeeze Pixel 2 sides to open Google Assistant - nope\n4. Related to #3 but yet different - Hey Google does not work, important when driving to have Android Auto play tunes on your favorite music player.  Can't now.\n4. date time & weather no longer displayed on screen when phone not in use - why?\n5. NO NOTIFICATION of text messages - I actually have to look at phone to see if i have any messages\n6.  Why do I have to be here - shouldn't phone just work?  It's my phone, I paid for it, new features should be a choice not a requirement.  Why am I on here posting instead of living life, what a waste of time.\n7.  Since update rolled out yesterday I have no idea what else is broke.  \n\nAdding info as I discover more borken;\n8.  Outlook no longer receiving email\n9.  Hitting volume up button then the bottom box used to open sound volume for everything.  No more?\n\nYes, I have a Pixel 2.  Looks like it's new out of the box phone and until and update yesterday worked just fine.  Forced upgrade will be an iPhone.",
