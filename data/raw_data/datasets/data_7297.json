    "content": "This is so hard to explain it makes my head spin. The amount of storage my photos occupy on the device in the Files Folder does not match the storage these photos take in the image folder that I access via the Settings-storage. I've only had the phone for less than two weeks and the only images that are on th device are images I took with the device, no other backups or transfers from my old phone. \n\nThe very same images that take 339mg in files folder appear to take over 2gb in the image storage accessible via Settings-Storage-photos.\n\nI compared side by side the images from the two folders.I do not have any other WhatsApp images  or downloads to account for the difference of storage memory. Pretty much some 1.7gb are unaccounted for.\n\n The only thing I can think of is that I recorded some videos last week.i deleted the files after backing them in the cloud. Those do not show up in either folder but they must occupy storage somehow and they must hide.somewhere..i looked in the dcmi folder but it does not show anything except the 339 megabytes taken by the photographs. \n\nAt this rate the storage will be full within months if files that were supposedly backed up and deleted remain hidden in the phone's storage.",
