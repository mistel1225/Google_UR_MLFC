    "content": "When i use netflix, some things i watch automatically go to full zoom and crop out a large portion of the screen and i am unable to pinch the screen to unzoom it. How do i change this so that i can watch things without having it in full zoom, because some movies/tv shows don't allow me to unzoom",
