    "content": "Since a few months I have the problem that the backplate is coming loose and that also brings another problem that dust is forming between the camera and the backplate. I have tried to contact Google about it but since I live in the Netherlands where the Pixel isn't sold I can't get any support. I have tried multiple ways but I have been told multiple times that they can't help me. What can I do to resolve this issue?",
