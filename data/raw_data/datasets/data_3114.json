    "content": "Even though I'm connected to the WiFi I keep getting the message that the phone can't connect for WiFi calls. I've turned on airplane mode and wifi and can surf the web. This works well at home but doesn't work at my construction site. We're not using Google Fi as the router. Could the problem be with the router or the phone?",
