    "title": "My Pixel 3 XL won't turn on unless plugged in. Once powered on the battery drains very fast.",
    "content": "I bought the phone in December 2018 and it has performed well until 2 days ago when the phone randomly turned itself off. Since then it has been impossible to turn on the phone unless plugged in. Also, the battery drains very fast with little to no use. Software updates haven't solved the issue.\nI would appreciate some assistance on this very frustrating situation. Thanks.",
