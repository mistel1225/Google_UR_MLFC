    "title": "Google Pixel 3a XL: Mobile Data connectivity and notification issues",
    "content": "Many of the functions on my google pixel stopped working.\n\nMobile data won't work and is in the off position. I slide it to the on position and then it automatically turns itself off after leaving that screen.\n\nThe active edge squeeze feature won't work. It is also turned on in settings and works when adjusting squeeze sensitivity. \n\nJump to Camera feature doesn't work, I double-tap the power button and it just locks my phone despite this setting being enabled.\n\nThe screenshot method of holding the power button and selecting a screenshot is no longer available.\n\nNotifications are also not appearing on the screen or on the scroll down menu. When I scroll down from the top of my screen it only shows the first row of settings from wifi to battery saving mode. It does not let me scroll down any further.\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.",
