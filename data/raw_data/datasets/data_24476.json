    "content": "I took my phone into the pool because I thought it was water resistant, I just tested if it really was water resistant for less than a minute, it wasn't under water for too long. Then when I tried to plug my headphones they didn't work, but it does charge, only by one side of the charger. \nI've tried cleaning the port and it didn't work. I don't know what else I can try. It has been one week since it stopped working.",
