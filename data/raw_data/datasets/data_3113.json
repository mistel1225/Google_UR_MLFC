    "content": " Hello after the April 2021 update I am having an issue using Bluetooth devices.  This has happened both on my pixel buds and alpine head unit in my car.  The call will go through the handset not the pixel buds or my cars head unit.  The option is there to change to that but it refuses to use that device.  I can switch to my speaker phone and back to the pixel 5 just fine.  It is random, sometimes it works just fine, others not at all.",
