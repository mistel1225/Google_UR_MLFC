    "content": "Howdy!\nI'm having issues with the Instagram video feature, and it persists through all 3rd party cameras. There is a tapping noise during all of my videos and it makes them un-usable.\n\nThis has started to become quite detrimental to my business. I work with influencers on Instagram and I recommended the new Pixel 4 phone for its camera quality. Low and behold, any videos they take are a waste of time because of the tapping noise! \n\nI noticed in some of the forums Google representatives have replied and promised a fix \"in the coming days\" but that was 3 weeks ago, and is now false. I'm not sure why a tapping noise is taking this long to fix on what should be a top priority device, it is a brand new phone after all! \n\nIs there any update on when this issue will be resolved? I only have a few more days until my return policies expire for the devices, I enjoy the Pixel and I would love to be able to continue using it, but this tapping noise in videos is very important to me and would force me to choose a different brand.\n\nIf you read through to the end thank you for your time, hope to here back soon.",
