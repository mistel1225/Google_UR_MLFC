    "content": "My wife sent me a video of my son through the messaging app. I never downloaded it. I recently went back to watch it and it was nowhere to be found. It appears that my phone purged it on its own. Is there anyway to retrieve it? She changed phones at work and apparently it wasn't backed up. Thanks in advance!",
