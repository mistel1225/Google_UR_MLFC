    "content": "After this December 2020 update,\n\nWireless Emergency Alert is now FORCED to make sound!\n\nEven when the phone is set vibration only, that alert makes massive sound and makes me embarrassed.\n\nI could make it vibrate only before this update.\n\nIn my country they push this 'emergency' messages like spam. A LOT. The sound is really pain in the ass.\n\nWhy? At least make the sound quieter. It's like thunder now!",
