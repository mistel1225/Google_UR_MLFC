    "content": "Starting from the March Update, my Pixel 3 XL has been freezing 2-3 times a day during app startup, video playing, and gaming. When it freezes, the touch screen and physical buttons are completely unresponsive and I have to wait for 3-5 minutes or hold the power button to restart. If I wait until it unfreezes, a \"UI isn't responding\" error will pop up.\n\nThis seems to be a widely observed problem among the PIxel community:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/ml1ets/pixel_4_xl_freezing/\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/mkdmpe/pixel_3xl_super_laggy_freezing/",
