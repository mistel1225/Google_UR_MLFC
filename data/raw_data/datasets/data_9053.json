    "content": "Just saw a story on January updates rolling out and it reminded me that I didn't remember getting the last update. Turns out my security update is still November 5. (which is like a day before I got the phone) Checking for updates gets nothing. Running unlocked on a Verizon mnvo with pixel 5. I thought updates were supposed to come straight from Google. That's why I bought the phone, for pure Android. Any ideas welcome! Perhaps I am missing something obvious.",
