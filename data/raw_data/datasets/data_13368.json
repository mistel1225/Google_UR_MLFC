    "title": "Phone Plays Ringtone Without Any Notifications",
    "content": "Hello,\nI have a Google Pixel 3 XL on Android 11 and recently (about a month ago), my phone would randomly play my ringtone without any new notifications or call. The ringtone is a song chosen by me so it's not a system default sound being played.\nThe ringtone would play randomly without any notifications from any apps nor incoming calls. Checking the phone logs afterwards doesn't yield anything either. The ringtone would also play for random intervals as well, sometimes stopping almost immediately and sometimes playing for minutes.\nAnyone know what's going on?\nThank you!",
