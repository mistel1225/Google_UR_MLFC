    "title": "Pixel 4a Contacts sync not working",
    "content": "Hello,\n\nwhile everything else (including all sync) works on this phone, I cannot get my contacts to sync. The phone app shows all contacts that I have in Telegram - but none that I have in my Google Contacts. If I open the Contacs app I can see that syncing is in progress, but it never loads any contact. Sometimes an error is shown that syncing failed. I enabled all sync, forced sync via date change & phone app, cleared app data and cache, reset all App configuration, transferred data from the old phone  ... basically everything shy of a complete factory reset (which I am reluctant to do as I have just finished setting up my phone which has taken some hours)\n\n\nWhat else can I do to get my sync to work?",
