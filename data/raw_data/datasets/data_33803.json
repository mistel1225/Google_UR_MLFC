    "content": "On other Android devices I am able to save multiple timers. I have one for my dryer, different cycles on my washing machine, etc. so I could just select the timer I need instead of setting it up each time. I don't see where I can add and save timers on my Pixel 3 and I'm really hoping that the option is available and just hiding from me.",
