    "content": "Hello everyone. I met an issue recently. When I take a picture by my Pixel 4 XL and jump from the camera app to the camera roll app, then the picture i take can't be previewed and the camera roll app will crash. It happened several times and every time I need to go to the app management of the system setting, force the photo album app shutdown and clean the cache of the photo album app. So that the app will work again and the picture can be previewed. This problem troubled me so many times and I wonder how to fix this issue. I am expecting a reply.",
