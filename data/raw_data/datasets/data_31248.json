Theres no progress bar or anything.  where the progress bar should be, they grey line, it just keeps moving across my screen, not indicating any progress, but more like showing that its trying.  I force shutdown my phone, and it just came right back up, i didnt even get to access the homepage.  It just went right back to updating.  can anyone help me at all???",
