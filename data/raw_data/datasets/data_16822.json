    "content": "Hi, I just updated to android 11 this morning, and I toggled my nearby sharing option from the quick settings and made sure Bluetooth and location are all on and my device visibility is set for all contacts. Whenever I go to Google photos and press the share icon I always get my usual suggested apps such as  bluetooth, WhatsApp and individual persons on whatsapp to share the image, when I also pressed on more options, there is a whole list of apps through which you can share the image but the nearby Share option isn't visible here! Am I the only person having this issue? But when I swipe up to the app switcher menu and then long press on a photo and press on share then the nearby share option is available. Really strange and frustrating. Your kind replies are highly appreciated. Thank you.",
