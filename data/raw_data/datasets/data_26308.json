    "content": "I had a flashing/flickering screen issue with my pixel 3 phone and i call Google support for help then after alot of troubleshooting. They decided that i have to send the pixel 3 for replacement. I sent the defected phone at the beginning of April and now it's almost a month and they didn't give me any updates regarding whether they received the defected phone or not. Iam resident at zurich and i used Swiss post to send the defected device. Swiss post confirmed that the package is already delivered but every time i call or email Google store support, they say that it's not confirmed within their system that package is received. After alot of calls and emails all i get is \" we are still trying to contact the warehouse to see of the package received\" and i don't understand what's really going on here!! I got no information whatsoever regarding the process or any tracking information!\nPlease your help would be great! \n\nMy case id incase someone needs it : 9-8112000025890\n\nSamar Mahmoud \nTIA",
