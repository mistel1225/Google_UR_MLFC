    "content": "So recently I began to notice that I am seeing events on calendars that have been shared with me on my home screen rather than just my own events. I am shared on a lot of calendars for reference purposes at work but I do not want to see events that are not on my own calendar on the home screen of my Pixel 3. I don't get notifications when those events are happening and my permissions on the calendars have not changed either. Does anyone have any idea how to fix this other than unchecking the calendars in the Google Calendar app since I do want to see them in there?",
