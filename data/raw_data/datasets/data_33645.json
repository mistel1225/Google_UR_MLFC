    "content": "Google 'swipe left' news feed blank with G Suite account on Google Pixel 2 XL. I added my new G Suite account and removed my existing Gmail account and now the news feed is blank. I have tried restarting the phone, clearing the Google App cache, uninstalling all updates and reinstalling them, disabling the Google App and re-enabling. I'm reluctant to wipe the device and start again because my phone is enrolled in my employer's MDM and would have to be re-added by them. \n\nAny last ditch efforts before wiping it?\n\nThank you",
