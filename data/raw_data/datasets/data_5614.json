    "content": "I have a USB mic and set of wired (3.5mm) headphones I'd like to be able to use concurrently on my Pixel 4XL.  I've gotten each to work by itself but any attempt I've made to connect both at the same time has failed. Is there any dongle or adapter that will allow me to use both at the same time?  Bluetooth isn't really an option because audio delay puts my voice out of sync with music/background audio being played on the phone.",
