    "content": "I have been having issues with Bluetooth connectivity since Android 11 was released. From sound cutting out on earbuds, the inability to see song information on the display in my car, and in ability to change songs using buttons in my car (all things I could do before). \n\nI read that I need to roll back to Bluetooth 1.4 but can't figure out how to turn on developer options as instructed. Is there a fix for this?",
