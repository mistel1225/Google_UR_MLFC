    "content": "For a couple days my pixel has been almost un-usable. It constantly pauses my videos, makes the google sound and tells me what time it is. I am not super tech savvy but have turned off talk back and select to speech. It could also be something in my headphones, but they are pretty new. If there are any suggestions on how I could fix this or if people have had the same problem let me know.",
