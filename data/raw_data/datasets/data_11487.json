    "content": "3 xl died night before last, have same issues like others  wcreen would be black and would have to restart phone to get it to work again (couldn't just plug mine in, had to restart bootloader) but this time kept on saying charging but stuck at 0%. Got out of shower,  same. Factory reset device, wiped it, the whole shebang.  What am I missing? Caution sign appears fast bootloader comes up when I press power and volume key.",
