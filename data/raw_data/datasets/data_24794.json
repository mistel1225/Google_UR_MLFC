    "content": "Hi there\n\nI have just received this phone after upgrading my pay monthly contract with Vodafone UK. It works great but there seems to be an issue when I start casting Netflix from this device to my Google Chromecast. \n\nAfter no more than a minute of casting the phone will power off and proceed to a black screen with red text stating the following; failure to load android system if this problem continues try factory reset.\n\nAfter this happening multiple times I finally tried a factory reset, which unfortunately has not solved the problem. \n\nCould someone please provide me with a solution as I have multiple Google devices to cast to and do not wish to have to deal with this persistent problem ever time I want to cast content to another device. \n\nThank you for taking the time to read this. I am looking forward to your replies\n\nTom",
