    "content": "my phone died earlier and when I got home, I plugged it in, but the charging icon that shows when the phone is shut off, doesn't show any charging progress, and when I try to turn the phone back on by holding down the power button, a red light in the top right corner comes on, the phone has been charging for an hour and it hasn't changed anything.",
