    "content": "I have a Pixel 5 with dual SIM. SIM 1 is set to be the default for calls and SMS. When I open Google Messages on the phone, sometimes I see SIM 1 being used, other times SIM2 and I have to manually change it by selecting the SIM. Why isn't it the default SIM always being used?\n\nIs there any way to have certain contacts, such as contacts from my work profile, always use SIM1 and all other contacts use SIM2 for calls and SMS?",
