    "content": "My most popular (and unrelated apps) are refusing to open today suddenly. Includes Pandora music, Amazon shopping, Audible, and Double Twist. Never had problems with these before. I have tried phone restart, clean app caches, uninstall and reinstall apps, checked for app and phone updates, checked my connection, everything short of reset to factory settings. Anyone else have this issue?",
