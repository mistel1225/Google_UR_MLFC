    "content": "When I have an incoming call, my phone doesn't indicate a call is coming in, ring, or vibrate. The only time I know I've missed a call is when the person leaves a voice message, because I get that notification. I don't get a missed call notification. Incoming calls also don't appear on my \"Recents\" list of calls. Voicemails do show up on the \"Recents\" list. This has happened even with people in my Contacts.\n\nRecently, my phone had suggested I use the autoscreen feature for suspected robo calls. These problems stared after I accepted that. However, they're continuing even now, after I turned it off completely. \n\nDND is off. Call volume is up all the way. I've tried restarting. The numbers aren't blocked.\n\nHelp!",
