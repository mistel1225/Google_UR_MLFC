    "content": "My pixel was shutting down randomly or rebooting. I noticed the last few times it happened, it was taking longer to turn on each time. This last time, it never turned back on. The charge light doesn't come on. It doesn't vibrate and you cannot access the bootloader. The computer recognizes it, but the device doesn't appear to have any power. It was not experiencing issues charging. I called tech and they've decided to send a replacement, but I am still curious if we know what the issues is? I've had it for a year and it appears to be a common problem with the Pixel 2.",
