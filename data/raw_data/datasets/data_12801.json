    "content": "I brought a new phone today. While in store I was asked to log in my gmail. So I did. But after returning I decided to factory reset the phone so that I will escape from any mishappening.   As i had the password of my gmail account  I tried logging in but it started asking for a security code. I don't know how to get this code now. As I have factory reset the phone the account wasn't logged in when I setup the phone again. And I didn't have this account opened anywhere else too. Even the security email or any other recovery options aren't showing now.",
