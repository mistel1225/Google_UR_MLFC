    "content": "Hello. My Google pixel 2 has started getting more and more inconsistent with its proper functioning. First my Google Assistant disappeared and can no longer find my phone. The only way to access the Assistant is to click the Google search bar.\nI cannot retrain my voice because it shows no devices found even though my phone is indeed connected to my home wifi, although I do not understand why it needs to be because my Assistant used to work anywhere, not only at home. Started having to retrain last May, almost one year ago but now assistant is just not on my phone access...\n\nThe other more important thing that has been malfunctioning is my camera. When I open the camera it just shows a black screen, it freezes up my phone and often times causes the phone to restart on its own. If I'm using an app like Snapchat that utilizes the camera, same thing...freeze, super delays, or restart of phone. This has been happening for over six months.\n\nThe last few weeks the phone now just restarts whenever it feels like it, not only just when using the camera. How do I get help with solutions for these issues?\n\nI think my phone is about a year and a half old.",
