    "content": "The Google Assistant on my new Pixel 4 XL phone will not set a timer when I say \"Okay Google, set a 1-hour timer\". It will say that the timer is set but it isn't, the timer is still at 00h00m00s.\n\nHowever, if I unlock the phone and click the assistant logo and then say to set a 1-hour timer, then it will set the timer.\n\nI have tried restarting the phone and removing the Google app updates and then reinstalling them. Google Assistant seems to work for the other commands I have given it but I haven't tested them all.\n\nHere is a link to the community thread and I have tried all steps listed in it. It also shows others having the same issue.\nhttps://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/21781845?msgid=21781845",
