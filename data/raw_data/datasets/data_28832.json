    "content": "I cracked my Glass one they charged me $242/ Rs. 17000 for the glass. Keeping the fact Pixel 2XL is now sold very cheap. I bought it for $923/Rs. 60000 and if someone asks to get the screen repair will cost $242/ Rs. 17000 that is absurd. If anyone has any suggestions. I'm listening.\n\nI know some people might think what is the harm in paying but then again I put in my whole year's saving to buy it, Can't just get that repaired so easily.\n\nThanks for understanding.",
