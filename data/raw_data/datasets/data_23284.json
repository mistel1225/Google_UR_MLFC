    "content": "I have a Pixel 3 XL with the Snapdragon 845 soc. It should support Qualcomm's TWS+ but it doesn't appear to work. I'm on the latest Android 10 Feb 5th update.\n\nCan it be enabled? I'd like to get the most out of the battery life on my Bluetooth earbuds and I can't unless TWS+ is enabled.",
