    "content": "Ok so , the owner , an old man , who is not technically savy has been struggling to figure this out. Im trying to help him.  He said he bought a pixel phone for one of his workers to use. That phone is under his workers google account.  The worker actually passed away and the phone was returned to the owner from the police.  Right now the owner uses and old iphone, would prefer to use the pixel .  I tried a factory reset but it wants the workers google accoutn credentials. He been trying to contact through verizon (where he bought it ) but has beeen getting the run around.  Is there a protocol for reseting a phone and also reseting the google account?",
