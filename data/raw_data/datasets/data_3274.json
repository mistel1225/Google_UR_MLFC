    "title": "Pixel 2 XL camera app crashes.",
    "content": "I've tried clearing the permissions, uninstalling the update, clearing the storage, reinstalling the update, safe mode, and even factory restoring the phone to no avail. Google support says I'm SOL, and out of warranty. The front-facing camera works just fine, and I was able to get the rear to work for about 2 seconds once but the app crashed again. The phone works fine otherwise. I'm fairly certain it's not hardware. \nAny help would be appreciated.\n\n\nUpdate: I've randomly got it to work several times now, so I know its not hardware for sure. Google fix your software before another class-action lawsuit hits your front door!",
