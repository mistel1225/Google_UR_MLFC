    "content": "I dropped my Pixel 4 XL this morning and it seems to have just shut down. I go to turn it back on via the power and volume buttons held down simultaneously and the Google logo shows up on the screen for about a second then the screen shuts off again. I have a feeling it's the phone shutting back down because I had it plugged into my computer and my computer said it disconnected as soon as the screen went black. I then go to the fastboot mode menu and as soon as I release either the volume down or the power button the phone shuts down again. If I hold on to the buttons the menu stays visible for about 5 seconds then shuts back down again regardless. If anyone can provide any sort of help it would be greatly appreciated.",
