    "content": "I seem to have this issue when receiving calls after the Android 11 update as of this week. I will get a call from another phone (in this latest case from my wife's equivalent Pixel 3), and halfway through the call will get the beeping like another call is coming through. However, it's the same person I'm already talking to. So I got a call from my wife, and was getting notice that another call was coming through, but it was from her. When I ended the first call, I wasn't able to swipe down to cancel the \"second call\" or swipe up to \"answer it\". I had to restart the phone to get back to the main screen and do anything other than continue to swipe uselessly.\n\nHas anyone else had this problem, and/or is there a fix for it? I never had the issue before on Android 10.",
