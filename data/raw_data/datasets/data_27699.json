    "content": "My pixel 3xl updated to Android 10 last night.  Since that time, I have not been able to\nUse Gestures\nAccess the camera by double-tapping the power button\nGo directly back to the home screen without hitting the back button repeatedly\nUse the long-press on wi-fi to access a full list of available networks\nList all the running programs\nReceive notifications\n\nI have tried restarting, shutting off the phone and waiting 10 min to restart it.  Are there any other suggestions to resolve this? \n\nThanks,\ndaveBr",
