    "title": "Updating Pixel 2 - Manually - January 2021 Security Update",
    "content": "Sorry if this asked been asked before, I searched through the forums but couldn't find anything. \nI am looking to manually update the latest security patch - Jan 2021 to my pixel 2. Since Google has officially stopped the support to this phone, I want to do this manually. But I am not sure if there's a patch that I can even download or use for pixel 3 or something? Any help or pointing in the right direction will be super helpful. \n\nI need to do this as my corporate email has stopped working, and it needs my phone to be on the latest software/security update. It's a perfectly good working phone and I hate to spend more $$ on a new phone. \n\nThank you.",
