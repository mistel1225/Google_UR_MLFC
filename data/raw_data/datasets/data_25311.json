    "content": "My back camera has stopped working. I have tried turning my phone on in safe mode, rebooting the whole system, uninstalling and reinstalling but nothing worked. My front camera still works but is very slow. I brought the phone in the UK but I'm currently living in Vietnam. I asked at a phone repair shop and he seems to think it's a hardware issue. How do I check this? And what do I do if I need to send this for repairs/get a new one?",
