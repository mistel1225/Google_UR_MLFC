    "content": "The Pixel 2 XL Verizon Variant seems to have a glitch In its power code. Running beta 3 Android 11 and the phone will be off when I come back to it after closing out Android by either hitting the power button to activate immediate lock screen or if I set it down without the lock button being activated and it closing out the Android UI after 30 minutes which I selected manually. I first thought it only did this at 50 percent but today it completely turned off As if I turned it off,  or the battery drained down to zero, or I and rebooted the phone to off is how it just does. 75 percent of the time the only way to get it back on is to use a power bank with a 5v 2.4 or higher rating or the same ratings or higher with a AC Charger. If try without any of those methods it works in the same process as if the phone battery was dead, hit lower button but no attempts to boot. Ã‡",
