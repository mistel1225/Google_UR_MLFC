    "content": "Google Voice Typing is Something to be desired??\n\nI am using a Google Pixel 2 XL I have been using Google voice typing for some time now. It is not working better than when I started. \n\nShouldn't it learn what normal phrases I use? It's always using Siri for a period, constantly. I say PS it uses TS, a comma is tama etc.\n\nIs there a setting that I am missing in my phone or otherwise that I can adjust. \n\nAdditionally, shouldn't it constantly keep improving itself based on what I speak into the voice typing???\n\nI thought Google was big into AI? Definitely not with the Google voice typing!\n\nWhat are your thoughts?\n\nPS: Interesting observation. WhatsApp seems to do the best job decoding my language. Any thoughts about that?",
