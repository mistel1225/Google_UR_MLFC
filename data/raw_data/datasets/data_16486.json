    "content": "Instead of being able to swipe from screen to screen, a green box appears and I have to try to get the green box around the correct area and double tap to try to open anything.\nI tried restarting my phone but that didn't help.\nAfter several minutes of struggling, I was able to get the settings open, but I can't swipe the list of options up and down to see if I could change anything there.\nWhat do I do?  I would like to be able to use the various apps on my phone but I can't swipe over to access them.",
