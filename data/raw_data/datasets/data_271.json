    "title": "Why am I no longer able to download attachments & preview attached files on my Pixel 2XL?",
    "content": "About a week ago my phone stopped allowing me to download files and/or preview images or PDF attachments on my Gmail on my Pixel 2XL. It's driving me crazy as I'm used to doing work on the road from my phone. This wasn't an issue when I was using up 63 out of the 64 GB of storage. I deleted some files and I'm closer to 61GB and that didn't resolve the issue. Please help.",
