    "title": "Question about getting a replacement device",
    "content": "I bough a pixel 3 a few months ago and am having issues with the camera. It has trouble focusing, which seems like not an uncommon problem. I contacted customer support and they want to issue a replacement for the phone. However, under the advanced replacement scheme, they want to put a hold of $799 on my card.\n\nI understand that this is not a charge, and will go away once the phone is returned, however, this means that I am liable for that amount of money if for some reason the shipping fails, right? I got my device under a promotion for $599 from the google store and a  brand new device now is $499. I feel it's a little unfair that the hold costs more than the amount I paid for or how much the device is worth, especially as I am getting a refurbished device.\n\nAnyone else had an issue with this? I feel like there's no choice to just bite the bullet with this and hope that nothing happens for me to be charged $799.\n\nThanks for your help.",
