    "content": "The rear camera shakes basically all the time. Recorded video turns out flickering and pictures are not as sharp as they should be.\n\nI have tried different settings and clearing the camera app to defaults.\n\nVideo of the phone exhibiting the behaviour: https://youtu.be/Y_wRNGdeV4w\n\nIs this a hardware fault with the optical image stabilization?\n\nHate to have to send it in ;(\n\nThe phone is 2 weeks old.",
