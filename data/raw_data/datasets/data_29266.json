    "title": "Battery Draining Faster after a Reboot",
    "content": "WIFI/Data was really slow so I rebooted by phone to see if that would fix the problem. It did, but then my battery started having a lot of issues.\n\nFirst while charging it would show that it was charging up to 105%. When I took it off the charger, it would then drain incredibly fast, but then it would sit at 1% for a long time, as if the battery % in the top right of the screen was wrong. I let it drain and it turned off by itself and then recharged if back to 100%, but now even on battery saver mode, it seems that the battery life has been shot. I could get through an entire day on almost a single charge but now I'm at 50% at 11am with battery saver mode on.\n\nBefore I could handle a charge without having battery saver mode on and having Bluetooth on all day, but now I'm struggling to make it through the day with Bluetooth turned off and battery saver on. One of the things I've tried was turning off digital well being, but I always had that on before and never had an issue with my battery.\n\nOne of the things that I feel might be the issue is that I constantly switch from a rapid charger (USB-C to USB-C plugged into a wall) to a regular charger (USB-C to USB plugged into a wall)",
