    "content": "A week after I installed Android 11 update on my Pixel 4 XL, the contact names for my text messages are not showing up. They disappeared. Just the numbers. There's only one that showed up yester: my father's that says \"Dad\".\nI do NOT want to do a factory reset. \nDue to COVID, I can't go into work for them to setup my phone again.",
