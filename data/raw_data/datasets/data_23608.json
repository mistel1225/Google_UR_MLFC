    "content": "Earlier whenever I streamed HDR content in youtube, the high brightness mode automatically kicks in my Pixel 3xl and takes brightness to the highest level, but now it's not happening and I'm worried that if I increase my phones brightness to max it will not go as high as high brightness mode when viewing HDR content.\n\nDoes anyone else also have this issue.",
