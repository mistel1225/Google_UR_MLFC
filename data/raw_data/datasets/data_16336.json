    "content": "Something changed with my prime video app that made me no longer be able to use my phone volume buttons to adjust the volume. I can use the buttons to adjust the volume when I'm casting from Netflix, Hulu and YouTube. I have looked at the settings in the prime video app and the Chromecast app and I can't find anything to fix this.",
