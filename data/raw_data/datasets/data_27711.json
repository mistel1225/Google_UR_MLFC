    "content": "It started acting weird this week...\nAs I attended a wedding and took lots pics, I had to Free Up Space as the storage was getting crowded...\nSo, although I had some pics & videos I planned to post on my FB, I went ahead to FUS...\nThen, later I attempted to \"Save to device\" for those pics & videos individually (I wish Google Photos improve the method to RESTORE backed up photos & videos in BULK - without creating an album...), I got restored the pics, but for the videos, I couldn't download with \"Save to device\"... All the results were \"Download Unsuccessful\". \nSo, I researched and tried a few different methods:\n- Created an album with all 4 videos (from 11s to 2m43s) then download from within the album â†’ FAILED \n- Get the link of the album (Select Share to create the link), copy&paste on Chrome browser on my cell (I only have a cell with me), select \"Download All\" â†’FAILED \n- Tried to Share videos individually to my Google Drive â†’ FAILED \n- From My Google Drive, I tried to Upload â†’ \"Preparing 1 files for upload\" appears and keeps going & going and NOTHING happens... (FAILED)\n- From the above album opened in Chrome browser, open the video, then download individually â†’ Worked only for 11s (shorest) & 2m43s (longest) videos, but the other 2 videos have been failing every time... ðŸ˜«\n\nI haved exhausted all the possible methods... and I still have 2 more videos I need to download... ðŸ˜“\n\nThis is Crazy!!!\n\nDoes anybody have any other suggestions?",
