    "content": "So a number of apps on my phone are not working correctly. I've deleted and reinstalled a few of them numerous times. What's happening is when I open an app it goes to the splash screen then crashes. Sometimes I get the flicker of the options that let you kill the app and submit an error report. But that only stays up for a fraction of a second. That error is also occuring on apps that seem to be working fine as well. So far the affected apps are Amazon, Target, Nextdoor, Facebook, Tinder and Alarmy.",
