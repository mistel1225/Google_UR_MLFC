    "content": "I'm updating my phone to open beta 12 after Google I/O 21. The phone is broken, fatal error.\nAfter factory reset, I get into the settings menu, select the language, wi-fi. I am not asked for an account to log in. System immediately asked to restore data using another device via a cable. I'm trying to skip, system asks for the pin code that was on this device, I enter, I get into a loop from which there is no way out: again asks to restore data from another device, after skip again asks to enter the pincode,...\nIn the window with the pincode, i can see button \"Use Google account instead\", but if i cliked here i get back to menu with question about restored from another device.\nIs this the case when you have to wait 24 hours to unlock? Or what should I do?",
