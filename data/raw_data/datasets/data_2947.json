    "content": "Yesterday when my phone battery is under 28% and i charge my phone. When i open my phone then, my screen flicker and ghost touch error occurs to a point that i can't even use my phone. I also notice my phone getting a bit hot. At that point i restart my phone and the problem still exist. I shut off my phone and let it cool down and charge it to 90%. After that i factory reset my phone. Flickering and ghost touch error disappear but the specific area on the bottom part of my screen is really under responsive. What could cause this issue?Is it software related or hardware related. I have drop my phone once or twice on the side corner. No damage nor crack on the screen. With COVID going on, i also wipe my phone screen and back with methylated spirit , whenever i go outside and come back. Probably 2 or 3 times a week. Can these cause the issue i stated above? Do i need to replace my whole screen or can i repair it? Color test and touch sensitivity on other area are working perfectly. Just that specific area on the bottom part of my phone.( The affected area is the Front part of the screen where i crop in the screenshot below. ) taken from a clip from youtube.",
