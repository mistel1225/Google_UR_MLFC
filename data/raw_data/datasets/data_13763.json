    "content": "I am trying to use Live Transcribe with my Pixel 5. When I pair the phone with an external bluetooth audio device it works perfectly, however when I switch to the Device Mic (or disconnect from the bluetooth device) it doesn't seem to be getting any audio at all.\n\nI have updated to the latest version and reverted to the original pre-installed version - to no avail.\n\nWould appreciate some advice on how to get this working with the internal mic.\n\nThanks in advance.",
