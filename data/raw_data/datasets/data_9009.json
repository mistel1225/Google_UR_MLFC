Phone has lived inside a case since Day 1.\n\nGoogle rep \"MJ\" thinks it is a non issue by saying \"It is a cosmetic damage since it just appeared suddenly\".\n\nHow can a part of the phone that's never been exposed be cosmetically damaged?\n\nMJ has also denied request for escalating this matter.\n\nDo I need to go to court to get this manufacturing defect resolved?",
