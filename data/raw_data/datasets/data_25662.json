    "title": "Google Pixel 2 - ERROR: Slot Unbootable: Load Error",
    "content": "Yesterday my Google Pixel2 suddenly reboot & then stuck in screen with android logo with option \"Start\", \"Recovery Mode\", \"Barcode\", \"Power Off\" whereby all function doesn't work except for \"Power Off\". In the screen it indicated \"ERROR: Slot Unbootable: Load Error\"\n\nI suspect there was an auto-update that had cause this sudden reboot. I tried various ways to reboot but nothing works. When i plug in USB to phone on my laptop, it was not detected and when you right-click on the USB icon to eject, it shows \"Eject Android\"- when i eject, it shows \"Android bootloader interface removed\". If i check in DeviceManager on Microsoft Windows, the Pixel2 wasn't really detected.\n\nIt would be a great help if you can guide me to solve this as I really love this phone and hope i could fix this.\nThanks in advance & have a great day ahead :)",
