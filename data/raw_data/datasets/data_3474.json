It then shows be a dead android figure with the text \"No command\"\n\nTried holding power button and volume down. It then opens Fastboot mode. I've tried all options:\n- BarCode\n- Rescue Mode\n- Recovery Mode\n- Restart Bootloader\n- Start\n- Power off\n\nAgain, I'm seeing the \"no command\" screen or the \"G \" logo with a bar that seems to be loading but isn't actually loading.\n\nWhat can I do?",
