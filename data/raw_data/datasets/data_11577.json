    "title": "How to change order of MediaPlayer widget when more than media player card is open",
    "content": "The feature of having multiple media cards open at once with the MediaPlayer control that lives in the quick settings is great. However, when I pause and resume from a set of Bluetooth headphones, it does not pick the most recent app. \n\nFor instance, I often have an audiobook app and podcast app in the background. If I am listening to the podcast app and pause it, when I resume it starts playing the audiobook app. The only way I can get around this is by closing out the audiobook. I love the feature but it is inconvenient if you have to take out the phone and do multiple actions every time you pause and resume. \n\nNot certain if there is a setting or something that I am missing on this. Thanks in advance for any help!",
