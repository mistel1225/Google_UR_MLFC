    "content": "I had the Android 11 beta, and Bubble were working fine and I loved them, especially in Facebook Messenger. It seems like they randomly went away, and I dont know if its a Messenger problem, or an adroid issue. \n\nIs there any way to force bubbles back, or is it just facebook being crap? It seems like it may be thanks to them, but it doesnt make much sense since they did have them. \n\nAny help would be awesome.",
