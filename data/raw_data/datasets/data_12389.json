    "content": "I was hoping for a full screen, but instead, google made a giant notch (notification bar).\nThe size of the notification is similar to Pixel 3's notch.\n\nExcept for the home screen and setting, I'm getting a really small screen on every app. Even on Chrome. At this point, I'm wondering why did you guys choose to have a punch hole front-facing camera?\n\nI was hoping I could fix it through adb; overscan feature.\nBut found out that you guys have disabled it as it wasn't being used...??\n\nPlz give us option to reduce the notification size and option to remove the gesture bar. Those just makes the screen smaller.",
