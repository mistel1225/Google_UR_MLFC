    "content": "2 days ago my Pixel 3a stopped working for calls and mobile data. The SIM card works in all other phones. Also tried with another SIM from a different carrier that is not working. I have tried everything I can find for hours including resetting network settings, restarting, selecting network myself and everything else I could find so finally tried factory reset which just made me loose a lot of settings and info but did not solve the problem. \n\nI see this has been a problem for many before and cannot find any solution online that works or possibility to contact Google so wanted to have a last try here.",
