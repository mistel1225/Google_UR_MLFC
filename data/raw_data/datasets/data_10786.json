    "content": "Hi thank you so much for any help I'm at the end of my rope. During a phone conversation my phone just goes dead The person on the other side can hear me but I cannot hear them. If I hang up to try to call them back there is no dial tone It's completely quiet if I wait several minutes then I can call back. At this point I've contacted T-Mobile they updated my SIMs card as they said it was quite old they thought that might help it did not. I contacted T-Mobile once again they factory reset the phone. The problem still persist. My phone is just 1-year-old. The warranty ran out in July I still owe on it very frustrated please help.",
