    "content": "I recently turned in mfa on my office 365 account which hosts my primary email address. I can add the account to the pixel just fine and I can log in. However if I switch to another application and go back to Gmail I get no emails. If I switch to the Gmail account and then go to the o365, I get a list.\n\nAny suggestions on how to fix?",
