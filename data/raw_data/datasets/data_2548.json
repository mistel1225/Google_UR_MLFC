    "content": "I'd love to know if it's possible to switch from viewing your open apps as a horizontal carousel to maybe viewing them as a vertical list (like the Pixel 2 had) or a grid view.\n\nPretty much anything but a horizontal carousel would be awesome.\n\nIs this possible with the Pixel 5? If so, how would I do it?\n\nThank you in advance!",
