    "content": "Hello guys!\n\nSo lately I was starting to have issues with my phone and this time specially with notifications. The problem started by when I was connected to Wifi and realized that I was getting either no notifications or very delayed notifications, etc if I get a message through Whatsapp, You can see the senders timestamp and sometimes it can be many minutes late o even not getting at all.\n\nSo I tried to change to 4G network and I did get instant notifications everytime. So it is something wrong between Wifi and Notifications.\n\nWhat I tried was to reboot the phone and no luck, tried even in safe mode and still no luck.\nTried to reset Router and still no luck. I am also running latest android Q beta but this worked fine until few days ago.\n\nWhat should I do?",
