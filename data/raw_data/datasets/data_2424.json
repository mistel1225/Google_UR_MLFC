    "content": "I've spent 5 days in Google Fi Hell. Why they sent me there I don't know, I am on Verizon. \n\nMy phone is showing no updates, even though the April and May updates have been released. Support wanted me to download the non-existent 12 beta and kept pushing me to do so even when the link he sent said there was not beta.\n\nAnyway, I want to get the updates, both for security and the updates that were in the April update. But it appears that Google is not going to be any help. So I came here. Is there any way to force the update, without having to reset my phone.\n\nStay Home - Stay Safe\nSteve",
