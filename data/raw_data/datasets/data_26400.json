    "content": "The android system of my google pixel 3 is not able to run, and it starts rebooting many times on it own and I tried restart in recovery mode etc but it doesnt help at all so I chose to format to factory settings, and now it requires me to connect to wifi to setup the phone. Yet, I am now on business trip in china and without connecting to vpn it is not able to connect my pixel to google to finish the setup.  I tried to connect with hotspot with vpn, wifi with vpn already etc. or sim with chinese network/germamy sim and none of them works and I basically cannot use my phone at all. \n\nI basically got stuck into the wifi setup page and not able to access the phone settings at all so I can not download VPN or any other procedure.\n\nWhat can I do? please help",
