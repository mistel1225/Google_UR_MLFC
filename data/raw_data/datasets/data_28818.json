    "title": "Can my screen be replaced under warranty?",
    "content": "Screen burn-in became apparent several months ago, it has progressively gotten worse - making the sections of the screen normally used by the on-screen buttons and status bar nearly useless for watching videos and it can be quite distracting for reading text. \n\nA more pressing issue, however, is that the phone screen is not nearly as bright as it used to be. I first noticed this when a friend and I were comparing his new Pixel 2 XL to my 18 month old Pixel 2 XL, my screen at 100% brightness was matching his at less than 75% brightness. This issue has gotten worse as in the past weeks it has become quite hard to see the phone outside - even under conditions where I was able to view fine in the past. \n\nI have spent the past hour going through the Google Pixel Phone Help pages looking for a way to file a claim, speak to a representative, or even check my specific phone's current warranty status, however, this is the closest I have come to being able to do any of that. \n\nSo, for starters, I need to know if this is covered in the 2-year warranty of the Pixel 2 XL, and how I go about filing a warranty claim for it. \n\nThank you for your time and support.",
