    "content": "Hi. I'm using a Google pixel 2 XL and I would to give feedback about this device. Since I upgraded to Android 10 everything is problematic. Since last week apps like phone, messages and the Pixel launcher are mostly not responding and when I succeed in opening them, they freeze and the phone eventually turns off. It also has the problem of crashing the whole system (system UI has stopped) and then turns off or the skin goes blank and eventually turns off. I have upgraded to everything made available by Google & updated the apps on play store but nothing really helps.. The enjoy of the phone as Pixel has diminished and today sound output devices on the phone are not giving out any sound. I can't play videod, musicâ€¦ worst part is I can't take calls, if I do, it freezes and turns off but it's never fixed, for two days now, the same thing has been happening over and over and I've ran out of options. Please help me to bring to life my precious phone.",
