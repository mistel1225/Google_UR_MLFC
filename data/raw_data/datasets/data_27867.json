    "content": "I just updated all my apps and freed up some space in my storage and plugged my phone into the charger, I also updated the phone itself before updating the apps and clearing the storage, it seems fine right now. I just don't want this to happen again. I'm a college student, I rely on my phone so much. With this happening, I feel like I can't depend on it the way I need to.",
