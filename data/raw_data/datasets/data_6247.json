    "content": "I've been having this problem for several months now. What happens is that the phone remains connected to wifi with a strong signal (I'm sitting beside it) but network speeds drop to zero.\n\nThe problem doesn't affect my wife's Pixel 3 or our two Macs so we can rule out router failure.\n\nDisconnecting from/reconnecting to wifi resolves the problem but only for a few minutes.\n\nI've tried the following fixes to no avail:\n\n1. Forget / readd wifi network\n2. Reboot phone / router\n3. Reset network settings\n4. Set Google DNS servers\n5. Disabled Google Location Accuracy\n6. Factory reset phone\n\nHelp.",
