    "content": "Hello,\n\nI would like to know how the sharing menu selects the contacts that should appear?\n\nI ask this because the chosen contacts are not relevant to me because they are people I do not have much contact with.\n\nWhy for example my wife does not appear in this menu? It's with her that I communicate the most every day, it would be more relevant to me. At first she appeared and was in first position and one day she disappeared ...\n\nFor information, I use Google Messages to communicate.",
