    "title": "Home and back buttons stops to work, 2 nav gesture (pills)",
    "content": "I'm reopening this question about the problems with the 2 buttons gestures/pills or in any way you want to call, because the previous was closed without solution (https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/79782631?hl=en) and on the bugtracker (https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/171369792) someone from google closed the bug as POSSIBLE duplicate because i have to write here, where nobody replied to me about!!!\n\nThe problem after 6 months is still here. The back and home buttons stops to work, using 2 buttons navigation bar, every time i switch from 2 apps using the slide gesture. In the bug tracker there is a video, which is more than explanatory. In addiction, since the 01/2021 patch, the back button randomly starts in loop to reopen apps instead of go back, closing app and go home.\nI tried safe mode, a factory reset, switch from the differents navigations system and then re set the 2 buttons navigation, but nothing solve the problem.\n\nThere is a possible way that someone from google can consider this bug to solve it??? \n\nHow many times i have to open this question? If I open it every day, is there any hope that at least someone from google will show up, if only to ban me? Or do I have to go directly under Larry Page or Sergey Brin's house to get support on this cr*p device that sell under the Google brand?\n\nThank you.",
