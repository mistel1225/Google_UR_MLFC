I have a google pixel 3XL and I want to install the beta of android 11 no more to get the most out of having a pixel in my hands for the first time, I have had other android and I want to know if I will have no problem with returning later.  Most of all because according to research before you have to unlock the pixel bootloader to reinstall stock, then I do not know if it can be unlocked or they recommend that I upload to Android 11 by OTA with unlocked bootloader.  I also don't know if it crashes again when uploading to a Stock.  I appreciate the help you can give me.Excuse me bad English but I use google translator",
