    "content": "I purchased phone only a month ago and it's frozen at least 10 times. It never lets me do a factory reset. Phone is unusable, a green box covers the different areas on the phone repeatedly moving through a menu. Problem is I am away from anywhere you can replace this phone for a few months (in Mexico). This phone has been a nightmare. Is there another way to reboot?",
