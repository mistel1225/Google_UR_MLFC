    "content": "I have tried multiple Cables and different charging methods. I am got my phone on Sept 27. I am still covered under warranty. I have gone through all the steps to trouble shoot. My phone is clearly defective. It has been extremely difficult to find a solution for refund/replace/repair. I can't call  google because decided that they aren't gonna give phone support. \nPlease contact me\n\nThank you",
