    "content": "Hello,\nMy google pixel 3A keeps crashing. I have tried everything from rebooting in safe mode and then the same issue happens. I reset to factory settings and it keeps happening. Is there any way to sort it? When it is plugged into a charger it crashes and comes up with the no-charge symbol and then goes to the actual percentage (Say 70%) It is really frustrating me and I need my phone for work. I would appreciate any advice or help. \nBtw, when it is in the bootloader, It never crashes so I am almost certain it is a software issue and not a hardware one. Thanks\nThanks",
