    "content": "Google app or assistant doesn't send my any push notifications. \nI can see all that information in my feed - weather updates, regular routes, my reservations, sport scores. But I don't recieve them as push notifications. All the settings are ON. \nIf I log in with another google account, I begin to recieve all those notifications immediately. So there's an issue with my main account settings.",
