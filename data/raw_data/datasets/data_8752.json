    "content": "How it looks like: I put my phone to terminal and no reaction from shop terminal or phone.\nWhen I rebooted my phone, NFC fixed and I can pay as normal.\nBut If I will pay next day, I'm not sure that I don't need to reboot my phone standing at the checkout in the store.\nI met similar problem on my Pixel 2 phone, but I thought it's my personal device problem(hardware maybe), but now with Pixel 3a I understand that it looks like software issue.",
