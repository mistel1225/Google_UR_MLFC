    "content": "When in a call, if I have an incoming call my Pixel 2 phone it; (A) Does not show an incoming caller and (B) Does not notify me to a missed call unless a voicemail is left, or the caller listens to all of the options of the voicemail and in which case a txt message is sent to me (no one ever waits that long). \n\nI have discussed this with Vodafone (Australia) but no luck. Is this a simple notification change as I believe I have tried most settings. Thank you in advance. JT",
