    "content": "Hi everyone, \nI was surprised when i first used my pixel 5 that no sound was going out from the top speaker when watching videos in landscape mode for instance (youtube)\n\nDoes that happen to anyone else ?\nI ve tested on a pixel 4 and the sound is just more balanced since coming from both sides of the screen...\n\nAll up to latest updates, including Android.\n\nHope some can help üòÅ\n\nThanks everyone",
