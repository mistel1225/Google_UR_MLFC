    "content": "I have a Purple Panda lavalier mic, which has a standard 35mm audio plug.  When I use it with the Pixel 4a to record video, the sound when played back is very low volume.  If I just use the 4a's internal mic, the sound is much louder.  I get the same results when I listen to the MP4 videos on another device.  How can I raise the external mic's recording volume?",
