    "content": "I have a Pixel 3 XL and my wife has the Pixel 3 and we both have BMWs. Neither one of us are receiving text message notifications and some text messages don't display at all through the vehicle's system, though others do. We previously had Samsung S9s running the most current OS and everything worked great. \nIs there anything that can be done to remedy this issue as holding a mobile device while driving is illegal in our state?\n I have already tried clearing out all devices stored in the vehicles and reconnecting the phone to the vehicle.",
