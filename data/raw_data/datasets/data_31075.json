    "content": "I will be buying a Pixel from the US but instantly travelling to the middle East. In the middle East, we use a type G outlet and since we don't use the ones that the US use, I won't be able.to use the one that comes in the box. I also realized that it's a USB-C to USB-C cable and plugs with USB-Cs are very expensive here. Is there any way to inform in advance and get it with the Type G plus from the US? Thanks!",
