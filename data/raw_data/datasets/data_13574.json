    "content": "Hi. My pixel 2 phone battery goes flat quickly. The touch screen not working properly which results in a 'grabby' screen. Any ideas? Second time in a week this had happened. I did a number of reboots the first time and X it seemed to fix itself, however same not happening this time. Thanks",
