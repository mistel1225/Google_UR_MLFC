    "content": "I started the android 10 update last night around 7. I woke up around 6 (so almost 11 hours) and it was still updating. I had it past the install and had restarted it, and it was stuck like that for at least 10.5 of the 11 hours. I held the power button to restart, and it shut off. Now, when I try to restart it the battery icon pops up for a second then the download bar (the same as when it restarted, but it's just the bar, no logos or anything and everything else is black) appears and disappears almost instantly. I've been trying to restart in safe mode but have had no luck. Any ideas on  what to do?",
