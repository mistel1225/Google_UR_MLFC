    "content": "Taking a look at some of my recent footage I noticed that the videos filmed in 60fps looked far worse than the videos filmed in 30fps. The 60fps videos were incredibly pixelated and looked like they were in 480p. The person I spoke to at google insisted it wasn't a known bug so I'm thinking I was given a phone with a broken camera that can't film 60fps at 1080p properly. Anyone else had this problem?",
