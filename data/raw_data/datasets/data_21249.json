    "content": "I had connected with my physician via Zoom to start a meeting.  I briefly saw myself and him on the screen, then video went off.  Audio continued, but a line on the screen said video had stopped.  At the very top of the screen a red banner said Driver Mode.  I may not have the exact wording correct as I was trying to talk to my doctor at the time, and as soon as we signed off, the screen messages went away.  \n\nI had Driver Mode turned off and did nothing to turn it on that I know of.  I was sitting in my car at the time but have never paired the car with the phone and have no interest in doing so.\n\nSince I was using the Zoom app, per the doctor's requirement, I can not tell if this is something that app could have done.  I also don't know if the Driver Mode was actually on or was responsible for the turning off of the video.  I only know I didn't access or turn on Driver Mode, nor did I turn video off.  Any ideas?",
