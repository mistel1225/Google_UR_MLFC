    "content": "So I've tried everything to fix the buzzing sound from the mic when recording audio or video but it just won't work. Please help to fix this issue. I'm pretty sure this is a software problem but sadly the default apps like camera, recording and google meet were the ones that suffer from this problem. I record simple music a lot with my phone and it was too major to just let it be. If nothing can be done then I'm changing my phone. So disappointed that a flagship phone can have problem like this.",
