    "content": "Hey,\n\nI recently switched from iPhone to Pixel (finally). The thing is that I never did a WhatsApp backup on my iPhone, so when I first launched WhatsApp on the Pixel, no Restore option was given. During the follwoing days, I received some messages, and therefore WhatsApp created backups on my Pixel (both Drive and in files). \n\nI then decided to restore my chats on the Pixel, so I did a backup on the iPhone, deleted backups from Drive and Files, and reinstalled WA on the Pixel. It now offers a Restore option, but proposes the Pixel (deleted) backups instead of the iPhone one...\n\nI know I should not post this in the Google Pixel Community, but I already looked on most forums and websites for a solution, without any result).\n\nThx!",
