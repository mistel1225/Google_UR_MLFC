    "content": "Examples: https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZYbU82GVz4 and https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=lUarB-sgC00\n\nWhen listening at volumes you'd listen to when trying to sleep the vibration and buzz is audible at distance when it's quiet.\n\nIs this just my device or the same for everyone with the Pixel 3XL even after the update? \n\nQuite the opposite of relaxing and stress relief I must say!",
