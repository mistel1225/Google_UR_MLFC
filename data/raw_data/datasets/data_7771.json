    "content": "SIM card invalid having worked for first two weeks.  \n\n- Pixel 4 unlocked, five months old;\n- Used Optus on new phone for first three months.  Changed to Telstra with new SIM.  Worked for two weeks and then says invalid, emergency calls only;\n- Occasionally the SIM works for about an hour;\n- Telstra SIM works in another phone;\n- Telstra service verified SIM card is operating correctly;\n- An Optus SIM works in my phone;\n- SIM and slot inspected, cleaned.  Cache cleared.  Factory reset, still no good.  \n- Unable to manually connect to a network in settings since SIM is not detected.\n\nAppears to be a phone issue connecting to Telstra.  Any advice please?",
