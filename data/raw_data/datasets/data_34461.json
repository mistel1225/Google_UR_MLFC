    "content": "My device is set in hebrew language. Up until the last update, the lock screen notification were centralized. After the last operating system update (now I'm on Android 9 and build PQ2A.190205.002), the lock screen notifications moved to the right side of the screen. If I change to any other language, it comes back to the center. Someone has any idea if this can be changed?",
