    "content": "I'm trying to connect my Pixel Stand to my Pixel 3a. The thing is, the stand doesn't appear in the list of Connected Devices when I place the phone on it. I put it on without a case. I've tried rotating the phone. Making sure it's balanced. The whole bit as the community suggests. Bluetooth is definitely on; it's connected to my smartwatch and whenever I use my ear buds.\n\nI restarted the phone, even while it sits on the stand. I have only used the equipment that came with the stand. I bought the stand and phone within the past week, so I haven't had much time to do anything to the phone, in my opinion, that could alter (somehow!?) the compatibility with the stand.\n\nMaybe I just have a defective stand. The outlet that I use works fine with anything else I plug into it.\n\nLet's see...what else...oh, right. I made it so nothing else is connected to my phone via bluetooth. Stand still doesn't show up. That's my whole thing: The stand doesn't appear, so I can't even tell you if the phone will charge or not. It doesn't charge, for what it's worth. I would have been cool if the phone didn't \"see\" the stand, but still responded by charging. But, nothing.\n\nLike I said, I just bought the stand, so it won't be a problem returning it. But, I wanted to ask to see if I missed something before I give up.\n\nThanks!",
