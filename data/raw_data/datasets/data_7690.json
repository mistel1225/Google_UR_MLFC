    "content": "Hi all,\nI recently flashed my Pixel 3a XL using stock image and Android Flash Tool from https://developers.google.com/android/images \n\nBefore I flashed my phone, there's nothing wrong when I took photos. But after I flashed it, I found it weird that even though I'm not tilted, the camera app says I'm tilted. If I tilt the phone, it says I'm not tilted.\n\n\n\nAnd I also use the \"bubble level\" tool in Google search, it shows my phone is tilted even if I put it on the ground.\n\n\nSo far I have already tried reboot, reboot into safe mode, uninstall camera app update and reinstall the update, none of them fix the issue. I also contacted Google support and they can't fix it.\n\nHow can I get it fixed ?",
