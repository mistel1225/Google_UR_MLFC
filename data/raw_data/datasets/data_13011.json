    "content": "Hi\n\nThe new app opening animations are causing my phone to lag, does anyone have a fix or way to disable them?\n\nPixel 2XL\n\nEdit: I found the way to disable them (just search for \"animations\" in settings), however this only feels like a band-aid not a proper fix as now it feels \"weird\" (I didn't have a better adjective)\n\nThanks",
