    "content": "I have tried starting in the bootloader mode by holding the volume down button and then connecting a pwoer cable. This starts the phone, but then I cannot select any of the start up options because it requires using the power button. Once in this mode, all I can do is wait for the battery to drain so the phone shuts down. Is there a way to fix the power button or to turn on the phone in a different manner?",
