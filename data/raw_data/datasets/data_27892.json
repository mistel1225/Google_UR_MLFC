    "title": "\"Note to Self\" feature not saving notes in default app when using Assistant",
    "content": "When I type \"Note to Self\" in the google search bar on my Pixel 3 XL, a card is pulled up where I can write a note and it is saved in my specified note-taking app (MyLifeOrganized). \n\nBut...\n\nWhen I use Google Assistant to save a note, by saying \"OK Google\", then, \"Note to Self...,\" the Assistant saves the note in some default Google notes app (one that allows you to save \"Lists\" and \"Notes\"). I don't seem to be able to change the default note-taking app used with the Google Assistant interface. \n\nHelp would be appreciated!",
