    "content": "I've recently had to factory reset my Pixel 3 as it was having some issues, I've logged into my account and everything has restored. I open chrome and the default search is google.com and I want Google.co.uk. I've checked location and settings on the phone and everything is UK. I can't add it or change it, any straight forward suggestions would be gratefully received as I'm losing patience with the Pixel 3 very quickly.",
