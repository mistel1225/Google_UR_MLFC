    "content": "Hi, I have a new Pixel 3a.  Randomly the screen does not allow any touches.  I have to reboot the phone.  I have tried a reset and it still is happening.  I can restart the phone (power button for 30 seconds) and it will work.  The fingerprint reader works along with google assistant when this happens, but I cannot select anything on the screen.  It is happening 1-3 times a day.Any ideas?",
