    "title": "Pixel 5 went into \"G\" screen for no apparent reason.",
    "content": "Got my new Pixel 5 three days ago and setup went fine.   Today I took it out of my pocket (so I wasn't trying to do anything on the phone at all) and it had a black screen with the google \"G\" in the middle of it and a small, looping, bar beneath this \"G\".  Left it for 30 mins, but no change.  Powered off and on several times but each time it got stuck  at the \"G\".  Did internet search, and found method for factory reset using various steps involving power and volume button.  Had to go through the whole setup of phone again.  To note:  On the day after I set the phone up, I did the latest update for android 11 as recommended by automatic notification on the phone.  Don't know if that was a factor.  Just adding this to the forum in hope that Google's reps and support people are aware.  If this happens again I'm afraid I will be wanting to send the phone back to Google store for a replacement.   A bit of a disappointment as I'm really pleased with the style, shape and everything else about the phone.    Should I not do the android 11 update?\n\nRegards",
