    "content": "My Pixel 3 after 3 min under water got wet inside and stopped working. IP68  guarantees protection in water up to 1.5m deep for half an hour. While filling warranty claim form i checked option \"liquid exposure\" and i get info that manufacturerâ€™s warranty didn't cover it. Is this phone waterproof or not?",
