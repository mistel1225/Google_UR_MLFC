    "content": "Everything works between my Pixel3 and Chromecast except for videos from Chrome. When I do cast a video from chrome it's just loading forever on my TV. All other apps cast videos just fine.\n\n- Pixel 3 is Android 10\n- Chromecast Ultra\n- Casting chrome videos from a laptop works fine so it's not a Chromecast issue.",
