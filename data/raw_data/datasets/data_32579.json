    "content": "Migrate data from previous phone is even worse than I thought! It just copies the APPs without the data and settings. Honestly Google? It's 2019!\nMost apps where copied but all lost its settings and data! All logins, settings are lost!\nI must have been braindead when I went for a Google phone spending so much money.\nDo I really have to root the phone to get a possibility to backup and restore my stuff?",
