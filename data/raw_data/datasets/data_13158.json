    "content": "Few days ago I noticed that my pixel2 was supporting Wifi Calling over my Jio Carrier. I didn't made any changes in the setting or enable the wifi calling, it automaticalling turned onn. But after 2-3 days there was no longer wifi calling available on the phone. I tried google support but they said to contact the carrier. Time to switch from pixel to any other device.",
