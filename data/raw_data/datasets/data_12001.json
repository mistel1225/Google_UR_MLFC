    "content": "My phone keeps attempting to charge everything it is plugging into , including external hard drives. I have no access to turn feature off. It also caused so many issues transferring media and information from old phone , every time i plugged it in the old phone (note 8) shut off and started charging. Is there a way to Manually turn Battery Share off and not affect the rest of the phone performance?.. it's really annoying",
