    "content": "My Pixel 3 has developed an intermittent fault whereby I am unable to hear the person speaking during voice calls and the person on the other end is unable to hear me. When it occurs it is an issue in both handset mode and speaker mode. It's also worth noting that when the issues happens I am unable to hear the ring sound when calling someone. I have also noticed the same fault in other apps that have voice call functionality such as WhatsApp. In order for calls to start working again I have to restart my phone.\n\nMy phone has the latest updates installed and below are the steps I have already tried.\nFactory reset\nClear cache on the phone up\nClear data on the phone app\nUninstall updates on the phone app\n\nDespite following the above steps I still have this issue as a daily occurrence",
