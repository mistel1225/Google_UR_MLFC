    "content": "I accidentally deactivated my Google maps app and now can't get it to reappear. I have tried getting help via chat and they had me uninstall and reupload the app and reset my app preferences and delete my cache and restart my phone and none of these things have worked. The only way to access Google Maps currently is to go to settings-apps and notifications- see all apps- maps. Please help me get the icon back on my home screen with all my other icons. Thank you!",
