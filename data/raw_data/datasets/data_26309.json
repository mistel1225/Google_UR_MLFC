    "content": "Hi,\n\nI have been using the original pixel charger and cable since purchase. However, the battery has dramatically worsened the past few weeks. Recently, it has been significantly poorer (lasting half the time) and sometimes doesn't charge. I am currently traveling abroad for a few months and access to a good smartphone camera is important. I have read the help forums and nothing helps. The problem persists and is a major issue. \n\nHave tried help centre chat but isn't available.\n\nWould greatly appreciate your help with this. \n\nMany thanks in advance.",
