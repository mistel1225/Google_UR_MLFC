    "content": "Today a few apps I use every day keep crashing on launch. It started with slickdeals. I uninstalled then reinstalled it, which prompted me to verify my identity by clicking a link in my email. I opened up Yahoo mail and the same thing happened. Opened it, white screen for a second, then crash. This happened with Amazon and another app as well. If I uninstall and reinstall it will open once or twice, but then just crash. I've stopped the apps, cleared your cache, etc. I've restarted there phone but still it's happening. Anyone else having this issue?",
