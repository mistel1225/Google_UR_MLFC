    "title": "Pixel 4 no audio with voicemail",
    "content": "I have a Pixel 4 with Sprint service.  About 2 months ago, the Visual Voicemail stopped having audio.  Wouldn't play voicemails from the Visual Voicemail app over bluetooth, speaker or the regular phone.  I checked all of the settings, notifications, changed the volume, nothing worked.  I could still get my voicemails by dialing 1 from the phone and calling the carrier voicemail directly.  I switched to YouMail voicemail app to try to correct the problem.  It will play voicemail via speaker but not over the phone. I also can't hear the outgoing message over the phone, only over the speaker.  Doesn't matter what the volume settings are, and I have checked all of the permissions.",
