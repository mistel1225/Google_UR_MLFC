    "title": "Built-In Screen Recorder Randomly Stops Recording?",
    "content": "I make youtube video about video games, and when the android 11 update came out, I switched to the built-in screen recorder because it made higher-quality videos. However, I seem to be having a constant problem where the recordings will randomly stop. Today it stopped at 14:25, yesterday it stopped at 11:38. It happens just about every time I record, though normally after the 10 minute mark. There isn't any indication that it stopped either, I continue doing what I'm doing, then go to stop the recording to find it already had stopped minutes prior. I still have a ton of free space on my phone, so I have no clue what could be causing this.\n\nHas anyone encountered a similar issue or know a fix?",
