    "content": "I have multiple email accounts and previously when I had unread email there was a number next to that account (when I click the account bubble at the top right). That has disappeared unless I back out, pull down to refresh them go back in. It's been about a week. \nI don't think I changed any settings sommust be the last update. Anyone know what setting I need to adjust to fix this?",
