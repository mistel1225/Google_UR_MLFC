    "content": "My phone died last night. I charged it and turned it on and everything seemed normal until i entered my unlock pattern. The screen went black except for the top notification bar. Then it immediately sent me back to the lock screen and requested my pattern again. I entered the pattern again to the same result. Boot says console is off and device is locked.",
