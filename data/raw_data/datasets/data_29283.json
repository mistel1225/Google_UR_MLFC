    "content": "Several times a day my phone will become unresponsive to the power buttons / freeze. Each time I have performed a hard reset, I'm about to restore factory settings to see if this resolves the issue. However, I noticed that the phone becomes responsive again if I plug it into a power source. I've been looking around forums and seeing lots of people with this problem, not sure if this would help google resolve the issue faster. I love the phone otherwise but these issues are driving me crazy.",
