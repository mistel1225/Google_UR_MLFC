    "content": "Hello friends, \n\nMy year-old Pixel 3, successfully running in the past with an eSIM connected to Google Fi, popped up with a \"No SIM Card\" message five days ago. I show no Mobile Network available. Before chatting with a tech I tried everything from a restart in Safe Mode to a factory reset. I also tried the suggested advice found in this community to use the dialer (*#*#4636#*#*) to get to the Network Settings, but my choices on the Phone Information drop down menu differed from those cited by original poster Brandon Dendinger. I spent two hours chatting with a tech the first night of the problem, and we additionally ran through all the app permissions. I was then told my ticket would be escalated, and I should hear from a \"specialist\" in 72 hours. I'm now at 120 hours and no further along in resolving this problem. I have checked back in twice,  and each time I was told a specialist would get back to me \"at the earliest.\" (Such a polite phrase from the playbook that says absolutely nothing.) I get the impression that after you have been \"escalated,\" no one else can touch the issue or offer other solutions. If anyone here has a suggestion or advice that I might have missed, I would be appreciative to hear from you.",
