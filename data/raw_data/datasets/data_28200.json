    "content": "On some incoming calls, the native phone app is hidden by a redish screen as shown below.  If the call requires any input, the keypad cannot be activated without pressing on this screen 5-10 times.  Often by that time, the caller hangs up.\n\nHas anyone seen this screen?  I cannot find an app on the phone that has this type of display.  Any assistance would be appreciated.",
