    "content": "My Pixel 2 XL (already updated to Android 10) suddenly rebooting itself repeteadly. At one point, it refuse to enter the OS, stuck at the G logo & bootlooping endlessly (https://twitter.com/overlord_666/status/1173526827362476032). After sometime, I figure maybe if I do factory reset/wipe, the problem will go away. So, I did that. No, the problem is still there. Next, I try to flash using the sideload OTA method. Still bootlooping.\n\nAfter that, I tried to let it bootlooping unitl the battery died out & pop out the sim. After a full charge, reboot into recovery, wipe clean & reboot back. This time, it can enter the OS & the initial setup. But instead of rebooting at the go, my phone reboot randomly. Sometime it took after 2 hours of uptime for it to reboot, sometime it's 4. It still happens & this time, I don't even install any other apps :-(\n\nAny advice?",
