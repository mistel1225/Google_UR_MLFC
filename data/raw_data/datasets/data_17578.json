    "content": "Before the videos shot on my Pixel 3a run properly in any media player on my desktop computer I have to convert them to AVI.  The original mp4 videos run fine on the phone and also when I upload them directly to Google Drive or Photos.  I don't have this conversion issue with my Nexus tablet or my wife's Moto G phone.  It's a fix but it's one more step that I'd rather not have to do each time.  Any ideas?",
