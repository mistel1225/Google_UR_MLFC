    "content": "We use Rackspace at work and I have their tech support number in my phone as the contact \"Rackspace\". It is the only Rackspace number in my phone, but when I use google assistant and say \"Call Rackspace\" it calls a totally different number that is their Sales department. Why will it not call the Rackspace in my Contacts first? I have to go and find that contact each time I call them, which takes away the awesome feature of hands free calling.",
