    "content": "I've purchased a new Google Pixel 3a and for some reason Android Auto won't load on my car system. I have a Vauxhall Adam 66 plate which is completely compatible and it happily loads my work iPhone and my old One Plus 5 but not my new Google phone. The Bluetooth is fine. \n\nThe cable that came with the phone is USB C but my car needs USB A so I have been using my old One Plus 5 cable to connect the devices, but when I do the phone only connects as a charge mode. Ice go e to developer options and put on the USB debugging as recommended in other posts but still nothing :(\n\nIt's Â£20 for a new Google USB C to USB A cable and I don't want to by it without 100% knowing it will work.\n\nAnyone have any experience or advice?",
