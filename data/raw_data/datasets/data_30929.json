    "title": "For 2 years, my Google Pixel GPS worked great. But in the last few months, the GPS does not work.",
    "content": "Let's say I want to go to Target. in Google Maps I put in Target. Google Maps finds Target. Click directions. GPS finds me and calculates directions. It's all working right up to here. But then I start driving. The Pixel immediately starts \"searching for GPS\". It never locks back onto GPS. If I pull over, stop the directions, and then put in Target again, then it knows exactly where I am now. Start moving, and it goes right into \"searching for GPS\".\n\nSame thing happens in Waze, so I know it is the Pixel GPS and not the Maps app. I've rebooted the phone, restored to factory settings, deleted and reinstalled Google Maps and Waze. Any other ideas?",
