    "content": "I can't seem to get Google support for my new Google Pixel Buds?\n\nGoogle's app, Sound Amplifier, has an email address on the Play store\nfor support.  That email address does not work!   The reply I got was:\n\"You have emailed to an address that is no longer being monitored.\nTo get help, please visit https://support.google.com/.\"\nHowever, Support does not know how to address these issues.\n\nToday I just got a new pair of Google Pixel Buds from Google, to use with my Pixel 3 XL Android.\n\nAt my age of 79, it is common for high frequencies to drop, so I was hoping that the new Pixel Buds together with my Pixel 3 XL might help \"punch up\" these frequencies.  I have already tried  your using Google Sound Amplifier Sound and the Accessibility options (including the Google  Accessibility Scanner), but they only provide a sketch of how I might modify sounds?\n\nI also am trying the Bass Booster Pro  app, and I would like feedback on the settings, to see if I am reasonably addressing my problem on both apps?  Google support recommended that I add an equalizer app to Sound Amplifier?\n\nThe basic problem is that although Sound Amplifier has a setting for \"Sound around you\", this does not work very well at all and all sounds are muffled by the buds.\n\nI also have tinnitus which I know makes it more difficult to address these issues.\n\nIf I can't get support, I'll just return the buds.",
