    "content": "just updated my 3a, and the wife's Pixel 2, to Android 10. Installation went Ok and no significant issues have appeared so far (which is always welcome).\n\nA couple of questions though - I thought that gestures, by default, would replace the home and back buttons? On my 3a I originally had 3 buttons but now have two (and gestures don't seem to do anything different), on my wife's phone she still has 3 buttons and again gestures don't seem to do anything new.\n\nDark Mode - Brilliant!! However I thought that if I changed the phone to dark mode, all Google apps also adopted dark mode? Google Play, Home and assistant don't have dark mode nor You Tube (unless you go into the app settings).\n\nOne feature I cannot find is to apply restrictions to the behaviour of certain apps in relation to quiet periods. What I want to do for a couple of apps is stop them notifying me of activity during the night. I can use Do not Disturb, but this is global or at night time I can go to each app and turn off notifications. Is this feature not available or is it hidden somewhere?",
