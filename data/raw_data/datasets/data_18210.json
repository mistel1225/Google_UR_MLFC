    "content": "Yesterday, face unlock on my pixel 4 suddenly started failing. After several attempts to diagnose the issue including restarting, cache clearing and modification of other security settings, I finally decided to delete face data and re-enrol. I keep getting the error  'enrolment was not completed face enrolment didn't work\". \n\nNot sure what else to do. I'm on the Android 11 August Beta and on the August 5 security update and June 1st Google Play System update.\n\nI'm currently in Lagos, Nigeria",
