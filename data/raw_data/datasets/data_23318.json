    "content": "When I start the Bedtime routine after putting my 3 on the Pixel Stand, it says \"Good night, Hiker2099.\" This disturbs my wife who is already asleep. I need to set my alarm at that point, but don't want the audible \"Good night, Hiker 2099.\" The phone is in Do Not Disturb mode when I put it on the Stand, yet it says the \"Good night\" every time.",
