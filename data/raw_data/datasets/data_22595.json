    "content": "I was watching YouTube then my screen froze and wouldn't turn off or even play audio. In the morning I tried to turn it on but it would just vibrate, so I then charged it and attempted to turn on again it just shows a batterybar sideways with a plug in the middle and red bar. I can't charge my phone or turn on I just want my old picture from it and text.",
