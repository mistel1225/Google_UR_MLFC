    "title": "Since the February Security update my phone will not charge w/out changing the UBS connect preferenc",
    "content": "When I plug my phone in (even using the original cord and brick) the phone will not charge.   I noted a \"P\" in the alerts area and pulled the menu down (Note: i have not seen this since the first time)  the alert read \"Android System: Charging connected device via USB\"; when i tapped it for more info, another line appeared, \"Tap for more options\"; \nIt then brings me to the USB Preferences and i need to change \"USB controlled by:\" and the select \"this device\"\n\nFor the record, i have worked with chat and called in.  Chat recommended that I bring my phone in or send it in and pay for repair or upgrade.\n\nChat advised the only next step was to Factory Reset, something I would have prefer to avoid at all cost.",
