    "content": "For the past 2 weeks, my phone USB C jack is not working. It will not connect to my headphones or my aux cord. I purchased 2 new aux cords and a new dongle and nothing  has worked. It will only work with my charger. I tried to get it fixed at my carrier's store but they didn't do anything and it is impossible to contact anyone for help. I believe this device is defective and I need help fixing it. I have only had this phone for a year.",
