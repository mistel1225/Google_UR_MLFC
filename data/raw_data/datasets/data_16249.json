    "title": "Pixel 3: Music stops playing after June security update",
    "content": "I tried multiple apps, but m4a Audio files play but I cannot hear the music. Sometimes the first song I can hear, but for the second it disappears again. This started after the June security update.\nWhen I enable this live caption option I here the music again, but as soon as the screen turns off the music is gone again. \nAll the time the progress bar of the music apps still are saying it's playing. \nI used the player called Ezplayer, but another music player shows the same behavior. Something got screwed up in the audio system\n\nNotifications and other sounds seem unaffected. And why does this not happen with mp3 files?",
