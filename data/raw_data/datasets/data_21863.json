    "content": "pixel 3 shuts down while charging. also shutting down (after multiple restarts) after taking the phone off charge; finally stabilizes.\nI tried safe mode, factory reset - continues to have the same issue.\nI had contacted Fi support about this issue within the first year of buying the phone, but the troubleshooting process/back and forth with support took the phone out of warranty time. \nNow Google is denying warranty even though I contacted them within the first year about this issue.\nHas anyone faced this terrible customer service? And is there any resolution? How can Google not stand by their product?",
