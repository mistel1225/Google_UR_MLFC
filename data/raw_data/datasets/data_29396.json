    "content": "I'm facing a recent issue with my pixel xl 2 battery life. I've checked the battery usage and everything and calculated the percentage I've spent on apps, and I noticed that 23% of my battery life was leaked. I should have 23% more battery percentage according to my usage. Even when it's full charged and I set my phone aside without any use, and all apps in the background are cleared. I notice that the battery percentage is going down. I used to love how good my phone battery was.. but I have no idea what's going on with it now. I wish if I can find a solution.",
