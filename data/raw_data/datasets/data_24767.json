    "content": "In the last few weeks (likely since an update), I noticed my phone does not route Calls or Texts over WiFi Anymore. It's a 2 XL that I bought off contract from Google back in 2017. The feature use to work just fine. My friend has a Pixel 2 he got from verizon and the feature still works fine, and both phones are up to date software wise. Called verizon this morning and there werent any network issues identified on there end. What is wrong with this phone? I have tried rebooting, airplane mode, and reset network settings.",
