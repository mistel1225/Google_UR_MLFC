    "content": "Last night my phone ran out of battery, and ever since, I have tried to do everything to fix it,  from resetting the phone, setting it to safe mode, to factory resetting it, and I still get the same problem. When the phone powers on, it says \"System UI not responding\" with the options \"Close\" and \"Wait\". pressing close shuts off the phone for a second but when I open calls, youtube, and spotify, no sound comes out still. pressing \"wait\" does nothing. I have now lost all my files because of this issue and because google has a \"backup data\" but not a \"restore data\".",
