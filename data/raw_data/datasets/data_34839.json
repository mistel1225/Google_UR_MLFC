    "content": "I bought a used Google Pixel.  The microphone has stopped working.  A reboot solves the issue but it happens daily.  I'm looking for a long term solution.  When trying to record a video, it says the microphone is being used by another app.  The only 2 apps I gave permission to use the mic was the camera and the phone.",
