    "content": "Dear Google support team\n I bought a Pixel 3 (64gb) on November of 2018 from your official Google store in France. In June 19 it started to have some issues during video recording (like camera shaking) which became worst on September 19. Now the problem is on both camera and video mode. I can see that some people worldwide have the same problem too. I tried to do what you told others to do (uninstall camera updates, uninstall third party apps, start in safe Mode, do a factory reset) but nothing worked out. Please let me know what to do next. \nCan I return it to you and send me another device? Please bear in mind that right now  I don't live in France anymore. I am in Greece and as far as I know you don't have an official Google store here. So in case of sending it back, is it possible to send me another device here?\nBest regard\nBill",
