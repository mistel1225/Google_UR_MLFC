    "content": "I freed up storage by deleting pictures and videos and applications..\nI've looked at usage for storage and memory and battery usage to assess any bad apps and couldn't find any.\nSo I  paused everyone of the applications That wasn't a regular use app, and uninstalled the most recently installed apps And those that were seldom used like travel apps.\nI've let my battery completely drain and charge with it off overnight. And yet it's still will go dead in 90 minutes I need to be recharged just from talking on it or looking at a news article.\nOr I have to keep it plugged in to a power source to make sure that I can do anything like take a video.\nIt heats up and is hot in my hand that never happened before so that I stick it in the refrigerator to try to make it cool down so it will be functional.\nI have tried safe mode.\nI don't know what else to do other than a factory reset but I can imagine that a factory reset is going to fix this if it's a hardware functioning problem with the battery overheating and being a bad battery now.\nIf I have to go to all the trouble of taking all of my data and all of my apps off of my phone and reinstalling them all, is a factory reset as good as buying a new phone?",
