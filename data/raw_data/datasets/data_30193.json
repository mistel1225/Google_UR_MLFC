    "title": "Battery life of Pixel 1 lasting 3hrs 45mins",
    "content": "My Pixel over the last month has been lasting shorter and short of a duration. At present it is lasting 3hrs 45mins. A week before that, it had been at around 6hrs, and last month had been at around 8hrs. Its incredibly inconvenient to say the least. I purchased it through my former service provider, but the plan is no longer active and I am no longer with that service provider. Not quite sure what to do about it. I'm not sure if this is a manufacturing fault or software issue, but I can definitely say that it is up to date, and no apps seem to be consuming battery life inaccurately. Any help would be appreciated in finding the issue here.",
