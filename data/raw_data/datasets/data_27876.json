    "title": "Why does my Pixel 1 request factory reset after upgrade to Android 10?",
    "content": "Since I upgraded my Pixel XL 1 to Android 10, it keeps crashing and I was given no other choice but to do a factory reset. This happened 3 times for the last three days and I need to restore my backed up account and set up all my apps all over each time this happens. Can I roll back to Android 9 or is there a way to stop this from happening? I lost a lot of data that wasn't backed up the first time it took place.",
