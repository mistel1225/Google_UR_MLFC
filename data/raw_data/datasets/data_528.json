    "content": "hi guys! just got the new pixel 5, and the pics I take of myself from the front camera are blurry compared to the pixel 3. take a look below. I made sure all apps were updated, system was updated, cache was clear, restarted, etc. The photo is so sharp on the pixel three- you can see my pores! I also made sure to turn off the skin smoothing feature. Does anybody know if this is just how the Pixel 5 is going to be?",
