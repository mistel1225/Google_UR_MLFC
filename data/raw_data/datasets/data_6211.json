    "content": "So I started to have this issue with my Pixel 5, that when I post to Instagram, the photo fails to save in my Google Photos. I have tried to ignore it but it's really doing my head in at this point.\n\nI have done everything one would reasonably suggest in this situation. \n\nI have checked Instagram and Google Photos permissions. \n\nI have the Save photo to camera roll option on Instagram selected.\n\nI have back-up selected in Google Photos. \n\nI have cleared cache and data of both apps \n\nAnd despite all of that, the situation hasn't resolved and it seems to be a known issue haven't seen a few people complaining about it but no one has provided an answer yet. \n\nWhen I do it in my Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra, it saves seamlessly and so I would really love a solution to this.",
