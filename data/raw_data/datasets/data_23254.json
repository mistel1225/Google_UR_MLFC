    "content": "Suddenly, out of nowhere (never dropped the phone or get it wet, just bought it a month ago) the front speaker stopped working and i can't hear anything when i'm in a call or listening to a voice message on it.\n\nThe bottom speaker works fine, and i had to use it to hear calls and messages (but it also loses privacy). Does anyone know how to solve this issue? \n\nI've already tried resetting to factory settings and didn't work.\n\nSorry for my bad english, i'm a spanish speaker. Hope you can understand what the problem is.",
