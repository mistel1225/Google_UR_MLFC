    "title": "Pixel 4a. Version 11. On all apps the top section of the app, with search and buttons doesn't work.",
    "content": "The top section of all apps can't be used. This usually means the search in the app can't be selected. Example, Facebook, across from the word Facebook, the search magnifying icon can't be tapped. The link to Facebook Messenger can't be tapped. When I try to use play store, the same search bar at the top of the app doesn't work.\nI've done a factory reset. As well as restart prior to that.\nThanks",
