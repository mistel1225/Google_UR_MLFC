    "content": "I have a schedule to turn ON DND at night and that works fine. During the day I often manually turn DND when I want to keep the phone quiet. As I'm switching between apps, such as Instagram, FB, whatsapp, DND will often get de-activated, and I keep re-enabling it but it won't 'stick'. I have Android 11, build RQ1A.201205.008",
