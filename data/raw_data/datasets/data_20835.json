    "content": "I bought my pixel 3a 2 weeks ago and had no problems until now.\nRecently I noticed the mobile data from my sim card was not working and a day or two after my pixel stopped recognizing the sim card altogether. \nNow I can't even connect to wifi. It automatically turns off a couple of seconds after I start it.\n\nTried resetting the network settings, factory reset with no success.\n\nAfter removing my sim card for an hour I was able to reinsert it and had cellular data and could connect to wifi for a couple of hours before it disappeared again.\n\nWhat could be causing the issue and how to resolve it?",
