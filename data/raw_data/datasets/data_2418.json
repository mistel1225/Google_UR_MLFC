    "content": "When I mannually turn off both wifi and data, my phone somehow is continuing to download emails and I can surf the web in this mode.  I don't know what network the phone is accessing and I have it turned off from automatic connection to public networks.  I don't want it to connect when I have purposely turned off wifi/data and I don't know how to stop this from occurring.  Is there a hidden setting somewhere?",
