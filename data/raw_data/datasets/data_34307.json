    "title": "How can I keep my Pixel 3XL Bluetooth from disconnecting in my car?",
    "content": "When in my car (Ford Explorer, using Sync), my phone's Bluetooth continuously disconnects and reconnects. It happens randomly, but I don't drive a ton and would estimate it happens 3 times per 10 minute drive. I never had this issue with my iPhone, and I've had the car for 2 years, so I am confident it is not an issue with the Sync system. Ideas?",
