    "title": "Pixel 2 not charging after random shutoff when charging",
    "content": "My phone is inconsistently charging. I've been charging it with my C302CA charger for over a year, never an issue, and included charger since I bought both a little over a year ago. Tuesday evening, however, I plugged it in and it immediately shut off, switching to the charging battery display.\n\nI turned it back on and attempted to charge again, the same thing happened. It now only charges if I clean the port with an alcohol wipe and/or thin card, but even then it's not reliable.\n\nI've used both the original included charger and laptop on several outlets. The charging end works with my computer and both wall outlet ends are fine. I also used compressed air without success.\n\nI bought it at my local Best Buy with their insurance plan.\n\nRecently updated to the latest version,  PQ3A.190605.003",
