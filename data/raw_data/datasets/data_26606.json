    "title": "Why is my Pixel 3 not a verified device (not play protected)?",
    "content": "Been trying to use my Google pay to little success over the last couple of days. Keep on getting that this device \"doesn't meet software standards\". I was told to check if my device is play protected and it is not. Checked to see what the hell play protect is, and it's to stop Chinese knockoffs from using Android. I have a Pixel 3, which I got from JB HI FI in Australia, whom I work for. FAQ is little help, basically just telling me to get a new phone. So what do I do to ensure my google made device meets Google's standards???",
