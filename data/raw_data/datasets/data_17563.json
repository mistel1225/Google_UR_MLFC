    "content": "My Pixel 3a had similar issues a while ago. I'm not sure what got it working again, or why it quit working.  I did try rebooting and booting to safe mode and a few other things.  It did start again, but not immediately.  Auto rotate no longer works.  I can't use Google Photo Sphere or Google Street View on my Google phone to make panoramic pictures.\n\nIronically, I got the Pixel to do just this as a Samsung crapped out right before this and I chose not to replace it with another one.\n\nSounds like a Google Android update was the culprit in regards to the sensor a year ago.\n\nAnyone know what is going on. There is a new August security update. Will this fix it?\n\nI really would like to make a panorama shot at this time.  \n\nMaybe I need to upgrade to a 4a, but I just bought this one and my experience isn't such that I'd want to buy another.  Maybe a direct replacement if it would fix this and other issues like brightness settings changing on their own and other behaviors.  It seems as if the phone is possessed.",
