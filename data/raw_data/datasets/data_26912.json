    "content": "I've had my Pixel 3a for six weeks now and I'm really, really happy with it. Unfortunately, over the last few weeks, I seem to be having a problem when using the headphone jack. Whenever I plug my headphones in, I get a faint high pitched whistling sound in the background. I've tried several pairs of headphones and they all do the same. It plays audio fine but there's this annoying sound - a bit like when you've been in a loud nightclub or bar.\nIf I move the connector around, it crackles and the noise stops, but if I move my phone the whistling starts again.\nThe phone is well protected (with case and screen protector) and I can't see any dust or debris in the jack. I'm really gutted as it's all been going so well so far.\nWhat do?",
