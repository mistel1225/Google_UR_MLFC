    "content": "Even a few days after receiving my Android 10 update (I waited a few days as per this article: https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/13981460), I have consistently seen terrible battery drain on my Pixel 3. This is very noticeably worse than pre Android 10 whereby I am seeing around 1 hour of screen on time. I used to get at least double that on Android 9. I am seeing this terrible battery drain with minimal to no screen usage, and do not see any unusual activity under Battery Settings. My phone actually loses power when placed on my wireless charger at work, where before it would obviously charge. I have attached screenshots of battery performance below.",
