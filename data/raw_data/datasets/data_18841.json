    "title": "After a video call, sound output switches to ear speaker instead of bottom ones.",
    "content": "The issue occurs randomly. For e.g, I am watching a youtube video, sound is played through the bottom speaker. When a video call comes, sound comes through top speaker as expected. After end of the call, when I play youtube, the audio is through the top speaker. I tried other apps, result is the same. Only reboot fixes the issue.",
