    "content": "Hi folks,\n\nI am wondering - is there a way to set up a script or automated action, where if a particular phone # calls me, it automatically answers and keys '9'?\n\nTo give background:\n\nThe entrance buzzer to my apartment is connected to my cell phone (Pixel 2).  \n\nI recently sublet my place while taking care of an ill parent. My building wont change the cell number connected to my buzzer (i.e. change it to my subletter's) - so each time they come in / out - they need to call me through the buzzer and i hit 9 to let them in,\n\nAs you can imagine, its not sustainable.\n\nAt this point id be fine if every call that comes in would be automatically answered w a key 9 lol.",
