    "content": "so i have and save a lot of photos, because i like to post them at random intervals. with my last phone, i was able to post photos from the photos app i had and it was wonderful. but now, i can only post with things that are in files, and for some reason, all of my photos are not included in that. is there a way i can post pictures from the photo thing or a way to get all the images into the files folder? because this is kind of miserable.",
