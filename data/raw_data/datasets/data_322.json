    "content": "I received a Google Pixel 3a XL last september as a birthday gift. It worked wonderfully and was a great phone but abruptly died after about 5 months. Zero damage, the phone never left its case, there was no reason for it. Google at first completely refused to help me in any way, because I live in Canada. Apparently all customers outside of the USA are second class, and not worth Google's attention. After battling them for over a month, they agreed to look at the phone. But of course, would not touch the phone if it did not come from an American address. So after using an expensive re-shipping service and waiting two months, I finally receive a replacement phone. And of course, its locked to an American cell provider, rendering it useless to me. \n\nI am truly speechless, I'm not even angry anymore. Google took my money and then spit in my face. I've never been treated so poorly by a company. I just wanted to buy a phone that works. This is fucking ridiculous. I wish I never purchased this piece of shit product. I am going to make it my life's passion to steer future customers away from this asshole company.",
