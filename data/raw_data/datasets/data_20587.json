    "content": "I was asked to reset the phone by a Google service exec after the speaker was not working. After Factory reset was completed, the speaker started working perfectly. Now when the phone starts up and checks the googles servers for update and activation etc, before setup, it's informing me that it is not a private device, and is instead a \"work device\", and is \"managed by my organisation\", despite this not being the case. This did not show as an option when I first got my phone. I am unable to log in using my private Gmail email address, and hence unable to access my phone, it resets itself every hour. I got the phone brand new from Amazon India and set it up perfectly the first time last November. Some one please help. Thanks.",
