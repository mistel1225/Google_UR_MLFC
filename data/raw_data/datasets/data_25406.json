    "title": "Overheating when talking on phone in a minute.",
    "content": "Phone starts getting hot in about a minute of call duration. This is hurting my ears and head, and it gets very uncomfortable which is why I have to always use phone on speaker or headphones. When I described my  issue to Google pixel support, they replied me by saying this is normal and this shouldn't be concern. This is heights of ridiculousness of how Google is ignoring my concern. They are asking to turn off data and take a break from phone. Is this type of support we expect when we purchase a 1000 Cad worth of phone.",
