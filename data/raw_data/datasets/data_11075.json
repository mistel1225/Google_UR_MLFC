    "content": "Dear all\n\nSince a lot of people have connectivity issues with their Pixels, including me, I've decided to create this post.\nI don't know if google employees read this post.\nGoogle's favorite answer is \"check with your carrier, they have to certify the phone\". That's just a lie!\n\nDear Google-team, when will you finally do your work, and import the settings from the GSAM database? Never heard about it? Google it!!\n\nhttps://www.gsma.com/services/resources/gsma-nsx-guide/\n\n\nWhy Google just ignores that and tries to blame the carriers?!\n\nMost phone manufacturer use the GSMA db, and their phones just work!\n\nThis is definitely my last Pixel if this situations doesn't change!!",
