    "content": "Yesterday when I was on a phone call the phone still had around 90% battery left. All of the sudden the phone shuts down and when I was able to get back on I looked at the battery and saw it dropped from around 90% straight down to 0% within seconds. Is this a phone hardware or a phone software problem?",
