    "content": "My phone was plugged in, I used it at 09h30 this morning upon returning two hours later, no response. I have done all troubleshooting as described using the different reset buttons (hold volume down and power button for 30 seconds, hold power button for 10 seconds, etc.), plugged in and not plugged in. \n\nI have used two different cables. But the phone will not turn on. No icons appear on the screen when plugged in. \n\nIt was plugged in next to my bed, it had been plugged in overnight, in the same place I plugged it every night. Very strange that it has just died while being there doing nothing.\n\nPlease help! Or should I send it in for it to be looked at by a technician?\n\nMany thanks in advance.\nS.",
