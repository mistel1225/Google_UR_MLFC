    "content": "I have to connect my charger cable to turn on phone after being turned off for whatever reason, like the phone dies after battery is completely discharged or manually turned off. I should be able to press power button and turn phone back on! Ain't happening! Tried safety boot up and resetting phone, not working! And yes phone indicates battery is charged. Happens at 70%, 80, 90 or whatever! But still have to plug in charger just to turn on. Once on, i disconnect charger and then phone works fine rest of the day. But if i do a reboot, forget it. Have to plug charger back in just to turn on! ??????",
