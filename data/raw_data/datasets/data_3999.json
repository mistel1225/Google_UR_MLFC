    "content": "(all) my Pixel Phones (inc the 4a) do NOT support video output via the usb-c (to HDMI) ?\nallegedly Google have turned this feature OFF in the code (apparently to 'push' Chromecast)\n- i do NOT want to connect in yet another device (chromecast) when colleagues phones work straight off one cable....and anyway this is not practical in the field.\n-WHY, when many other Android phones have it enabled and works well.\n\nyet (another) reason to sadly NOT buy a Pixel phone again... Being loyal to Google is now becoming a chore... with constant KULLing of features and Apps.",
