    "content": "Hello\n\nI've been trying to get these issues solved which has been very frustrating re my pixel 5:\n\n1) Free headphones. Where are they? I spoke with someone called 'Albert' and he admitted that I should have received the headphone because I purchased the phone and claimed the headphones within the agreed time frames? I was told by Albert to complete a 'contact form' with Sales and they'll get back to me. I did this and I never received a response. \n\nMy claim number is 546-409-768\n\n2) I'm often talking to someone on the phone or watching a video and the volume drops dead. I've tried all the solutions on line but no luck. Can you help? This is very frustrating and it's affecting my work \n\nI really hope that someone can help me as the above is causing me considerable stress. \n\nThanks, \n\nSean",
