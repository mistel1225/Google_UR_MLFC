    "title": "Why are certain internal sounds not being recorded?",
    "content": "I've had my pixel for about 5 days now. I've recorded a few things with internal/media audio, with the screen recorder built into the phone. I was streaming a show on the discord app to one of my friends today and about 7 minutes into the stream she said the sound stopped working. I looked into it a little further by restarting my phone and apps, clearing cache. And the consensus I came to was that the apps which media is displayed in the box above notifications and below the tiles in the drop down menu, are the only ones sounds are not being recorded anymore. In discord and the screen recording app. So for example, youtube and game audio can be recorded, but not spotify or chrome. I don't have any idea why this has happened. I would love it if someone could help me. \nThanks -Coop",
