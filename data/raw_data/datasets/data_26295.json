    "content": "I would like my phone to read out my text messages when my hands are not free.  saying, \"read me my e-mail messages\" works fine, but only when asking for my text messages.  I'm currently using android messages (and it's my default messaging app).  the only messaging apps I have are facebook messages and hangouts.  i have the latest version of all apps and pixel updates.\nthanks!",
