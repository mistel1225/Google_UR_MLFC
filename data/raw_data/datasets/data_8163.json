    "content": "My storage is full so I cannot use my phone until files are backed up and deleted. But I can't back anything up as, despite trying EVERYTHING mentioned in previous posts, my USB file transfer option is greyed out. It is not the cable, I've tried various USB ports, tried on Mac too. USB port is clean. \nPLEASE help. I need to access my phone for work.",
