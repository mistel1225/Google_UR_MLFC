    "content": "Google wants to be like Apple, but where is the security update? Should have supported atleast 4 years. Paying so much money for a phone which is dropped after 3 years from Google itself is horrendous to say the least.\nGoogle copies all \"feature-removal innovations\" from Apple and yet they can't copy a good thing like security updates.\nAnd forget about support like Microsoft does. They give 10 year security updates to their OS.",
