    "content": "So I've ordered a Pixel 5 through Google store on 1st Oct and the expected delivery for the device is 26-27th Oct but when I try to order another Pixel to the same address(for a friend) now, it shows delivery between 16-19th Oct. Anyone else noticed it? I expected it to be the other way around",
