    "content": "Pixel 2 XL\n\nA couple of days ago, I asked Google Assistant, \"Hey Google, remind me to [task] at 11 o'clock tomorrow.\" I later added a second reminder for a different task.\n\nThe next day, Google reminded me on my phone at the right times, which was great.\n\nHowever, since then, Google keeps on reminding me. It happens without fail every time when I restart the phone, and at arbitrary other times. The notification shows both of my old reminders. (See the attached screenshot of my notification.)\n\nHere is what I've tried.\n\nTap the notification, which opens the Google Assistant and shows me that there are no reminders.\nPress \"Done\" on the notification, which closes the notification.\nSwipe the notification away.\nAs already mentioned, restart the phone (several times already).\n\nBut still, I keep getting reminders.\n\nHow do I cancel these old reminders, please?",
