    "content": "When using my Pixel 5 since I first got it I've noticed the general touch sounds when tapping on apps or typing will have sound glitching up and down. It'll happen randomly, I've tried factory resetting with no help. I've also RMA'd the phone with the replacement having the same issue out of the box. Others on reddit have had similar issues:\n https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/jluc26/noise_glitch_loud_to_quiet_tap_sounds_is_this_a/\nHere is an example of the issue:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nnf3WgYoxZY\nI'm assuming this is a software issue. Hopefully it can get fixed soon.",
