    "content": "I searched everywhere (and to be honest this should not be a default anyway), but does anyone know where you can find the option for the phone's screen to shut off and lock while charging? \nAs long as I have my charger plugged into my phone, the phone stays on unless I shut it off and lock it manually. It never goes to sleep.\n\nThanks!",
