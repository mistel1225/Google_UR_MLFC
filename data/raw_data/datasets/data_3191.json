    "content": "Hi. I have a pixel 4a with 6 months. Since 3 months ago, i started to notice a wavy image effect while using camera. It apperars frequently while taking pictures and recording videos. I use it mostly outside with day light and i often get this anoying effect. The image starts waving a lot and the phone makes a strange noise, sounding like a bee. Anyone also have experienced this issue? Could someone help me on how to contact google services to solve this issue? \n\nMany thanks.\nBest regards, \nJorge Vieira",
