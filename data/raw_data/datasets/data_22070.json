    "content": "My Google Pixel 3XL has been having a horrible freeze and I guess the best way to describe it is no screen response just out of nowhere. It'll go black and not respond to me try to bring the screen back to use or it'll show me the time but I can't do anything else. Its so random when it does it too. Somedays theres no issues and some days Im fighting with it all day. It's especially horrible about the black screen freeze when Im done with a call (I can't hng up, they have too) \n\nI tried safe mode and that didn't do anything. I haven't dropped it and nothing is cracked or damanged, I can't afford the deductible on insurance so I got to make this last till october when im done paying on it",
