    "content": "Hello, \n\nMy Pixel 3 randomly started launching its camera today. While the camera would be open, the power pop-up screen would also display and it was frequently pulsing on the screen as the phone was vibrating. It also got itself stuck in a restarting loop where the phone would turn black and then display the google logo but would not progress from there and would instead turn black again and repeat. I was able to break the loop by restarting the phone and entering safe mode, but about 5 minutes later the camera self-launched again and continued with the same issue described above. After one of the restarts it did stop and has been working normally for the past 10 minutes or so. \n\nI did not recently download any new applications so I doubt that could be a reason behind it. \n\nDo I need to update software or do anything to ensure this issue is actually resolved? Is this an issue to speak to my wireless provider about/ have them look at the phone in store? I want to prevent this from starting all over again soon as I'm concerned it isn't truly fixed yet. \n\nThanks.",
