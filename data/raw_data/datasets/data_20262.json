    "title": "Pixel 3XL mostly goes to phone earpiece instead of bluetooth headset",
    "content": "I believe this happens from updates here and there.  When I used to have my BT headset connect and called someone, it used the headset.  Now it starts saying BT headset on the screen but then switches to the earpiece before/when the person answers.   This is extremely annoying.  It keeps happening.  Same headset I've had since I got the phone.\n\nFurther, when I had a call coming in if I turned on my BT headset it would automatically answer when I turned it on.  It doesn't do that now.  Also, when I manually answer with BT connected, it says it is using the BT but it is not.  It is using the earpiece and I have to select the BT device  even though it is already selected.",
