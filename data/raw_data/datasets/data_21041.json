    "content": "Hello! \n\nThis is probably something really simple (hopefully!), but I hope someone can assist me. My work Gmail is managed by the Google Device Policy, so I set it up on my phone under a Work Profile.  Now I have no idea how to access it via the Gmail app.  My work profile account does not come up as an account option inside the Gmail app (when clicking the profile on the top right), even though it is listed under \"Work\" when I go to Settings -> Accounts.  Is there some special app or setting I need to be able to access Work Profile emails?\n\nThanks for any help!",
