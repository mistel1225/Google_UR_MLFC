    "content": "Due to my Google Pixel 5 taken lower quality photo than my old Pixel 3 XL, so I made several test to figure out what couse this, then find my camera has shift focus issue, it always focus behind on the subject I pointed.\n\nI tried these methods but not working:\n• uninstall camera app (back to v7.6)\n• factory reset\n• clean cache for Google camera app\n\nI wonder if you could confirm if this issue could be fixed by future updates, or I need to RMA? Thank you.\n\nThe first attached sample shows the situation, I pointed on the right orange juice pack, but the sharpest is on coffee cup. \n\n\nCorp pic below : Pixel 5 (pointed on right orange juice pack but focusing left coffee cup)\n\n\nP3 XL (focus on right juice pack)\n\n\nBest regards,\nKarl Lu",
