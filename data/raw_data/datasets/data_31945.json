    "title": "\"find my phone\" not working. Phone lost in a public space, is there another way to erase it?",
    "content": "I left my phone on top of a taxi a few days ago, whilst distracted by my daughter. The \"find my phone\" option is saying \"Can't connect\", so I am unable to find its location or erase it. May I ask if there is another way to do this? I scoured the local area. The taxi driver states it is not where I thought it was, in his trunk. The phone is still ringing - it was on 50% battery when I lost it and it has been four days, so maybe someone has it plugged in.",
