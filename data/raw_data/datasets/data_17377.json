    "content": "I've been trying haptic feedback and it's been working really well. Though whenever I plug my headphones into the headphone jack it doesn't work, is this some sort of feature In unaware of? Because I would like to have haptic feedback on my Pixel without having to unplug my headphones. I've tried re enabling the haptic feedback feature, looking through accessibility, and trying to see if anyone else has had this issue. I'll try restarting my phone, though even then this shouldn't be a problem.",
