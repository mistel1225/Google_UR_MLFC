    "content": "Mine is so bad that I can barely touch it, and Google Fi knew nothing about this and sent me another phone which is in transit but seems useless now. I'm moving at the beginning of January and things are going to be hectic without a functional phone. \n\nHalf the time I turn on the screen it automatically starts selecting random icons and apps, and last night it deleted a bunch of email and sent a draft I wasn't finished to my boss. On Christmas day I took it out of my pocket and it had called 911. Typically when it happens it happens so fast you can't consciously pick up on what it's doing cuz you're trying to stop it from happening and so I have no idea what else it might have deleted or archived or whatever. \n\nSo yeah, I'd really appreciate knowing when I should expect to possess a working phone. You know, since it's the only one I've got, and I bought it less than a month ago.",
