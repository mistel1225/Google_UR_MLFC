    "content": "Hello,\n\nWith my new Pixel 5, I'm not able to get any GSM network working. Even if I choose LTE / 3G / 2G I always have the \"no service\" message and a little cross on my empty network status icon. (I'm not speaking about data). I don't have any 5G sim card.\n\nI already performed 3 factory reset, network setting reset, nothing works. I'm very confused about that.\nAlso when I let my sim card inside and factory reset my phone, it bootloops during the Wifi search step maybe 4 or 5 times before showing me some wifi network. Works well without sim card.\n\nOther network stuff like Wifi and Bluetooth works \"well\".\n\nAny idea ? Do I mess something ?!\nThanks\n\nAndroid version:\n\n\nnetwork picto:",
