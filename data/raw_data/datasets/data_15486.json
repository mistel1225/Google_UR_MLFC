    "content": "I received a new pixel 4a yesterday. Completed the setup. Today morning, the phone did not start. Tried following the steps given in forum (pressing power and vol down button) and it does not help. The screen flickers with some messages and then goes blank. Should I just return the phone or is there a way to make it work? \nThanks.",
