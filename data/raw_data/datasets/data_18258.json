    "content": "My phone shows me my home weather despite me being on completely different part of the continent. Even stranger - if I press the (incorrect) temperature, it opens Google window and shows me the correct location and correct weather. Once window is closed, screen widget continues to show my home location's weather. Any suggestions how to change this as I found nothing on it - neither in my phone, nor in previous community questions.",
