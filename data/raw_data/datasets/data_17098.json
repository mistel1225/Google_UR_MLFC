    "title": "Pixel Phone repair status untrackable; no help from chat support, no response for escalations",
    "content": "My Pixel was bought in July, 2020. It suddenly shut off and was submitted for repair to Google field agent on 10 August,20. \nSince then, I got the last update on 14th August. The chat agents give me the same reply everytime that the parts are unavailable, or \"Team is working on it, rest assured every thing will be taken care, our expert team will respond within next 24 hours\". And they are saying this for the past 20 days almost. I can understand scarcity of tools and parts, but its been almost a month. My expected delivery date shifts by a day everyday. All my escalations are unanswered. \nI expect assistance, as this is really getting frustrating. I may have to start tweeting the issue to the management team at Google.",
