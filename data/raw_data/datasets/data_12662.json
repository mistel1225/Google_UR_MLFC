    "content": "Hello,\nAbout 2 weeks ago, I charged my phone with a power bank and it turned off, however it was charging but it was off. Note: the screen wasn't on (like when you charge your phone while off and the battery sign appears, not it was off. I turned it on and noticed it was charging. A day later, the same thing happened (while using a normal charger)\nThe problem is my phone suddenly flashes lines, and it turns off (black screen) while charging or when the screen locks (screen timeout). Note: It doesn't happen everytime\nThen, things went back to normal for a couple of days. However, it's happening again. About 3-4 times per day, my phone flashes lines on the top part of the screen, shaped like thunder (black and a little bit of green, direction: left to right)  In addition, it turns off sometimes, but this usually happens whenever I charge my phone. Also, I sometimes try to unlock my phone while it's charging, and it sometimes turns off. \n\nI'm afraid that my phone won't turn on someday.\n\nBackground: I've had this phone since July 2019. Never had an issue. My phone is in perfect condition, with no cracks. no major accidents, etc. However, I do believe small changes (speed, lagging) started occurring in July of this year, but nothing major. Unfortunately, I am thinking of getting the Google Pixel 4a 5G or maybe just changing to a new brand.\n\n\nPlease let me know if you guys have had similar issues.",
