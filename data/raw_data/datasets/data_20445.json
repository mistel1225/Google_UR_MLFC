    "title": "How can I screen mirror without buying a peripheral hardware item?",
    "content": "My phone won't pick ip my TV when I try to pair them for screen mirroring. Both are on the same network and this method worked in my old Huawei P20 Pro no problems. As far as my Google ability lets me see, I need to buy a chromecast. First of all, if I am correct, I am pretty annoyed about this, so much so that I'd have not purchased the phone if I knew as it's an important feature to me and this feels like a gouge and second of all, I am sure there must be another meathod. Any help? Thanks.",
