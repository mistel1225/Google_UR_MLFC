    "title": "Google Pixel 3a XL won't connect to internet using mobile data after Android 11 update",
    "content": "I recently installed Android 11 on my Google Pixel 3a XL and now, my phone will not connect to the internet using mobile data. I've already contacted my carrier (t-Mobile) several times & there are no issues on their end. I have an active unlimited data plan. I've tried ensuring that my mobile data is turned on, resetting my network settings, turning the phone on/off in safe mode, setting the APN to default and a factory reset. Nothing is working and it's very upsetting because I just bought this phone brand new and now, all it does is talk and text. Any help would be greatly appreciated.",
