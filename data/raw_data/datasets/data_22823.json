    "content": "I've tried clearing phone app cache, force quitting phone app, restarting phone.  The 'Screen Call' option is missing in the phone app settings - and it won't ask me if I want to screen when a call comes in.\n\nThe only thing that 'fixes' the issue is to un-install the Phone app update.  Then I can see the 'Call Screening' option in settings - and I get the 'Sceen Call' button for a phone call.\n\nBTW - there is no version number for the phone app update, so I have no way of knowing when there is a different version of the app whereas this issue might be fixed.  I have to turn OFF auto-updates, and as prompt security updates are one of the main 'features' of the Pixel phones ... this is undesirable?",
