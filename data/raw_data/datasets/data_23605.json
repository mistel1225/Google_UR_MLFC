    "content": "After the most recent update (Android 10 I think?) the time / clock has disappeared from my notifications bar.\n\nI just have the battery, wifi, signal etc symbols on the right of the notification bar and nothing on the left.\n\nSometimes if i get a notification there will be a gap/empty space next to it in the bar, where the clock obviously should be.\n\nThere is no clock showing on the homescreen at all, so the only way I can check the time is to lock the phone and then wake up the lock screen.",
