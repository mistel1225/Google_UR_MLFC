    "title": "Google Nexus 4 XL only 2 month old continually freezes after calls are ended and I'm unable to unloc",
    "content": "Google Nexus 4 XL seems to freeze constantly once there has been a call hung up and I'm unable to lock screen or do anything with phone for about 30 seconds before the biometrics will work again. During this time I'm unable to use the on off button it just hangs without letting me be able to do anything. Screen is also deactivated for a short period of time so I can't use keypad or pin to unlock it.",
