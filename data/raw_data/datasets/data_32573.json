    "content": "About a week ago, I accepted updates for my beloved Google Pixel  1. Later that day, my phone must have crashed while in my pocket. I soon noticed my phone getting warmer. When I checked it, I found it stuck in a boot loop. The Pixel powers up to the white screen with 'Google' written on it before it randomly restarts. To make matters worse, I'm on holiday at the moment. I bought on ebay less than 2 years ago (Australia).\n\nNot knowing what to do exactly, I tried the following:\n1. FORCE SHUTDOWN: Hold the power button in for several seconds to force my phone to totally shut down so that I could deal with it when I had access to Google. Unfortunately, the phone continued to restart again and again. Because the Pixel is a sealed unit, I cannot remove the battery or anything like that.\n2. RECOVERY MODE:  holding the Power Button + Volume Down button for several seconds to enter the boot selector screen. That worked to bring me to a black screen with my phone's details (e.g. serial number, etc.) and a menu where I could select options such as 'Recovery Model', etc.  When Ipree any of these it just goes back into bootloop/   \n\nNot sure what to do. I am trying to contact google...",
