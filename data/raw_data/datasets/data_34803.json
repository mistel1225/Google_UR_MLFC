    "content": "-Spotify music stops playing after clicking on any type of media within Twitter\n-Google Assistant gets triggered by being in a pocket, again stopping any music being played - should add a setting where the assistant can only be triggered whilst the phone is unlocked\n-Battery saving mode if anything drains quicker than normal mode, either way there is no discernible difference in the rate of drainage\n-The rear facing fingerprint sensor is inconsistent at best, not even close to being in the same league as Apple's\n-There needs to be a more seamless experience when switching between Google Search and Chrome, it's like they're two separate apps (which they technically are, but shouldn't be)\n-When playing media in full screen, very often the bar at the bottom of the screen remains visible in white or black, essentially rendering something unwatchable\n-clicking on Youtu.be links doesn't automatically open the YouTube app, especially from Instagram. Shouldn't be a major issue but the screen doesn't rotate for full screen viewing, forcing the user to manually open the app and navigate to the video, another Google App that doesn't interact seamlessly with the android OS \n-The NFC chip / wireless payment system is unbearably inconsistent and I have been regularly left holding up a queue like a lemon whilst I try and get the payment to go through, again feels like Apple Hardware are miles ahead in this sense\n- It should be possible to add email accounts to the phone for entering into forms that aren't in use by the built in Google Mail app\n- Nothing ruins the UI like an app with a square logo in a round icon, either make fitted logos compulsory or add some kind of AI, editing feature where the logo is cropped to the icon\n- Add a feature where the battery level of connected devices is more readily available",
