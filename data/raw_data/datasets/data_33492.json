    "content": "In the past 3-4 weeks, I've had random times where people can't hear me talking on my Pixel. All they hear is static and that I sound very quiet and distant. I'm not certain I want to invest more money in this phone as I already had to replace the battery because after 2 years my original battery was down to 55% capacity. Are there any suggestions on how to fix this microphone issue and how much it will cost? Thanks for your help!",
