    "content": "I was using my pixel XL while on quarantine and out of nowhere it got turned off suddenly. It won't turn back on. As soon as this happened I got to youtube searching for solutions and I got nothing other than a youtuber asking me to hold down the power button for a minute, take a towel or cloth and press firmly on the phone as he says it could be some internal hardware out of position. None of these worked. At the end of the video he says his viewers to put the phone in a fridger (which is dumb and could damage the phone). I had the slightest faith in this but I did it anyway. After getting my phone out after 30 mins from the fridger, it showed the google logo and showed promise. But the logo went away and it was the same thing again. I can't do anything right now in this quarantine without my phone. I would be very much thankful if anyone can reach me out to solve this problem. \n\nP.S. It would't even show me the google logo before putting it in the fridger. It basically doesn't do anything when I hold the power button",
