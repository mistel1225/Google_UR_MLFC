    "content": "I downloaded and installed the patch on July 2nd. Since then, I've had battery issues, my phone not recognizing that my headphones are connected. Wifi cutting in and out and now, I went to bed last night. Woke up and saw my phone said on screen \"5:32am\" I asked my google home what time it was and she said \"it's 8:34am\" so my phone I guess bricked in the middle of the night and was frozen for 3 hours",
