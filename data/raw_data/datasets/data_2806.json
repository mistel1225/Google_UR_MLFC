    "content": "I just got my phone a few days ago and I keep getting pop ups that are supposed to be helpful but I already know how to use a Pixel, so all it does is create an extra step when I go to use my phone and I have to stop and click \"Got it.\" or \"No thanks.\" on a pop up. How do I get it to leave me alone?\n\nI have googled everything I can think of on how to turn off pixel hints or tips, but I am at a loss since I don't actually know what the feature is called.",
