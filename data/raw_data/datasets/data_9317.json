    "content": "I tried literally everything I could find on the internet but it won't respond at all. I'm really carefull with my phone and have a really good case on it. Lately the phone was already acting weird and it turned off a lot without a reason, but that was an easy fix. I just had to plug my phone to the charger and it turned on. But now it really seems dead and unresponsive.",
