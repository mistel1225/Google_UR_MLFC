    "content": "Somehow, the accessibility feature voice over got turned on.  My phone no longer functions the way it use to.  It took over 30 minutes to get the password screen up because suddenly swipe no longer works.  I did manage to figure that out.  Now, how do I get to the off that first main screen so I can open settings and turn this useless to me feature off?  I know where the options resides, I just can't get there.",
