    "title": "My phone keeps putting itself into silent mode multiple times daily.",
    "content": "All notifications are held from me until I check the specific apps. This can be Gmail, whatsapp or other messaging apps. \n\nI've checked my notification settings, all are set to be on. \nIt's not related to my volume setting, as I keep this on max at all times.\nI do not have \"Do not disturb\" or \"Focus Mode\" on\n\nEvery few hours when I check my phone properly, I'll drag the settings from the top of my screen, and there will be a small \"silent\" with an X to get rid of it. Once I do, my notifications work again. I never manually set this, and it keeps going back to it throughout the day without me realising. Resulting in me missing messages until much later.\n\nFeels like a fault with the operating system, not sure how to fix of course.",
