    "content": "Since a couple of months my Pixel 2 XL doesn't charge rapidly, even though it shows that it is charging rapidly.\n\nI have used the included charger, also tried the one supplied with my friend's 3XL, changed outlets, cleaned the USB port but only once in 10 times it will charge properly otherwise it takes 4-6hrs for a full charge. \nAfter the Feb patch, the problem was solved, each time I plugged it, it was charging at fast speed, I was relieved but now the problem is back. I have noticed that the phone does not heat up at all while it charges slowly, while it does otherwise. Looks like a bug or deliberate restriction, either way this is not how it should be.\n\nQuite a lot of people are facing this, please fix, don't forget about the device since it isn't the flagship anymore.\nI am seriously disappointed with how the phone is being treated just after a year it was released, this makes me lean towards getting a new Oneplus instead.",
