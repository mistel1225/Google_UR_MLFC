    "content": "Hi,\n\nI have been using a Pixel 3a for around two weeks. However, the phone ist still running on security patch level '5 March 2019'. when I manually check for updates in the settings, I get the message that the system is up to date, despite obviously as of today the updates for April and May have been out there for weeks. Any advise on how to enable the security updates to be downloaded and installed?",
