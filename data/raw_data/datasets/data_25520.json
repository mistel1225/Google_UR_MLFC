    "content": "So, just got this device. Great speakers but for some reason when using speakerphone during a call it is not clear or loud. Amazing how different it's is using the same speakers. Have tried on several calls and all not so good. Is there a way to tweak the audio so it's clear and loud?\nThanks",
