    "content": "Hi, \n\nI'd like to use an external mic, such as the Rode SmartLav with my Pixel 3?\n\nIt seems I need:\nExternal Sound Card USB Audio Adapter.\nA USB to USB-C adapter.\n\nDoes this work? Do I need anything additional such as a sound app? \n\nI've done research on the Rode website, Reddit, Amazon, and elsewhere and just want to make sure.\n\nThanks in advance! Steve",
