    "title": "Pixel 4 XL mic suppression not working?",
    "content": "My wife and I came from a Pixel and Pixel 2 XL (respectively) and now have a 4 and 4 XL. I've noticed since we switched that we can both hear every environmental sound and voice when we call each other, as if the noise suppression on the mics isn't working at all. This definitely wasn't the case with our previous Pixels.\n\nWe're on T-Mobile, and WiFi calling is disabled. We both have the same \"Made By Google\" case on our phones, and I've tested the case theory that someone else had posted about the holes not being large enough, and there was no difference.\n\nI'm not sure where the issue lies, but while the clarity of each others voices is vastly improved from our previous phones, the amount of noise we can both hear makes it almost impossible to hear each other at times. \n\nAny thoughts or suggestions would be appreciated!",
