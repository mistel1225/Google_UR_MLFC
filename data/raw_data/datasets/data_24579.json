    "content": "Since December update if I change gesture settings on my Pixel 3 XL from 3 button to 2 or 1 button gestures my phone shuts down and won't reboot. Have to do a full factory reset and make sure gestures are set to 3 button. Previous to November/December updates I was able to use the new gesture system and prefer it to old 3 button s controls.",
