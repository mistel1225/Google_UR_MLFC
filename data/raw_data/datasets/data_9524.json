    "content": "Well, as battery care claims, when I charge it at night, it will systematically charge my pixel 5 by morning alarm time. That is, my phone would charge fully 100% by my morning alarm time and this way it protects the battery. However, today I checked and my phone was already full one and a half hour before alarm time!!!\nIs it a fake feature? How can it protect battery overcharge this way?!",
