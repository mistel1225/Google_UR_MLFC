    "content": "I'm having issue with delay between receiving messages and voicemail. Sometime it takes hours and I don't receive any call or text and then I start receiving all my messages and voicemails at once. I tried to call my phone from different device when I had this issue and it went straight to voicemail.\nThe problem is getting worst and I have to keep restarting my phone to resolve the issue.\nI'm using cricket and I don't think that's the issue because all family using the same plan and I am the only one with this issue.",
