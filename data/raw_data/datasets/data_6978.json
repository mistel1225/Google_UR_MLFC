    "content": "Hi,\n\nI purchased a Pixel 4a from someone who bought one in Germany around November.  The device was new in box but after using it I noticed the camera froze. I went to the store in Germany which was a total drive of 3 hours back and forth. They did not want to give me a new device because it was 1 day over the period in which they would do that. Instead they said they would send the device for repair. After about 3 weeks I could pick up a new Pixel, which was in the same openend box as my old one which I found a bit strange but, ok.\n\nAfter I got home, again a 3 hour drive back and forth the phone started randomly resetting after initial setup. This kept happening after factory resets and only got worse. Also the back of the device got extremely hot accompanied by a loud screeching sound. The device have a message about being compromised. \n\nThe store said I could turn it in again for repairs but only after lockdown in Germany... Which will be at best in March.... I'm getting so frustrated now and although I live in the Netherlands and Pixels aren't officially sold here I hope Google is willing to help me with this situation. \n\nI look forward to hearing from you.\n\nKind regards,\n\nRichard",
