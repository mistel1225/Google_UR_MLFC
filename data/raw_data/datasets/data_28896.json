    "content": "Hey, so I recently got a new microphone to film videos with. The microphone itself is great and work fine on my laptop however when plugged into the pixel via the headphone adapter an unbearable buzzing noise seems to happen.\n\nAny suggestions on how to fix this? Even post-production noise removal doesn't quite do the trick.",
