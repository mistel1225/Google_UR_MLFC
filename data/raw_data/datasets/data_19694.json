    "content": "This pixel 3 was operating as designed and then displayed a pixelated screen and refuses to shutdown.  When we go through the forced shutdown it immediately reboots.  A forced boot into the OS doesn't work (30 sec pwr + vol down), doesn't work and the phone reboots again into the pixelated screen.   Any thoughts?  ",
