    "title": "Pixel 3a earpiece speaker disconnects internally when phone is pressed against ear... Known issue?",
    "content": "For the past month I thought I was going crazy, my phone randomly would seem to have terrible reception and people would be breaking up and such when I was trying to talk to them on the phone. Only recently in the last two weeks found out that when I press my 3a to my ear with any pressure, the earpiece speaker would cut out. Confirmed by playing music and pressing it against my ear. Every time, the speaker would cut out.\n\nThis phone has been on a bumper case its entire life of 8 months and has been repaired by ubreakifix in February under Google warranty for the common bottom speaker issue they all face. My question is if this is a known issue with these phones for the top speaker to have this issue I'm facing? It seems like any bit of pressure that causes the phone to flex backwards seems to cause this... And since the speaker part is the same for both the 3a and 3a XL... It just causes more questions.",
