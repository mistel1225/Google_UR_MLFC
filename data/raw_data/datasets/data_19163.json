    "content": "Since the update to Android 10 my device can not use either Google maps or Waze in Android auto.  When launching the both appear to pick up GPS but flip back and forth from where my car was last parked to approximate current position and never kick into nqv mode.  Help I use Waze daily for my 35 mile commute",
