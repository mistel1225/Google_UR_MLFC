    "content": "Pixel 3a XL suddenly is silent and only vibrates.  I checked DND, airplane, volume levels, and that setting for \"shortcut to prevent ringing\" it's also off.  when i go into sounds -to change ringtone, those are also silent when you peruse the choices.   I reset in safe mode to disable all apps...still is not ringing, so that's not the issue.  Recently updated and scanned for issues.  whaaaat....is happening?  thank you in advance.",
