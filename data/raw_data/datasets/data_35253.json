    "content": "Hello. Recently I bought a new Pixel 3 mobile from the lithuanian eshop BigBox.lt. I used it for few hours and noticed a small defect on its display. (Down it was slightly brighter and more yellowish and on the top of screen along the right side was darker and colder tint). Right the next day morning called them and described the issue. They send their courier and the next morning I gave the phone back to them.\nThen they said there is nothing wrong with the display its just OLED and it may be little bit different from other screens. \nI asked for replacement or money back. But they refused to do so and instead they gave the phone to their service for repair. Said it will take a WEEK! \nI returned the phone as being defective for replacement or a refund but not for repair. And I disagree to wait so long.\nThey are damaging Google's name and for sure doesn't respect their customers. \nCould someone advice me what to do in this situation? Any help would be much appreciated.",
