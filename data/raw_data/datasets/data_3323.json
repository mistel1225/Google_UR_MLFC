    "content": "I have messed up with setting up my first phone. I skipped the wifi part, but now realize I need to order a wireless router. I think I also messed up the fingerprint part, by not syncing what I did with the vibration.I think this because the phone won't unlock. Is it possible to start all over with the set-up, once the router arrives? As in back to the very beginning?",
