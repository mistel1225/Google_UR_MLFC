    "content": "Wifi roaming on my Pixel 3a is not working.\n\nHave an eero mesh network installed. I can go to different locations with my Pixel 3a and a 4 year old iPhone SE. Within seconds, the iPhone switches to the nearest access point. The Pixel never switches (even if I set it directly beside the nearest access point). The only way to get the Pixel to switch is to turn Wifi off and on.\n\nIs there some setting that needs to be changed to get Wifi roaming to work? Or perhaps some app that I've disabled? It's incredulous that a new Pixel has less functionality than an old iPhone.",
