    "title": "Battery draining, & Support not accessible from phone",
    "content": "Hello, my pixel 2 is rapidly draining it's battery. It started to happen extremely fast, for example I would get up in the morning and take it off charge and it would be 25% down in an hour with me doing very little. If i listen to music the power meter decreases down like a ticker. These are all things I used to do without issue.\n\nI have reset the phone, a full factory reset and only added back on the apps that are critical to me. This has helped a little but I still have excessive battery drain.\n\nWhen I click on tips and support in the pixels settings menu it does not load and I eventually get the android pop up to either close play services or wait. As a result I am contacting you via the this support page.\n\nPlease help?\n\nThanks dan",
