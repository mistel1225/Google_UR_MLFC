    "content": "My Pixel 3 all of a sudden cut off last night in the middle of a call. The phone would not come back on. I put it on the charger even though I know it wasnâ€™t dead. The phone came back on three times and each time it crashed as I tried to send a text to the person I was on the phone with about having phone issues.",
