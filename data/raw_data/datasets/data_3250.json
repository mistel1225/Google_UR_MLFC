    "content": "I noticed a while back that part of my screen turned a beige-yellow tinge. The top 1/3 of the screen is regular white, then there is a clear straight line after which the screen is more yellow. And then there is another clear change in color where the part with the home button is. So basically my screen is split in to 3 parts which all have a slightly different tint. No clue why. Tried adjusting color to natural, but the 3 different tints persist. Did restart etc. Is it a hardware issue? The sperations are perfectly straight horizontal lines.",
