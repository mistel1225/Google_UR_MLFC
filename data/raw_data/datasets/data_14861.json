    "content": "My phone won't turn on after attempting to instal the October 2020 update even while pressing volume down + power buttons together . After I clicked update the phone went to the \"getting things ready\" screen and then it froze. It then turned itself off and I haven't been able to power it back on even after charging for over 4 hours or while being connected.\n\nPlease help! What should I do?",
