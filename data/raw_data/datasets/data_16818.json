    "content": "My Google pixel phone won't charge. The only thing I've done different is bought a portable charger and charged my phone with it for about 20 minutes(not sure it even charged it) but now nothing will charge my phone. Not sure if that's the reason. I don't want to take the risk to use the portable charger with another device incase that's the issue. Before spending money on a new phone wanted to see if anyone else had this issue.",
