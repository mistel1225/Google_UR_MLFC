    "content": "The camera audio quality is terrible, I've already read many posts in the community telling that a software update/upgrade would fix that, however I did all upgrades/updates and nothing improved in this matter yet.\n\nAudio is very very low in comparison with other brands, mainly when recording outside in open environments.\n\nCan someone could help with that?",
