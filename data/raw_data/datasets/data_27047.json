    "content": "My pixel was broken and I sent it to google to have alook and hopefully fix the issue. One thing that I have noticed is that I forgot my driving licence and my bank card in the phone case that I sent with. And now I even noticed that I've been charged from that barclay card that I haven't used for a month.\n\nCan someone get in touch with me? I would think that google would send you back your docs if that would happen especially when on your driving licence it clearly shows your name and your address",
