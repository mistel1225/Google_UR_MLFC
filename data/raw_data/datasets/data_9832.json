Stuff like \"Congratulations you've done the 5 millionth Google search and you've won...\" \n\nI am really careful with this device, no sketchy sites, the only apps downloaded are from the play store and are very widely used, no games, no media beyond Spotify and Soundcloud, etc. I haven't clicked any links in emails that weren't from known sources, etc. Is my phone compromised? When it happened while using chrome I just thought it was an annoying pop up and swiped back, but then I got one while not using chrome, and keep seeing them. I always swipe back when they show up. Here is one I got while reading the local news site, KSL.com. The address shown in the bar is definitely not familiar, and I was on their secure site reading an article when suddenly that popped up.",
