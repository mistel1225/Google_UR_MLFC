    "content": "Try to turn it off: I press button and when I tap on \"Power off\" a box appears saying \"Do you want to reboot in safe mode..\"  Whether I tap on \"reboot\" or \"OK\" it won't turn off: it does but after umpteen attempts. Can I get rid of the prompt \" Do you want to reboot....\" and when I press the power button I can tap on \"power off\"",
