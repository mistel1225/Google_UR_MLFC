    "content": "This just started happening. I'm on a call and another call comes in, rings through, and disconnects my first caller. It's really annoying. I'm using a Pixel2 XL, Android version 10. Is anyone else having this issue? Is it just a setting that needs to be adjusted or is it a problem with the Android 10 update?\nThanks for any help you can provide.",
