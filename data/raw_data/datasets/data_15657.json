    "content": "Hello,\n\nI am from Portugal and I bought my Google Pixel 3 at UK, on google store.\nI need support to repair my Google Pixel because the charge port are not working well and the pixel sometimes charge, other times do not.\n\nI already search all the web, Google Sites, Google Help Center, Warrantly Center and I cannot contact google nowhere! The chat options is not available. The call option is not available. All the pages converge to the point of call or chat that is no available.\nExamples:\nhttps://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/7109524\nhttps://store.google.com/gb/repair\n\nIt is a shame for a customer spent a hours and hours searching for support or solution and nothing! The suport for a google product is very disappointed.\n\nThe only solution that I found was writing here!\nThanks in advance for any response.\nRegards",
