    "content": "I recoded this video of the problem. It's on my personal facebook account.  I have no idea how to describe this problem other than recording this video.\nThe only thing i remember, is plugging it into my truck's usb data port and the screen shown really bright and it froze. I had to hold the power button for longer than normal i thought. It finally turned off. I restarted it, and it's been like this ever since. It works, and there is no performance lag if I use the phone. But the pixel stripes are really annoying.\nurl: https://www.facebook.com/kealii.z.ballao/videos/10220388189155916/",
