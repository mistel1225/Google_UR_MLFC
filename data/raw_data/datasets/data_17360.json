    "content": "My problem isn't with the device, it's something with the settings I believe. I use samsung galaxy buds, and the first time I connected them to the phone to use over facetime, but after that, I was never able to put the phone on speaker mode during calls or use facetime without the buds or some sort of headphones. I tried turning up the volume, and even at full volume I couldn't hear the other person unless my ear was up against the phone anyways. I tried turning off bluetooth and that didn't work either. I ended up just giving up. Sometimes, when I would disconnect and reconnect my ear buds, to fix a connection error, I would hear the other person for a slight second, only for the volume to go down (although the volume was all the way up) does anyone know how to fix this?",
