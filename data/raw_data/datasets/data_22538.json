    "content": "So on gesture navigation on the Pixel, I used to be able to tap the home button (pill) to go back to the home screens from any app, and then tap it again to back to the primary home screen.  I would do this if I quickly wanted to get back to my main home screen for some reason or other (I like to reset my view for example).\n\nThis no longer works - a home button tap takes you back to the last home screen you were on, but I cannot find a way to get back to the main/primary home screen apart from swiping back to it and it's getting really annoying!",
