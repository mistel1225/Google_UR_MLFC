    "content": "With other phones, the Roav Bolt (Google Assistant car adapter) will auto connect to the phone when starting the car.  With the Pixel 3a, I have to go into bluetooth settings > previously connected devices > Roav Bolt and manually connect every time I start the car.  It stands to reason a google assistant and a google phone should work better together.  Any suggested fixes for this?",
