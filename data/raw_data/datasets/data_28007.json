    "content": "My assistant isn't listening at all. I don't mean \"Okay Google\" I mean at all. I'll squeeze my phone and it doesn't hear me. It just sits loading until it takes up all of my screen since it thinks I didn't say anything. I turned my phone on and off and then I found the assistant app, uninstalled it and tried again and nothing. Anytime I search for help I only get results related to specifically \"Okay Google\" so that's why I'm posting here.",
