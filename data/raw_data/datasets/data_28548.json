    "content": "Last night I set up a wake up alarm for 7:30 am. I have a rule for Do not Disturb that turns on at 10 pm through 9 am, behavior set to \"Muted, but allow alarms\". About an hour after I went to sleep I woke up to hearing my email alert. I looked at the phone, DND was OFF. I manually set it to On and went back to sleep. At about 4 am my email goes off AGAIN. Sure enough, DND was off AGAIN!!!\n\nIs this a known bug? If you set up an alarm after DND turns on automatically it then turns it off?\n\nThanks",
