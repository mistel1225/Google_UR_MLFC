    "title": "Pixel 2 XL \"eats\" through every pair of usb-c earbuds/headphones I buy!",
    "content": "I got my pixel 2 XL a couple years ago and over all have been pretty happy with it, my whole audio situation with the phone is a nightmare. At first I got the first gen pixel buds with my phone but they were the WORST headphones I've ever had no joke. The audio was fine, it never charged!! It was a constant headache to painstakingly always check if it was charging and then trying all the little reset things etc etc. I finally exchanged them for a new pair and they were exactly the same, they had the same battery issues (I don't even use them anymore). This lead me to seek out buying a usb-c pair of headphones which overall I prefer. I bought a nice pair off Amazon only to have the audio cut out in one bud under a week, then the audio completely stopped. I blamed this on the earbuds, returned them and bought a new pair from a different company. I've had it less than a month and already the right earbud is dead??! Also I've had two dongles because they both \"broke\". Background: I am very careful with my electronics, I do use my earbuds every day but I've used the hell out of almost identical earbuds on all of my iPhones and they lasted a really long time. Never cutting out under a month? I have this gut feeling it's not really the earbuds but my phone. Idk what that would mean tho? Does anyone have this problem too?  Am I not using the right earbud brands for my phone? (The earbuds I bought were not especially cheap, they ranged around $25-$30 and they were all brand new)",
