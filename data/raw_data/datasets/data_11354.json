    "content": "I just noticed this a couple days ago. Normally the weather widget I had on my home screen, suddenly has disappeared and is nowhere to be seen. Apart from that oddity normally I swipe right from my main home screen and it would show all of the news google had, doesn't pop up. At the bottom of said screen where the google search bar is, instead of normally searching Google when I tap it instead or some odd reason it searches only through my apps.\n\nIntermittently though, assuming maybe it's something I have maybe done, the error messages pop up for like half a second then disappear, or when I attempt to use certain apps that normally work fine they quickly pop up then vanish. Not sure as to what's going on as I updated my device 2 weeks ago and nothing happened then. Not sure if anyone has run into the same issue but would like to get some input/advice on what I can do to get my phone working as it should be.",
