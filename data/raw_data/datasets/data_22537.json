    "title": "Cannot access \"Tips & Support\" section in the settings",
    "content": "When I tap on \"Tips & support\" in Settings, it goes nothing and jumps back to Home Screen. I tried to clear all cache and user data in Google and Google Plat Services but it doesn't help. Also, I tried to option \"Tips and support\" after switched to Safe Mode and the result is the same (jump back to Home Screen). Is there anything I can do or try without hard reset my phone (it's annoying..............) Thanks",
