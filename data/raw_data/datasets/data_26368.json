    "content": "Got an update today (assuming it's this one: https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/18553639?msgid=18553639).\nI restarted my phone due to slow data speeds, and when it turned back on, it started a software update. It's been stuck in a boot loop for the last 45 minutes. I'm afraid to do anything with it because I just took a ton of vacation photos today and don't want to lose them.",
