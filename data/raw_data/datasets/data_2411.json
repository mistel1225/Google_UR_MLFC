    "content": "I have a pixel4 XL I love my phones I keep my phone in my bag not in a pocket. today I have noticed the white plastic /backing has started to come apart from the black sides or back. I have never had an issue like this with any of my other phones previously I think my phone is just over a year old. What should I do Its like the glue has come unstuck. top back right hand corner.\n\nMany thanks\nDave",
