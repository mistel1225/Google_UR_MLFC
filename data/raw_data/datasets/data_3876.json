    "title": "After Pairing my Pixel 4a with my car, infotainment of the car crashes (BMW i3)",
    "content": "Every time when I pair the pixel 4a with my car, the infotainment of the car crashes. BMW did software updates and even replaced the head unit - no success.\nWhen I use a different smartphone I don't have any issue, it seems to be related to my phone.\nI did a factory reset of the Pixel - no success.\n\nAll updates are installed, running Android 11.\n\nAny ideas? Thank you.\nAsked the support but they forwarded me to the community.",
