    "content": "Sometimes, colours on my phone just shift more into black. Everything that's dark gets darker, while lighter colors seem to stay as they are, kinda like someone turned on high-contrast mode.\n\nI cannot figure out why this happens, and don't know how to reverse it. It's extremely annoying, as darker greys get hard to differentiated, and I don't have a way to e.g. check how exactly pictures look before sending them to someone.\n\nThis only affects how colours are displayed - if I take e.g. a screenshot and send it to someone, they will see the colours as normal (see pictures, which are a screenshot of my screen vs a photo taken of my screen).\n\nI already tried enabling/disabling anything related to display settings like the night light, bedtime mode, different color modes, etc., all to no avail. They work fine, but the baseline that everything dark gets darker stays the same.\n\nAny advice is welcome.",
