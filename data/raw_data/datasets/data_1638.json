    "content": "My screen has just started showing a line from the top to the bottom of the screen. It isnt noticeable when the screen is black, eg when on the always on display. And is far more noticeable when the background is white. \n\nI know that it isnt a crack due to how straight it is. The line also doesnt appear in my screenshots.\n\nHas anyone else experienced this issue?",
