    "content": "I want to remove search field from a bottom of my google pixel 4a 5G it takes a place on display and I'm not using it. I didn't find obvious way to remove it. I even disabled a google service but it didn't help. It's really annoying.\nI was advised to do the following on android community, but this didn't help:\nTap and hold your home screen. \nA new menu will appear. \nAt the top of the screen will be the Google Search bar. \nTap and hold it and an option to remove will appear.\nThere is no remove option.",
