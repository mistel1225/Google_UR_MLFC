    "content": "Well it's one of those posts when I say \"I forgot my pin and i can't reset it\", but Find My device service can't reach my device. My friend changed my pin and of course he can't remember it, so I tough that i will comeback home and I will use Find My Device to reset pin or erase phone's memory. I logged into mentioned service and it said \"Can't reach device\" and \"Last seen: 2 June 2019\" which is today. I remember that FindMyDevice was turned on.(I've got Android Q Beta and phone bought in Verizon)",
