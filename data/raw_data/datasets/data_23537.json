    "content": "Hi - My pixel 3XL just keeps on closing majority of apps which were opened. Even if I've opened 8-9 apps ,to my dismay I find that only 2-3 apps are running in the background and rest all of them have been closed over a period of time. This happens every time. Is this a problem with my pixel 3 XL handset or it's happening for everyone?I thought that the RAM management issue was fixed but apparently it's not!  It has the latest version of updates March 5 2019, installed . \n\nAlso Settings- Tips & Support is crashing all the time whenever I try to open it. Please help!",
