    "content": "Whenever I take a screen shot, it now appears in the bottom right-hand corner of my screen. This is ridiculously annoying anytime I want to take multiple screenshots back to back. In the attached screenshot you can see both the setting I want to turn off (outlined in red) as well as a google support thread I looked to for answers; unfortunately, the settings in my phone seem to be different than those noted in the forum.",
