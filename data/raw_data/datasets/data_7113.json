    "content": "I've recently bought a Pixel 4A and after installing the latest software and security updates, all of a sudden the touchscreen is erratically unresponsive everytime I try to text. Yesterday I couldn't even enter my pin code to get into my phone, it was infuriating. But it's inconsistent in the areas of the screen that are affected. \nAre there are any fixes to this problem? Telco already has confirmed it's not a hardware issue.",
