    "content": "When I ask my phone to \"open spotify\" or \"play X on spotify\" it will with a) do nothing or b) open up spotify on my android TV.\n\nIs there a way I can get any commands I issue via assistant to only apply to the phone (and to get them to also actually work consistantly) sometimes it will register the command but won't actualy open spotify and start playing?!\n\nThis seemed to work just fine on the Huawei Mate 10 Pro I've moved from - annoying that a google device seems harder to get working with the google assistant!",
