    "content": "My phone is a Pixel XL not Pixel XL 3.  Android version 10. I have been religiously making system backups using Google backup to google drive.  I login and see the backups, but there is no *intuitive* way to figure out to get that data BACK onto my phone after a factory reset.  I know the question is asked if you want to copy data during the initial restart - but duh! if you bypass that how do you then restore?  The most basic backup and restore systems allow users to control this stuff.  Not Google!  All of the videos and tech notes from Google do not show how this is accomplished, yet, they constantly harangue users in the apps to backup to google cloud.  What's the point if you can't get that data back onto the phone?",
