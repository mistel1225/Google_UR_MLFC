    "content": "As I was going on my phone, I noticed that apps such as youtube, reddit, had no audio. I thought this was odd, so I checked if my alarm audio works, and it does. I checked my ringtone, and it works, but when I went to the play music app, the same downloaded ringtone doesn't work. I've tried restarting, safe mode, checked all the sound volumes, and even factory reset it, but its the same. Media audio doesn't work, only system audio.\nwhat do? ps. only had this phone from the 1st of september, no cracks, drops, and also audio from the headphone jack works fine.",
