    "content": "Last week I ported my number to Xfinity Mobile and was able to use my Pixel 3a XL. The ringing stopped on incoming calls. I could see the pop-up caller ID, just no ring. If I go to sounds and pick my ringtone I can hear it fine. I can hear text & email notifications just fine. Xfinity did not have a clue, so I reactivated my account with Google Fi yesterday. The same problem still exists. DND is off, and all of my other sound notifications are fine. I had no problem until I ported to Xfinity. Any help would be greatly appreciated.",
