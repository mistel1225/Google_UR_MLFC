    "content": "I just changed my phone to Pixel 4a and realized that I couldn't access anything in the android/data file folder.  There is a game I play that I can only transfer the game record by copying and pasting the game file from my old phone into the the game folder in the new phone.  Inability to access android/data file means I lose all my game record.  Quick search through the forum shows that this accessibility issue comes from Android 11 OS upgrade.  Google needs to address this.",
