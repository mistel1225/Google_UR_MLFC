    "content": "I've told Assistant to play an album using VLC, but it tells me I need to set the default music app for Assistant. I tried following the instructions it gives, but they don't match what I see on the screen; ie: there's nothing in the top right corner, and there's no Google Assistant app, let alone Setting for Google Assistant!",
