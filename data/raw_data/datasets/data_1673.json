    "content": "When I plug my phone into a USB type C to type C cable from Google, my car says the device is not responding. Have tried all troubleshooting options with Google and the dealership. It is definitely the phone that is the issue. Has anyone else had this issue? I'm feeling pretty hopeless and I am starting to think about getting a different phone, but I love my pixel! Help!!",
