    "content": "I've tried everything and I can't fix it. When I'm connected to bluetooth with my wireless headphones I have always been able to adjust the headphones own volume using the volume button on my headphones and I could also adjust the bluetooth volume on my phone using my phone's volume buttons, I could adjust each independently and now since I've upgraded to android 11 I can't do that. I have also notice that when I connect my headphones to my phone, I have to shut them off and turn them back on again in order for my phone to acknowledge that my headphones are connected via bluetooth. Also when I am connected to my cars stereo via bluetooth, since the update, the volume slider on my phone doesn't change my musics volume at all. It either turns the music on or off no matter if the volume is in the middle on my phone or if it's all the way up. I can only adjust the volume on my stereo and I want to be able to adjust the volume with my phone sometimes. There are clearly many issues with bluetooth since this update. So to reiterate, I can't adjust volume when connected to bluetooth independently on my phone and headphones and when connected via bluetooth to my cars stereo, turning the volume on my phone up and down does nothing. I have factory reset my phone, I have restarted it, shut the phone down, I have booted in safe mode, I even deleted and readded all my bluetooth devices. I have done everything. And I've done it all multiple times now",
