    "content": "I got my phone stolen and the industry seems very connivant and relaxed with this situation.\n\nI called the carrier which says that products bought to Google from their own Google Store cannot be blocked through IMEI by them, that I should call Google to block it... \n\nBut Google only has a very few insufficient options that are only about blocking thieves from reading data.\n\nWhat is the phone number or the way that I can contact Google so they block their own product so at least this makes more difficult for thieves to benefit from this situation?",
