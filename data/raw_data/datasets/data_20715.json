    "content": "I bought the google pixel 4 xl a week ago. and it keeps accumulating dust and small hairs when its in my pocket. They stick out from between the screen and the phone itself. I clean it often but it is a major pain. Also some are not sticking out. Others i can see that are between the crack of the screen and phone. Is this a defective phone? or is this normal?",
