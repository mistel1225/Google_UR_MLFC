    "content": "My 20 yr old son passed away a few weeks ago and I've been trying to unlock his phone since then. I'm scared to reboot it cause I don't want to lose any pictures that he might have taken and I don't know if he had it backed up. The service for the phone is turned off. He used a security pattern, I don't know if that helps. Tried talking to google but they referred me to here. So if anyone has any ideas I would greatly apricate the help. Thank you, a grieving mother",
