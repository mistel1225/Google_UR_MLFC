    "title": "During the conversation, the interlocutor echoes his voice.",
    "content": "I bought google pixel 2 three years ago. Everything was fine until yesterday. At the interlocutor during a telephone conversation, an echo of his own voice appears. I'm fine with the sound. There is no echo and I hear the interlocutor perfectly. But the interlocutor hears a slight echo.\n\n\nI noticed that when using a headset (headphones), the interlocutorâ€™s echo disappears and he hears me perfectly. All is well and when using \"loudspeaker\". The interlocutor echoes only when I communicate by attaching my Google pixel 2 to my ear.\n\n\nWhen using Telegram, Viber, Whatsapp echo is not observed. Everything is good both when recording sound on a Google camera and during sound recording.\n\n\n\nWho knows how to solve this issue?",
