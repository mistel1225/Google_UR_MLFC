    "content": "I can only start a Hotspot on my phone when I am at home connected to WiFi.\nThe second I leave my home network it turns off. If I try to start a Hotspot when not connected to WiFi I am given the notice to 'call customer service to subscribe'\nAfter hours of service calls it hasn't fixed the problem, but I am assured I do have 10gb of Hotspot data.\n\nI have service through StraightTalk on the Verizon sim",
