    "content": "About two days ago the audio on my phone stopped working completely, when playing whatsapp voice messages or any other audio it doesn't make any sound. Volume is up, Bluetooth off, not on silent mode, apps are up to date, I've factory reset my phone but the audio still isn't working. When I connect my phone to my car Bluetooth I have no problem playing audio then through the car speakers but when I disconnect again the phone still won't give me any sound. Has anyone had a similar issue? Please help!",
