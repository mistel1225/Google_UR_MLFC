    "content": "I have been using third part apps to edit photos for over a year. These have always been saved in perspective folders: Photoshop Express in the Photoshop Express folder. This helps me manage my work flow. Suddenly images saved from these apps have stopped showing up in respective folders. In fact of I hit save and immediately go to the folder I seen them there for a second but then watch them vanish. Any help would be greatly appreciated.",
