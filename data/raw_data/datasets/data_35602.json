    "title": "Bad autocorrect",
    "content": "The autocorrect changes correct words to unintelligble ones every single time I use it and it is not because I saved the wrong word or any other user error. Also, I turned it off but it is still doing it. And it is a common problem, so I assume you know... Any chance you'll fix it? It's so bad I just quit texting as much to avoid having to use it",
