    "content": "I've always been a Google fanboy and was really pleased with my new Pixel 3 when I purchased it last month. \n\nSadly, after 3 weeks of ownership, the screen began to flash violently and brightly when used in low light conditions.  After a chat with google support,  I tried safe mode, no change. Then a factory reset, which solved the problem for 1 week, before it retuned even worse.\n\nI have RMA'd my shiny new defective Pixel 3 back to Google's facility in Poland. It took 4 days to get there and now I'm in the dark. I have contacted Google support via chat twice, but they can't tell me anything, other than scripted responses about how valuable I am as a customer.\n\nThen I started googling the flashing screen issue and I see this is a MASSIVE issue with this phone. People are saying they are on their 3rd RMA and the problem is still there. I'm also reading that people who sent a brand new, pristine phone are receiving reconditioned units back. \n\nSo in summary:\n\nWhat are Google doing to address this very widespread screen defect?\n\nWhat's happening with my own particular RMA? ( RMA02375194 )\n\nWill I get a new Pixel 3 back, or a second hand one?\n\nWhat are the odds that I will get a defective screen on my replacement Pixel 3?\n\nIn the meantime, I'm stuck with an old HTC, that is super slow, but at least it works and doesn't blind me randomly at night. Seriously regret buying this $800 phone now.  Premium product?",
