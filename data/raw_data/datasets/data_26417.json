    "content": "Hiya, \n\nI wonder if someone with knowledge of screen burn can help.\n\nI sent my phone off to Carphone warehouse to be traded in, and have had an email back to say that the payment has been lowered due to the phone having screen burn. This wasn't on the phone before hand as you can see from the picture this is something that stands out. \n\nI guess I just want someone to confirm that it's screen burn, or worst case that it's not and might of been dropped in transit.\n\nThanks,\n\nGraham ",
