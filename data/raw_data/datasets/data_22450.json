    "content": "I have a Pixel 4,\nWhile i was using it, it randomly hanged and restarted.\nSince then I have been unable to start my phone beyond the lock screen.\n\nHere's what happens:\nPhone boots > It asks for the phone password > I enter the password > Phone unlocks > I use the phone for around 10 seconds > It hangs and restarts again.\nWhen it restarts, if I don't enter the password and remain on the lock screen, it does not hang.\nSo basically I'm stuck right now on the lock screen of the phone. I tried the safe mode. Phone hangs and restarts there also after I unlock it.\n\nIf I stay on the lock screen, I'm even able to pick up incoming calls.\n\nI guess it must be a software issue because if it were to be caused by a faulty app, atleast the safe mode would work.\n\nAnyone..??? Please help......",
