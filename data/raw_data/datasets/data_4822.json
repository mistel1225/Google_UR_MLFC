    "title": "Several Apps Crash to Home Screen",
    "content": "Several apps on my phone, such as Google, Gmail, Amazon, and Carrier Services are crashing. If opened they will remain static on their start screen for about 3 seconds before crashing to the home screen with no error messages. Opening the app from the recent apps tray repeats the issue. I have followed all troubleshooting steps provided by Google except a factory reset with no resolution (close app, restart phone, force stop, clear cache/data, uninstall/reinstall).",
