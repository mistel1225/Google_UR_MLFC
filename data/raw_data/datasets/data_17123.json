    "content": "My alarm turns completely off for all future repeats when I swipe right or use the volume buttons to turn off the alarm currently going off.  It says \"Alarm Off.\"  I then miss the alarm the following day because it is no longer active. I have to go into the app and turn it back on for it to work the next day. It makes choosing repeat useless.\nI do have volume keys set to 'Dismiss.'\nHow do I set my phone so I can dismiss rather than completely turn off the alarm for the entire week?",
