    "content": "I am not techie, I've tried and tried to do this and the helps I've found , don't.  To share some photos OFF MY phone, I needed to disable cookies ( I did) and unlock the phone - I tried.   Google keeps making me use Google apps or prompts, when I probably would want to use my own Windows 10 photo sharing app. Please advise, this has taken me 1/2 a day already. Thanks",
