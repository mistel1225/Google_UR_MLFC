    "content": "I am trying to turn off the text message preview BUT still want to be notified when I get a text.  I have tried all the options suggested online but on my pixel 4XL it does not appear to give me this feature option.  Like for example when I get a text and my phone is locked I dont want the message to show what is written but rather just notify me that I have a message from Person X. please help this is very annoying when I am out with people and do not want private message showing up on my phone while it is locked on like the table where anyone can see it!",
