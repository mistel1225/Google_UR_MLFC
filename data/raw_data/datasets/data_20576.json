    "content": "I've faced the problem of Telegram incoming calls in Do Not Disturb mode. The problem is when I turn 'override DND' on for Telegram incoming calls, there is no call sound. And when I have missed call, override DND becomes disable.\n\nTo reproduce this bug you need:\n1. Enable DND mode;\n2. Turn 'override DND' on for Telegram incoming calls in Android notification settings;\n3. Call yourself from someone else's phone (there will be no sound - this is the bug);\n4. Check Telegram incoming calls in Android notification settings (there will be disabled 'override DND mode' - this is the bug).\n\nHere's the video I recorded to demonstrate you this bug - https://photos.app.goo.gl/nToCKJ8zzquuzLcw8.\n\nDoes someone else faced this bug? Is that Telegram bug or Android DND mode? Can it be fixed?\n\nP.S. Sorry for my grammar mistakes, I keep learning. :)",
