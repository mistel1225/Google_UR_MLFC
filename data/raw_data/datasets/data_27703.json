    "content": "After Android 10 update when I record video with the main camera with Google Assistant Voice Match on I can hear a hiss in the background. When I turn the voice match off it stops. When using the front camera the problem is gone. There are several people reporting this issue on XDA as well. I guess it is just some bug in the fresh Android 10 optimisation, please fix it asap.",
