    "content": "For the love of god I can't get external microphone working on the Pixel 5. I tried 4 different dongles including 2 with in-built DAC, including 1 dongle made by Google (the older one I assume, worked with Pixel 3) and nothing works. Why the hell do they make it so hard... I can't easily buy the new adapter since I'm not in a country that they sell in anymore and I don't even know if it would solve the issues.",
