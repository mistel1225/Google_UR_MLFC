    "content": "My Pixel XL just turned off while I was navigating back home. It had 77% battery then, the phone was normal except for some restarts since I opted out of the Android Q beta. \nBut now when I try holding the power and volume down button, all it does is vibrate after 48 to 60 seconds and nothing else happens. \n\nPlease help!",
