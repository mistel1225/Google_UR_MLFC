    "title": "Youtube App no Longer Working on Google Pixel 2",
    "content": "Shortly after my Google Pixel 2 XL automatically updated (Android 11 update) my YouTube app stopped working; it would continuously load, and then eventually tell me that I was not connected to the internet and was offline, even though I was connected to my wifi.\n\nI looked up what the issue was and how to fix it, but all steps I have taken do not work. I tried restarting my phone, clearing both the cache and data on YouTube, disabling the app, force stopping it, updating the app, and uninstalling the app (but because Google runs YouTube, the app is a default system app, meaning I cannot uninstall the app). \n\nI have checked all community conversations and have looked on Google Help pages, but all \"solutions\" are the same steps that have repeatedly failed to fix the issue. Can anyone help? Thanks.",
