    "title": "Feature request: I would like to be able to swipe left and see a feed of upcoming PERSONAL events",
    "content": "The 'swipe left on main home screen' is a great gesture to get a 'feed of relevant information'. But in this time of people attempting to minimize phone distraction, I would like that Feed to only contain personally relevant information: i.e. Weather, Calendar, Stocks, Upcoming flights. i.e. the exact feed supplied by 'Updates' in Google App. \n\nCurrently I can swipe left to Google app then manually select the 'Updates' icon (which is a strange Icon btw - what is it meant to be? An old-school desk 'inbox' with stuff popping out of it??). But what I want is for swipe left to drop me straight into the Google App Updates Screen.",
