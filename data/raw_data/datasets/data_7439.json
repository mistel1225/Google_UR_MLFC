    "title": "Back Button Sensitivity Out of Whack",
    "content": "Since the January update, the back button sensitivity moved to the right for non-Google apps (e.g. Whatsapp, Signal, etc).\nWhile in the home screen or on Google apps, when I tap on the back arrow it works fine.\nWhen I launch a non-Google app, I have to click way to the right for the back button to work.\nI have reported the issue a few times but got no response yet. This is a major annoyance, especially for lefties.",
