    "content": "Hi \n\nI'm reaching out to the community with despair and after having gone through a lot of back and forth (and mental torture) with the Google support team. \n\nMy Google Pixel 3 XL stopped working and went into a restart loop on Nov 8th. I contacted Google support and they agreed to send a replacement device. I received a new device but it was Pixel 3A. I again reached out to Google support and they took a really long time to get back to me. In that week, they called me at 11:30 pm at night when I was asleep, and promised me on several occasions to call me back and they never did. It was the worst customer support experience for me in my entire life. Despite all this, I never got the help I needed. \n\nI never received a replacement device and I kept reaching out to Google via email, phone, chat and Twitter (I have a proof for all these interactions). Google has now charged me $1257.00 for not returning the faulty phone. The agreement all along was that I'll get the new phone and then send the fault phone back. No one is still replying to me. What else can I do? The only next step I see is to get my bank and their legal team involved. \n\nPlease help!",
