    "content": "What's going on to the stock of the Pixel 5? It's been four days since it was last in stock in Canada and when it was, it would often glitch the phone out of my cart. I've been checking the site now every hour to see if it is in stock as I really need a new phone. I've called Google reps and they said they can't give me a timeframe or even an email to notify me when it is back in stock. \n\nIt disappoints me that Google can't handle the demand at the most important time. Now I am leaning towards the OnePlus because at least they have constant and predictable stock.",
