    "content": "Hi all,\n\nI have got a annoying problem nwith my pixel 2. The charger does not fit securely. When moving phone the charger tends to become loose and fall out.\n\nI did take out the dust, but my charger still does not fit properly. I have the same issue with every charger... this is not a charger problem.\n\nThanks upfront for your help",
