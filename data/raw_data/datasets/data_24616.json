    "content": "About every other day, my Pixel 4XL will be somewhere in the 60%-70% battery range when I get the pop up saying my battery is getting low and it drains all the way down to 0% and shuts down. I ran a bug report in the developer options and it's showing the battery capacity as 12417mAh which is obviously nowhere near correct.",
