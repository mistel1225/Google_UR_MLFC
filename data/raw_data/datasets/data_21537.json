    "content": "How can I fix so that my froncamera/selfiecamera uses the HLDR/Visual core feature when taking selfies within Snapchat?\n\nThe back camera takes amazing pictures within Snapchat, but, the frontcamera is just not good. I hope there is a way to fix this, and that I have missed an update, a certain setting or something to take better selfies within Snapchat.\n\nI have the latest update from Snapchat (April 20th, 2020)\nI have the latest version of Android (Android version 10. Android security patch level March 5, 2020. Google play system update March 1, 2020)",
