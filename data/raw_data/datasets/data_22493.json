    "content": "After the March update, everyday when I get in my car and get Android Auto going with Google Play Music, it works but it randomly stops the songs currently playing and I have to press play again, does it quite often and it didn't do it before the March update. Can anyone help me out? All apps are up to date, already unpaired and paired my phone... I'm lost and it's driving me nuts. Please help me out. Thank you in advance.",
