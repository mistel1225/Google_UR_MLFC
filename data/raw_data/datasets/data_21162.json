    "content": "I have tried all the steps the support center has offered by Google and by all the users is the community but none of them helped the issue and I did some more digging it is not just my device it is all devices from pixel 1 to pixel 3 that are affected by this. From my research in the community center on this Google support website Google is not doing anything about this. I hope developers read this message and try to fix this issue please.",
