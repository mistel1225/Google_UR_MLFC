    "title": "My google pixel 4 vibrates at random with no notification",
    "content": "My phone vibrates for seemingly no reason, I've seen this issue for various pixels on a variety of stes and the only solution is to run it in safe mode.  That is not even close to a solution, I just want my phone to vibrate when someone texts or calls, that's it. I know there's settings for the phone, and then more hidden settings within each app, and I've turned off notifications for all of them.  Is there settings besides in the phone settings or in the app settings?  Your design team deserves an award for coming up with two but if they've figured out a way to add a 3rd or 4th layer of settings then they need promotions too.",
