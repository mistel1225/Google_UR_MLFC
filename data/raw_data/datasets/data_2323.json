    "title": "Battery drain after inserting 2nd sim card into pixel 4 XL. Battery % 'unknown''",
    "content": "T-mobile sent me a sim card. After I installed it my battery always says unknown if I go to the battery settings page. In the top bar it always says 50%. Also the option to display the % # isn't even visible. Even after I took the sim card out the problem still persists. The battery still not keep a charge and dies within a minute of me unplugging it. Earlier today it appeared to return to normal. I even watched an hour of a movie off the charger. But now it's back to saying unknown battery status.",
