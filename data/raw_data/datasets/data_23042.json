    "content": "After months of consistent flawless operation, the fingerprint reader on my Pixel 3 XL started to have issues. It doesn't recognize my fingers half of the time.\nI cleaned the sensor, although it was not dirty at all. I always keep my phone clean.\nI deleted all 4 fingers I had set up since day one and created them again. Even while I was creating them again, the phone often would not accept my taps on the reader.",
