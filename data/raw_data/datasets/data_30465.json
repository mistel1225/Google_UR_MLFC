    "content": "I want to prevent cold callers from being able to leave voicemails.\nI have added the callers number to my block list and treated as spam etc, yet they are still able to go directly to my voicemail and leave voice messages!\nI get no ring notification for their call, because it's blocked and treated as spam, but I do get the voicemail left icon display, once they have left their message!\nI have done some research and it appears that Google has an app that can deal with this, called Google Voice, yet this only currently works in the USA!\nI bought a Google phone to be able to be better protected and to receive regular updates etc, it seems ridiculous to me not to be able to utilise this Google app on a Google phone here in the UK!\nI'm really fed up with these regular unwanted and unsolicited voicemail calls and want them stopped!",
