    "title": "Watching videos, after an ad pops up my sound changes. Or if I jump ahead it does as well. 3XL phone",
    "content": "Anytime I watch a video whether it be Facebook or YouTube if I have an ad pop up after the ad finished the sound changes. It loses all bass and depth and gets really tinny sounding. I've tried updates, I've changed settings and made sure it wasn't buffer lag by checking it on LTE and Wifi. But it remains. Will not do it with stored music or videos on phone. Pixel 3XL",
