    "content": "My dad has a Pixel 3a and was streaming his church service on chrome via an embedded youtube video (so definitely not 4K). During the 25 minute video Chrome reported 10GB of data usage. He called his provider but they're stumped as to why this happened. It's reporting on his device data usage not just his mobile account.",
