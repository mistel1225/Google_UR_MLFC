    "title": "Problem with Wi-fi Hotspot. Can connect my Mac computer, but can't navigate the internet. Never ha",
    "content": "Have tried to change the hotspot name, re-establish wi-fi settings, even phone settings, also re-join wi-fi network in my Mac. It hasn't been posible to navigate since the last 10 days, it has happened before and has fixed itself with no apparent way. Never happened with my old iPhone 4, never happens now when connecting to my wife and daughter's phones. Very frustrating. Need internet in my computer for working. Thanks for your help.",
