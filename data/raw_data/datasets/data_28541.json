    "title": "Pixel 2 XL crashes when plugged. Tired everything. Google support is awful. Still in warranty. HELP",
    "content": "My phone crashes every time it is plugged in. I have reset the phone, tried numerous plugs.  Support is giving me the run around.  They 1st said I could bring it to ubreak ifix for warranty repairs and ubreak ifix says no.  Now they want me to send my phone back for repair but say it can take up to 15 days.  I use this for business.  I can't be without it.  Any ideas?  This type of service will stop by from buying any Google products in the future.",
