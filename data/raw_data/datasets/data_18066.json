    "title": "Do pixel phones' usb-c ports have built-in surge protection (ie: against USB killers)",
    "content": "I've googled this question a million times and can't find an answer. If I were to accidentally plug a USB killer into my pixel 3a, or if my phone was charging and my house was struck by lightning, what would happen? Would it fry the USB-C port? Would it outright kill the thing? Sorry if it's a stupid question, I don't want to take any chances, as this is my only reliable phone.",
