    "content": "I've a strange problem here.\nI've always used \"Neat Calendar\" widget for an agenda on my main screen. I've been using this this since my Galaxy S2 days!\nHowever, on the Pixel 5, it does not show my contacts birthday calendar. I've tried unsetting and resetting the calendars to display etc. no joy. All other calendars show/hide as expected.\nI then installed \"Event Flow Calendar\" widget, and this has exactly the same problem. Will not display my contact's birthdays.\nThe Google widget works ok however.\n\nI looked back on my previous phone (Huawei Mate P20), and the birthdays still show just fine on both of these widgets.\nI thought it may be a pixel launcher issue, so I tried it using Nova launcher, and still no joy.\n\nI'm thinking this may be an android 11 problem for these apps.\nIts a shame if it is, as I dont think Neat Calendar is developed any more.\n\nJust wondering if anyone else having a similar issue with these (or indeed other) 3rd party calendar agenda types of widget for contact's birthdays.\n\nCheers",
