    "content": "Hey,\nI just bought a Pixel 3 XL from a big retailer in Germany (Saturn). I got a 50 Euro discount because the package has already been opened. I just charged it and saw that the bootloader is unlocked. I now wonder, whether I should return it or if this can happen, is not a security threat and can be undone. I'm kind of worried now. I suppose this is nothing that would happen with a factory new google device?\n\nBest wishes,\nSebastian",
