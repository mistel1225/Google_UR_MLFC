    "title": "Not able to find contacts by searching on keypad in phone app",
    "content": "I am not able to search for a contact by typing the name on the keypad in the phone app unless I type the entire name. But I am able to search on the search bar at the top with only a few letters. For example :- in the phone app, if I want to search for 'varun US', I need to type the entire name 'varunUS' in the keypad for that contact to show up, but when I use the search bar at the top, the contact shows up as soon as I type 'var'.\nI have attached 3 photos for reference. In the first pic, the contact doesn't show up even after I type 'varun'. In the second pic it shows up after I type 'varunUS'. In the third pic it shows up after I type only 'var' in the search bar.\nThis issue never happened on any of my old Android phones, is this a setting or something?",
