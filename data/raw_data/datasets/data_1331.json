    "content": "My Pixel 3a front (selfie) camera stopped working in late November 2020.  I tried different camera apps, doing a factory reset on the phone, and all of the other troubleshooting steps from Google.  None of them made any difference, so I was advised to send my phone to a Google authorized repair partner (Ubreakifix was the only option in Canada) for out of warranty repair.  They replaced the front camera module and midframe (which I assume was damaged in disassembly) and it worked great until March 2021.  Suddenly the front camera stopped functioning again - giving me the same \"Something went wrong\" message in the camera app when I try to switch to the front camera.  As in November, it doesn't work in other apps either.  In early April, I noticed the bottom right corner of the display is lifting away from the midframe and I started getting \"phone is getting too warm\" messages occasionally when using the phone in bright sun.  I'm rather frustrated as I spent about $250 for the repair and it seems like the camera modules are prone to failure based on anecdotal evidence online.  I'm not thrilled about the idea of shelling out more to repair this again, only to wonder if the camera module will fail again.  I'm going to try to make my case to the Ubreakifix franchise to give me a break on it, but since it's outside of their 90 day warranty, I don't think I have a leg to stand on.  I do suspect something was wrong with the replacement midframe/adhesive or application thereof since the display is separating from it, but I don't know if that's a factor in the second camera failure.  Any thoughts?",
