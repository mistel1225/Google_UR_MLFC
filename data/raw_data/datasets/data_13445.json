    "title": "Battery Drain and Constant Reboot Pixel 2",
    "content": "Battery drain extremely high after October 2020 security patch which became worse after implementing Android 11. I can watch the battery percentage drop like a countdown timer. Phone is not hot. \n\nFollowed the conventional steps, including factory reset as new, safe mode, etc.  No improvement. \n\nPhone also constantly reboots at around 50% and is therefore unusable. \n\nDid two chat sessions with support. Google's answer is to send it in for repair. BTW the phone is 3 months out of warranty. Unbelievable, I expected more transparency from Google. This issue is blowing up the internet. \n\nMy wife's pixel 2 has the exact same issue.   Neither of us have tunein installed.",
