    "content": "I did a factory reset to my phone and when I set up the phone again, some apps like Samsung Accessory Services, or the Galaxy Watch plugin now appear in the launcher, but when I open them they send me to the app information (like a shortcut to the application info in Settings). I've tried clearing the cache, the storage and doing another factory reset, but nothing have worked. Is there any way to fix this? I am using Android 10 and those apps shouldn't be shown.",
