    "content": "The screen turns completely black when on a phone call. The power button dies not wake it up. It will only return when the call is ended from the other person. Moving the phone does not work either. Cleaning the proximity sensor does not work either.  The last time this was posted, a Google employee said an update in April 2018 was coming and would help.",
