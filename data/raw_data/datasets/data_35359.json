    "content": "My pixel 3 was charging overnight with the google charger. When I woke up in the morning it was super hot to touch and had shutdown over night. I had to wait another 20-30 mins with the case off the phone before it would turn back on. I asked Google for a replacement or a refund. Does anyone know if the replacements have this issue as well? I do not want to go through the hassle of getting a replacement only for it to have the same issue.",
