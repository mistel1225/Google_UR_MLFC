    "content": "I would like to know, what type of glass is used to cover main camera lenses in pixel 5. You know, for exmple, in iPhone there is not scratchable saphirre glass on lenses, but here in Pixel 5, all lenses are under one square piece of glass. Is it saphirre too, or gorilla glass, or what?",
