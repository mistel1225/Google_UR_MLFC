    "content": "Hi i recently bought pixel 4a using polish carrier (4g). whenever i send an SMS the receiving party gets 4 messages instead of 1. The same happens when I receive SMS - randomly I get duplicates. Chat option is OFF (RCS off?). When I enable Chat it works fine.\n\nNone of the threads I found here have a working solution although they are closed\n\nThanks",
