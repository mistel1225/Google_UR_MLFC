    "content": "Recently an additional Translate item appeared in the context menu and I am looking how to disable it.\n I have the Translate App, it works great and it has a useful item in context menu. It was in the top item. But recently another Translate item appeared that is doing translates via Google Search, which is much less useful. To use the previous Translate, I need to click \"More\" and select it there. It reduces useability.\nIs there any way to keep Translate only via Translate App?
