    "content": "Over the last few days the volume control overlay has been randomly disappearing - not showing on screen when volume buttons are clicked. If I open an app such as youtube or spotify it works again, however once I leave that app it disappears again. Resetting the phone fixes this temporarily but it always happens again.\n\nAny advice?",
