    "content": "UPDATE:\nMAJOR THANKS TO KEITH WHO SOLVED THE PROBLEM. THE ISSUE IS DUE TO FIREFOX LOCKWISE. UNINSTALL THE APP AND IT WILL GO AWAY.\nEvery time I open up a google app (settings, play store, messaging, etc) and use the keyboard, a little toast notification (grey/white bubble at the bottom of the screen) pops up and covers the keyboard for a few seconds saying null. Every time without fail, a little bubble, and the word null. It happened right after I upgraded to android 11. It's very annoying.\nDevice: Pixel 4a\nOS: Android 11",
