    "content": "This morning my alarm went off at what I thought was 5:00 am but every other clock in the house said it was 6:00. Has anyone else had any issues in the days following daylight savings time with their clock jumping back and forth? The time corrected itself when I connected to the WiFi at work but it was a rough morning to say the least.",
