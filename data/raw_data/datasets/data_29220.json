    "content": "My Google pixel 3 phone heats up when using the video app it came with.  However even when it's on video setting and is not recording it heats up very quickly.  When I do video record, it heats up after just a few minutes and will black out and stop.  The phone just seems to freeze and shut down.  You can't blame it on \"real-time processing\" because it isn't working when it's just sitting there in the video mode without filming.   It is very frustrating since I make online  drawing video lessons and the video is spoiled because the phone shuts off and I've continued to draw.  Now the lesson has to be thrown out because of this problem.  I have to start the work all over again.  Even though the videos are very short, the phone just heats up so that it's very hot and just shuts off.   Several times I have lost really good works because of this.  I don't think I will get another pixel after this experience.  More hype than it's worth.",
