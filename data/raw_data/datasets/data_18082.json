    "title": "How do I contact Pixel Support outside of a supported country within the EU?",
    "content": "I late 2018, I bought a Pixel 3 in Germany, EU. Recently, I noticed that the battery has swollen. Since the phone is still under warrenty, I'd like Google to have a look at it. The problem, however, is that the Pixel Support Chat and Phone Support are both geo-blocked in Sweden, EU. Paying for VPN access for the sake of circumventing it seems like a huge overkill, seeing all I want to do is to file a request for repairs.\n\nCalling Google Store Germany is a no-go - their office is closed because of the ongoing pandemic.\n\nWhat are my other options? Any help is much appreciated.",
