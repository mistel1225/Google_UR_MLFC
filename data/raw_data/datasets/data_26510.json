    "content": "I have a black border on left, right and bottom of my screen. The games are not filling the whole display because of the navigation Android 10 moves to the bottom when in landscape. The whole Idea to move it with the rotation of the phone is the dumbest ever. Not only is it scaling the games wrong now and creating black bars on the screenshots I take, it is also very difficult to activate when using a case.\nThis is bugging me so much that if there's no solution I will return my Pixel 4.\nOn Pixel 3 the experience was great, in landscape the navigation was staying on the side and was easy to activate with any case. I just hope this doesn't change when updating to Android 10..",
