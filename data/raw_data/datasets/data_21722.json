    "content": "Hi Community,\nSo I have a Pixel 2 and recently tried to updated to Android 10, but, as you can guess, now I am stuck in a bootloop. I have tried the restart 7 times but still failed. So I was wondering if it was possible to enable USB Debugging from Recovery Mode?\n\nIf anyone knows of any way to do so I would greatly appreciate your help!\n\nSide note: I have found this guide \"https://www.isrgrajan.com/how-to-enable-usb-debugging-in-android-using-recovery-mode.html\" but I am not sure if it works or not, I have not tried it. Has anyone tried this and can confirm that it works?",
