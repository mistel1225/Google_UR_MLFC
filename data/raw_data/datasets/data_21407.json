    "content": "Two weeks ago I purchased a Pixel 4XL. While my experience has been mostly positive with it, I recently noticed a strange issue with the Google App. The app is using an extreme amount of User Data compared to all my other devices. And the size continues to increase each day. My current user data size is over 600mb today and had gone over 800mb last week. I have cleared the data numerous times but the data reaches back to over 400mb again within seconds. This is only occuring in my Pixel 4XL. I have an OG Pixel XL and OP7 Pro and the user data is only 64mb. Not sure why the Pixel 4 is taking up so much more data. I have factory reset 3 times but the problem persists. Anyone else experiencing this issue with their Pixel 4? Help would be greatly appreciated.",
