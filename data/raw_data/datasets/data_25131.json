    "content": "Hi, I just bought a Pixel 3a a couple days ago. Everything works fine except for the front camera. It did not autofocus when I tried to take a selfie. My face would turn blurry and the background relatively sharper. I searched this community and found another person having the same issue. Is it supposed to be like this? If not is there a way to fix it? I just hope my device is not defected. Thanks.",
