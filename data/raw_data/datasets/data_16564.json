    "content": "I look into the notification settings of Android Messages on Android 11, and I see one contact twice, and one contact under a category at that is the same as one of the duplicates, but different than the others. See screenshot for better explanation. How did this happen, and can I remove the 3 \"Incoming messages, a Default settings\" without bothering the others? ",
