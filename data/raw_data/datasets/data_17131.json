    "content": "My Samsung 7 Edge has a feature that \"show the latest contact information for each caller\"\nIn other words, when someone phones me, the dialing screen would show a brief call and/or text history of that number. This came in handy when business clients were phoning and/or texting me. \nDoes Pixel 4 have this feature, or does anyone know of an app that would be able to perform this task?",
