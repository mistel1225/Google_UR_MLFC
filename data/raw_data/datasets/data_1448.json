    "content": "The past few days I've been using my Pixel 4 as I usually do but as soon as it hits 15% battery and initiates battery saver mode it does a soft restart, all my apps are still open but some data is lost (for example if I was watching Netflix I'm back at the home menu rather than in the episode). Not sure what to do at this point to fix this issue, is it a setting I messed with accidentally and hadn't noticed the change until now?",
