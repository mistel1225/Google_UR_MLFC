    "content": "How can I stop the wallpaper from zooming whenever I do things on the home screen?  It triggers the same thing in my brain that Windows 10's maximize/restore animation does.  Call it motion sickness or whatever, it's physically painful.\n\nAt least in Win 10, I can turn that animation off.  The worst part of this in Android is that the zooming still happens if I turn on the accessibility setting to remove animations!  And if I set the developer options that control animations to \"Animation off\" (yes all three of them), the zooming *still* happens.",
