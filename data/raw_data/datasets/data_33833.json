    "content": "I have a Pixel 3 XL and my best friend has a Pixel 3.  Before that I had a 2 XL and he had a Pixel.  We use Messages to chat with one another a lot and up until the past month or so never really had an issue, but now--whether we're using it on our phones directly or through the Messages for web desktop client--our messages are often going through out of order, and we frequently find that photos we'd tried to send never went through at all.  On the flip side, sometimes messages go through twice for some reason instead.  None of this is unique to our conversation--it's happening intermittently for both of us in messages with all different contacts, but we're both Pixel users and have had these issues repeatedly for at least two weeks now.  We've both verified that all the latest updates have been completed, restarted the devices multiple times, etc. - all the usual basics.  Any other advice on how to resolve this would be greatly appreciated.",
