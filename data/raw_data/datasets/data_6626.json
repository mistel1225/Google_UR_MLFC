    "content": "When launching the recent apps menu on the launcher of my Pixel 4a 5G (square button) and turning my phone to the right/90 degrees and attempt to close apps, I cannot swipe up to close but if I swipe down, the Launcher stops working and crashes. If I rotate the phone to the left, I can swipe up and close apps without any issues.",
