    "content": "I have my home wifi saved on my phone and I have the settings set so that I automatically connect to it. \n\nHowever, I'm noticing that my phone will somehow disconnect to the wifi and will not reconnect to the wifi automatically (even thought it shows it listed as a connectable wifi network). I have to do this manually every time and If I don't notice it, I will end up using unnecessary data.\n\nAnyone know what's going on?",
