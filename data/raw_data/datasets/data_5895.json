    "content": "Hi All,\n\nI have not set any Pin/Pattern password to open my Pixel 4A. It is simple swipe up from lock screen to unlock.\nBut since yesterday, I do not see the lock screen. As soon as I double tap or press power button, the phone opens directly in unlock mode.\nI have searched everywhere under Settings but can't find any disable/enable button for this.\nPlz help.",
