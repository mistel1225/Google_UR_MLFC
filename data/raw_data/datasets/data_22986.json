    "content": "Woke up to my phone smoking and whistling this morning while it was charging. Tried to get it disconnected from the charger by quickly pulling the cable out, and now my carpet has deep scorches in it where the phone landed. First series Pixel XL. I haven't seen too many other posts about this happening while plugged in.",
