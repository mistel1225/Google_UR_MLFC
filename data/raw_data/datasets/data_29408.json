    "title": "Hardware connectivity from the charging cable to USB-C connector port of my Pixel 2 is loose.",
    "content": "The charging cable keeps falling off and is not tightly connected, I have tried using other USB -C charging cables as well, also the type C - 3.5 mm jack adapter provided keeps falling off disrupting music and calls while using headphones.\nI have tried blowing off the port to check if there's any dirt, but doesn't help. I have seen suggestions to clean the port manual with a pin or a toothpick but that is not something I am keen to do because I would not want to damage the charging socket due to any external interference.",
