    "title": "Usb C pixel buds not working after initial setup.",
    "content": "After factory resetting my phone it usually allows me to setup my pixel buds once. After doing so it would never detect my pixel buds or any usb c audio.\n\nOn one orientation it does not work. After flipping the connector around it shows up as charging a USB device.\n\nHave cleaned my port with isopropyl and have tried and tested other headphones which are working. Not to mention that after setting up it works well and allows audio through. It only stops detecting after removing the headphones.\n\nMy best guess now is it could be software related?",
