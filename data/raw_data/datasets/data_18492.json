    "title": "Pixel 3 running Android 10 app drawer incorrect contents; differs from Google Play \"Installed Apps\"",
    "content": "I have a new Pixel 3, that shipped with Android 9, and replaced a Samsung A10e.. After re-installing the apps saved on a Google Backup, the app drawer contents are incomplete, not including several apps that are installed according to Google Play \"Installed Apps\". Also, the converse is true; several apps in the app drawer are not in \"Installed Apps\" list.\n\nUpdating to Android 10 did not change the problem at all.\n\nThanks in advance for any insight or workarounds you can suggest.",
