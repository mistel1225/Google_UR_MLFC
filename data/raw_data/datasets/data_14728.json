    "title": "Pixel 4XL: how do I zoom using just one lens?",
    "content": "I have a macro-lens clipped onto my phone to take better close up shots. I have the lens carefully positioned over one of the camera lenses.\n\nHowever, when I zoom in and out, the camera app switches to the telephoto camera, giving me a view of just the EDGE of my macro lens. I completely lose the view through the lens I've carefully clipped the macro lens to.\n\nHow do I stop the camera from doing this?\n\nHow do I force it to just use ONE of the lenses regardless of where the image is focused, regardless of how far in/out I've zoomed.\n\nThis is driving me nuts and ruining my photos. It wasn't an issue on the Pixel 3 because it only has a single rear camera.\n\nThere has to be a way to stop it from switching from one camera to another when you zoom.\n\nPlease help.",
