    "content": "A while ago my Pixel phone started loosing connection with the car. The Bluetooth connects but when I connect the cable to the car I get the message \"there was a connection error with your Android Auto device.\"\n\nThis started happening all of a sudden during a drive. I tried different USB cable - still the same. Different phone connects perfectly. \n\nTried also resetting all connection settings from Settings menu. Tried cleaning the USB port on phone... Nothing helps. This is really frustrating. \n\nAny ideas? \n\nThanks.",
