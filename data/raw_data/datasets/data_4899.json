    "content": "This is honestly just a general question,  I haven't seen any bad behavior regarding this.\n\nThere are some notifications that I have received that wake my entire phone's screen, as if I clicked on the power button to wake my device. I am curious if my Pixel 4 XL knows when its in my pocket and doesn't do this. I am concerned that it may turn on and then erroneously perform tasks because the screen woke due to a notification.",
