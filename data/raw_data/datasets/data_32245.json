    "content": "I had this problem a year ago where my phone will wake automatically without any notification, just a blank lock screen. I am very sure all notifications were turned off. After a firmware upgrade, the problem seems fixed and I no longer have that problem. But this problem return after the 9 April 2019 Android version 9 firmware upgrade. The time of wakes are totally unpredictable. No apps were running in the background. Please help me fix this problem. Thank you.",
