    "content": "I recently updated my phone for the android 11 update and when I did I lost the ability to screenshot by just holding my power button. I've tried to hold both the power and sound but it doesn't work. I've also tried scrolling up from the bottom of the screen to look for a screenshot button like Google says to do but there isn't any. Is there someother way I can take a screenshot that I don't know about?\n\nThanks\n\nAlexis",
