    "content": "I've had the phone for a few days and the battery seems to drain really fast, with just scrolling through Instagram for about 30 mins, I lose around 10% battery and doing just normal activities drains it really fast. I've looked at the app usage and there's only a few apps I use which take up most of my battery. I've reset the phone twice, messed with a bunch of settings. Any tips?",
