    "content": "Pixel 1 suddenly dead overnight,  it was charging as usual, would not turn on, no charging. \nGranted its 4 years old, but do you expect your phone to die suddenly? Not at this price and company name right? \nubreakifix says, could be motherboard issue, as changing battery did not help. Seems to be common with Pixels. \nI am rethinking of buying Pixel as my next phone. Are newer gen. Pixels worth their price?",
