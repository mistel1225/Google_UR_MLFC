    "content": "I have contacted Google support who have confirmed my month old pixel 3 has a software error that won't allow me to open or use my canera. A week after said phonecall my phone dropped and smashed... Google will no longer fix my broken month old phone until the screen gets fixed. I got a $500 quote from ubreakifix, does anyone know of somewhere I can get it fixed/send it to that will be cheaper? I just can't justify paying $500 just for Google to send me a completely different phone that actually works. (I'm in Canada by the way)",
