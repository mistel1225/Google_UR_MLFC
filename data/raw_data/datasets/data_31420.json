    "content": "Ever since the March update, my battery went from lasting 36 hours to 6 hours at best.  I have now deleted every single app I have ever downloaded and it still won't hold a charge.  Last night it died at around 6pm after spending 2 hours on the charger during the day, so I plugged it (factory charger) in until about 1am and it read 72%.  Restarted, re-plugged in, and went to bed.  This morning I woke up and it said 100%, and as soon as I unplugged it, it said \"shutting down.\"  No low battery beep, just shut down.  I plugged it back in and turned it on and it said 1%.\n\nSo I have tried:\ncleaning charging port (although my case has a charge port cover and it was clean)\nuninstalled every app that might be a problem\ntried checking what apps were using battery (but that feature seems to have disappeared in settings)\nchecked for app updates\nchecked for Android updates\nTried safe mode for a day (battery life only changed a tiny bit)\nTried my friend's factory Pixel charger (no change)\n\nBefore I do a factory reset (royal pain in the butt), what else can I do?",
