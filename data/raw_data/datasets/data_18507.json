    "title": "Pixel 3 Camera causing touchscreen to freeze",
    "content": "Hello.\nI have a pixel 3.\nWhen I use the camera or the photos app, my touchscreen becomes unresponsive. The buttons work but the screen does not. I can't restart using the power button because that needs to be completed with a screen touch selection. So I need to do a hard restart. \n\nAfter I enter my password and swipe up, the camera and/or photos app are still open. If I chose either the screen will become unresponsive. If I swipe to close them, they remain open as they are stuck in memory.\n\nBut if I open another app, like Gmail, then swipe up, it allows me to close all. \n\nIs this a result of a software update or a hardware problem?\n\nThanks\nNick",
