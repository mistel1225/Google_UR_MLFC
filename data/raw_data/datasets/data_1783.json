    "title": "Pixel 4a suddenly only works on OEM charger, even then only on one \"side\".",
    "content": "Got the \"Liquid or Debris\" message earlier and then another a little later saying it was OK to use.  Now the phone wouldn't charge using any of my regular chargers (confirmed they are all working on other devices).  Dug up my OEM charger and cable and that works but even then only on one \"side\".  By that I mean the part that connects into the phone normally doesn't have a side, you just plug it in and it works.  Now it only works if the \"right\" side is plugged in.  There is no damage that I can see to the port and nothing happened today that I recall would have prompted the message or caused any damage.  I've done all the troubleshooting in the \"Unplug charger or Liquid or debris message\" and \"Fix a Pixel phone that won't charge or turn on\" instructions.  It's under warranty but the closest walk-in repair place is 200 miles away and so I'm looking at 7-10 days for mail repair, which I'm hoping to avoid.  Ideas or suggestions?",
