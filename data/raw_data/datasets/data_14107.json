    "content": "I'm looking to purchase the Pixel 5, current Fi customer. Through the google store - the Pixel 5 is sold out, but it's available unlocked. There's no difference in price, so I'm trying to see if there's any problem with me buying it from the google store and then adding it to my Fi account and switching it out with my current phone.\n\nThanks!",
