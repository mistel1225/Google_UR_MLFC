    "content": "There are several stuck pixels in the status bar of of my phone. The pixels aren't dead as they are always green and red (about 3 green and 2 red) when the display is on. \nThe pixels are in the center across the width of the screen, and on the bottom of the status bar. \nIs there a way to fix stuck pixels on the status bar of a pixel 5 phone? I have tried a browser based pixel fixer, and an app but they don't extend into the affected region of the screen.\nI have tried to use an app which \"pushes up\" the status bar, but it doesn't seem to actually extend the display area. \nI want to see if I can make the pixels work before I go down the route of sending my phone for repair. Thanks. ",
