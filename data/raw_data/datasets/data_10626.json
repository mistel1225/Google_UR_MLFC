    "content": "Since upgrading to Android 11 this week, I've noticed a change in how quickly my battery drains. My device takes hours to charge on the pixel stand & gets hot. I also had screen freezes on the lock screen, where I had to reboot the phone. I've done a factory reset & the screen freezes seems to be fixed, but the battery drain has not. At 80% & charging wirelessly it stated 5 hours til full? Any idea on how to fix this?",
