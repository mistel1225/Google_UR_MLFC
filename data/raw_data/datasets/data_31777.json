    "title": "Pixel 2 xl does not charge immediately after I put in the charger. Headphones not working as well",
    "content": "My Pixel 2 XL which I bought less than a month ago is not always charging properly. I have to fidget with the cable in the port to make it work, removing it and inserting it multiple times. Furthermore, my headphone jack is acting up. When I insert it, the phone switches off and shows the battery charging. It only works when I switch it on again, and sometimes reswitches off again. I tried different cables and made sure I have all updates.",
