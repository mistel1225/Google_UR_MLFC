    "content": "It's not helpful for Android to disable screen shot at the discretion of developers, since they protect themselves, not me. \n\nTricky promotions. limitations, use, and other such legalities need to be saved to show to people etc at future dates when conflicts arise.\n\nBesides, you can just snap a picture using another device, but that undermines the digitization and simplicity we all strive to employ.",
