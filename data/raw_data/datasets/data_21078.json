    "content": "Hello I have an enormous battery drain problem what started in android 10. I used to participate in the android 10 beta and around the 4th beta the battery life just skyrocketed to around 2 days of use but when more beta came the battery life just said it goodbyes. I now only get around 5 hours out of this thing (Pixel 2 XL) I hate it. I have searched around and nobody has a real solution, so I want to try to go back to that beta. Does anyone know how to get the old beta images of android 10?",
