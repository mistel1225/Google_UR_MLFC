    "content": "After receiving the January Security Patch, my Pixel 2 has been acting up in many ways:\n-Lags several seconds to change apps\n-Many apps restart when focus is changed to them ( Whatsapp and Instagram show their splash screens, Chrome refreshes the curreent tab)\n-Gboard lags up to 10 seconds to come up (leaving a black rectangle where it should be) when a text field is selected\n-Swipe input doesn´t work (the lines break mid swipe)\n-Voice input doesn´t work, recongizing only tiny parts of what was said.\n\nI´ve read similar issues over the Oct patch, and treid doing what was recommended: Restarting the device; booting in safe mode (performance just barely improves); wiping cache.  No success.\n\nNow I´m trying to sideload the OTA. But once the ADB sideload command is given, nothing comes on my PC´s command prompt, while on my device only this:\nFinding update package...\nOpening update package...\nVerifying update package...\n\nI´ve given it time (left it overnight), tried different cables and ports, confimed the checksum of the OTA file... But I just won't go past that.\n\nAm I missing something? Is there something else I should do?",
