    "content": "Hi there,\n\nI was told several time by interceptors that they can hear me really bad, all because of poor quality sound. I thought it might be something wrong with their devices but I have checked that by myself. The sound quality is really awful indeed. Is like talking with someone using a really old phone. If I try putting myself on speaker - it is even worst. No issues though with video recorded clips.\n\nI went to my carrier provider and have changed the sim card - but it is the same thing. I have almost all the time 4G antenna so I don't think I have issues with that. Via WiFi I have exactly the same issue.\n\nIt is either the soft (but I have done many updates since I have the phone) or the issue is with the microphone itself.\n\nNever dropped the phone, never have tried it under the water. I am using it roughly for about 2.5 months.\n\nOne more bad thing is also that it is purchased from USA but I live in a country out of Google support... \n\nAny advises will be very appreciated.",
