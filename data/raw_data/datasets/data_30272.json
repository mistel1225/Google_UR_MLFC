    "content": "A few days ago, I was finally able to click on a call in the Recents tab in the phone app on my Pixel3 and be able to look at call times and durations for that particular contact, but only a few days later, I am no longer able to do so. Long pressing on it only gives me the options as in the picture attached.\n\n\nThis is such a basic feature to have! Can someone tell me if I am doing something wrong here.",
