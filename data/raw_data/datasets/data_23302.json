    "title": "Pixel 3XL Battery Drains Extremely Fast Once At Around 30% Battery",
    "content": "My Pixel 3XL Battery will drain extremely fast once the battery still have around 30% battery left. Once it reaches around that point, 30% battery means I have less than 30 seconds of battery left as it drains 1% every second. It happens regardless if safe mode is on or not (see images below). Moreover, battery sometimes will not charge to 100%. However, if I plug in the charger while the battery is draining very fast, then unplug it after a second, the battery percentage will stop dropping rapidly and will decrease normally.",
