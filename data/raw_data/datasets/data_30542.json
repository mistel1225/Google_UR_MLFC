    "content": "My pixel 3 xl does not play nice with other devices that use a wifi link so the phone can be used as a controller, such as a drone or a camera trigger. It starts the connection process, connects, discovers there is no internet service and then either  refuses to connect, or switches itself back to a network with internet access. I cannot find any setting to override this behaviour",
