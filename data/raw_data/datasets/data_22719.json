    "title": "Google asked for my pin to repair Pixel 4XL - is this normal?",
    "content": "I bought my Pixel 4XL in January and ran into issues transferring data to my iPhone. I took it back into my service provider (optus) and they sent it to Google to repair/replace as it is still under warranty. When I called Optus to follow up (after 14 days when they said it would take 7-10) they said that Google needed my pin to get into the phone.\n1. Is this normal - surely Google are able to fix phones without the pins? This seems highly un-secure and a massive breach of privacy\n2. I had reset my phone back to factory settings so I don't think the pin would have still been associated with the phone?\n\nThis whole saga has been about 2 months and Google sent back the phone without even repairing it, so it's now been sent back to Google and I am still waiting. Moving away from iphone was a big move for me and my friends warned me not to and I am starting to regret it!",
