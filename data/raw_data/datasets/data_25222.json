    "content": "I am having problems when trying to connect to some websites (Amazon specifically) and use some Apps when connected to wifi.  They just don't work - it's almost like there is no connection.\n\nThe sites all work fine on other phones in our house connected to the same router (S7, Iphone 7 to name a couple) and worked fine on my old S7 Edge - but my Pixel 3 XL just won't connect.  If I turn off Wifi it works fine.\n\nI've tried resetting the network settings (worked immediately after but not for long), connecting to different wifi networks at home but it still does not work.\n\nIts incredibly frustrating and the only down side of my lovely new phone.\n\nCan anyone help?",
