    "content": "I have problems with using NFC, where it reads the tag only after a minute or more (painfully slow)...\nWhen I put it down on a tag, it takes a bit of time before it reads the tag (1 or 2 min)...\nI installed \"NFC Tools\" which is an easy app to test...\n\nWhat can I do to fix this problem? Because I really need it for development.\nThe first question youre probably going to ask is what case I use arround the device (this is the pixel official case) and removing this case doesn't help...\n\nPS: I tried to report on the pixel support app, but it keeps crashing when I try to start it...",
