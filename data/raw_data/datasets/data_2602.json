    "content": "Hi. My first time to be using a Pixel 3a XL as my old Realme 7 Pro's screen cracked and became unusable.\nI wanted to know:\n1. Is the phone actually safe for light rain or an accidental fall to the sink?\n2. Is there a way to hide apps (similar to Hidden Space on Oxygen UI or Hide Apps setting on One UI) and then easily find them afterwards?\n3. Is there no way to install Dolby Atmos to the device?\nWould love any help & advise please. Cheers.",
