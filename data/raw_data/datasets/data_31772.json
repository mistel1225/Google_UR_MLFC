    "title": "I have a pixel 3 and a pixel 3 XL. Verizon told me I could swap the sim cards out if I decided I liked my personal phone number on the larger phone. The problem is, the 3's sim card fits in the 3 XL, but the 3 XL sim card doesn't want to fully seat in the the slot on the pixel 3. Is this normal?",
    "content": "I've tried removing the sim card and reinserting it several times. It appears to \"almost\" fully seat, but never does. I also get the message that no sim card is present.",
