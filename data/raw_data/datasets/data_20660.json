    "content": "I can't hear other people when using apps like duo or skype nor does speaker phone work unless I'm using earphones plugged in to the 3.5mm jack port.  Tried factory reset safe mode etc and been through settings and nothing works. Music and video sounds are working and normal phone calls are ok. It seems to me that there is a hardware fault with 3.5mm port or one set of speakers. It is as if the port for headphones is preventing one set of speakers from from working.",
