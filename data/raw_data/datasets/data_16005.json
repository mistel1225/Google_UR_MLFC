    "content": "I have tried all the C to USB cables I have, and none of them when connected to the Pixel / Computer will give me entry to the File System . Is there something that I must switch on in the Pixel to gain entry? My computer is a Linux Mint 20 OS and I have a MTP program that connected my previous phone to the computer. I can connect with a cable my Amazon Fire Reader, so I suspect either I need a special cable or something in the Pixel itself is preventing a connection. Any suggestions will be helpful. Piet.",
