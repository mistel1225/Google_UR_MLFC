    "content": "So I've read VoLTE will not work on Pixel devices in Korea and I wanted to ask the community a couple questions as I'm a bit confused what VoLTE does for my phone.\n\nAccording to \"willmyphonework\", the Pixel is compatible with the three big providers in Korea, so using LTE data should be no problem.  If VoLTE doesn't work, does that mean I can't make regular phone calls?  \n\nBasically, I'm not too knowledgeable when it comes to the tech sides of phones.  If my phone is compatible with the LTE network, will I be able to make both phone calls and use LTE as I normally do with say, Samsung or LG?",
