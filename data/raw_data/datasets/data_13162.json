    "content": "I need a new phone (old Pixel XL has gone into an unstoppable infinite reboot cycle). Thinking of buying a Pixel 5 with Google Fi in the USA but will be retiring to the UK early next year. I would prefer not to have to change my phone when I retire and move. Will a Pixel 5 purchased here be fully functional in the UK? Will it work on 5G in the UK?",
