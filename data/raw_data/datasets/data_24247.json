    "content": "I have setup face unlock in Pixel 4XL multiple times. \nEvery time I try to unlock my phone using my face, it doesn't work. I try moving phone to different angles, move my head different ways, and finally it unlocks. Takes about 5-6 attempts each time and I end up getting a good neck workout. \nAlso, this refuses to work at night or in dark. Everytime I have use my pin to unlock the phone.\n\nI miss fingerprint unlock :(",
