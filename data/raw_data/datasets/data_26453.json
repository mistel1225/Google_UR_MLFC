    "content": "I just bought my Pixel 4 from the Google fi. But when I checked my apps, I have permanent T-Mobile apps on my phone. The very reason I chose to go with Google fi was to get rid of seeing T-Mobile on my phone on a daily basis and now I have it permanently on my Google fi serviced phone. This really cheapens my experience with Google fi and I really hope somebody can help me fix the situation.",
