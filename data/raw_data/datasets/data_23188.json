    "content": "When I bought the Pixel 4  I never dreamed it would not have a fingerprint reader. If I would have known that, I would have bought the Pixel 3 and saved a few hundred bucks or kept my Pixel 2 as there was nothing wrong with it. Very disappointed! I feel like I've taken some big steps backwards. Google needs to be very open about NOT carrying that feature over from previous models.",
