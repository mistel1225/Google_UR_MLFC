    "content": "According to the battery usage in my phone's settings, sound amplifier is consistently using ~20% of my battery. I've disabled the app, and I never use it, yet today 23% of battery usage was attributed to sound amplifier. \n\nI can't find any posts about this problem. Anyone know a way to completely delete the app?",
