I looked in to settings than phone turned off. It was on charger so I left it on the charger. Few minutes later trying to turn on just not happening. I wait longer than keep trying to get it turned on. After many trying pxl turned on. Now screen not  moving smoothly, skipping. What can I do to get over this problem? Just started two days ago. Today is third day. I'm starting to worries about it. Thank you for your help.",
