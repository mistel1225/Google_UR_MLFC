    "content": "Yesterday, my Pixel 4 XL stopped charging wirelessly. \n\nI have three wireless charging stands, including a Google Pixel Stand, but my phone won't charge in any of them. \n\nI've removed the case, started the phone in safe mode, and tried putting the phone in a horizontal position, but it still won't charge wirelessly. My Pixel 4 XL will (fortunately) charge using the cable.\n\nWhat can I do to fix my phone's inability to charge wirelessly?\n\nThanks.",
