    "content": "I tried to get Verizon's new call filter spam blocking app but it won't install. I get an error message saying that it is not compatible with my device. I contacted Verizon tech support and was told that this is a known issue and that this app will not work any of the pixel phones. According to Verizon it is a google issue. This means that anyone with a google phone will not be able to take advantage of the new \"STIR/SHAKEN\" call filtering technology which is supposed to be the latest most effective way to deal with unwanted/spam calls. This is extremely disappointing. Is Google working on a fix for this?",
