    "content": "After sitting idle for a few minutes my pixel won't wake up. The power button doesn't work, the finger print sensor doesn't work, the only possible thing that works is plugging it into a charger. After I plug it in it wakes up, but often I'm not near a charger when this happens. Holding the power button and resetting works 1/10 times. What is going on why hasn't Google fixed this?",
