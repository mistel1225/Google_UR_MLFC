    "title": "New Pixel 4a. SMS \"Not sent\" error on all text messages & Carrier has no solution",
    "content": "I have set up my new Pixel 4a, and it works well with strong signal coverage, with no issues receiving text messages. However, every time I try to send a SMS to any number, I get the \"Not sent. Tap to try again\" message.\n\nI've cleared the cache and data numerous times (and rebooted), I've checked/updated the SMSC number, and spent ages with the carrier trying to resolve the problem - and they're at a loss.  No matter what I do, the problem persists.\n\nAnything else I can try? Thanks!",
