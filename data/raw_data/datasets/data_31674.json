    "content": "When I'm in a Skype call, my alarms, simply don't work. I'm using AMdroid and tried to use it's setting to prevent that from happening, but my alarm still won't sound when I'm in a call. It makes a beep noise once and then vibrates. Can't find any \"in-call settings\" or anything in Skype, and the ones in AMdroid are set right.",
