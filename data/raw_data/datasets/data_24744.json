    "content": "I've been using messages and trying to use the shortcut to see the contact by hitting the circle icon. I get an error message that says \"contact doesn't exist\" despite the contact appearing in contacts and being searchable... Import glitch? Does anyone have a fix? I've tried restarting the phone and the related apps. Happens only for some contacts. I made sure that contacts permissions we're on for Google messages.",
