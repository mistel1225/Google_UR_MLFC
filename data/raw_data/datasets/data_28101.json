    "title": "Pixel 3a keeps lighting up when \"locked\"",
    "content": "My phone while \"locked\" or asleep, keeps lighting up every 10 seconds, all day, every day, since I started using the phone. It is as if I am receiving a notification, but nothing is there. I have tried to Google the issue, looked thru my apps and my settings and do not see anything that would cause it to light up so much. I have tried the troubleshooting steps I have found online however most are not applicable to to me. I love the phone, other than this issue. Thank you in advance for anyone that can offer some help!",
