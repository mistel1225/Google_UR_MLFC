    "content": "So recently (started a couple days ago) have this problem where when I ask Google a question, the answer voice is very slow like she's intoxicated and very purposeful if that makes any sense. I read some posts about the assistant voice so I made some adjustments to it changed it to an Aussie voice which is kind of cool but that's not the voice I hear when I ask Google a question if that makes any sense. Anyone else experiencing this bug?",
