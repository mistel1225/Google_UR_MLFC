    "content": "I have an issue with a speaker in my Pixel 3A (it doesn't work in calls). I've tried to contact support via Twitter (link to original thread - https://twitter.com/lowski_/status/1294551380900950016) but after exchanging a few messages in the thread and via DM I started being ignored.\n\nI've tried all suggestion from support (including factory reset) but it become clear that the problem is related to the hardware issue as none of them work.\n\nI also explained that I bought this Pixel 3A in Germany via Amazon.de website from Google seller with official shipment to Poland (for those of you who don't know we are also a part UE). I even offered sending a phone for a repair on my cost but I still didn't get any reply. At the moment I don't know who should I contact regarding my problem.\n\nI can't contact Google directly because on every page it says: \"As a precautionary health measure for our support specialists in light of COVID-19, we're operating with a limited team. Thanks for your patience, as it may take longer than usual to connect with us. For additional support, consult the Help Center.\" and there is no any contact form.\n\nIs there any other way to contact Pixel support?",
