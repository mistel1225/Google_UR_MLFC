    "content": "My Pixel 2 XL (with Android 11) lost its ability to charge over the weekend. I just got a Pixel 4a. I powered on the P2XL and did a full backup. I then started the P4a setup and was unable to use the cable to transfer data (probably for the same reason I could no longer charge the P2XL) so I had to do a restore from the cloud (Google Drive). It reported no errors. I noticed none of my SMS or MSM were on the new phone so I ended up having to boot up the old phone again and install a 3rd party app to do a backup, and then retore it onto the new phone. I'm down to 15% left on the old phone, I hope this is the last of whatever I need to do!\n\nJust putting this out there so it can be on record as I noticed others reporting a similar issue.",
