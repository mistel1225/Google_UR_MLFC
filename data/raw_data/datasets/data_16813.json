    "title": "Has anyone else seen since upgrading their Pixel (X) to Android 11, much of the Album Art vanish?",
    "content": "I updated my phone today with the official  Android 11 and hey presto many of my Album Art pictures no longer display in Google Play Music anymore. Before the 'upgrade' when I opened the Google Play Music App, every song had its own art but now only a few do.\n\nDoes anyone know what's going on or how to get my missing Album Art back without having to pay for a subscription to Google Play Music. My view is the Art was there before the upgrade so I shouldn't have to pay or sign up to a subscription service to get it back.",
