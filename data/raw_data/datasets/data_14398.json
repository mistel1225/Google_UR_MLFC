    "content": "Hello everybody.\n\nI bought a Pixel 2 a couple years ago, and after an accident I had to replace the back glass. I live on Brazil and there is not one place that repairs Pixels, so my only option was to buy a replacement from the internet and do it myself.\n\nAfter I replaced the glass, bluetooth stopped working properly. I tested with multiple devices, and the range is now very short.\n\nAny idea how I can solve the problem? Thanks!",
