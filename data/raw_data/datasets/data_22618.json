    "content": "Pixel 4 is stuck on G startup screen after I tried to install Amazon app from Google Playstore. When I go into recovery or rescue mode I just get the dead android logo with “No command”.  I cannot afford to lose the local data (not backed up on cloud because Phone was so new).  Google customer support has not been helpful and is saying I need to wipe the system and lose the local data. Please help ! This is a very expensive and new phone and should not be having these issues when installing a well known app from the Google store.",
