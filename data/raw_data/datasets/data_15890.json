    "title": "Charger cables keep disconnecting (not lint related). Can't find how to contact for repair",
    "content": "Any charging cable that I try disconnects at the slightest movement, so that I'm never sure if my phone is actually charging. I've tried cleaning lint form the usb-c port - some lint came out but problem persisted. I also tried changing cables but did not help.\n\nI would like to send my phone for repair, but I cannot find on the google / Pixel help sites any contact information. When I follow the instructions on the `Find an authorized repair partner' section it leads me to https://store.google.com/repair, where it confirms that my device is under warranty and that I can get it fixed, but then when I ask to contact a representative, it simply redirects me to the general google support website (and showing the following message \"As a precautionary health measure for our support specialists in light of COVID-19, we're operating with a limited team.\").\n\nAlso important: I am currently based in Germany  (where I also bought my phone)\n\nHow can I get my phone fixed???",
