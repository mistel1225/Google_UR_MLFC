    "content": "I have seen other posts with this issue but none with pixel 4 XL. My alarms make no sound. Text and ring tones only work while I am playing a game. I have removed and reinserted the SIM, I have restarted the phone, I have cleared the storage and cache of the clock app, I have reset the app preferences of everything, and I have even done a factory reset. DnD is not on, and phone is up to date through the November security update.",
