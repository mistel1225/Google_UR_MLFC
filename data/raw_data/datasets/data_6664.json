    "title": "Bose Headphones Pixel Offer Scam",
    "content": "Hello,\nI pre-ordered Pixel 5 in France in October 2020 and I am eligible to get bose Headphones as a part of promotional offer by Google. My request was validated on 18 December after I submitted all the documents but till now I have not received the headphones. In the mail for validation it was mentioned that I will receive the headphones within 60 days after validation date but it was not shipped. I even complained about this and got a reply that it is due to Brexit and after that they stopped replying to the mails.\nIs it a scam from Google just to sell their phones in France.",
