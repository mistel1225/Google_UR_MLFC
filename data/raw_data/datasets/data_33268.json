    "title": "Wifi \"Connecting\" to \"Saved\" - What to test/replace?",
    "content": "Hello. I found out last year that the case for my Google Pixel XL is definitely NOT waterproof. The phone turns on and pretty much functions as it did before the event I call \"the accident\". The Wifi shows the available networks (albeit a very weak signal) and constantly goes from \"connecting\" to \"saved\" until showing the network at \"disabled\". I have tried changing the IP, resetting the phone, booting in \"Safe Mode\" to see if it was an app causing the issue, and have finally simply done a factory reset with the result being the same. I have seen posts with comments stating that the next step might be a replacement... but replace what, exactly? What should I test to see if its the motherboard, wifi wires, etc.? I am willing to do, and have the necessary tools to do, a parts replacement. I just need to know what you believe is the part that highest chance of being the one that needs to be replaced so I am not spending an arm and a leg attempting to fix it. Thank you in advance for your assistance. :)",
