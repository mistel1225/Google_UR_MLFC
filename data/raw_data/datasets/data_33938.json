    "title": "Pixel XL sudden unsolvable low volume issues",
    "content": "Still have an original Pixel XL, all up to date and in good condition. Sometime in the last month, my media volume randomly cuts down to what sounds like 30% of max volume even though all sliders are maxed. \n\nIt happens using Spotify, watching YouTube or Facebook videos, pretty much any media volume. \n\nThe closest comparison I can think of is imagine you're mid video on YouTube and receive a notification, you hear the tone while the background audio from YouTube still plays at probably 1/3 normal volume. \n\nAnytime I start to watch a video, or play music, I hear the full volume for a moment or two before it just cuts down to what sounds like less than 30%.\n\nAny help is appreciated. I've tried to disable absolute volume with no success. Makes no difference in behavior.",
