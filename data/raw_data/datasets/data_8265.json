    "content": "Hey everyone,\n\never since the last system update, the system on my pixel 5 supposedly takes up 43GB (all the space that was left). Also, my Apps supposedly take up 64GB, yet the only large App I have installed is Outlook (36GB, lots of inboxes). I think there has to be a storage leak somewhere - the system seems to keep loading something until it is completely full. Phone is basically unusable rn. \nWondering if anyone knows what to do? Preferably without wiping my phone, resetting the authenticators and everything is just such a pain.\n\nThanks!",
