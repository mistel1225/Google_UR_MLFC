    "title": "Pixel 2 keeps crashing/restarting seconds after start-up even after multiple Factory Reset",
    "content": "After a normal restart on my phone, I noticed the phone kept crashing when the logo \"G\" is loading on start-up. I decided to do a Factory Rest. I think this worked because the older start-up screen showed, but similarly, the phone crashes when logo \"Google\" turns to the \"G\" at the beginning. The screen goes dark and phone restarts, and crash in the same exact fashion. Going to Boot-loader page and recovery mode works fine. The phone doesn't crash at all on those screens (which tells me it's not a battery/power issue). I have Factory Reset multiple times, but after the reboot, phone keeps crashing right after start-up.",
