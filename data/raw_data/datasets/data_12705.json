    "content": "Just got my Pixel 5 today. I noticed a small green dot appear and flicker at the top middle corner of the screen whenever I listen to voice notes on Whatsapp and whenever I open any chat box in the Telegram app. I've tried many other apps with texts and sound and video but I'm only seeing this issue with Whatsapp and Telegram. I made sure it's not from the apps by checking on my old phone. Any idea what to do about this?",
