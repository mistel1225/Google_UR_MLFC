    "content": "Hey guys,\n\nI've just switched over to the Pixel 3a from another Android phone and had a quick question about the NFC shortcut in the pulldown quick settings menu. \n\nOn my old phone, it was possible to tap the bottom right tile, and the NFC would come on. Here, doing so does nothing - as you can see, it looks sort of shaded out. Is this just a quirk with the Pixel phone, or do I have to enable something to get the shortcut to work? Although I can turn it on in the settings, I'd rather not leave it on permanently, as I've been told it drains battery.\n\nMany thanks.",
