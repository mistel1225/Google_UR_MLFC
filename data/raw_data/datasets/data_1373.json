    "content": "I came back from a trip where my phone was on airplane mode. I came home and connected my phone to my computer and saved all the photos and videos and then removed them from the phone. After turning the airplane mode off I noticed that nothing was showing on the photos app. I reconnected my phone and transferred everything back to it from the computer and let the phone sync and then re deleted everything from the phone via the windows browser. I can now see the photos but non of the video will play and I can not edit the photos either. Any help would be appreciated.",
