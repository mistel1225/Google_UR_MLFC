    "content": "More than a year ago, customers complained on this forum that their Pixel 3a phone orders suddenly got delayed with no further notification. Guess what? It's still happening. I ordered my phone (3a) on May 27, with a delivery date of June 17-18. Three days ago, the delivery date was changed to June 10-11: YAY! Then today, as I'm anticipating my new phone arriving possibly tomorrow, I suddenly see \"Your shipment was delayed. We're working to get it to you soon and will email you when it's on its way.\" WTF? YOU are the ones that moved up the delivery date by a week. Why? And now, not only can you not meet your new date, you can't even tell me what the problem is or when my phone will arrive.\nI'm a long-time Fi customer, and this will be my third Google phone (Nexus 4 and 6). Why is customer service so bad? \nIf Amazon was this bad, Jeff Bezos would be a hundredaire.",
