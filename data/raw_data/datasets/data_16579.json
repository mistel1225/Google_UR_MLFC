    "content": "Dark mode is off system wide, but the status bar is still black. Happens in all apps such as the Play Store, Chrome, Gmail, messages etc. The apps themselves are not in dark mode, but the status bar is.\n\nThe problem was on Android 10, and after updating to 11 today, the problem persists.",
