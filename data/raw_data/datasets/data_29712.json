    "title": "Charging a Pixel 2 XL after July 19 security update",
    "content": "I purchased a Pixel 2 XL on Amazon and since the July security update the charging goes bonkers. First, it started by shutting off when I plugged in the charger (of any kind), then it charger's plug to the phone became burning hot and now it doesn't charge at all. I need my phone and I have 11% left. \nIf it is a hardware issue, which I think it is, and known by Google given the number of posts in the forum, the devices must be replaced (mine is still under warranty).\nPlease help.",
