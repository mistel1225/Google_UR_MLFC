    "content": "Got a hardware issue on my Pixel 5 (bright line on the screen appeared out of nowhere). Trying to reach support but all forms are disabled. If I try to go via the store and file warranty claim I do not get further then displaying option to chat & phone them. Once trying to select any of those, I land in help center because Covid and shotige of stuff they have :) \n\nI need to reach UK Support specialist or file warranty claime via UK store. Help pages does not help me, need to send the phone to repairs. Thanks for tips.  \n\nMarusa",
