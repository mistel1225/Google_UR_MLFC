No worky..., No registration on the Verizon network even though the same SIM works on my old phone, Pixel 3.\n2. Verizon doesn't support DSDS for anything but apple.\n3. Verizon is crippling the hotspot feature on the Pixel 4\n4. I waited 72 hours for Google support and they never contacted me.\n\nBye.",
