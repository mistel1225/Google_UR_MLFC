    "content": "Suddenly my Pixel USB C earbuds will not play music via an assistant command. Music still plays fine through the ear buds if I start the music on my phone first, and I can open any app via assistant command through the earbuds, even my music apps, but when I say \"hey google, play music, or play music on YouTube music, or play music on Google play music\" .... My assistant says \" Ok, playing music on ...etc... etc\"\nThe same earbuds work perfectly fine on my wife's Pixel 3 XL, and will play music via assistant no problem.\nAny ideas on what's going on here, or how to fix it...... Restarting the phone, and clearing Google data has done nothing.",
