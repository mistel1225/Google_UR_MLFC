    "title": "Pixel 4 XL Top Speaker Very Quiet On Calls",
    "content": "Recently in the past couple weeks the top speaker on my Pixel 4 XL has been very very quiet when I'm on calls. My call volume is at the highest and I'm holding the phone to my ear like usual. But the noise coming out from the speaker is so quiet that I have to use speaker phone now because I can barely hear the other person. \n\nI couldn't find anything in sound settings that would fix this. Also tried restarting my phone. I've had this phone for a year now and it only just started happening. My phone also has the most recent update.\n\nAny help would be appreciated!",
