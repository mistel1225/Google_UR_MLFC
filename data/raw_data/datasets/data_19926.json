    "content": "I have only had my Pixel 3 for less than a month, but already when I delete a photo by it comes up with a notification \"Delete item permanently? Your device is low on space. This item will be permanently deleted from your device and account.\"\nI have checked my device storage and it says I've only used 32GB of 128GB. I have checked my Google One account storage and it says I've only used just over 1GB of 15GB.\nAny ideas what is going on?",
