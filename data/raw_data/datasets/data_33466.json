    "content": "I just bought a USB cable for connecting my Pixel 2 in my car. Android Auto issues aside, the thing is not charging my device, even though it says so. My battery just went down 10% after driving for a half hour while listening to a podcast and using navigation for ten minutes of that drive. (The wall charger works fine) I do not want to randomly buy more expensive cables on the blind hope that they work better, only to potentially have those be regrettable purchases as well. Does anyone out there have solid, tested recommendations for a USB cable brand to get for a Pixel 2?",
