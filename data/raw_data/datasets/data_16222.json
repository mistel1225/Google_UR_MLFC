    "content": "Google Pixel 3 when entering USB mode doesn't show previews for photos or videos. so many other identical questions quietly locked by a shitty corporation that has refused to fix it because 'lol google photos cloud bettur'. \n\nTemp solution is copying the entire folder your trying to preview to desktop. Delete them off the phone. Then do what you need with the photos and reupload.",
