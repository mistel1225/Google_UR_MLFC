    "content": "The Pixel power/battery use/restart issues started about 3-6 months ago.\n\nI purchased the new Pixel when it first came out in 2015.\n  I just traded my original Pixel for a brand new one because I thought the battery was dying. I'm having the same issues with the battery status indicator, charging, holding a charge, excessive battery use for all functions and having 4% battery capacity after turning the phone off for a couple of hours AFTER charging to at least 80%.  The phone shuts off after taking a few pictures or making a call. This is a brand new Pixel with a brand new battery!\n  I did the safe mode reset you recommended and nothing changed. I noticed I started having these issues a few months ago after you did an Android update and have read several blogs that have detailed the very same problems. It's not the apps, it's your operating system and its updates.\n  I will be changing away from Google phones tomorrow for something I can trust and rely upon. I lived my Pixel for the first 2-3 years, especially the camera but I can no longer recommend your devices to anyone based on recent experience with battery and power issues.",
