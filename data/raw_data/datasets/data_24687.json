    "content": "This is a version 5 app vs version 7 of gcam.\n\nForget the colors, a lot of things changed. Look at the difference in my face details, look at the hair details. Do you know what does this? HDR+ activated. We can´t turn it on always like anymore, we can´t choose to have it off or enhanced when we want. With this you turned this front camera into nothing. People are all asking why pixel 3 takes better photos than pixel 4 with front camera. Well, its not about quality, it´s about what they have done with the HDR+.\n\nPlease, help me and say, how can I turn it always ON. Or at least create a new version that is at least better than other ones!\n\n\n\nAPP 7 Version\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAPP 5 VERSION (HDR+ Enhanced ON)\n\n\n\nAPP 5 VERSION (HDR+ Enhanced ON)",
