    "content": "On my pixel 2XL, since my calendar is usually booked from the moment I wake up to fall asleep, the ambient OLED display doesn't show the date anymore. It just shows my next upcoming appointment in the time. Do you know if there's a way to bring that back? I always forget what date it is throughout the day.",
