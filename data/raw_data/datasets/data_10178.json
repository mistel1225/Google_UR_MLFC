    "content": "I have a contact - Robert Duvall.  If I open my standard phone app and start to spell his name using the dial pad:  R-O-B-E, it only shows one of my contacts - Robert Bernet.  If I spell his last name, D-U-V-A it only shows his wife Debbie Duvall.  If I go into my contacts and search R-O-B-E, it brings him back plus another 30 contacts with the name Robert.\n\nWhy doesn't the phone app search all of my contacts when I key in their name with the dial pad?",
