    "content": "Greetings community. Very exciting the have a platform here. was wondering this morning if there was a way to use my wonderful new Google fi VPN protection on this pixel 2 as a bridge between my other devices and an unsecured Wi-Fi network and pass on the Wi-Fi securely through Google's VPN only. ultimately what I'm trying to do is connect to a public unsecured Wi-Fi network with pixel 2 (3,4) and pass traffic from Google VPN to my other devices at home. As if it were a standalone router. To reframe that for example I'd like to connect my Nintendo switch to my VPN protected Google hotspot which is connected to an unsecured wireless Wi-Fi network. An example would be any available Wi-Fi perhaps a laundromat, airport, campus or anything of the sort. Google is number one and let's see if there's a way to make cool things happen like this! The sky's the limit oh, just kidding there is no limit. Thanks engineers and community!",
