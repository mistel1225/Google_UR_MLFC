    "content": "It suddenly stopped working and rebooted automatically while I was using it on March 4th. Then I saw the recovery message as I attached above. I selected 'Try again' and the device started to boot again and again automatically and endlessly. Then the next day it became a brick. The power button was not working. Holding power button + volume down button 30+ seconds was also not working. Nothing happened. I left it several days waiting for running out of power and tried again after charging it. Still nothing happened.\nWhen I connect the cable and hold power button + volume down button, 10 seconds later I can see red light on the top right part, but nothing appears on the screen.\nI tried everything I saw on the internet. I want my Pixel 2 repaired or refurbished.",
