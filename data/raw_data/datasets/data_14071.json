    "title": "Why google India didn't make pre-booking available considering how big that brand is?It disappoints.",
    "content": "I was trying late at night I.e. around 12 am to book this phone and could buy it because it was out of stock for my location. Considering the hype they had built, they should have come up with more units or pre-booking of the phone. What a shame that they followed the same strategy as Chinese brands. Also, they are not saying anything about when that phone will be made available. Don't keep us hanging and give some direct information. That day you destroyed my sleep as well as my enthusiasm.",
