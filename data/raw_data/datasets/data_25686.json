    "content": "I am using Red Pocket, on the Sprint network, and have no data.  Calls and texting are fine.  The phone is brand new, unlocked.\n\nPart of their troubleshooting steps is to access the *#*#3282#*#* menu --> Data Profile --> Username and edit the value, which is wrong according to them.  But I cannot edit it on the Pixel 3a.  \n\nOn my old phone, when I entered ##3282#, I was initially presented with an Edit/View option and then could edit anything.  What's up with the Pixel 3a?  Why can I not edit Username?",
