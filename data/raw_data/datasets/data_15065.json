    "content": "So my 4XL started showing a low battery percentage after charging wirelessly 2 nights ago (this is how I charge every night). I used the factory wired charger for several hours and the battery percentage didn't reflect any increase or decrease all day yesterday but the phone worked fine. I put the phone back to charge wirelessly last night after confirming the charger still works on other phones, and woke up this morning to find the battery was dead and the phone won't power on. I cannot get the phone to charge on any wired chargers, so it has become a paper weight. The phone has been taken care of extremely well, it still looks like new..... never dropped or anything. I'm seeing this is a common problem that has been reported several times this year.\n\nI followed the steps for contacting pixel support using my laptop here, but I keep getting put in a loop to describe my problem and file a warranty claim, then it says to use the \"Contact Us\" button of the screen, and clicking thru that just keeps sending me in an endless loop. I need to arrange to get my phone fixed ASAP, how can I get the ball rolling on this????",
