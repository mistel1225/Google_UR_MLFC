    "content": " I used Android file exchange on my MacPro laptop to copy/delete files from my Google Pixel 3a XL. I've done this many times to free up space on the phone and had no problems, but this time, the process disabled the Pixel shortcut to my files directory (with folders for downloads, documents, DCIM, camera, gallery, etc). See pic: the icon for the shortcut is greyed out, and when I tap it I get a notification at the bottom of the screen that says \"Shortcut isn't available.\" I tried shutting down and rebooting but that didn't help.\n\nWhat happened to the shortcut, and how do I get it operational again?",
