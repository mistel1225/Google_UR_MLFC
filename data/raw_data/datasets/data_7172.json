    "title": "Pixel 2 Pin Code Not Working",
    "content": "My Google Pixel 2 is not accepting my pin passcode. I know for a fact that it is right, but it is just saying incorrect pin. My device is supervised by Google Family Link, and I have tried the pin many times so that the emergency call feature doesn't function anymore. I have tried getting it into Safe Mode, but it just wasn't working. This is not another known bug where the screen goes black for a second and then goes back to the unlock screen. Please help.",
