    "content": "For several months now I have been trying to solve the problem with my Pixel 3 wallpaper. When you set the wallpaper to the main screen, it becomes cropped and scrolls when you turn the page, and the main problem is that because of this the quality of the wallpaper itself is VERY bad. At some point, manual cropping to the screen resolution of my pixel helped, but after the next update, all my downloaded wallpapers were cropped and did not work normally. I went through all the settings in search of a lever to disable wallpaper scrolling, but I did not find anything.",
