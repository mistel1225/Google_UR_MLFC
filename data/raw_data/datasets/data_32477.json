    "content": "After charging my pixel 2 overnight in Argentina, The alarm sounded and I gave it a squeeze to snooze. Alarm went off again after a few minutes, and when I tried to turn it off, realized the screen wasnt responding on any part. Tried shutting down normally, but couldnt press screen to choose the shut down option. Tried the power+volume down button restart which also didnt work. When  booting in safe mode, a screen pops up that says “No Command” with a green robot guy and a red alert exclamation.\n\nWhen I start up normally, The fingerprint and side buttons work fine and the screen looks normal with my background and everything, but noting registers. Im completely locked out.\n\nThe screen is clean and undamaged. Im not sure what else to try except a factory reset. Only problem is im not backed up, and am traveling without my laptop for the next several weeks. It will be a while before i have access to my computer and everything.\n\nTo top things off, Im an American living in Colombia so Im not sure how an exchange/repair would work.\n\nPlease help!!",
