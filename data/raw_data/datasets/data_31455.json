    "title": "Why is the Quality of camera in Instagram stories so bad all of a sudden?",
    "content": "I bought Pixel 2XL in Jan 2018, have been using Instagram from the start. The quality of posts on Instagram Stories used to be top-notch due to the introduction of visual core chip. After a hiatus from instagram for a few months. I started using Instagram Camera again and the quality is so freaking bad. The still pictures are super grainy and color science is so bad. The video is slightly blurred with bad audio. \nIt used to be awesome in the start. Now, it's just useless.",
