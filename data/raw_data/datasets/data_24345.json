    "content": "I'm interested in a Pixel 2, and use several GPS based apps. I've bee wanting to test the Galileo and BeiDou GNSS systems, as they were recently allowed to be used in the USA. I've read mixed reports that the Pixel 2 refuses to pick these systems up in the US, even though the hardware supports it, and the FCC has allowed the use of these systems. Do the latest software updates fix this issue? If someone has screenshots of an app like GPSTest or similar running on a Pixel 2 in the US, I'd love to see it",
