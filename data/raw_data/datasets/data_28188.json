    "content": "How do you download an app, such as WhatsApp, on a second SIM.  Specifically, I have WhatsApp on my GoogleFi profile, no sim.  I would like to download WhatApp on a second SIM on a local European SIM. I want to maintain my current settings- default for calls and mobile data is the local service and  default for SMS is Google Fi; but add WhatsApp to the local SIM profile.  Possible to do? Thanks.",
