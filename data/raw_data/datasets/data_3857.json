    "content": "So I've recently bought an external Lavalier microphone off of Amazon. I plugged the microphone into a USB-C to 3.5mm headphone jack adapter and plugged it into my phone. (The microphone is a TRRS)  The phone detected it, and everything was good so far. I recorded a short video, and after reviewing the footage, noticed there wasn't any audio. Is there something I could do to resolve this?",
