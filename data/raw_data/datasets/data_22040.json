    "content": "My Pixel 2 kicked the bucket about a month ago. The last time it was operable was when it was laying next to me in bed after I used it. There was no early warning sign. It just stopped working. Black Screen. Won't charge. Won't turn on. Dead with a capital D.\n\nI rely on the cloud for backing up my device files, which I thought might include my downloads via Google Drive, One Drive, or Dropbox, but this is apparently not the case. Much more important than the downloads that I'm missing are the Performance Reports that comes from the TEC Auto Test app that I'm supposed to save for a minimum of 3 years. It's my bad not looking into whether these files would be included in any backup, and transferring them via cable sooner, but now that they are gone I'm in desperate need of help.\n\nAt this point I'm willing to accept that recovering these files is outside of my ability. I'm looking for other options. Tech support or something else, is there a way to get these files. As I mentioned before, I am legally required to maintain a record of these files for a minimum of three years...I don't think I've even had my phone that long.",
