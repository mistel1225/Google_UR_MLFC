    "content": "Hello Need Help about pixel 3xl!!!!\n\nSuddenly my pixel 3 xl has color issues on screen. Especially when watching HDR scenes the Black color seems to blurr out. Also If I make full brightness the screen looks faded as if color washed. In setting the display color is set to adaptive but still the color looks faded when compared to even a xiaomi phone screen. I am really disappointed with the experience I am having now.\n\nAlso from the same day I am facing the problem I have noticed (on the same day) that after completely turned off my phone when I press power button the screen flashed with brown color (just a small full screen short flash) .\n\nAlso I have gaved feedback report from settings there but no reply and have done all things possible like reset.....and so on still the problem remains.\n\nI am not a hard user of phone but I use pixel for camera and productivity and for this color issue it's a pain for me.\n\nPlease check whether there any bug in the software as I never dropped my phone and kept in proper way and battery backup is good till now. \n\nWaiting for reply with a solution",
