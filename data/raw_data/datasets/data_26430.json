    "content": "I am randomly getting ads popping up when I am using apps like instagram, WhatsApp, messages and Twitter. I get a button on the screen saying \"loading ad\" and then a stupid advert comes up!!!\nI want these ads to stop. I pay a significant amount of money for this phone per month, and I do not want ads popping up when I'm messaging on WhatsApp, messages or writing emails. I have not opted for these.\nIf there is anyone out there who knows how to stop this, please help! I will swap my phone for something else otherwise",
