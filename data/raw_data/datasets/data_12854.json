    "content": "Just got Pixel 5 yesterday. Great phone but noticed that the doodle animations that are supposed to show in the search bar at the bottom of the pixel launcher are not appearing. I still have my Pixel 4 and they are working fine on it. Have tried toggling the special effects option on and off multiple times but still no luck. Anyone else experiencing this issue?",
