    "title": "Pixel 5 - Top Speaker not working intermittently.",
    "content": "Sometimes my top speaker (ear speaker) stops working for calls using both the Phone app and Whatsapp. I can't find a regular theme as to why this is happening. If I restart the device several times it seems to clear it up, but it comes back at seemingly random times. My only theory so far is that it has something to do with the battery saving feature, like it's turning off the speaker to save power, as the only consistent thing I can find with each failure is that it seems to happen after the device has been in standby for a while.\n\nIs anyone else having a similar issue to this?",
