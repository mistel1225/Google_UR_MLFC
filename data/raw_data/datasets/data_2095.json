    "content": "I dropped my pixel from an height a  little less than 2feet, after which I picked it up. The screen was still on but the phone went off immediately I attempt unlock.\n\nAfter this, the phone would not turn on or charge. The phone shows starting attempt when plugged in and pressing power button -it goes off when power button is release and boot loops on Google logo of power button is held down.\n\nWithout bein plugged in, pressing power blinks the low battery logo and holding it down blinks continuously. \n\nI have left the phone plugged in for several ours. The difference in behavior when plugged in and not indicates the port is still working",
