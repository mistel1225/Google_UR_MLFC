    "content": "Pixel won't load the internet if my wifi is on and connected. As soon as I turn wifi off, everything loads again. This happens on different wifi networks and I'm not experiencing this on other devices. I've tried resetting network settings, hard reset, and software updates on my phone. This is a problem that routinely happens every month or so, without any clear explanation as to why it starts to work/stops working again. \nWhat am I missing???",
