    "title": "Pixel 3a sees Roku and TV, but can't screen cast to them",
    "content": "When I go to Settings->Network&Internet->WiFI->WiFI_Preferences->Advanced->WiFiDirect, my pixel 3a sees both my Samsung 7 series smart TV and my Roku 3.  When I enable my screen cast icon, the app just sits there scanning for devices - it cannot see either device.  All of my families' phones can see both devices - and cast to them - except my Pixel 3a.  Is there a reason for this?  Is there a fix for it?  And, if there is no fix, is there an application I can download from the play store to overcome this design decision?  I've tried several apps and they have the same issue: they don't detect the devices on wifidirect.  Any help or insight would be greatly appreciated.",
