    "content": "I just got a replacement Google pixel 4a after my original was plagued with performance issues after the Android 11 update. I was so happy when the replacement arrived with android 10. I've had this replacement for 1 day, I just restarted my phone. Now Android 11 has downloaded into  my device WITHOUT MY PERMISSION. I DID NOT CONSENT TO THIS UPDATE.  How do I prevent this from happening again? I explicitly did NOT want this. Android 11 took away my favorite features ( aka screenshot from lock button)  and ruined my old device.",
