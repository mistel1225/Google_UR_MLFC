    "title": "Pixel Buds causing Pixel 2 to get very hot and battery to drain rapidly. Any suggestions to correct?",
    "content": "I recently purchased the Pixel Buds to use with my Pixel 2. With the first use I noticed my phone getting very hot and going from 95% battery to 2% in under two hours. Other Bluetooth headsets do not cause this issue with the phone. Listening to music with another Bluetooth headset on the same phone for 3 to 4 hours at my desk results in a battery drop of roughly 5 to 10%. I have tried rebooting and scanning for updates manually. Any ideas on how to correct this?",
