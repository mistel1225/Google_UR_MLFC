    "content": "My Pixel randomly stopped displaying normally on the screen. I didn't drop it or anything unusual. I literally walked it from one room to another.\n\nI can feel the phone vibrating to touches, power off, and the fingerprint. It boots normally, from what I can tell - it feels like it recognizes my fingerprint but is asking for the passcode as additional authorization (if I tap in the number area, I feel vibration feedback.\n\nThe screen will have a small flicker near the top when I click the power button (like the screen is turning off). The flicker is only about one pixel thick along the top border.\n\nI've tried connecting the phone to my PC, which it detects, but claims is an unrecognized device.\n\nI've tried doing a hard reset, but the logo doesn't display, nor does the safe mode menu. When I held down the power+volume down buttons for 30 seconds, the LED blinks red once.",
