    "content": "Title says it all. I have followed a few troubleshooting forms to fix the issue such as restarting in safe mode and a factory reset, but nothing has worked.\n\nI also noticed my phone seems to randomly react even if I am not touching the screen, or when I type it will go berserk opening random apps or exiting out of whatever it is I am doing (app didn't crash).\n\nMy phone did randomly restart itself for a few a days, but it seems to have worked itself out.\n\nUpdate: I went to my place of purchase after talking with a Google representative and following their troubleshooting guide. I turned in my old phone and received a new refurbished as a replacement. Unfortunately the issue followed me to the new phone within the first week. I've tried deleting and uninstalling all apps as well as a factory reset to no success. The problem persists.",
