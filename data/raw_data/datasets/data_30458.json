    "title": "How to get back to stable version of pie after leaving beta? Pixel 3a XL",
    "content": "I opted out of the beta 4 and now I can't get back to pie. It stays like this for hours or it will say pause and go back to this. I have factory reset twice, restarted like 4 times, cleared Google play services and tried different networks as well as making my wifi unmetered. I don't know what else to try to get back to stock. I don't have a pc to sideload or flash either and the nearest repair center is in another city. Here is my last hope after hours of googling.",
