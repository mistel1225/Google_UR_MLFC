    "title": "My 4XL has stopped texting photographs",
    "content": "When I try and text a photo, it just hangs up as \"sending...\" and won't go any further.  I assumed that this was a size problem, but any photo, including one that I compressed down to 49K on my pc and emailed to my phone to text, gets hung up.\n\nCarrier is Verizon\nI am using the native Google Messages App\nAndroid version 11\n\nReceiving pictures just fine\nSends texts & emojis ok\nSends video links just fine\n\nI'm not sure when this started, but I texted a photo about 4 days ago (1.4 M) with no issues.",
