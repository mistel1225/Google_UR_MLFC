    "content": "Hi, I wondered if anyone had seen this issue before?\nWhen waking the screen it flickers with what looks like a commodore 64 loading screen. Phone is extremely slow to respond and it can only be fixed by a forced reboot, just for the issue to return when the screen sleeps and awakes once more.\nI've tried:\nSafe Mode\nFactory reset\nPraying\nHours of googling\nOffering one of my children\n\nVideo here, the phone is unusable really. It's like being back in the 2004 and I simply don't like it. I think there's some hardware issue here, but hoping someone knows exactly what to do and I don't have to pain a warranty return.\n\nMany thanks\n\nAndrew",
