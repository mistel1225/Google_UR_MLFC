    "content": "Yesterday my Pixel XL would not connect to WiFi and bluetooth was crashing constantly.  Resetting the network settings did not help and the WiFi will not turn on.  If you touch the setting to turn it on then it immediately turns back off. Doing a factory reset has not helped nor has upgrading to Android 10.  Any suggestions about how to resolve this?  Is it hardware or software?\n\nThanks",
