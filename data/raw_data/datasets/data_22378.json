    "title": "Trouble Sending Pictures on the Pixel 4 XL",
    "content": "I always have issues sending pictures in text messages on my Pixel 4 XL. I'll go to the messaging app, pick a chat, select the plus button to add media, attach a picture, and hit send, this then usually succeeds at sending, but frequently fails to send. I've discovered that restarting my phone after the message fails, then clicking it to resend does send it, but it is very frustrating, and I never expect my picture message to fail to send.\n\nAny chance this bug will be updated or something in my settings could be causing this issue?",
