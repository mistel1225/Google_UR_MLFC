    "content": "Hey there!\nSo, on my Google Pixel 3a (with Android 11 Beta) I can see the at a glance widget including the temperature just fine. But when I tap on the temperature it will not open the Google Weather App, but the Google App with \"searching\" for Weather. This appears to be just for the last couple of days. Before that the Weather App was always showing.\nI tried a couple of things already, restarting the Phone several times, clearing cache for the Google app, deactivating and activating the Google app.\nHow can I restore the Google Weather App by tapping on the temperature?\n\nEdit:\nI found out when I use the Google App without any Account, the Weather App will open again! Switching back to my Google Account, the same happens as mentioned above! What is wrong with my Google Account?",
