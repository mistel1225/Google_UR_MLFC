    "content": "I am at my wits end. I bought pixel 4a and have issues with touch, speaker, wifi connectivity and camera. I have received a defective product, and my phone is only 4 days old yet google is not providing me an option for replacement. I am only being given the option of repair. If I receive a defective item, I want a replacement not a repair. Google assistant on chat couldn't even provide me with the link of company's replacement policy in India. \nRegretting purchase from google.",
