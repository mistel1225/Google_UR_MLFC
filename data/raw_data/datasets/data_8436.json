    "content": "Recently and suddenly my phone keeps restarting. It also has long periods of no signal. It either says H+ or when I go to check it it says Insert Sim. In my house it searches for WiFi constantly and can't find it. I have tried\nFactory reset\nClearing unused apps and making more storage available\nInstalling the latest update\nWhat can I do. It's driving me insane.",
