    "content": "Hello,\n\nI purchased a 2 xl from a third party and it said unlocked when i purchased it. I want the option to be able to downgrade android versions if i want to as i did on my 3a. I went to oem unlocking under developer options but it is greyed out. I checked and made sure it wasn't VZW and it isn't. Any other ideas anyone might have?\n\nThe phone is (SIM Unlocked)\n\nI've checked on XDA also but couldn't find anything specific to my issue.",
