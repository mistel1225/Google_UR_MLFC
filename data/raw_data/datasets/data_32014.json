    "title": "Not getting notifications until i unlock my phone (pixel 2)",
    "content": "For some reason all of my notifications recently aren't coming through until i unlock my phone. I look at my phone and think i haven't had any for a while, then when i unlock with my fingerprint the notifications come flooding in. \n\nCalls and texts seem to come through when locked, but i don't receive notifications for things like whatsapp messages and gmails until i unlock the device.\n\nI have 2 step verification on when signing into my google account, and if my phone is locked the option to unlock with a notification is greyed out saying my device is unreachable. but if its unlocked its fine.\n\nIt seems as though my phone is offline when it is locked. \n\n\nMy brother has the same phone and we have compared settings which are all the same, yet his notifications work fine. \n\nI have tried deleting and reinstalling apps, also i tried restoring my device back to factory settings and neither fixed the problem. \n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated? thanks",
