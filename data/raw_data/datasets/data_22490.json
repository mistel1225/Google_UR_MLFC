    "content": "I’m not sure this feature has been completely rolled out yet, but following the 03/2020 Android update I still don’t have settings in my Pixel 3 phone app for automatic call screening. My carrier is Verizon, if that matters.\n\nI’ve tried purging the app’s storage and cache, and verified it's at the latest level (03/04 update, per the Google Play Store).\n\nWhat do I need to do in order to use this feature? I'm tired of waiting!",
