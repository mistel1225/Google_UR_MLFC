    "content": "Hi, I am using the earbuds that came with my Pixel 3 on a Macbook Pro with usb-c ports.\n\nThe problem is that the input volume on the mic is super low compared to other headphones I have. I have tried the Pixel Earbuds on the phone and on an iPad Pro with usb-C and they sounds fine (normal volume).\n\nThe input volume is maxed out on the mac but people are still not able to hear me using Google Meets or Zoom etc on the Mac. Both are fine on the phone or on the iPad (with the same Pixel earbuds).\n\nIs anyone else having these issues or able to solve this problem?",
