    "title": "Pixel 3XL Hardware and Features Query From Virgin Owner",
    "content": "I'm excited to be receiving my very first Pixel device. But I wanted to know more:\n1. Does it support hi-res audio of 24-bit/192kHz or 32-bit/384kHz audio?\n2.  Does it have a \"Clear All\" options in the multitasking pane?\n3. Does it have an option for NFC shortcut toggle?\n4. How loud (in dB) can the speakers go up to?\n5. Does the selfie camera have autofocus or is it fixed focus?\nDoes both the selfie and rear cameras have option for a wide/ultrawide angle as an option?\n6. Can i set the blue light filter on at a specific time of day?\n7. What display options are available?\nI have had Android in the past 9 years (from Samsung to Motorola to Sony) and I think \"stock\" Android can do more and learn more from these OEMs in terms of added features and performance.\nPlease advice. Many thanks.",
