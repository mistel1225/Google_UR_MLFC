    "content": "The system volume on my Pixel 4a is SO LOUD. You can hear across the house when I take a screenshot, \"like\" things on Facebook, or use the phone's dialer pad. It's also very loud just clicking and navigating around the phone. \n\nIt seems like the only work arounds for this are to:\n- turn off sound for dial pad tones\n- turn off touch sounds\n\nBut this still leaves me with super loud screenshots and Facebook likes. I don't want to put my phone on silent whenever I want to do these things. \n\nI see that there appears to be a system sound fix that was just released for the Pixel 5, but where does that leave the rest of us?!?!?!\nJan 2021 Pixel update: https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/91975505",
