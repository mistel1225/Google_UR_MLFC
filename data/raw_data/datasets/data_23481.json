    "title": "Pixel 4 RMA Nightmare",
    "content": "I purchased a brand new Pixel 4 at the end of October and was approved for an RMA return for the device in November. It's been well over 90 days and my shipping label still hasn't been sent out. I keep being ping ponged through  different supervisors and \"assured\" the escalations will handle this promptly. The supervisors are unable to give me additional information about my case since it's been escalated and they mentioned they don't have access to see what's happening.\n\nThere unfortunately seems no time frame of which this matter has to be resolved. Plus  since I'm unable to speak to the escalations team I cannot get any further information about this case. \n\nI'm hoping this can be escalated or someone can provide me with some possible recourse to get this resolved.\n\nThank you for your assistance.",
