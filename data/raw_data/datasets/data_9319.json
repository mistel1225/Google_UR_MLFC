    "title": "Is the Pixel 4a 5g (Android 11) completely incompatible with VR?",
    "content": "I got a Pixel 4a 5g with Android 11 for Christmas and tried tonight to set up VR on it, but nothing displays correctly. It seems to be related to the display -the right VR screen is partly off of the phone screen- but I can't find information on how to adjust the display settings. Since Google has conveniently cancelled all of their VR apps it looks like Android 11 really is the death of VR on android devices. \n\nPlease tell me I've missed something; otherwise I'm returning the phone if I can't use VR on it.",
