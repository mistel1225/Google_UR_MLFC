    "content": "As the title is saying, the Contacts app doesn't show my outlook.com contacts. My outlook.com contacts do show up in the dialer app under \"Contacts\". I'm using the outlook app from the play store and i have enabled contacts sync in the settings of the outlook app. Cleared the cache in the Contacts app, restarted, went into safe mode, did a factory reset and nothing works. I'm using Pixel 4XL unlocked and i'm on Android 11 with September 2020 security update. Seems like a year and half bug that google doesn't want to work on.",
