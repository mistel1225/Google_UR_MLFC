    "content": "Just updated to the new Android 11. Seems like they have removed the ability to go to multi tasking (switch apps) from the home screen. Can anyone confirm this?\n\nI used to be able to swipe up from the home button and see what apps were open but now I need to open up an app then swipe up.\n\nI am using KLWP and Nova Launcher but I don't know if that would affect this.",
