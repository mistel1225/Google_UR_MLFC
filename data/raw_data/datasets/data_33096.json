    "content": "My phone drowned a week ago but I managed to turn it back on. The problem now is the phone always says that it is connected through USB connection. Thus, I am not able to charge my phone when the phone is ON. I am only able to charge when it is OFF and it charge very slowly. Anyone know ehat the issue might be so that I can get the right sparepart for it. I am from Malaysia btw so itbis kind of hard to get parts here.",
