    "content": "It's just been few days that I got my pixel 4a delivered. The phone warms up if I click more than 1/2 photos. It warms up quickly if the photos are clicked on portrait mode. I haven't even recorded any video yet. The more pictures you click, the more the temperature rises.\n\nWhen I first unboxed it was heating up like a lot, does anyone else have the same issue while using the camera? \n\nGoogle is going to replace my phone, but just want to know if anyone else is facing the same issue or not ?",
