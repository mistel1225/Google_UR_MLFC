    "content": "I received a replacement device and was setting it up. I accidentally selected the wrong account backup choice and restored my previous 4xl phone which had been factory reset when Google was trying to repair it. I should have restored my 2xl account which is the phone I've been using while I was awaiting my replacement. Is there any way I can un-do the wrong restoration?",
