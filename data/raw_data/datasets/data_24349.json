Cannot remember my password. \n\nAny attempt to sign in tells me to authenticate by hitting a number on my pixel device. but my Pixel device is not signed in.\n\nAttempting to password reset has resulted in this message:\nIf you sent that request, you don't need to take any action. We'll investigate your account and respond to you within a few days.\n\nProbably due to the fact that I am away from home on business.\nNeed to set up my phone with my account as it has all my contacts associated to it.\n\nPlease help!",
