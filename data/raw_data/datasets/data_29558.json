    "content": "On my Pixel phone, when I click Settings, and then click Storage, it lists the storage of my phone for each categories. In Photos & videos, the storage is 5.3 GB, and in Files the storage is 5.2 GB. \nBut when I click Photo & videos, it further lists the following items,\nPhotos  177 MB\nCamera 112.70 MB\nImages 5.09 GB\n\nI cannot get access to those 5 GB Images to free up those storage.\n\nI also doubt the storage of 5.2 GB in Files is weird. I cannot free it up either.\n\nI have tried everything with Google online support by sharing my screen. They asked me to delete all backed-up photos in Photo app, install all new updates and restart the phone. But still there is 5GB space hanging there.",
