    "content": "I've seen lots of posts about the volume going down on its own, but I haven't seen my issue yet. My volume increases itself to maximum every day. I always keep the media volume at about 20%, which I find ideal for quiet rooms, but every day at work I inevitably open insta and the first video is absolutely ear-bleedingly loud.",
