    "content": "Whenever I click a link from my gmail, it moves to a new screen as if to open it but it just stays a black screen. I read something about uninstalling webview updates but that didn't work. I've had this phone under a month...I am annoyed that something this basic is not working. Is there some obvious fix that I'm not thinking of?",
