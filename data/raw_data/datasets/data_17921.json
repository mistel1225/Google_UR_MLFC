    "content": "I had put off updating my pixel 2 for about a month because I was having battery issues and when I finally updated it, it turned into a brick. When turning it in it just stays trying to boot up with the Google logo and white screen. \nI can get it into recovery mode but I don't know what to do from here. \nI plug it into computer while in recovery mode and it won't pop up on my computer. Is there anyway to get my pictures and videos from my phone??? I'm so upset that only the XL version was compatible with SD card!",
