    "content": "I have a Pixel 3XL 128gb. Since the Android 10 update, I phone is stuck in roaming mode, call quality has declined considerably (I would chalk it up to poor Verizon service, if my wife also didn't have a 3XL and hasn't experienced this). I also have lost the ability to answer calls. When someone calls, I swipe to answer and it disconnects the call. I have tried with many different people calling me, paid attention to make sure I was indeed using the answer button. I use my phone a lot for work and not being able to answer when people call is incredibly frustrating. Please help!",
