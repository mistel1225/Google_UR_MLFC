    "content": "I have google pixel 2 that freezes or won't respond. Freezes continuously. Factory reset has been done but no luck. Can not pick up the calls as well. Ample space is available in handset. All apps are updated.\n\nTried by removing some of the apps but no luck. It is very frustrating. Don't understand how to resolve this freezing issue. Plz help.",
