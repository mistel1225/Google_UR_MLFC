    "content": "Can someone please help me with this? I made a post a day and half ago and haven't gotten any reply or upvote about not having a label to return my pixel 3. google support call is down, I know the service staff has been reduced and from the forums I've been seeing, even when the service staff hasn't been reduced, it could take them 5 days to contact back and seem to solve nothing. I'm getting worried especially it's close to Christmas time as well where they may be close for multiple days. \n\nthis is my original post and I can't find any info telling me where the CASE ID should be, so I guess I missed something I should've saved when I made my first post so I can't even escalate it. \n\nhttps://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/88854727?hl=en\n\nSomeone please help me with this if possible, I really don't want to pay that hefty fine. With how bad the service is plus that $135 service charge that I was not aware of and this is the \"service\" I'm getting, I really don't think I'll bother with preferred care and seriously may consider not bothering with pixel phones ever again despite the fact that I love the phone itself.  \n\nThank you, \nDave",
