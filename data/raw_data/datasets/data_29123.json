    "content": "It's working,and when I press a key on synth it plays the sound through ma phone .but because it's one input on ma phone and it's been used by the synth I need the sound to go back through to my synth so instead of it playing the sound through phone speaker it will come through my synth headphones... So is it down to the phone or the app?",
