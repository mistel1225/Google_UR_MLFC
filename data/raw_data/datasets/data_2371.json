    "content": "Three time in the last 2 months my Pixel 4 will lose WiFi, Bluetooth and mobile data. I would go to WiFi setting to turn it on and it would not react to the command. Same for mobile data. I reset the WiFi, Bluetooth and mobile data in settings & restarted but it didn't fix the issue. Each time I have had to resort to a hard factory reset. My phone has the latest updates, under 50% storage used, no 3rd party/iffy apps and purchased new 14 months ago. Is there a solution to this issue that does not involve factory resetting?",
