    "content": "Tried sending 1 picture via email, it won't leave the Outbox, stays for hours, 'uploading'. Has not arrived at destination. Are pics too large? How do I compress, or whatever, to make them email-able? I can't find anything written on the subject in the phone or online. Telephone support not available from Google. Any help will be greatly appreciated.",
