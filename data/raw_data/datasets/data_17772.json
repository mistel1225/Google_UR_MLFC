    "content": "Hi!\n I've been having trouble with my phone it's a Google Pixel 2 ( about 2 to 3 years old). Now my TWO issues are, that my phone does not sync up with Google Chrome on my computer at all, What I mean by this is a log off my computer for the night come back to my computer in the morning and I will be kicked off all of my saved website info (meaning I have re-login to all my sites including my Google account on Chrome, which then means that I have to use my phone to sign in to my Google account on Chrome so it actually sings up). Once it syncs up I'm perfectly fine everything works as normal.\n\n\nNow, I have another problem with my calendar on my phone, say I have six events on my calendar for the day Oh, it will only give me three audible out of the six events that actually have in my phone. Once it goes through the first three events, then it tells me what I have to do for the next morning.",
