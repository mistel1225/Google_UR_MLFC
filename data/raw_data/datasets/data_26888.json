    "title": "Pixel 3 pin suddenly incorrect after latest android update",
    "content": "I decided to update to the newest android update before I went to bed. Phone restarted just fine and as I went to check my social media for the night,  when I go to put in my pin, which has not changed in the year and a half I have had my phone...its incorrect. I have now tried 10+ times putting in the same code to avail.\n\nThis is absolutely ridiculous that the only solution is a hard reset but I understand why something like that would exist if your phone got stolen. I'm angry that I'll get my contacts deleted since I need those.\n\nI have seen previous posts where people said it was preposterous that a pin would reset itself after an update, but they were 2+ years old so I couldn't jump in. I am not sure if I am the only one.\n\nHelp",
