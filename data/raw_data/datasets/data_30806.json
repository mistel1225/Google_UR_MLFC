    "content": "My battery is at 49% and even while on the charger, it is shutting down after a minute or less of use. What is going on? I uninstalled the only third party app that I started using right before the problems started and it still did not resolve the issue. The phone is new (two weeks old), and have installed all updates made so far. including the 9 a couple days ago. Phone was working great up until last night. What's going on?",
