    "content": "The battery started to degrade on my Pixel 2 and was looking for a replacement. It was really strange to see that that new Battery price of the Pixel 2 is significantly higher when compared to the XL models of for that matter the latest models.\n\nNot sure what's going on. It would be great if the team can rework on the pricing.\n\nRef Link: https://googlepixel-support.b2x.com/part-price-list/?devicename=Pixel",
