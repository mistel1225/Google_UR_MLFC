    "content": "My phone is sitting on my desk on a (non-charging) stand. Nothing is blocking the sensors (I don't use a case or a screen protector), and when I get text messages, my screen sometimes goes black and AOD shuts off.\n\nI think have to unlock my phone, lock it again, and then AOD pops back on.",
