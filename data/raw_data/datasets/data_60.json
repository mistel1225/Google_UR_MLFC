    "content": "Hi, my pixel 4a got a bit wet on the counter and it originally had \"liquid detected on USB port\" message.  I dried it off, laid it flat for 2 hours and turned it off.  I turned it back on, the message was gone, but the screen glitches every time I try to swipe the screen.  Any ideas on how to fix this?",
