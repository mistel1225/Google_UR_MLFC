    "content": "I work for a small police department and we have recently instituted a Crisis/Hostage Negotiation Unit to handle critical response events. I’m currently researching devices which can be used to create contact with a person in crisis (Throw Phone).  While there are specialized devices already in existence they are often out dated, bulky, expensive and or require an actual wire to connect two phones together.\nThere must be a better way…\nI would like to be able to set up a “micro throw phone”. Basically a cellphone with extra batteries and chargers in a small waterproof case.  \nThe device should be able to:\n- Send or receive texts/calls from one phone number only.\n- Have the video/audio remotely activated\n- Have GPS active\n- Have no internet access\nI’m also open to recommendations for known apps that can help achieve the above requirements.\nHey Google, this would be a great project that is easily achievable and can help save lives. J\n~",
