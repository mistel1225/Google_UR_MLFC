    "content": " my NEW Pixel 4a's telephone number does not display in:\nSettings / Phone number\nalso in Settings / Sim status / Phone number on SIM\non both counts, the answer is 'Unknown'\nI have already seen a post on this here forum, stating that, since this is SIM business, I should talk to my my network supplier. I have spoken to them once already, and they have sent me an SMS message without problem, so the number (transferred from my previous phone) is working.\nSo, I guess I could get back to my network supplier and ask to speak to more technical folks?\nAnyone can shed more light on this?\nMany thanks!",
