    "title": "I still have the pixel 1 I got it 2 years ago and my service is terrible. It's not Verizon's fault.",
    "content": "My pixel started dropping calls and losing internet not long after I got it. It was happening in certain areas so I went to Verizon and got a new SIM card. No change. Every time it happened I would use my girlfriend's iPhone which also had Verizon so it's not the carrier's problem. I've used tech support numerous times updating, changing settings, even doing multiple factory reboots with no luck. Did I get a faulty phone or have other people had this issue?",
