    "content": "I live in India and I use Airtel as my SIM card. Recently, my phone started not to take any calls or make any calls and even I cannot use my mobile data.\n\nI've restarted the device, took out and reinserted the SIM card again, tried resetting the netword services in settings but no use. In the SIM card settings the device detects the SIM card and even shows the details of the SIM card but I cannot access the services provided by it \n\nI tried calling from this phone and it says please turn of the airplane mode or try connecting to wireless network services and when  I tried calling from another phone, it tells that the phone is switched off\n\nCan you please fix this as soon as possible.",
