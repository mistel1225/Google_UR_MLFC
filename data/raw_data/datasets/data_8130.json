As well as my Bedtime Routine and the Assistant setup. \n\nI have perform EVERY suggested workaround and nothing fixes the issue. I had to buy an alarm clock you plug in because well I'm gunna get fired. \n\nAnd I don't see the point in having to download a different app when there is one built into my phone on purpose.",
