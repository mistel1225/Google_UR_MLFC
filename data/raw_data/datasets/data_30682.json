    "content": "I like to run my phone with \"Display Size\" set to \"Largest\". \nThe only problem is the back-button's hot-area now extends all the way to the left edge of the screen which means the edge of my hand is constantly touching it.\nIt's incredibly annoying.\nI can't use the keyboard without constantly cancelling the typing and quitting the app.\nIf I think about it I can grip the phone with a claw hand to make sure my palm doesn't touch the edge.\nAlso I can glue a piece of plastic to the corner of the screen. I actually did that for a while but it fell off.\nI could also just give up on having this setting the way I want it which is what I'll probably just do.\n\"Larger\" and \"Largest\" both suffer from the this problem. \"Default\" and \"Large\" are OK.\nI imagine with would be particularly vexing for people with poor eyesight who actually need this feature and suddenly find their phone has become very difficult to use, so I would think this would be an accessibility issue Google would want to get on top of.\nAs I recall older versions of Android didn't have this issue, but I can't remember how long I've been living with it.\nDoes anyone have ideas for how to keep my settings the way I like them, but also add a \"dead zone\" on the bottom left corner of the screen?",
