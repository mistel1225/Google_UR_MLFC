    "title": "\"Go Live\" Feature No Longer Visible On Instagram On Google Pixel 4A 5G",
    "content": "Assuming this is more likely to be an Instagram issue than a Pixel one but since purchasing a 4A 5G the \"Go Live\" feature on Instagram has disappeared. If I log into my account on another phone I can see it, but when logged in on my new Pixel it's not there. Obviously borrowing someone's phone whenever I want to do a live broadcast isn't really viable. Has anyone else had this issue / know if it's a common problem?",
