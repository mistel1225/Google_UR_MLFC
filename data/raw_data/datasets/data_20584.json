    "content": "My girlfriend's Google Pixel 4 just went black this morning. I get vibrations from it sometimes, and sometimes when I call her phone it starts to vibrate - not every time though. It doesn't respond in any other way. Tried to enter the boot menu (by holding the power button and volume down) but it doesn't act the way it should act it seems.\n\nHow do i get in contact with Google about this? The phone is only three months old. Is it likely a hardware problem or an issue caused by a system update?",
