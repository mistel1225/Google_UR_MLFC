    "content": "Well Currently there isn't a feature to schedule the Ambient display to turn off at night and I hope that there would be such a feature so as to not only save battery but prevent the phone from disturbing us with the screen light. If that is not possible maybe have a night mode for the Ambient display? Thanks community. #teampixel",
