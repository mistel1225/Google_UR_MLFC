    "title": "Rural, no home internet. How to connect pixel to smart tv? I'll buy two chromecast if I need to.",
    "content": "Rural, no internet, connect pixel to large screen for visually impaired. This is a very important feature I have become dependent on.  I would hook 2 chromecast in a circle if it worked.  A docking station, super duper chromecast, displaylink, or a fun house mirror to miracast?  I had to switch phone plans and now only use the pixel as a hotspot for my smart tv.  But I want to run band lab on a big screen.",
