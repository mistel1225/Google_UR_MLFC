    "content": "My \"Contacts\" app is perfect - only one of each contact. \n\nBut for some reason, when I open the Phone Dialler (stock Android), and hit \"Contacts\" from the lower menu, there is around 10-15 of each contact. \n\nAny ideas what's happening here? The majority of the duplicates are empty - only have the name and no number or other details.",
