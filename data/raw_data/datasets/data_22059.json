    "content": "Active Edge is on, Assistant language is English.  Squeezing for assistant used to work, but just stopped working recently.  I have rebooted, verified the above settings, and taken the phone out of the case.  I can say 'ok google' and the assistant comes up with no problem.  When I squeeze the phone there is no vibration any more.  Battery saver is not on.  I can't find any more information on this issue.  Wondering if my phone is faulty now.  I've only had it for a couple of months.  And...I haven't dropped it.  Any help is appreciated.",
