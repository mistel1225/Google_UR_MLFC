    "content": "Hi,\n\nI made a repair order to have my Pixel 5's screen replaced as I had dropped mine and cracked it. I opted to send the phone to Google myself rather than wait to have packaging shipped to me as it was faster. \n\nI am still waiting to receive the shipping label by email.\n\nI have called and used the support chat several times but I haven't received any resolution.\n\nIs there anything I can do to expedite this?\n\nEnrico",
