    "content": "So far Google and Airtel in India, is not supporting the Pixel 2 phones for 4G VoLTE. The network is damn worst that the calls are getting dropped. Have spoken to Airtel customer care and they don't have any idea when they will support Pixel 2 phones for VoLTE.\n\nGoogle..! Do you have any plans to expedite this with Airtel India? Do you still want us to use this network?",
