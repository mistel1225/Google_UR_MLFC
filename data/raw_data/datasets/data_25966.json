    "content": "Have tried troubleshooting through all the methods suggested by google online, and also consulted Google Authorized service center, and the service person said it;s a problem with the audio IC and as in India, google doesn't replaces IC, they suggested me to replace the motherboard. which was very expensive, and moreover this problem occurred exactly just after my warranty period.  \nIs there any possibilities to solve my problem apart from replacing the motherboard and costing me the new phone's price.",
