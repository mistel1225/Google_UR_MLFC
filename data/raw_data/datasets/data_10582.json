    "content": "I have a Google pixel 2 with android 11 IOS. I want to play mobile games with a PS4 controller(call of duty mobile / modern combat 5) ,  but I'm having problems. I believe I have too many settings turned off in too many apps that may be affecting my efforts. my question-- what apps affect Bluetooth, WiFi and a PS4 controller that I can turn ON to fix my problems? \nreply to g37lang@gmail.com",
