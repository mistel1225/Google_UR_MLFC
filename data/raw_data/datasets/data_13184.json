    "title": "one app is not logging in",
    "content": "One app will not login since Android 11 update. I can log into the app on other devices without issue. I have checked for current updates on app, uninstalled and reinstalled app, contacted app developer, cleared cache and followed every other troubleshooting guide I could find short of a factory reset on my phone. The app login brings me to a PS4 login to get in and that's where the issue is. When I go to the \"PS4\"login page the phone will not log in. I can go directly to Sony page and login without issue it's only when the app links me that it will not allow it simply brings me back to the app in a repetitive cycle.",
