    "content": "Hi there,\nHave a pixel 4a 5g. I have an issue with using the headphone jack (Bluetooth seems unaffected for this issue). When I first plug in a device like headphones or an auxiliary cable, the volume is really low (lower than usual at that specific level, even at max system volume). It sounds muffled and not loud enough. This happens to all audio coming out of the device and does not seem related to a specific app. The issue is there while using Spotify, google maps, YouTube etc.\n\nTo fix it I disconnect the device, wait for a couple seconds then plug it back in. Sometimes doing this 4-6 times to fix the issue or not at all. A restart usually does not fix the issue. Neither does booting into safe mode or a factory reset.\n\nI have the same issue on my pixel 3a as well. The issue was not there while running android version 10 on the pixel 3a which I am not able to test on the pixel 4a 5g. This also happens when I loaded android 12 DP2 on the pixel 3a.\n\nOne of the reasons I chose this phone over the pixel 5 was because of the headphone but there are constant bugs. Does anyone else have this issue or any solutions?",
