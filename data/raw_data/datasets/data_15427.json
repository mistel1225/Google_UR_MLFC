    "title": "recent pixel 4 update disables google assistant",
    "content": "Google conducted an automatic Google app update and as a result, Google Assistant was disabled. I spend well over an hour with Google chat to troubleshoot the issue with no solution other to uninstall the recent update and reset to factory settings. The Google rep, with screen share, uninstalled Google app update 3 times and went to Google Play to download the recent update, download three time with a restart for each download. NO SOLUTION! The rep sent the problem to software and I sent it to \"feedback.\" As a result of auto updates, I found myself in the same situation and had to uninstall and turn off automatic updates. I am now in factory settings and Google Asst. works and I can voice enter my calendar events and call my mom!",
