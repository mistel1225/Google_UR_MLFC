    "content": "I noticed that when I want to share a photo taken by my Pixel in Instagram or Whatsapp it is incorrectly rotated, but when I select it, the rotation is ok. When viewing the photo in the Photos app, the rotation is ok, is only wrong in the preview (before sharing) of third party apps.\n\nThis happens for portrait photos, landscape photos doesn't have this issue.",
