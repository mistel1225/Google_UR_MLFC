    "title": "Has anybody had issues with skin burns/rash from Pixel 3 being in your front pocket?",
    "content": "I always keep my phone in my front pocket (screen facing my leg), and one day I noticed an uncomfortable feeling on my leg. It looked a little red and irritated. By the next day it was basically a full blown rash, and the next day it had progressed to almost looking like burns with some light blistering. I began putting my phone in my back pocket, and most of the rash/burn cleared up within a few days, but I still have about a 1\" spot on my leg that is still red and discolored and the skin almost looks like a chemical burn.",
