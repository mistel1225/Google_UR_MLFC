    "content": "Hi there,\nA few days ago my Google Pixel 4 XL turned itself off and now won't turn on. It displays the battery with a question mark symbol. This is the second time the 4 XL has stopped working properly for me -- I bought one originally direct from Google in April 2020, then had to get it replaced once in July 2020 when it started switching itself off in my pocket. That one was replaced in July and now this issue has started.\nI've chatted with Google Support, who said that I bought my phone from a retailer (I didn't -- bought it direct from Google), and I keep being told the issue is being investigated and they'll have an update 'soon'. I've been waiting three days now, and have this morning emailed through the original email receipts for the original purchase, then the replacement purchase in July.\nIn the meantime, I'm using an old backup device with a dodgy battery. In short, I totally regret purchasing the Pixel 4 XL and want to know what my options are. I've paid more money than I ever have before for this phone with which I am totally dissatisfied. \nCheers,\nPatrick",
