    "content": "Hello,\nI'm a new Google pixel 3 owner and I noticed something really annoying... While I have Earbuds connected and phone in silent mode it keeps vibrating if I get a notification. I tried also Battery Saver but it keeps vibrate . The only way I found to stop it , is to disable Assistant from earbuds ... The notification sounds that I listen when I get a message or whatever is perfectly okay but how can I disable vibration without losing assistant? That's really dumb I think.. It should have an option .. Thank you for your time!",
