    "title": "No Audio or MIC on Pixel1 XL When logged into Google account",
    "content": "I'm having this very weird problem where both speakers and mic on the phone do not function at all while I'm signed in to my google account on the phone. However, if i remove the account both speaker, loud speaker and microphone all work fine. I've made sure its not muted and all volume sliders are up to maximum. I've also performed a factory reset multiple times in an attempt to fix the issue. The phone has all the latest software updates. It also does not work in safe mode.\n\nOriginally i thought i was a faulty phone. I returned it and received a new replacement. The exact same problem occurs with the new phone. I tried creating a new google account and logging in with that. Yet the problem still occurs. It only seems to work when the phone isn't linked to any account.",
