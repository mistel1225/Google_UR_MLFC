    "content": "Push emails are not pushing. They are either delayed or do not arrive unless Gmail is manually refreshed.\nThis has occurred on my Pixel 3a XL and TWO Pixel 4a 5G's.  This occurs regardless of whether I am on WiFi or cellular data. It also occurs on both Gmail and Exchange accounts. Adaptive battery has been turned off. It does NOT happen on LG or Apple phones. This feels like a Pixel issue.",
