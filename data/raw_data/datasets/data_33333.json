    "content": "Contacted Sprint support and went to the store but both indicated my device is not eligible for Sprint. However, many people were successfully activated Pixel 3 XL on Sprint. I verified that I got the right sim card (SIMOLW516TQ). https://s4gru.com/forums/topic/7833-the-s4gru-byod-sim-compatibility-chart/  It is surely not about the the sim as the device based on the serial number was marked not eligible. I bought out this phone from Verizon five days ago and was able to use it with a T-mobile sim card.",
