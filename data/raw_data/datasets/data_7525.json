    "content": "HSBC app stopped recognising the finger print sensor on my pixel 3a permanently. I've tried deleting the app and reinstalling it and it is still not recognised. \n\nI had this occasionally happen in the past , but closing and re-opening the app would fix it.\n\nFollowing the recent pixel update (January 2021), it has just stopped working altogether. I haven't been able to find any restrictions in the settings related to the fingerprint senor. Any suggestions?",
