    "title": "Cannot play media through Jeep uconnect system",
    "content": "After every other phone update my phone develops an issue where media (music, podcasts,etc) won't play through the uconnect head unit in my Jeep. I have tried restarting the phone, the head unit and the car. I have also removed the phone from the car's connections and the car from the phone's connections and tried to reconnect (pair). Nothing seems to work. However, there doesn't seem to be a problem with the phone functions, which still seem to connect properly",
