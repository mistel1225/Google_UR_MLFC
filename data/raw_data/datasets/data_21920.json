    "content": "In the top right corner of my notification bar I see an alarm icon. It has been there for weeks and is set for Monday 10 am (which I get to see when I swipe down). It appears to me that it is not an icon of the regular Android alarm (which appears to the left of the not-bar). The alarm never went off, nothing ever happens on monday 10 am, it seems pretty useless to me. I can't seem to get rid of it, and I really don't know which app might cause this. I went through the alarm settings, I went through the regular settings, I went through my apps...I just don't know.\n\nDoes anybody have any experience with this? Can you help me take down that icon?",
