    "content": "I am awaiting a link to replace my Pixel 3 XL which decided not to power up one day.   Google support responded quickly and RMA02423417 was issued and expired since I wanted to make sure it was covered.   I am told an email was sent for a new RMA02485306 but there is none in any folder.  Help.",
