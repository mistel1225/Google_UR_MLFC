    "content": "My first generation pixel XL was hot, even though I was not using it and it was not being charged. I powered the phone off, to allow it to cool, but it would not power back on, and it was still hot, so I did a hard reset, and when it came back on I noticed that the battery level indicator was significantly lower than what it indicated before the hard reset. These symptoms indicate to me that something is running in the background demanding high CPU cycles. I can imagine that if I had not caught the problem before the battery died that the phone would be a brick. This behavior has recurred three more times over the past month. Is this software or hardware? How can I identify what is going on?",
