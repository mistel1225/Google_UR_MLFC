    "title": "Unable to delete downloads in Files app",
    "content": "I have two files showing in my Downloads folder in the Files app on my Pixel 4 XL. This could be more of an Android problem and not Pixel but I'm not 100% sure.\n\nBoth were downloaded from reliable sources that I've downloaded from before so I know 100% they're not malware or anything. \n\n1) I long-press on the first file and select them both.\n2) When both are selected, I tap on the trash can\n3) I confirm I want to delete both files. I've also tried deleting them individually and in Safe Mode.\n\n\n4) I get this notification that the files couldn't be deleted.\n\n5) Tapping on view details just gives a list of the files.\n\n\nI had this happen once before and after trying to delete and then restarting my phone it fixed it. This isn't the case this time. The PDF has been here since last Friday and the APK (Amazon Web Store to install an app I bought from Amazon) has been since this morning. Thank you in advance for your assistance.",
