    "content": "Went through the steps of the \"Speed up a slow Pixel phone\" guide of the Help Center (https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/6377329?hl=en&ref_topic=7084009), but neither of the steps solved my problem. Neither apps reset, factory device reset and even in safe mode the lagging is as present as in normal mode.\n\nTakes approx. one second to input one character via keyboard. Menu scrolling lags as well.\n\nIs there a way to uninstall/roll-back the December 2019 Security Update?",
