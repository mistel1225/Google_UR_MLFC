    "content": "The front camera of Pixel 4a is not working. Last week, I was able to take selfies properly but today suddenly the front camera isn't detecting any object. It is showing \"Try Night Mode\" even in complete sunlight or in a well-lit room. I have restarted the device and closed all the apps to check but it is still not working. There was some update notification few days back and I had done that. Post that the front camera is not working. Please suggest what to do.",
