    "title": "When the pixel 4a case will be ready to ship in India? Or shall we go with Spigen as Google is late",
    "content": "As we have eagerly waited for Pixel in India, the same patience will have to show for pixel 4a case also? As soon as we buy the pixel 4a, we need a case to protect our new phone. But here Google shows coming soon which we clearly know will be equal to few months. So being a loyal google customer, we will be compelled to buy brands like Spigen, Caselogy etc. \nA request to Google, kindly put a date on case webpage so that it will be easy for us to take a decision. Give us all the necessary information regarding the retailer, shipping, price, country availability etc. \n\nStill hoping, Google will release 4a case on or before 16th October.",
