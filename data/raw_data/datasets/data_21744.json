    "title": "Microphone not working? Loud background static. On pixel 4xl",
    "content": "There's a loud background noise and the voice recording is at a very low volume. I've tried this in safe mode and have checked with device recording. The loud background noise disappears when using Bluetooth. I've already factory reset still the problem persists. I even brought it unit a Google licenced repair shop and they informed me that I could just send it in under the 1 year warranty. They have also tried to air spray the microphone as this was one possible solution. However I need this phone for work so time is essential.\nPlease please help me out with this.",
