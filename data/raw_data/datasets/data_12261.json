    "content": "My Pixel 5 (upgraded from Pixel 2) is charging extremely slowly and feeling very warm when it charges. It will take over 10 minutes to charge 1-2% of the battery. I've tried turning the phone off then back on to see if this is an issue with the battery indicator but the charging percentage doesn't change. It doesn't matter if I'm using the charger from the box or a wireless charger. I'm not clear if I've been sent a dud phone or if this is happening to anyone else.",
