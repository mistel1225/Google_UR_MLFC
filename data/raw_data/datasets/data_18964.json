    "content": "I was gonna edit a sheet I own and created, like I do every day, but today as I highlighted a cell, there was a note saying sheet is write protected. I am logged in with my only google account, on my google pixel 2. What's wrong?\n\nStrangely enough I was still able to add people who may edit the file, so I added myself and the issue is resolved. How can I be authorized to do that, when I'm not authorized to edit the file? Must be a bug somewhere.",
