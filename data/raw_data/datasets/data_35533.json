    "content": "With a few of the travel apps I use, (Delta) I can log in and try to set the Travel destination but once I pick a departing airport the app preforms a loading animation and nothing shows up on the original screen. The same works for other apps if I add new information it does not save or clears out all old information. This also seems to be an issue with news apps if I follow a link to another site when go back to the original app I end up back at the top of the news feed as if the app just relaunched. This seems like a Ram issue, but I checked other Pixel users experience and they do not have the same issue.",
