They must meet specific criteria around privacy, security, and data use.\"\n\nSo that means that there is a way in!\n\nAs a Security professional who works everyday to protect the fortune 500 companies from breaches and attacks  I have learned that the more junk you throw in the trunk the easier you make it for someone to miss-use that junk.\n\nI find it appalling that BIG Tech would once again take an action without the knowledge of their client population.\n\nThe appropriate approach would have been to inform your users of the impending change and provide a method to opt out of the change!\n\nYou have now installed an API that, regardless of what you say, can, and does, create additional exposure and an avenue for hackers to exploit.\n\nHave you learned nothing over the years?\n\nWith all of the available attack vector available why would you provide yet another for the hackers?\n\nMy Trust Level with Google is now at an all time low of ZERO!\n\nPROVIDE A WAY TO DISABLE AND REMOVE THIS API!",
