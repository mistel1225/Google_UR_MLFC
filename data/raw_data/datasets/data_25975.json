    "content": "I bought a pixel pre-owned one. It looks like working perfectly except the sim card detecting.\nI live in Germany and tried with german sim card (o2 and Telekom) but I always have no service. It seems to be detected because I can see the sim card provider on \"sim toolkit\" (It is activated with inserting sim card, but with no sim card it is hidden).\nI asked to google support team Germany with chatting. But they said my pixel is from the USA and I have to contact the seller.\nThe Pixel is not able to be unlocked (bootloader), so I think it is a Verizon model.\nCould anybody solve this issue?\nThanks in advance",
