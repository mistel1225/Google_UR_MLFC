    "content": "Hey guys, \n\nAfter updating to android 10 and freeing up some space (pictures) on my phone, a random blank image appears in my camera folder within Google photos (circled in red in attached photo)\n\nI can't seem to delete this blank image or find it within the files app.\n\nAny advice on how to get rid of it?\n\nThanks.\n\nBest Regards,\nKeith",
