    "content": "Every time I press a volume key the ok google assistant bars show at the bottom of the screen and there is haptic feedback. The only way to stop this is by turning off (disable) the google app. It also triggers when unlocking the phone either with or without the power button.\n\nI have tried disabling the accessability shortcuts. This didn't help.\n\nMy google app is the beta one.\n\nI can't remember what triggered this first starting a few months back.",
