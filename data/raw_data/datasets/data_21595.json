    "content": "I took my phone out of my pocket and it seemed to have reset. Had to put on the SIM code again. Since then my pull down top menu is very limited (6 functions; no data). I can't turn data on at all, even by going into settings. Also when in an app I can't close it by tapping the bottom middle of the screen. I can only hit back several times until it closes. Help!",
