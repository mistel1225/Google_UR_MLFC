    "title": "As I am using talk to text large parts of my message get deleted.",
    "content": "When I use talk to text on anything. Chrome, messenger, text message, anything even this. Every time I use it for more than one sentence it deletes everything except for a few words. No idea why it's happening It's been going on for months. I've reset the phone, completely deleted and reinstalled apps. I would love to find a fix because I use talk to text pretty much exclusively. The only temporary solution is to stop talking and hit a key and then rehit the microphone button. I used to talk to text for a very very long time on pixel phones without having this issue.",
