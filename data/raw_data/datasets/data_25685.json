    "content": "My phone displays \"Preferred system\" at the top where it used to say \"Verizon Wireless\" and there is a \"R\" next to the signal strength indicator. I first noticed this on 9/30/2019. My phone recently updated to Android 10. I'm not noticing any issues with calls, texts, or data. I also know I am not actually roaming. I'm on the VZW network in Columbus OH.",
