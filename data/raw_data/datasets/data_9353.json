    "content": "Whenever the onsceeen keyboard is open, any button on the right side of the top row of the screen will act like it is being moused over or highlighted, or something like that. It happens in any app with a button in that region, for example in the messages app, the button for starting a phone or video call will be highlighted. This is very annoying and I'd like to know what can be done to fix it.",
