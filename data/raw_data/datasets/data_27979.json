    "content": "I haven't been able to take a picture on my pixel 2 in a week.\n\nI think it started after upgrading to Android 10. The same problem persists in safe mode and after I've cleared the cache/memory, uninstalled the update / reinstalled update, etc.\n\nI've tried everything. Please help.\n\nI hope this isn't Google's way of forcing an upgrade to the pixel 4..",
