    "content": "I like the pinned live scores, but starting the other day, the notification bar says I have a pinned score, but the score/bubble is nowhere to be found on the display.  I can't get rid of the notification either - had to reboot to clear it.  Now when I tried to pin a score tonight, I get the notification, but can't find the score bubble anywhere.  It's like it got moved off the edge of the display.",
