    "content": "I have been using my pixel 2 unplugged overnight whilst siting with my baby, stints of about 2-3 hours and am getting what I can only describe as a small electric shock. During this time I am holding the phone one handed with my little finger around the charge connection and index by the fingerprint scanner and am getting a pretty noticeable slightly painful tingling. This also has now seemed to also be the case when plugged in and charging. I don't believe this is static related issue.",
