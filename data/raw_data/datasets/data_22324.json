    "content": "I am setting up a new Pixel 4. And trying to transfer my data from my Galaxy s7. When I plug the cables to connect the two phones I get a message on my galaxy that says \"Data transfer tool: No installed apps work with this USB accessory. Learn more about this accessory at https://g.co/datatransferhelp\" which just brings me to the pixel set up instructions. Which doesn't help. Has this happened to anyone? What do I do to transfer data? Any downside to transferring the data another day?",
