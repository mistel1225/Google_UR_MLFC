    "title": "No Bluetooth operability at my house. Non device specific.",
    "content": "As soon as I turn any BT peripheral on....  at home, it ceases to work.  Literally...  I am unable to use BT, AirPlay,  etc.  The devices always need a power cycle at least, to communicate as expected and often need to be factory reset to be used again.  And only when I have left my neighborhood.  Here are three screen shots of the BT scanner software.  1 and 2 are taken immediately at BT switch on.  3 is at switch off, \nI do not own an Apple TV.  I am sure none of these unknown devices are mine... unless this activity can be expected from non BT enabled devices.  \n\nAs an aside...I did discover my Alpine car stereo was set to operate as a BT participant even though the car and the stereo was off.  \n\nCan anyone please tell me what the problem source is and perhaps how to solve it?",
