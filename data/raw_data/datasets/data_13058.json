    "content": "I have had my Pixel 3 for over a year now.  When driving, my phone will place itself in Do Not Disturb mode and Driving mode, which is fine.  However, when not driving it will randomly and constantly turn these features on.  I have taken the steps to delete any Do Not Disturb schedules, but it still turns on.  Some days when I notice it is on when I am not driving, I will check the Do Not Disturb settings and a schedule has been created.  What is going on and how do I fix it?",
