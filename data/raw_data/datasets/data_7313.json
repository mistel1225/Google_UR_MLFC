    "title": "Pixel 4 XL WiFi not working after android 11 update even after factory reset.",
    "content": "It's been several months since both of our Pixel 4 XL phones were upgraded to Android 11. I have tried everything including two factory resets, and WiFi still works only a few seconds at a time, even though phone says it's connected. Pages take several seconds to load or sometimes I have to turn WiFi on and off for it to work. Every other device in the house has absolutely no issues and our phones were fine until Android 11 was pushed out. Google has ignores this issue that is all over the internet as I assume they have no idea how to resolve.\nI find this situation unacceptable and someone from Google needs to reach out to help resolve this situation or replace our phones. Otherwise this will be the last device that I will ever purchase from Google and currently my house is full of them.",
