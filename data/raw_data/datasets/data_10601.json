    "content": "Hello. I am not sure what is the exact problem with my Pixel 4XL. I just quess it may be connected to when I get under the hard rain, because after that I can not turn on my phone. But its my quess I am not expert. And Google doesn't want to accept because its water related. But its my quess, it may not. I wanted to be honest. I am not rich guy from Rodeo Drive, I am Ukrainian guy who moved here to get better live. Lost job because of Covid and I really need my 9 month phone back to even get started looking for some job. Google completely ignoring my asking to check what is wrong. I was expecting a bit more support and understanding. Any advice will be much appreciated. Thank you -",
