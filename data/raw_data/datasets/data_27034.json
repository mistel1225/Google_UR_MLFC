    "content": "Hi,\n\nI purchased the Pixel 3a a few weeks ago and I experience call quality issues via LTE.\n\nIf I was called I can barely understand my counterpart. If I call back everything is fine. In both cases onr can hear that VoLTE is used. The upgrade to Android 10 did not make any difference.\n\nI already changed from a physical SIM to eSIM after I experienced the issue the first time. Does anyone have any suggestions how to fix this?\n\nThanks to everyone!",
