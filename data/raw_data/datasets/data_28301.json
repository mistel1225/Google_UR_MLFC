    "title": "Difficulty getting Customer Support to send RMA labels (Over a month so far)",
    "content": "I had Google Customer Support agree an RMA for my faulty Pixel 3 over a month ago. However I did not get any labels sent to me despite them telling me they take up to 24 hours to arrive.\n\nI have now had 3 Chats with support chasing them for these after which this was escalated to Pritika in 'The Google Support Team' \n\nI have emailed her 10 times trying to get an update on the issue but all I get in terms as a response is that this is 'prioritized with our specialist team' \n\nI am not convinced that anyone is making any effort to resolve this and there is no apparent way to get this escalated further.\n\nCan anyone help in any way? Any advice would be appreciated! Thanks\n\n7-7635000027171",
