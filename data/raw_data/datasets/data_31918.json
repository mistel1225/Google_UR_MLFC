    "content": "2 identical Pixel 3s bought at same time (Nov 2018) from Verizon online. Tech at Verizon store suggested turning off Bluetooth and WiFi.  Didn't help.  60 minutes on phone with \"Bill\" at Verizon - told I could send both new phones back and get refurbished ones.  We've lived in same house 19 years, always had Verizon phones of all brands. NEVER have had any problems with connectivity anywhere in the country.  I work 6 miles from home and have for 12 years.  Never a problem.  Only with the Pixel 3s.  My husband calls me from home and one of has to step outside or put speaker on.  Is it the microphone?  The antenna?  Anyone have similar issues or know a solution?",
