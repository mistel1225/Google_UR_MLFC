    "content": "My Pixel 4A making creaky noise while pressing the back panel near camera bump. I reached to Google Support. They told me they will create a B2X ticket and will take 500 Rs. as it does not come under warranty. And they will solve the problem within 19 business days.\n\nMy question: were there any charges asked when your Pixel 4A was sent to repair center?",
