    "content": "When I send messages with Latvian language special characters such as \"ā, ē, ķ, ņ\" etc they get sent as simple letters \"a, e, k, n\". I already tried changing languages and looking for gboard settings to fix this, but no luck. Anyone knows of a fix? I read that same has happened with other non-English languages, but couldn't find a solution.",
