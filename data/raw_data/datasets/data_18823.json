    "content": "OG Pixel (2016 version) here that was working fine until recent Android 10 firmware update.\nFirmware updated and the phone just shut down. Will not charge or respond to any button press combinations. \n\nI see that this is a problem with hundreds of users on this forum as well as reddit.\nStrangely enough, when usb cable is connected to PC, the PC will make a noise as if it is recognizing a device is connected though phone is dead. But it doesn't show up on the PC in device manager.\n\nGoogle needs to fix this, whether in warranty or not. Firmware update bricked my phone.",
