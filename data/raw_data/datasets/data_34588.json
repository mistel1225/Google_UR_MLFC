    "content": "I bought a pixel 2 XL (not brand new),\nI found that the bootloader is unlocked, On my play store it says my device is not certified by play protect.\nI wanted to know if this is because the bootloader is unlocked, if that's the case how can I relock bootloader because I can't download Netflix or even when I downloaded the app I can't watch anything because it says the device is not supported.",
