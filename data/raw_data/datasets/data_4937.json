    "title": "Google Podcasts Cuts Out When Phone Sleeps",
    "content": "My phone is up to date but I just started having problems listening to Google Podcasts via earpods.  \nWhen my phone goes to sleep the podcasts continue but I can no longer hear them in my earpods. As soon as I wake the phone up it starts playing in my earpods again. \nAnother poster on this forum had the same problem and found that shutting off Google Assistant helped resolve it.  I would like a solution that lets me continue to use Google Assistant.\n\nI have several sets of earpods.  Lately some sets work well but in other sets only one earpod will play at a time.  I can change which earpods are playing by touching the earpod but I've been unable to find a way to get both of them to play together.\n\nThanks in advance.",
