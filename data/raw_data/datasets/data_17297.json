    "content": "Hello, I bought a Pixel 3 way back in January 2019 and up to this day all my Photos and screenshots from that phone were counted on the cloud storage (which is said to be unlimited for pixel 3 owners). I have some other photos that i backed up to the same gmail before buying the pixel but that took less than 5-6 GB of the storage. Now its at 13.22GB and growing.\nFor clearance:\nOnly photos from my camera and screenshots are being backed up (although I have disabled the screenshots and I am looking for a way to delete them from the cloud)\nMy mail uses 500MB and my non photo files are using 770MB.\nI contacted google's customer support but they only showed me how to change the quality of the backups.",
