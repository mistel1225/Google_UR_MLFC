    "content": "My Pixel 3a has very low ringtone/alert/alarm volume. You can barely hear incoming calls and alarms etc\n\nIt is not the speakers as when you play the sound  from settings, it is plenty  loud as is media.\n\nIn call voice volume is fine.\n\nAll volume sliders are to max\n\nWorks the same in safe mode\n\nHas not always been like this\n\nThere seems to be a lot of folks on here and elsewhere on the net that seem to have a similar issue. Have not found a definitive solution, is there one.",
