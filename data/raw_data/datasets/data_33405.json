    "content": "Just bought off ebay. Seller says it was fine when shipped. I can't boot into recovery mode from bootloader. When I select recovery mode, it just shuts off/reboots...when not plugged in, I can't even boot into bootloader. When plugged in, I can get bootloader, but no option helps. An odd reg battery icon, then green battery icon, then white regular battery icon flashes when plugged in. Plus a red dot in the top right corner that blinks slowly. Any ideas? Can't do anything with adb on Mac.",
