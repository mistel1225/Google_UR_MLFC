    "content": "I have raised a repair request for Pixel 2 XL and B2X has picked up the device on 5th July.\nDevice reached there on 10th.  Since then it was showing status as ‘device collected’. I had to follow multiple times to escalate until they have updated the status to ‘repair in progress’.\nI am not sure if they have actually started repair or bluffing with me because it has been 6 days and status shows the same. \nI had just simple connectivity issue as device is not getting connected to PC otherwise perfectly well maintained device. Should it take 6 days after starting repair on the device on the same status??\nThey have not responding to email except pre-drafted, automated kind of replies.\nEach time you try talking to customer support, there is a different agent other side which assures same thing- to get back with status in 24-48 hours. And they never respond until you have the next follow up.\nI have spent hard earned money on such a flagship product and didn’t expect such pathetic tie up with support centre like B2X.\nAround 20 days and status of repair is unknown. I am not sure what B2X is doing with my device.\nFew of the agents said its due to pandemic such delay is happening, I don’t see this is a pandemic issue, this is case of bad coordination, misrepresentation of repair status and  pathetic service centre support like B2X.\nCustomer deserves to know the status of the device being repaired, customer is also not spared by the pandemic.",
