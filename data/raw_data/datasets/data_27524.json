    "content": "I have one Insta 360 One x Camera which can do live streaming of videos when connected to a mobile phone via an OTG cable. I am using the camera Micro usb to regular usb cable and connecting it to the Pixel 3 xl using the Pixel OTG adapter (which came with the phone), However the connection fails ( the app deos not detect the phone connection) and the USB tether mode always goes back to charging. The tethering shows that the connection is controlled by the camera which is correct. Pixel /Pixel 2 xl are listed as compatible with the camera. Please help.",
