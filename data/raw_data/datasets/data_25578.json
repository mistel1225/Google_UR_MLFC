    "content": "I recently replaced my google pixel 3 under warranty. Now this new pixel autoplays my audible whenever I connect headphones or an audio playback device. I would like this to stop, but I can't find any setting related to automatic playback.\n\nThere is no setting in app or in that controls autoplay, and I have never had this issue before.",
