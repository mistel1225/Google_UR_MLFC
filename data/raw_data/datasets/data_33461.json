    "content": "I'm trying to setup my WiFi calling to WiFi preference but there is no option to change it so it's on default mobile preference. I'm sure this option was there before the march update was rolled out. I have reset my network settings and a phone reboot with no change. I have WiFi and 4g activated on my 02 account.",
