    "content": "After a day like many others, I set my alarms on my pixel 3 like always and went to sleep. The next day I woke up way too late and discovered that my pixel was not responding to anything. It won't turn on, charging it through the USB or wireless makes no difference. I live in the Netherlands and bought the device in Germany. I would like to send it for a repair in Germany because it stills falls under the warranty but I do not know how to contact google. The only option I could find was via the pixel help service on the phone itself but I can not access that. Does anyone know if there is a easy way to fix my phone or otherwise how I can sent my phone to google to be repeared.",
