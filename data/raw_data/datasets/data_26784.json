    "content": "In the at a glance section, it displays weather, I saw another post on Reddit where they shared a Google support message that said by disabling the Google app (swipe right) and all the weather notifications, after 14hrs it should disappear.\n\nAfter a week it's still in at a glance, I have a better weather widget and it's annoying me that I can't disable the weather in at a glance. Also I don't want a third party launcher, they all suck.",
