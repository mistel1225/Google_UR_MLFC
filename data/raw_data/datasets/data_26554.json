    "title": "The Analogue accessory detected notification",
    "content": "Theres this notification popping up one day \"Analogue audio accessory detected    The attached device is not compatible with this phone. Tap to lean more. \" and have stayed in the notification bar ever since without plugging anything into the port. After seeing the message the fisr tthing i tried is actually plugging the wired pixel buds that came with the phone into the port, of course I couldn't hear anything though it. Although the notificaiton isn't much of a problem this makes it so that my pixel 3 now cannot charge wired. I tried booting the phone into safe mode, disabling the non-exsistent audio device through the bluetooth section in settings, tried cleaning the port with some sharpened toothpicks, tried deleting apps that might affect the port, and lastly after everything failed I factor resetted my phone, and still the notification just comes back up. I've literally searched through the entire internet for any solutions but I genuinely could not find anyone with solid evidence that worked. I know that multiple posts about this same problem have been posted but I still made this post hopefully to see whether any progress had been made on the problem. A patch recently came in for the pxel 3 but with no luck fixing the problem, hopefully someone found a solution here in the forums.",
