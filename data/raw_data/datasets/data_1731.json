    "content": "When taking pictures with my pixel 4a the images are blown out and the colors are all wrong. When a photo is sent to me, same thing but when I send a photo to another pixel 4a phone they look great so it  looks like a program problem in my phone and not the camera. Would reinstalling all aps help or is this something I can't fix?",
