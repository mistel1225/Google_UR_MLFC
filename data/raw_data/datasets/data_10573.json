    "content": "Hi\nI have a Pixel 5 on EE (UK)\nOTA system updates only seem to work for me if I disconnect WiFi and use mobile data.\nIf I look for a system update over wifi it says I'm up to date.\nIf I turn off wifi, it detects the OTA update but then it says \"Download Paused\" with a warning about \"Downloading updates over a mobile network, metered Wi-Fi or while roaming may cause additional charges\"\nI then turn on wifi, and it says \"System update, update available\" in the System menu\nIf I go into this, I just get the above \"download Paused\" message constantly, even after clicking \"Resume\"",
