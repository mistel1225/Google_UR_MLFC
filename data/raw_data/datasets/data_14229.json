    "content": "Hi,\nThere are 2 features I would like to turn off and restore to how they where in android 10. \n\n1. Turn off media controls. I prefer the media controls as a notification, and not added to my quick settings.\n\n2. Adding suggested apps back.\nWhen you opened up the recent apps menu, at the bottom, there was a Google search bar and about 5 suggested apps + the app drawer. This functionality has been replaced with \"screenshot\" and \"search\" and I have no use for either of these buttons,and would like to reverse it to how it was in Android 9 and 10.",
