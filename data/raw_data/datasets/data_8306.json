    "content": "I recently got me a pixel 5 and have noticed all of the photos taken from the front cam of the pixel 5 paint me red, literally ! All the photos have me with 'red skin' instead of my natural brown skin- is there a setting that needs to be changed for this to stop happening? I have tried a fair few photos with all three options of the Face Retouching option with no luck. There's one other reddit thread talking about this but its for a Pixel 2 XL. All I want is just a normal (real looking) photo.",
