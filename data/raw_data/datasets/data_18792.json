    "content": "I take pictures of my hand creating different hand modes for manuals. I have adjusted the lighting and am taking the night shot which helps. But I want to purchase an external light source that works to give me better photos. I bought some LED lights and it made dark grey lines through the picture until I moved it completely away from the light source. There was a notification that Pixel 2 Cameras don't like LED lighting. I was recommended to get a light ring from a photo place - however, those are LED and I am concerned they won't work. What is my best option to get better photos with less shadows and darkness. If the Light Rings will work, which size is best. I also seen a Light Cube.",
