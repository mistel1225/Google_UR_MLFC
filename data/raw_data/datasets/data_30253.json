    "content": "I hope my ordeal will raise awareness. After this, I request anyone who is reading this to NOT to buy any PIXEL phones.\nJust one month after the warranty, my phone started freezing. Soon, it started restarting itself in a loop and froze continuously. I was informed by Google Support that no replacement would be provided because my phone is out of warranty. The b2x team took my phone for further diagnosis and I was quoted a price for the repair which I paid. 11 days later I get my phone back, but soon I was to discover that it was a defected piece. Just 7 days after the speaker of my phone suddenly stopped working. When I brought this issue to attention I was told that I will have to again go through the entire ordeal because this is a different issue than the previous one.\nIs this how Google, which claims to be superior to Apple and claims to offer premium smartphones, is supposed to be? A bunch of incompetent people who couldn't notice a major default during diagnosis of my phone, and claim it to be an electrical issue that just happened within a week of repair.\nThis was not expected of such a reputable organisation, and I have never been so disappointed. I used to consider myself a part of Google family; but now I'll advise everyone never to buy their product.",
