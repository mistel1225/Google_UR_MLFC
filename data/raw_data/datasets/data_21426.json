    "content": "When I plug my Pixel 3 in to charge, nothing happens. The cable and connection seem good and I've checked that the port is clean. The supplied USB-C earphones work.\n\nIf I turn the phone off with the cable plugged in, it starts charging immediately and then continues to charge when I turn it back on. The battery also drained from 100% to 72% overnight yesterday.\n\nAny suggestions? Many shops are closed at the moment here in Germany due to the COVID-19 outbreak.",
