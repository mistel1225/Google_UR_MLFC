    "content": "My Pixel 2 XL with Pixel Launcher has been showing the wrong weather on the at a glance widget and the lock screen. I don't know where this weather is coming from since when I click on it I then see the correct weather and location. Use location is on. I tried switching to a different launcher, which because it's a different widget it will show the correct weather on the home screen but the lock screen still shows the wrong weather. \nI recently turned off tracking and personalization type Google stuff because I didn't want to be tracked and search results were horrendous and unusable.\nThe weather issue was there before I made these adjustments.",
