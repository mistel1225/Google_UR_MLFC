    "content": "I'm a bit confused.. Would it even matter if it's not unlimited since the original size photo from the pixel meets the minimum resolution before it counts towards your storage? (of course 4k videos don't count, but photos should be good even in original resolution since specs show 12MP + 16MP camera)",
