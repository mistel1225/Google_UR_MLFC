    "content": "Yesterday evening my Pixel 3, which I've only had for ~ one month, notified me of unusual high data usage.  Upon investigation I could see that within two hours Google Photos used 1.5 GB of mobile data.  I hadn't used Google Photos or the camera app that day, the app wasn't open, and the was no synching activity to speak of.  Where did that data go, and what was it going towards?\n\nI paused the app and continue to have the app paused.  Today when I briefly unpaused the app and tried to pause again, I received the error message \"can't pause Photos\".  \n\nGoogle, what is happening here??",
