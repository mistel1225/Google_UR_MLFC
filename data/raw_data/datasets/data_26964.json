    "content": "I've tried all solutions (safe mode, network data reset, factory reset, router factory reset, disconnected all other wifi devices, etc.).\n\nThis issue started yesterday morning after the phone charged overnight.  Have not dropped it, it hasn't been submerged it in water, it hasn't been shocked with electricity - it's has a very well cared for life.  \n\nMy Chromebook and Chromium device both connect to wifi no problem.  Issue isn't router.\n\nGoogle says to return to them for a new one, but I'll be without a phone for 8-10 business days.\n\nIs there any other fix that can be recommended?",
