    "content": "Alright, so. I have adaptive charging turned on and on the locked screen it says \"full by 9:30 am\", which is the time of my weekend's alarm. The bedtime is set to 11pm.. I couldn't sleep, so I checked Discord on my phone and realized: it's almost full after an hour. This night, the same thing is happening: It's always fast charging, which is also making the battery heat up a lot. Room temperature is about 13Â°C, I like to sleep in a cold room. Yes, I am using the official charger and the official cable. Any fixes for this?",
