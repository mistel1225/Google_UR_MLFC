    "content": "I discovered a slight annoyance with my new Pixel 3A. After first powering up the phone, you will not get any notifications whatsoever until after you manually unlock the phone. That being said, all email, messages, texts, etc notifications will not alert you at all. You must first unlock your phone, and then you receive notifications. This extra step is a small hassle. All other phones that I've had, Android, give you notifications instantaneously after powering up the device. I wish the Pixel 3A did the same thing. I would like to receive my notifications as soon as it powers up. Then if there's a notification, I would unlock it to see what I was notified about. Without a notification, I never unlocked my phone and missed several important texts from work the first few days after receiving my phone. Maybe it's not a huge deal to some, but it is a slight annoyance. Maybe Google can correct this with an update?",
