    "content": "Since one week now, when I connect my Pixel Buds (2020) to my Pixel 5, suddenly relaxation sounds which are pretty loud are playing. \nSometimes it starts at 11 AM or at 14 PM. \nAlso, the google assistant tells me after some time always that she cant currently read my notifications.\nThe music is playing non-stop over every other sound -> phone call, spotify, voice mails, etc.\n\nWhat I tried:\n1.) Turn several applications off and uninstall Spotify \n2.) Restart the phone.\n3.) Disconnect Ear Buds (music continues on speakers)\n4.) Sleeping time settings of clock app.\n\nAny idea what the problem is?",
