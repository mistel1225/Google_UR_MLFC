    "title": "Pixel 3 restarting continuously",
    "content": "My phone was continuously restarting until the battery finally died. The phone was rarely on long enough for me to power off, however I did manage to hit \"power off\" once or twice - but that did nothing. Phone said \"Shutting down\" and then would turn on again! It was already at 43%, but it took close to two hours for it to finally die. I let it sit for a while until the phone cooled down. As soon as I plugged it in to charge it, it started restarting over & over again. I was able to try restarting in safe mode once, but nothing changed. I searched through Pixel community issues, and no one has found a solution other than dropping their phone on the carpet, which I'm not interested in trying. There were no new apps downloaded around the time this issue started happening. I bought the phone in November of 2017 and I keep all apps up to date, and download all phone/system updates.",
