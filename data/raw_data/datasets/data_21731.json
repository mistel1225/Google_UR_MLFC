    "content": "Phone all of a sudden doesn't charge with original factory charger. Conveniently it's just out of warranty period.\n\nThis is a problem a large number of people are having. Threads have been locked. Google need to acknowledge and fix this problem.\n\n-Original charger works on other phones\n-replaced charger and cable with new genuine type. Didn't work.\n- updated phone didn't work\n-Factory reset didn't work\n-Cleaned port with compressed air and pikster didn't work.\n- tried a USB-A to USB-C cable out of computer,  works but slowly. And plugging it in causes the phone to instantly turn off.\n\nI want to buy the pixel xl 4 but if this isn't acknowledged and fixed I will not be buying another Google phone.",
