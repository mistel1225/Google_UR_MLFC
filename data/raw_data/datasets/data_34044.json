    "content": "I went through the initial setup of my new Pixel 3, and did the copy apps and data thing with the cable. After an hour it said it had finished, but on the results screen there was a LOT of yellow exclamation points.\n\nAs near as I can tell my photos and contacts transferred, as well as all the apps I had downloaded. But nothing else. So the apps were not set up, none of my emails transferred (except Gmail, but not Bluemail or Yahoo). None of the login data for saved wifi networks or apps were transferred. None of my texts or call history.\n\nNow on my old phone I have a notification from 3:45 pm that cannot be dismissed and says \"Google Play services- Data Transfer Reconnect your cable.\" That is the time I finished setting up and the Pixel said I should unplug the cable. Plugging int he cable to both phones does nothing.\n\nAny ideas?",
