    "content": "Hey so my google pixel 2 is completely glitched out. Like the screen is just a bunch of colors and boxes. Has anybody encountered this/know what to do? Tried holding down my power button to reset and the phone still vibrates when I do that but it's not shutting down. Would letting the battery die and trying again fix this? Is my phone bricked? Thanks very much.",
