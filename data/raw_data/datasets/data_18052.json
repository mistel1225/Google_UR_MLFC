    "content": "I purchased a cheapie used Pixel 1 for when mine (same) had to go in for service. Moving data over to the wiped spare was easy but now that I want to go back to my fixed one, which wasn't wiped, I can't seem to move messages without wiping it first. I had a ton of issues like lost logins/passwords with the first data transfer so I'm hesitant to do that again. \n\nIs there a way to move just the messages from the spare to the original?  Photos seemed to move over already with no problem but there were messages and pix sent in messages that I want to have from when I was using the spare.\n\nI would keep the spare going but I got the smallest memory since I knew I'd only be using it for a moment.",
