    "content": "Hello Team, \n\nThis is a service request for Google Pixel 2 battery, under warranty. Its been an year now since the situation after Google auto close my issue for battery under warranty period. The issue is still recurring, the battery has been draining very fast & have to charge my phone at least and abrupt shutting at 35% with battery getting extremely heated while talking calls or video calls. \n Even after 100% charge the battery drains out within 5-6 hrs which was much much higher previously. Also, while it reaches 30 or 35% and if on call, then abruptly the phone turns off. \n\nI had raised the issue during warranty period in Feb, 2020 and the issue was auto closed by Google without any resolution. \n\nThe battery is currently under warranty. Kindly assist with service request & help to replace the battery. I understand as Google loyal customer the support would be ensured timely and with complete resolution to maintain the user experience. \n\nThank you!\n\nReena Baby",
