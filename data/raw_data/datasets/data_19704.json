    "content": "a few months after use there is no sound coming from incoming calls. spoke with multiple agents they all said contradictory statements. one was able to provide a few troubleshooting tips and i went through everything, even factory resetting the phone. if i were to bring it to ubreakifix would they be able to make the repair and would that in any way void any warranties. I know a lot of people had this issue and it looks like google does not care at all. Has anyone found a fix. Please share if you have. Thank You.",
