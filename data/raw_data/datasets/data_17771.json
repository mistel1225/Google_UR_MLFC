    "content": "I am trying to find out how I escalate a Google complaint.\nI have a replacement pixel from Google that is faulty.  It's been logged and Google sent yet another phone out.\nThe replacement has not been delivered, but is now 'lost in transit'\nGoogle are refusing to escalate, resolve or in any way help.\nMy credit card has been taken to secure and I'm worried I will be charged.\nGoogle support are unable to send another phone.\nSo I'm 14 days without a working phone, a phone lost in transit and hours trying to get a resolution with Google.\nCan anyone supply me details so I can log a complaint and contact the ombudsman.",
