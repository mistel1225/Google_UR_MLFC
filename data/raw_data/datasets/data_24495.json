    "title": "Facebook Messengers mute button causing soft reboot on Pixel 3a. Anyone else experience this?",
    "content": "This started happening after the Dec. 5 security update. When I use Facebook messengers audio calls I typically have to use the mute button due to the loud environment I work in. Ive noticed when i unmute and mute multiple times during a conversation (around 5 or 6 cycles unmuting and muting) in a short period of time (5 minutes or less) my pixel 3a will freeze and perform a soft reboot. Anybody else experience this? I have performed a factory reset and this still happens.",
