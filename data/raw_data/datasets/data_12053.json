    "content": "I have an HP wireless printer that i use to print emails/docs from my phone with no issues.  The printer still shows in the list to select but recently (last 3 days) i am not able to print any longer.  I get an error \"Sorry that didn't work.  Try again\".  I am not sure if a required app to print was removed but i am not able to print from any app on my Pixel 3a.\n\nHelp please?!?!?!?",
