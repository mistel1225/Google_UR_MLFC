    "title": "Very Poor, Grainy Video Call Quality on Pixel 5: WhatsApp, Google Duo, Skype have the same issue",
    "content": "Video call quality on Video calling Apps like WhatsApp, Google Duo & Skype is horrible on PIXEL 5. The video quality is so grainy, it is pathetic. Bright sunny environments are made black & white. These days video calling is so essential and issue with that is non-negotiable. I have seen Google support passing the buck saying check with 3rd party app developers.\nCheck your own Duo app for this Google.\nHow can this be not a priority issue and that too on your latest flagship phone.\nThe photos and videos from the normal Camera App are really good, take nothing away from it but on video calls you have to fix this.\nOr \nLet me know how to return this phone because service providers like Optus Australia DO NOT CONSIDER THIS AS AN ISSUE, HEIGHTS.\nSo want to go back to my iPhone.\n\nGRAINY VIDEO CALL QUALITY -1\n\n\nGRAINY VIDEO CALL QUALITY -2\n\n\nACTUAL PIXEL CAMERA OUTSIDE VIDEO CALLS\n\n\n\nGautam\na not happy Pixel 5 user wanting to return this phone.",
