    "content": "When opening the camera app on my Google pixel 3 it often crashes. When it doesn't crash I can take pictures but when I switch to another mode like panorama or video it will result in a crash. \nOpening the camera function in another app like WhatsApp or Snapchat will show me an error message and closes the app.\n\nWhat I tried to fix is:\nCleaning the camera lens and laser.(didn't help)\nRestarting my phone (helps at first but after couple uses will crash again)\nDeleting the memory of the app and updating it again (didn't help at all)\nReboot phone in safe mode(does not help)\nForce stop the camera app, clearing cache and data (does not help)\nFactory reset or/and wiping data (didn't help)\n\nWhat can I do to fix my camera?",
