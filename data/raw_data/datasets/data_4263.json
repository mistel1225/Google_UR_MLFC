    "title": "Google Pixel 3 battery is draining 1% per MINUTE while in use.",
    "content": "This battery issue started in mid March. Previously I would always get a full day of use from a full charge (including 2-3 hrs of screen on time). Now my battery is draining at 1% per minute while in use. Under settings, the battery usage that is shown does not match the actual battery usage (see attached screen shot). As shown in the screen shot, if you add up all the percentages of battery usage since full charge it equals 12% so the battery should still be at 88%, but instead my battery is at 48%. ",
