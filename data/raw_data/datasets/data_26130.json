    "content": "I just recently installed a Work Profile on my Pixel 2, and installed the Phone App on the work profile side. I manged to get my contacts from my work e-mail, but the Voicemail option is completely gone, visual and regular. It still appears on my personal side, but I need it working on my work profile in order to have access to my work contacts.\n\nNot only that, but I tested calling my phone and the missed call does not appear on my work profile, only my personal side. Anyone else encounter this issue? Thanks!",
