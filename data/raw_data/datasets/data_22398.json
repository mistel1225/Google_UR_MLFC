    "content": "My Pixel 2 XL start having issues with signals (zero bars) after the Android 10 update. Tried everything with Google Support including Factory reset, new SIM, safe mode, trying SIM in different phone etc. but to no avail. Support eventually agreed to ship a replacement phone once I sent mine back. So annoying but regardless. The new phone arrived and worked fine with full bars until the Android 10 update and then signals disappeared completely again! Called support and went through same troubleshooting again and same offer to ship me a replacement phone once I return mine. \n\nHow can I take to someone intelligent at google instead of just shipping my phone back every other week.",
