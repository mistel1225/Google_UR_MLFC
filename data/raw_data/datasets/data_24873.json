    "content": "The first day I had my 3a I needed to download multiple apps from The Play Store that I had installed on my Nexus 5X which had succumbed to the Boot Loop of Death.  Using my Verizon home WiFi, nothing would download and install.  I turned off WiFi and used Mobile Data which, as a Project Fi user, costs me $10 per GB.  Every app downloaded and installed.  The next day I downloaded another app (new to me) using my home WiFi with no problem.\n\nAnybody had any similar problems?  Any thoughts on where the problem was?  Google Play Store or Verizon?",
