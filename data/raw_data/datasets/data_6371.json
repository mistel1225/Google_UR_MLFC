    "content": "I bought my Pixel 4a in October, when it was launched in India. The main reason for buying the device was it's camera. And I was super happy about it at the beginning. \n\nHowever, over the course of time, the quality of images from the front camera has reduced drastically. It's not like the phone is taking bad pictures; it looks more like a focus issue.\n\nSince the camera used to take splendid images earlier, I feel it is a software issue rather than anything to do with the hardware. Just look at the attached image, the one on the right was taken the very next day I bought the phone while the one on left was taken today. \n\nI understood that I'm not the only one facing the issue as couple of my friends who own the phone also told me the same. There are also numerous posts about it in this forum too. And if we google it, you can see a lot of people have the same issue.\n\nWould really love it if Google can do something about the front cam software as I know my device can take better selfies",
