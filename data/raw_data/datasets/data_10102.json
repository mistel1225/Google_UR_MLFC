    "content": "Phone is defective out of the box. Speaker Phone broken. I just want to exchange the phone for a new one. The price has changed and they are sold out. I AM SO FRUSTERATED.\n\nGoogle North American 24/7 customer service line is a dead end. It is turned off due to covid and directs you to use their online support. There is no live chat, no email addresses posted that I can email, service line is dead. How is there no HUMAN on earth working for google to answer a problem. Where did all the humans go during Covid??? Out of all companies, GOOGLE hasn't figured out how to have people work from home and answer the phone, live chats and emails? I'm so lost in their stupid circle of online general support. I'm disgusted by google.",
