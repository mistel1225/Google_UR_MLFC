    "content": "Trying to change back button to right side. Noted few apps that can do it but from reviews there appears risk of causing issue with the phone.\n\nAny way of changing the button directly through Google?\nI've got small hand and usually use my phone right handed which made it quite the stretch to press the back button.\n\nThanks!",
