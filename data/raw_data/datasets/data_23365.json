    "content": "I had been using iPhone Xs Max eSim for awhile, and recently just get a Pixel 3 XL from NYC Google Hardware Store back to Hong Kong .... I checked around the documentation and seems itâ€˜s no way to add eSim easily like iPhone? or I missed steps or something? Can I scan barcode like iPhone does? Seems there is no manuel or details covering it despite of the complex API documentation mentioned about some intergration possibliites.",
