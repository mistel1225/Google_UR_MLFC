    "content": "I updated my Pixel XL to Android 10 and after that the screen saver clock or ambient display, however we say it has stopped working. No matter what I do it doesn't show up unless I do it myself by clicking \"Start Now\" button. Can anyone guide me on how to fix it or is this a problem or anything.",
