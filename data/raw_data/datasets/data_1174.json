    "content": "Brand new pixel 4a, new phone and I cannot get Gmail notifications.  I've tried everything.  Its is the most frustrating thing in the world a simple notification!\n\nI've basically given up read lots of similar issues about the phone and basically want to send it back straight away. The lack of notification light really annoyed me. I thought that was basic!\n\nFeel like I've wasted time getting this phone\n\nCan anyone help?",
