    "content": "I hope there is someone who can explain these observations. I have tried many web searches, but without knowing what to search I have not found an answer.\nOn my new pixel 5 I can swipe up to get to my home screen. Near the bottom middle of the screen there is a white carat. Each time I swipe up the white carat jumps up and down three times. It does not seem to be clickable. What is this jumping carat telling me?\nEvery third time I swipe up the white carat is replaced by a circle, which is blue under default style, This blue circle rises up briefly along with some other icons and a short blue vertical bar appears on the far right of the screen. What is the purpose of this short lived blue circle?",
