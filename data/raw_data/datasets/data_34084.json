    "content": "I have a brand new Pixel 3 and I have very bad cellular reception. After a minute or so speaking in the  phone, it is getting scattered and unfragmented voice. Both for me and the person I talk to. Sometimes the call drops out and I have to recall.\n\nThis problem is consistent for every call I make. \n\nI have tried to move my SIM card to another phone and then it works excellent with the other phone. I have also tried to restart the phone. Nothing helps.",
