    "content": "I am trying to install a Google Play system update. I will start the update, it will download, and then prompt to restart the phone too finish installing the update. The phone will boot back up, and I can go to the setting under security to see that the update the installed, but then my phone will randomly restart itself instantly and when I go back to it, it will say I need to update. Is there anyway to fix this? Already tried factory resetting.",
