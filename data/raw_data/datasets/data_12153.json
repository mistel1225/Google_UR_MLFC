    "content": "I recently updated my Pixel 4 XL to android 11 , but battery life is atrocious . It loses from a fully charged battery a percent every 10 minutes on standby do nothing , I have already check battery stats in settings , no app is abnormally draining battery life , and when I unplug or plug in device sometimes it takes a minute to register it is no longer charging or is charging and phone now gets hot in stand by a bit . So I am downgrading my device from android 11 to 10 later tonight via flashing android 10 image . If I have already backup my device on android 11 via the standard backup tool that backs it up to G drive , can I restore from said back up on android 10?",
