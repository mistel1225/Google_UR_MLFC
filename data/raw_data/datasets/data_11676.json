    "content": "Google pay on Pixel 3 XL now works when screen is locked. It used to require an unlock using fingerprint sensor. How do I go back to this state? I only want Google Pay to operate when phone is unlocked. I assume this has changed because of a software update on the phone. I can't find a way to change this setting.",
