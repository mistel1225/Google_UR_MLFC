    "content": "I've only the phone for a day. Literally nothing wrong with this phone at all performance wise. It's everything I expected and anticipated, except for the garbage sound quality compared to my pixel 3. I wish there was a way to get it upgraded. I would've spent an extra 50 dollars on this phone if that is what it would've taken to have higher quality speakers. Come on Google. You're way more capable than this. Sounds like I'm listening to a phone sitting in an antique metal Foldgers can.",
