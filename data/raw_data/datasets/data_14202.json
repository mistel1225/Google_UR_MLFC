    "title": "Pixel 3 volume automatically increasing and power button stops working too",
    "content": "The volume is automatically increased, the volume drawer keeps showing and power buttons stops working too (given that this happens even if no headphones are connected) whenever I start using any media app (Youtube, Netflix, etc) and would continue to occur even if I close those apps.\n\nI had faced same issue earlier and I restarted the phone in safe mode, the problem didn't reproduce in safe mode. So, I followed a community post thread which suggested it was due to an app. I had installed Photo scanner app by google recently so I uninstalled it. After that the issue got fixed.\n\nBut, now I have again started facing the issue, and this time there is not recent app installed. I tried to open in safe mode but it started showing \"No Command\" screen.\n\nI have started facing these issues after Android 11 update. Please suggest how to fix it.\n\nThanks.",
