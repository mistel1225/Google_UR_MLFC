    "title": "Why does the pixel 3a require you to buy a Chromecast in order to mirror? It's unbelievable",
    "content": "I've downloaded every mirroring app on the play store and every one just opens the cast app which of course won't find anything but a Chromecast. \nI wanted to cast ATT watch TV to my Roku because ATT hasn't built a Roku app yet.\nI was really surprised to find out that the pixel hijacks every mirroring app out there.\n\nI thought about getting the pixel 4 but this kind of control and trying to force me to buy another Google product has really turned me against the idea. \nOh well maybe ATT will provide an app soon. Their watch TV is pretty good for $15.\nUntil then I'll just watch through my 4 year old Asus Zenpad. It has built in PlayTo which works perfectly.\nNever going to buy another phone with stock Android\nVery disappointed",
