    "content": "Hello, in the bottom left hand corner of my pixel 4 a splash of white light randomly appeared and then green lines across the bottom of the screen. Then after a few days the white light got a little larger and some vertical lines appeared up the screen.\n\nI sent it away with Carphone Warehouse for repair under warranty but they have returned it saying that the issue has been caused by physical damage. The only proof of this they provided was a couple of poor quality pictures basically just showing the issue with no explanation whatsoever of what they are saying the physical damage was.\n\nThe phone has never been dropped or been in water. There is no visible damage to the phone whatsoever. And as I said the issue just randomly appeared one day.\n\nJust wondering if anyone else has experienced an issue like this as think I am going to end up going round in circles with this. Any advice how I could proceed this would be welcome.\n\nThanks.",
