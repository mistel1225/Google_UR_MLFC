    "content": "This October, Morocco abruptly changed their Timezone.  https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-45995634 Morocco is no longer GMT 0, it is now GMT 1 with no daylight savings. The Timezone tzdata has updated the zone. Apple has updated iOS with the zone Google Calendar has updated the zone.  But my Pixel 1 on version 9 has not. And the Google Calendar app has not. My appointments have been out by an hour for over a month and itâ€™s driving me crazy. When will this be fixed?",
