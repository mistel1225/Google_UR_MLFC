    "content": "I've restarted my phone. The phone asked for pin. Once I've entered correct PIN, the screen turns black and phone again asks the PIN. To avoid the problem I've started the emergency call, asked to edit emergency information, and in response the phone asked for PIN. I've entered it, the screen blacked out, but now I can unblock the phone with my fingerprints. Unblocked phone informs me that \"System UI stopped\", I go to home screen and phone get's stack on \"Phone is Starting\"",
