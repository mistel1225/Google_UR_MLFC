    "content": "Can forwarded calls be marked as such to be differentiated from direct calls to my phone number, with a notification or some text on the call info.\n\nIt is a feature that is available on many different phone, such as the LG Q Stylo+, but not on the pixel seemingly.\n\nI have already contacted my service provider( BELL ) to confirm it was set up on their side for me to know that it is a forwarded message if my phone has that feature available.\n\nThank you for your help.",
