    "content": "I dropped my pixel 2 xl on the floor the other day and crashed the screen. The problem now is these 2 persistent vertical green and thick white lines down the middle of the screen. I don't know how to fix it and I live in a country where Google has no authorized distributor.\nAny help is greatly appreciated,",
