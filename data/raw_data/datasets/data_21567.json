    "content": "My phones is constantly dropping BT connections, this occurs with multiple devices (2 BT headsets) 2 car connections, as well as a ipad connection.  Once they drop it's incredibly difficult to reconnect, sometimes restarting the phone and device multiple times with no success.  I've tried all TS steps... removing devices and re-adding one at a time.  Starting in \"Safe Mode\" makes no changes either.",
