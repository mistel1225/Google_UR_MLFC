    "content": "Started having mic issues around 2-3 weeks ago on my og pixel. People can't hear me and I can't hear them. Restart fixes the issue for a call or two. Tried safe mode, factory reset, and my PS earbud and mic, but nothing seems to work for more than an hour or so. Ubreakifix isn't doing free motherboard replacement anymore.\n\nJust trying to get this phone to last until the pixel 4 comes out. Anyone have a temporary fix for this that might make it two months?",
