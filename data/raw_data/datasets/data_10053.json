    "content": "I have been running into an issue at least today where when I try to take calls on my Pixel 5 the screen doesn't detect my proximity and doesn't shut off, leading to my ear engaging with notifications and with the quick settings. When I try to use a sensor test app none of the sensors are detectable and tap to wake and turn to shh do not work, do I need a replacement or what steps further can I take at home?",
