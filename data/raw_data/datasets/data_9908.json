    "content": "Recently just upgraded from the Pixel 3 XL to the Pixel 5. Prior to upgrading, I transferred most of the information off my Pixel 3 to my computer. But now, my Pixel 5 keeps connecting and disconnecting. On the device manager on Windows 10, it says \"Unknown USB Device (Device Descriptor Request Failed)\". Every time I try to find a driver or something for it, nothing works. Tried using Windows update to find a driver to no avail. Any suggestions?",
