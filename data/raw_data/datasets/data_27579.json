    "content": "Hey, so before the newest android version I used to be able to cast from daydream to my tv no problems. Chromecast ultra. And also to my Nexus player. Since the new update I can cast but there is not picture. Just lines, artifacts, \nGlitching. Similar to a bad signal on an old crt tv. I've tried restarting phone. Chromecast ultra, Nexus player. But still doing it. Any help would be greatly appreciated.",
