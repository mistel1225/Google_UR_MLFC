    "content": "hello community,\n\ncan you tell me what i should do? i've had my pixel 3 phone for almost 2 years, and somewhere since last summer it started overheating. Now the standard CPU temperature is 40-45 degrees when reading web sites, messengers, google-feed.\nUnfortunately, because of this there is constant throttling and constant glitches in the interface and apps.\n\nandroid 11, all updates installed.\n\nThanks in advanced.",
