    "content": "I purchased my Pixel 3 in the early fall of 2019, running Android 10. I have never been able to receive push notifications from three very important apps: MyChart, Powerschool, and LorexCirrus. I have scoured the internet and found nothing that makes them work. As far as I can tell all other apps work. All my settings are enabled, notifications are enabled. It's like like my phone isn't even receiving the notification... Any one have any ideas?",
