    "content": "Updated to Android 10, and now the alarm clock and timer are stuck on silent. I've tried changing this in the settings, but the phone will not allow me to select alerting. I'm not using a 3rd party app, it is the alarm/timer that comes standard with the Pixel 3XL. Will there be a patch to fix this issue?",
