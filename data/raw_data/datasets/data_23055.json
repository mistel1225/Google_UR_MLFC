    "content": "I have the automatic updates turned off, so I don't know how, but right now the system update page says that installation is paused and will resume when the phone is not being used, and an option to continue now. I don't want any system updates they ruin the phone!!! I had 2 Nexus phones before and updates have ruined them without fail every single time. I need to stop this please help!",
