    "content": "Yesterday, I noticed a contact was missing from my phone. I thought it weird, but I just added him back in. Today, I found another contact was missing from my phone. I checked online at contacts.google.com and they were no longer listed there either. I'm certain that I didn't delete them, and I'm a bit concerned as to why my contacts are randomly disappearing. \n\nI do have multiple accounts on my phone, and I checked the contacts list for each of them just to make sure it wasn't an issue of only certain accounts' contacts being displayed. Pixel 2 XL & Android 10 (one of the accounts if a GSuite in case that changes anything).",
