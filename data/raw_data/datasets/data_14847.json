    "content": "I previously selected a full back up on my device two days ago in preparation for having my device repaired by a local authorized shop. I had to wipe my device before turning in the device (hence the full back up), but now that I have the device back, and after restoring from that back up, all of my data, specifically my 100GB of music is missing, not to mention all of the user data from the apps I had, such as the music apps that had my playlists etc. I can see that the 'restore' returned the applications to my device, but not any of the app settings and individual user accounts related to those apps. Isnt the full back and restore supposed to keep that information??\nHow can i get all that music back. I mean even if I can't get my playlists back (which would suck) how about getting all that music back?\nHelp!",
