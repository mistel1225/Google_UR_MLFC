    "content": "Dear Google,\n\nI am a Google lover and a great fan of all Pixel phones. In my opinion, it's the best phone I have ever seen for general consumers. For gamers, it's obviously R.O.G. Phone III is best until now. So, actually, this is not my problem, my problem is about its design. A phone doesn't becomes perfect without a great-looking design. It's design is as important as it's hardware specifications. If we look over to other brands and companies, you can see they have a much better design for their phones than Pixel phones. I believe that if Google puts a little bit of attention on the Pixel phone's design as it does for its software optimization, Google can get a huge market of mobile phones. The main thing for what I contacted Google is, I want to design the next Pixel phone 6's build part. I am very hyped about that & I have already designed an illustration and a paper sketch for it. Mainly I want to be hired by Google for designing the next Pixel phone, Pixel 6 & Pixel 6 XL. \n\nSo, please reply to me if Google wants to approve my designing request or want to disapprove.\n\nGoogle Fan,\nSamiullah R.",
