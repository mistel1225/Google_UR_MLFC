    "content": "Overall I'm really pleased with the Pixel 5, with the exception of an annoying audio bug.\n\nWhen typing, the sound plays correctly, then lowers itself, then back to normal - almost as if my finger was covering the speaker.\n\nThis also happens with notifications - sometimes they play at full volume correctly, or play somewhat quieter.\n\nAm I the only person having this issue? When setting up the phone, I transferred data via USB from my Pixel 2 XL (not sure if the backup process may have made a difference)\n\nMany thanks",
