    "content": "I want my Pixel 3 to rotate to reverse portrait where the USB charger port is on top. I can get it to rotate in the other 3 directions. But sometimes it would be really nice to have the charge cable out of the way when I'm using the phone for reading in portrait mode for extended periods. Seems like such a trivial thing to support.",
