    "content": "Hi. I'm currently with T-Mobile, but want to purchase a Pixel 5. During the purchase process, the Google site asks to \"Choose your carrier\". It then gives choices of \"Fi Unlocked\" or just \"Unlocked\". If I want to purchase one to try on T-Mobile, but then want to switch to Fi later, which phone should I choose?  Is there a difference between the Fi Unlocked and the Unlocked?",
