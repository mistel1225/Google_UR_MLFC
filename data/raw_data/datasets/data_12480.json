    "content": "Over the last week or so, my phone has been unable to tell whether or not it's charging. This happens most times after I plug it in, so it's very difficult to tell if it is actually charging. I've experienced this before but way less often (like once a year, as opposed to several times a day). Also, my battery has been draining much faster than it usually would. How do I fix this?",
