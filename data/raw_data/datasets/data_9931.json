    "content": "Downloading from Google Play is successful but fails during installing.  I have tried VLC apk versions but they also all fail to install with the error msg \"Can't install VLC for Android\".  Other apps install with no problems.  Only VLC will not install.  I have tried safe mode, clearing cache & data from the Google play app, rebooting, but nothing works.  I rarely need to ask for help but this has me baffled.  Wondering if anyone has vlc working on a pixel 3a XL.  Any useful advice would be appreciated; but pls don't as me to do a reset.  Thanx.  Also, I have applied all the latest updates available.",
