    "title": "Unable to get replacement device for Pixel 3 with broken USB C port",
    "content": "I have a Pixel 3 64gb, and it's just about a year old. Just over 3 months ago, the USB-C port stopped working. I submitted a case to Google and they mailed me a replacement phone, which was great. However, the phone was returned back to Google before I ever received it.\n\nSince then, I have been continually told to be patient about my case and have been unable to get a replacement phone. This happened weeks before any of the COVID stay-at-home orders were instituted and any US work places made any changes, but I am constantly being told that I'm not getting support because of COVID, which doesn't really make sense. I would of course understand the extreme delay if I had submitted my case after the COVID restrictions started. \n\nWhat do I need to do to get my phone replaced? I've waited a few months and try contacting Google at least once a week, following up on my case. I even tried creating a new case, but that was shot down because I already have a case open.\n\nNow, my phone's battery is starting to have problems because I've been exclusively wirelessly charging for the past 3 months...Has anyone else had a similar experience?",
