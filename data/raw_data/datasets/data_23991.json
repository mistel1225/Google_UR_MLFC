    "title": "Android 10 Ambient Display Customization",
    "content": "Since the update, ambient display (i.e. the \"always on\" display that shows even when screen is powered off) is showing what's playing in huge text. What a poor design! Do I have to tell everyone what I'm listening to?\n\nUnless I'm absolutely misled, I saw there is absolutely zero customization option for what's showing on the ambient display. Huge customer trust buster.\n\n1. Feature request: please add ambient display customization.\n\n2. I know how to adjust other settings, including shutting off ambient display. Just add the feature. Thanks.",
