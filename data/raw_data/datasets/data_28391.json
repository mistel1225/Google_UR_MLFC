    "content": "My Pixel 3a has a whole vertical line of about 1cm wide that is unresponsive to touch. I have tried to reset the phone but it did not work. The phone is pretty new (about 1 month) and there is no damage at all in the screen or the phone. What should I do?\n\nI attach a screenshot of a drawing app.\n\nThanks!",
