    "content": "For about six months now or more my 3a's audio randomly freezes or pauses regardless of the 4 different blue tooth devices I connect to. I keep my phone updated monthly and even did a hard reset. It happens when the screen goes to sleep, when it pauses I can wake the screen to play again, but as soon as the screen goes back to sleep it randomly pauses again. This occurs so far with Google podcast app, Pocket Casts, and Amazon Audible app.I experimented with different Bluetooth protocols even in the developers mode to no avail. Particularly when I'm driving is this very frustrating.  Please fix soon üôè",
