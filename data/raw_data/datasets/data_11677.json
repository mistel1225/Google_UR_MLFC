    "title": "Pixel 4 XL Battery Life Horrible After Android 11 Update",
    "content": "My Pixel 4 XL battery drain has been so bad after I updated to Android 11. I'm not even using it, no background apps, nothing, and it's just draining. I have Motion Sense off, Smooth Display off, all the battery-consuming settings off. I tried Safe Mode. It still drains extremely fast in Safe Mode. When I go to usage settings, it says the Android System is using it all up. How do I fix this? Is it Android 11? Will there be an update pushed out? I was hoping it would be fixed in the October 2020 security patch- but it doesn't say anything in the changelog.",
