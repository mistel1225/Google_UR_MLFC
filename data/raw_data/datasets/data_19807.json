    "title": "Why does my notification banner disappear quickly?",
    "content": "I have a Pixel 3 and I am running on the June update of Android 10. I factory reset my phone and once I started receiving notifications, I noticed that the notification banner would appear and almost instantly disappear while my phone is unlocked. I hear the notification tone but my phone vibrates only for a millisecond. (Which is not the right vibration length). And the notification banner disappears right after appearing. I also noticed that if I already had an existing notification in my notifications, then the incoming notification would work perfectly fine. It only happens when I receive the first notification from any app.",
