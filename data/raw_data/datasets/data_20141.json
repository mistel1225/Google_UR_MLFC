    "content": "Morning all.\nI have a Pixel 3 and since last night it is just continuously restarting itself. It then begins to feel hot. \nThe only thing that seems to stop it doing this is if I plug it into the charger. \nWhen it is not plugged in, it just keeps showing the screen as if I'd held down the power button and then restarting. \nI have no case on it now and have tried starting in safe mode but to no avail. \nAny ideas?",
