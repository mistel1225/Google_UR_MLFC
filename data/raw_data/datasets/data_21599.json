    "content": "When I go into feature Flags and try to enable the screen recorder (I hear you can enable it with a feature flag tweak, don't get mad if it went from the menu and I'm just dumb) but all I see is a text saying \"experimental\" \n\nI have the Google pixel 1st gen, although on my galaxy a20e it shows every flag, that was running Android 10\n\nI just did get it today and I upgraded from Oreo to 10, maybe something's broke along the way?",
