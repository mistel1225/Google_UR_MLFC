    "content": "I recently changed my ISP.  I've been unable to link my Google Pixel 2XL  phone to the new Wi-fi address.  \nI have a total of 7 devices. (Smart TV, iPhone, Google Pixel phone,  a Desktop, Two Kindle Fire tablets,  and a Samsung Gear Sport watch.) \nI switched from a satellite ISP to a Fiberoptic. \nThe upload speed has gone from 2.7 mbps to a whopping 202 upload and similarly on the download.\nI've contacted tech support from both the  ISP as well as the router manufacturer.\nSince all of my other devices connected seamlessly it's obviously an issue with the Google device settings. (maybe the MAC address ?) \nI just can't figure it out.  Any suggestions would be great.",
