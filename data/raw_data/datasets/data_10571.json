    "content": "I have a 2013 BMW 3 series.\n\nBluetooth connects to the car, calls incoming and outgoing ring and can be answered with the button on the steering wheel. \n\nThe problem is that when the call connects I can't hear anyone speak and they can't hear me.\n\nI've tested the car on an old phone and it's working fine, so the issue has to be on the phone.\n\nPhone calls and contact sharing are on within settings.\n\nI've tried removing and reconnecting, same issues.\n\nVery grateful for any advice as I'm in the car a lot for work and really need this to function properly!",
