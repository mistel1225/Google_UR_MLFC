    "content": "This feature use to work flawlessly but for the last few weeks (before and after the OS10 Upgrade) every time I try to trim a down a video that was taken with the phone's own camera I receive an error. When I use a third party file manager app I can see that a temporary file is being created but something goes wrong in the process and after I get the error \"file cannot be saved\" the temporary file is corrupted and cannot be used.",
