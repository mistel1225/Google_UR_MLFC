    "content": "The most recent OS update forced through an update to my messages application. One that I had disabled in the app store to keep a key feature that was recently removed more specifically the minimize notifications feature for certain contacts. \n\nThe forced update removed this feature making it more or less unusable for privacy reasons since I use this phone for public reasons but need to keep certain messages from showing up. \n\nIt's sad that Google feels the need to remove features.",
