    "content": "I put my Pixel 3 on a Pixel Stand at night, and I use this as an alarm to wake me up in the morning. Generally I set two alarms, about 15 minutes apart, because sometimes I press snooze or sometimes I just turn off the first one. I've set both of the alarms with sounds that are distinctly alarms, but not jarring. Recently, the first alarm is fine but when the second alarm (or snoozed alarm) goes off, the sound is a super annoying, blaring sound that is not the sound I chose. It wakes me up, but it also ruins my morning because I wake up feeling pissed off! I tried resetting the sounds, reordering the alarms, etc. It still does it. I tested the alarms when the phone wasn't docked on the Stand, and the alarms sounded with the sounds I chose, so now I think it's something the Stand is doing, but I don't see any settings that would cause it to do this. (I did, however, see 3 versions of the Stand settings, some of which were contradictory, so I deleted 2 of them). \n\nI'm using the Google Clock app, and I thought about uninstalling it and trying something else, but a) I'm not convinced that will help and b) most of the other alarm apps out there seem to be designed to be MORE annoying.\n\nAny suggestions? I love the Stand as a wireless charging device, but if I can't figure out a way to fix this, I'm going to have to stop using it overnight.",
