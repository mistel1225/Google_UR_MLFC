    "content": "When you get text message, using the Google Messages app, and reply from the notification shade, it STILL shows a blank profile image after you send you message. This happened in Android 9 and was something many people online and myself have reported. Somehow Android 10 doesn't deal with it. Does anyone know who to change this? I have tried everything. It's bugged me then and now.",
