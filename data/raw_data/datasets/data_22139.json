    "content": "This Google Pixel was set up with my son as the Owner, and me with a User account. He's passed the phone on to me now, and I want to become the Admin / Owner and delete him as a User.  I just updated to Android 10 and can't figure out how to do this. If I do a factory reset when I\"m signed in as him, will it also delete all the data on the phone under both of our profiles, right? Is there a way to avoid this?",
