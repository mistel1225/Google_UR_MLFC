    "content": " I've been trying to pre order the Google Pixel 5 for a couple weeks now. It's been sitting in my cart. When I click on my cart, it loads a blank white page. This happens on Chrome mobile and desktop. Clearing cache data/cookies doesn't do anything. Singing out of and back in to my google account does nothing. I thought you would have figured it out by now, you know, being Google and all. But the problem persists.",
