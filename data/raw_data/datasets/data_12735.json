    "content": "I recently switched from a Pixel to iPhone. Some of my contacts who use android send messages that don’t come to my new iPhone number. Some of them are somehow being sent to my old Pixel even though it has no SIM card. I suspect this has to do with some glitch in how RCS messaging works, but I don’t know how to correct it.",
