    "content": "Does anyone in the community know when the Security update for November 2020 for android 11 is launching for Pixel 5 5G? I have had the phone a few weeks and there is a November update but not sure when it arrives. My mom's Pixel 3 got it but I haven't yet and I'm wondering if anyone else with Pixel 5 has gotten it through carriers.",
