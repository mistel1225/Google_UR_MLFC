    "content": "I went to get a cracked screen fixed at ubreakifix since it's the approved Google location, but the phone came out faulty. The moment I had phone calls with people, they kept telling me they heard themselves talk. I took it back to ubreakifix and they told me it was a Google support issue. I did software updates (Android 10) and restarted in safe mode. I made calls to test it out and it is still the same problem. The ONLY time the people don't hear themselves on the other line (or hear themselves less) is when I make the phone call over a Bluetooth headset",
