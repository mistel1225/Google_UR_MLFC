    "content": "I've searched here and on reddit for solutions to the Rear Facing (Selfie) Camera facial distortion issue everyone is facing but no one from Google seems to be offering a solution??  Please let me know if this is an issue that can be fixed if I send in my phone to google to fix or if I need to get rid of this phone.  It's actually really saddening because it makes me extremely self conscious when I try and take a photo of myself. :(",
