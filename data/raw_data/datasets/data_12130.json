    "content": "After the most recent Android 11 update, my 'double tap power button to launch camera' shortcut errors to a single tap launching the camera - usually when I'm trying to turn the screen off. Is anyone else having this issue and if so have they figured out how to fix it without completely disabling the shortcut altogether?",
