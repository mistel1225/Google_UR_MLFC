    "content": "I'm in a student dorm where we have a regular wifi but with a certain certificate which we need to access the network. But the problem lies in the phone for some reason, as of recently I can't connect to the WiFi network anymore because the phone requires now a DOMAIN for some reason, how can I remove this domain or how can I get the name of it? \nI'm really a big fan of this phone but because of this I'm thinking to switching over to an iPhone..",
