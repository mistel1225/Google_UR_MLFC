    "content": "My Active Edge is on however when I go to Settings > System > Gestures >Active Edge, the only features I can see are \"Squeeze sensitivity\" and \"Squeeze for silence\" .  These two features work as expected.\n\n However the feature \"Squeeze for your assistant\" has now completely disappeared! Where as it was there before. I had it turned on and was using this feature for over two weeks. Now it is gone.\n\nDoes anyone know How I can get back the \"\"Squeeze for your assistant\"\" feature?",
