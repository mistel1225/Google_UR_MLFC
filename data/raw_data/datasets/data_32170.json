    "title": "My second email does not notify me until after 10:00pm local time it seems",
    "content": "So I have 2 emails on my gmail app, my main one is personal and I get notifications usually instantly with that one. My second email is work, but it only notifies me at a certain time, usually around 10pm PST. This is problematic because for 5 hours (from when I leave the office to when my gmail finally remembers to notify me) I don't get any notifications for work, and since I am working in the world of consulting engineers, I have to be able to respond if necessary. Not getting those notifications until I am usually in bed and on the verge of sleep is not helping the situation. I have Sync and background data turned on as well.",
