    "content": "Hi\n\nRecently bought a pixel 5. Seems very good so far, however, I have noticed that many apps (mostly games but others as well) in landscape mode do not utilise the full screen. There's a black edge on the side where the camera hole is and some apps also cut off some of the bottom. It makes it look very weird. Even Google apps do this!\n\nIs this an android bug? A pixel bug? A developer issue? I don't know!\n\nHopefully someone here knows. \n\nThanks.",
