    "content": "Both my wife and I have a Google Pixel XL (first gen) and we updated to Android 10. Any screenshots, downloaded photos, etc. that we placed on the phone since the update, do not show up to select from within the facebook messenger app.\nI'm not sure if this is app related or OS related, so I am asking this in both places.\nIf we choose the \"take a picture\" option for our message, we can select \"browse photos\" and choose the directory we want, like screenshots or downloads or camera but when you select screenshots or downloads, it only shows the images we had on our phone before the update, no new ones.\nIn order to share the images with friends or family, we have to navigate to the image on our phone and share it from there, not through the messenger app which makes it super inconvenient than the normal method.\nWe've checked all of our facebook messenger permissions to ensure they are enabled, have cleared cache and storage and reinstalled the app. Nothing we've tried fixes it.",
