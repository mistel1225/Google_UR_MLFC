    "content": "I recently got a Pixel 3 and was trying out different wallpapers when I noticed that the live wallpapers which is based on location shows the wrong location for me.\n\nI am based in Europe and the Marvelous Marble Wallpaper is showing US instead of Europe. All other wallpapers that are based on day/night schedule is also wrong since the location seems to be based in the US.\n\nI still have my Pixel 2 and that shows the Marvelous Marble correctly over Europe.\n\nThe phones are setup more or less the same. I have checked a lot of settings to make sure they are the same.\nMaybe the location for Live Wallpapers are hidden somewhere. Does anyone know?\n\nThanks!",
