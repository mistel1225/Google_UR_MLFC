    "content": "My screen is flickering\n\nI have smooth display active as I love the 90hz option and I heard it could be that? Are their any other fixes or causes to the screen flickering? It's so weird it's not going fully dark but think of it as the brightness does micro adjustments constantly. It's really annoying!",
