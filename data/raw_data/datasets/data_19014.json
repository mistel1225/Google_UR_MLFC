    "content": "Before I begin, let me say that I have, in the past, experienced a dirty charging port. This is not one of those times.\n\nI will frequently experience an issue, where my phone is plugged in, and the battery indicator makes it appear that the phone is charging, but it isn't.  In fact it will even say \"charging\" on the lock screen, but the percent battery will go down instead of up. \n\nUnder normal circumstances, when I first plug in my phone, the lock screen will only say charging. Then after a few minutes there will also be an estimate of the time until full charge. On those occasion when it really isn't charging, the time estimate will never appear. If I go back to my phone's lock screen, a few minutes later and see that the estimate hasn't appeared, I can unplug it and plug it back in, and sometimes that corrects the problem, but I still have to wait and see if the estimate appears to be sure. The worst times are at bedtime, and I wake up to find my phone hasn't been charging all night.\n\nWhy would the phone indicate it is charging when it isn't.",
