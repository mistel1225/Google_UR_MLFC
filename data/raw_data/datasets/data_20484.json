    "content": "I have a Pixel 2 and it has suddenly started having battery issues the other day and won't turn on now.  It started off by displaying as charging when not plugged in, then wouldn't charge when it was plugged in.  It is now completely dead, I left it charging overnight and it would go back and forth showing a red blinking light and a steady one when I tried to power it on.  I live in Japan and need an authorized repair place, please help.  International shipping from Japan is currently suspended.\nMy friend said there was a recent google update and this happened right after, maybe this had something to do with that?",
