    "title": "Just want to scream at my pixel - battery drain, reboot, no mic - the list goes on",
    "content": "I'm at my wits end with my Pixel phone.  It's a different problem every day.  This morning for example, my phone was charged to 100% in the car.  In the 3 minutes it took me to walk into my office, the battery dropped to 96%. I tried to make a call but the microphone wasn't working so I rebooted and then the battery showed at 1%, so now it's charging.  If I have the battery at less than 70% then I can't take photos without it freezing and turning off.  I can't receive calls at less than 50% battery as the mic stops working.  I don't have any unusual apps and all the settings claim the phone is working fine.  Do I just give up and buy a different phone??",
