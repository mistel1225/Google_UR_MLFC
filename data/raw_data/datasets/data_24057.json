    "content": "Both my wife and I just got a pair of Pixel 3a's through Google Fi.  We're enjoying the phones as they're a huge step up from the Moto X 4 in terms of speed and taking pictures.\n\nHowever, we're having issues with some bluetooth notifications.  Specifically text messages.  Previously we had no issue getting texts to our fitbits (both charge 3's) or our cars (one car has regular Sync the other Sync 3 both have updated firmware).  This was with the older phones.  \n\nAll other bluetooth functionality works.  I can make calls/listen to music in the car no problem.  The fitbit notifies me of calls and when I get a message from other apps like Facebook Messenger and gmail (I can read and take actions like replying.)  At first I thought it was the \"Chat Features\" but this was never an issue for the Moto x4 and even when I get regular SMS it's no different.\n\nI've tried re-pairing devices and changing app settings but nothings seems to help.  Anyone else run into this?",
