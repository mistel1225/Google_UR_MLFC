    "content": "Does anyone know if the Pixel 4a 5G works with Spectrum Mobile? I'm thinking about switching and upgrading from my current phone to the Pixel 4a 5G and purchasing it directly from Google unlocked. Their website has an IMEI compatibility checker but since I don't have the phone I can't use it and their support hasn't been too helpful. I know that the Pixel 5 works as it can be purchased from Spectrum.",
