    "content": "Every time I use my front-facing camera, whether for a selfie or for a video chat, thin, multi-colored lines run up and down the screen.  It is almost like shimmering or the vertical lines on the old TVs when they went off the air.  It's been this way off and on since I purchased my phone last year.  Now it is constant.  Help please!",
