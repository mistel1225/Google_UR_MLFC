    "content": "In the last year, four times after Google Pixel makes an update and I get into my car I notice the messages button is greyed out. The only fix for this is to do a factory reset on my Google Pixel and then the messages button no longer is gray. I took this to my car dealership and they said definitely it's your phone not the Bluetooth in your car. My messages come through my Bluetooth screen from Sirius XM.   What type of updates does Google Pixel make that would constantly cause my messages button to turn gray so I no longer can see or hear my messages without doing a complete factory reset on my Google Pixel 4A.",
