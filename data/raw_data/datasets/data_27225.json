    "title": "How do I get rid of new \"call emergency services\" overlay on Pixel 2 XL running 10?",
    "content": "I updated my Pixel 2 XL to Android 10 the other day, and somewhere along the way, I must have approved an addition to one of my lock screens. I now have 2 red bands with links to \"call emergency services\" and \"send SMS alert\". I've already accidentally hit the SMS button and got a warning countdown that it was going to call 911 unless I cancelled because I don't have emergency contacts set up. I don't need this function because I use the Medical ID app. Problem is, I have no idea what I activated, and no idea what to search for to turn it off. Any help would be appreciated!",
