    "content": "In  pictures I see in reviews of  the 4a5G  the screen goes right to the very edge with the battery information ,WiFi info eccetera  small and often in white writing shown over the top of the image. Mine doesn't do this,  it has a centimetre high black bar with all of the Wi-Fi battery percentage excetera information displayed. Please see attached pics showing my screen and what other pixels seem to look like..\n\n\nIs there a setting I'm missing..",
