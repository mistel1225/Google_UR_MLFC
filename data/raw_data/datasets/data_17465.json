    "content": "Hi Everyone,\n\nI have the typical android/iphone communication error however it is just with one or two contacts. Both of these contacts (iPhone) can text me but their calls go straight to voicemail and cannot receive any messages from me (Pixel 3 XL) using stock messenger, FB Messenger does work. Verizon has been useless in fact they decided to refer me here after I started this post. Any ideas on how I can resolve this issue?",
