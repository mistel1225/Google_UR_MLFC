    "content": "I thought I caused the feature to disappear by reformatting my phone but upon consulting with support and googling, I'm thankfully not alone. https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/d2avu7/android_10_google_lens_on_multitask_menu/\n\nAndroid 10 was the culprit which leads me to assume the feature will simply return with enough time. Being able to seamlessly grab images was so utterly useful in tracking down artists from social media & memes. Now, we are left with the ability to grab text & share but a much slower process in searching for similar images. Image searching remains a feature that is simple on a desktop but requires extra legwork over a phone. And lens really put the first step in that work. Till you return from a fruitful voyage! ",
