    "title": "Android Messages on my phone says \"Can't play audio. Try again.\" Anyone seen this??",
    "content": "As it says above, the Messages app on my phone won't play video text messages because of the above error message. I recently switched phones to the Pixel 2 XL, and transferred everything using a transfer cable and my gmail account. It plays the old video text messages transferred over from my previous phone without a problem, but any new video texts will come in as a picture, and below that, a play button window as though it were an audio message....as if the video message has been separated into a picture and audio. But, if the play button is pushed,  the error message above is displayed. The phone plays all other videos without issue; it's just the text video messages received in Messenger that are in error and won't play. Any suggestions??",
