    "content": "I have call screening on my Pixel 3a XL until I reboot my phone.  Then, to get the feature back I have to go to Apps & Notifications (under Settings), select the Phone app, then Force Stop, then clear cache.  After that process, call screening is again available under Phone, Settings.\n\nWhy does rebooting my phone affect that feature??",
