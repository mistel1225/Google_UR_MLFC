    "title": "Pixel 3 xl not turning on after several weeks of various issues",
    "content": "Problems started a few weeks ago, when I noticed the battery started draining much faster than usual (100 -> 0 in about 3 hours of non-intensive use). I had not installed anything new in the weeks before, so I didn't  think it could be sone rogue app eating the battery. I figured I'd wait it out a bit to see if things change, and after a week or so it started saying my pin was incorrect (it wasn't), while fingerprint was working ok. Today the phone decided to require the pin for extra authentication, so I was kind of stuck, and decided to give factory reset a try. I followed the instructions, but the phone just shuts down instead of entering recovery mode. If it helps, the phone state says \"error\" and the reason is \"combo key\". \nAnd finally, now it won't power normally at all.\nI'd appreciate any help with this, thanks!",
