    "content": "If I run YouTube and open up snap at the same time the phone randomly stops running freezes for about 3 seconds and shuts down.\n\nI'm thinking software issues? A bug I'm on pie and I have the update for Android q but there's issues in that beta so I'm waiting for the bus to be fixed. So my issue is probably a software problem.
