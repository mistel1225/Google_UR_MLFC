    "content": "I have been trying to work with Google to fix my phone for months and their customer support has been absolutely terrible. They have terrible attitudes, refuse to help, promise callbacks and emails but never follow through, shove me onto hour long holds for no reason, state that the only way to raise a complaint in google is to talk to a tech support advisor->floor supervisor->manager who will contact me (but still hasn't for 2 months).\n\nDo any of you have an idea of who I can talk to next about this terrible experience?",
