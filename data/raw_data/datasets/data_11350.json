    "content": "Twice since I've owned this phone it has restarted on it's own from a 85% or above charge. And once it's on the loading screen with the G and moving bar underneath, it takes a LONG time to finally boot back into the OS. I haven't timed it, but at least 20 minutes or more. And I'm probably being generous there. I am very gentle with the phone, shouldn't be any hardware damage. Also do not see swelling on the back of the case, cause I would know battery at that point. I do believe I'm on Android 11.",
