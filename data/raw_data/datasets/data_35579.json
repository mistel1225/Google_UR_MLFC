    "content": "I have tried to factory reset my device to completely wipe it clean in hopes that it would solve the problem, but before I can completer the reset, my phone restarts again. I also left it overnight in hopes that letting the battery drain would \"fix\" it, but the moment I plugged the phone in, it began restarting again.",
