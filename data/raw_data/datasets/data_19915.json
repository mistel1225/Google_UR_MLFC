    "content": "Pretty much everything.  Tried all menu items, start, recovery, all the others.  Status went from \"error\" to \"locked.\"  Currently poor little android guy is on its back with a red triangle with ! point in in and \"not command\" underneath.  Have read many articles, nothing worked.  Currently am waiting for power to run out, recharge, and try then.  Thanks for help.",
