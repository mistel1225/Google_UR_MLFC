    "title": "Pixel 5 - Tap and lift to check and auto-rotate doesn't work",
    "content": "For tap and lift to check phone I have turned off the features and turned them back on. Still the screen when locked and off does not react to being tapped or lifted. I have also turned off and on the auto rotate and it does not work. I have factory reset the phone multiple times to include no restore and kept it a new phone and this does not fix the auto rotate feature or the tap and lift to check phone features.\n\nThis is my second phone with these issues and after replacing the phone it worked for a little less than a week and then went bad. The first phone had even more problems. Have had the phone for almost a month and only a few days the phone has worked right. Anyone else have these issues or know how to fix? Support does not know how to fix, and I think they want to see what the interest is to prioritize updates?",
