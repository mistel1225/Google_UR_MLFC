    "content": "Everytime I try to use the reverse/selfie mode on my camera it tells me it's not working or not responding. I've cleared the cache on all of my apps, didn't help. I have also tried restarting in safe mode and my phone still says the same thing. My phone and apps are up to date on all updates. Has anyone else had this problem or know how to fix it?",
