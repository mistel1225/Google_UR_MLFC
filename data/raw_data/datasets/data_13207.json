    "content": "I have enabled Bubble notifications in individual apps as well as in General settings. I even tried clearing the cache for Whatsapp and Messages but Bubble notifications are still not working on my Pixel 3a XL device. I'm more interested in whatsapp message bubbles than Google Messages. Is there anything else I can try to fix this issue? Thanks!",
