    "content": "When I click photos with the camera app it does not show the photo in the preview circle and does not get saved in files or even the photos app. Moreover, when I switch to video mode a popup appears saying 'cannot record video, leave the mode and try again'. I am able to click photos and save them from snapchat,  etc. I have just recently got this pixel 4a and it's frustrating to not be able to use the awesome camera.",
