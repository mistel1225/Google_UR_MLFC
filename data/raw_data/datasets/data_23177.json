    "title": "Pixel XL (1st gen) display failure",
    "content": "The display for my 1st gen Pixel XL has failed. I've been given approval to swap it out under warranty but I need to get photos & video from it first (I was traveling in airplane mode when the failure occurred). Can anyone help me figure out how to get this data?\nI think syncing the phone would be faster. The sensors still work-- it gives the vibrate response when I touch the screen-- but the LED is completely dark. If I can get through the startup with PIN and get it out of airplane mode, it would sync. But I can't see the buttons to get through this. Does this gen phone support USB cable connection to an external display?\nIf there's no way to get it to sync, is there a way to retrieve the photo/video data that is on the phone?",
