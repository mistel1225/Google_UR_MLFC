    "content": "Hi\n\nI have a problem with my Pixel 3. My back camera will not focus. Can only take photos really close to my phone.... Have done a factory reset and tried the camera before I installed any new apps. But that did not work.\n\nAny suggestions of how to fix this, if it is fixable at all.",
