    "content": "Tried restarting, resetting, no change. Far end can't hear me for 5-10 seconds when call is established sometimes.  Also far end sometimes loses my audio after 1-1/2 - 2 minutes.  Same thing is happening with two Pixel 3s in my family. Third Pixel 3 (XL) is not exhibiting the behavior.  Seeing widespread complaints with similar issues online across carriers.  Cannot find any comment/info from Google on the issue. Is this a possibly a hardware issue with the two phones?",
