    "content": "I'll make a call, about half the time the phone I'm calling will ring, the other times my phone will hang up before a connection is made. But the phone will 100% of the time hang up within 2-5 seconds of being connected.\n\nI've tried safe boot, SIM card reinsertion, turning off Enhanced 4G LTE mode, etc.",
