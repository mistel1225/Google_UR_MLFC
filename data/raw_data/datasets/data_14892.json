    "title": "Pixel 4 XL not ringing since Android 11 update",
    "content": "Since the update (first day), my phone will not ring for incoming calls.  The vibrate/notification still works, but no ring.  Do Not Disturb is off, and all settings are the same as before the update when it worked.  The ring is a Pixel ring.  No new applications have been installed. \n\nThe phone does ring if booted in Safe Mode.  Turning bluetooth and wifi off does not make a difference.\n\nPlease don't suggest doing a factory reset as I have no intention of going that route.\n\nedit:  FYI I did have Zedge installed to use their sounds.  Thinking that was the issue, I had uninstalled it to use the default Pixel sounds.  This uninstall was before the I posted (and tried safe mode reboot) so that's definitely not the issue.",
