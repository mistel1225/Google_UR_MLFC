    "content": "Hi there, I have a broken pixel 2 phone. It bricked after a firmware update and attempts to fix it myself failed.  Other then the software no longer working properly, all of the HW should still work fine on the phone.\n\nI have looked into getting it fixed as it's been sitting around for months as a paperweight. The only support centers here close to my city in London, ON Canada are an hour away. there is only one licensed repair center in Canada which is Ufixit   they have specific software programs for Pixel that should be able to repair it. When I tried to fix myself I even tried to load the firmware back on over USB   using the steps that are described in other articles   nothing worked as I'd get to a point in the flashing process where it would not continue .\n\nUfixit is no longer doing mail order repair they told me when I called. I have talked to mobile clinic also but they tell me to talk to U fix it  . Can I please figure out where I can mail my phone in and have it repaired\nI can understand why they are not doing this but this leaves me in a spot where I cannot get support or repair for my phone. Please help?\n\nI do not wish to try troubleshooting anymore as I spent many long hours at it months back. I would like to send it in somewhere and have them potentially put firmware back onto the device. I am sure Google has a way of doing this when the phone appears non recoverable after a firmware update. \n\n\nRegards,\nMark",
