    "title": "Why pixel 4a is out of stock all the time?",
    "content": "Will Pixel 4a be available in India now? or I will have to buy One plus?\nIt is very sad to see how the newly launched product just vanished from the only retailer! And if we really believe the news then it sold out in just 30 minutes which is difficult to believe!\nI have pixel 2 right now, whose display is damaged and I am really in need of a new phone. If it is not available in a day or two, I will in any case have to shift to one plus! I don't understand how Google can afford to lose customers for new product when competition in mobile market is so high!\n\nNow that it is back in stock, it is undeliverable at all the Pin Code that I tried including the major cities. \n\nEither they need to provide us with the Pin Codes where it actually is available.",
