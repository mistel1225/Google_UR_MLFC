    "content": "Now that the Pixel 2 is no longer receiving updates, I'm about to purchase a Pixel 5 and would like to minimize the inconvenience of migrating from the Pixel 2 to the Pixel 5. To be clear, I have read the canned Google instructions on transferring data from and Android Phone to a Pixel, but have more specific questions.\n\nThere has been some chatter in the blogs about glitches occurring when migrating using a wired connection between old phone and a Pixel 5. Is it safer to migrate using the Pixel Cloud backup (even if slower), and if so, how is this done? Is it safer still to start fresh on the new phone and manually reinstall Account and Apps? (If it matters: the Accounts, Apps, and the organization of the Apps in groups is all I want to transfer; there are no other data on my phone as everything is in the cloud). \nAssuming that I will use the wire, am I correct that the Quick Switch Adapter talked about in the canned Google procedures is nothing more than a USB-A to USB-C adapter and so I can use instead a USB-C to USB-C cable?\n\nThanks in advance.",
