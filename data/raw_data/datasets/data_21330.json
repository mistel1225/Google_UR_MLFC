    "content": "Hi everyone, my Pixel 2XL screen just stopped working. Tried to restart several times, same issue. The squeeze function and the fingerprint sensor are fine, but I can't get into my phone at all because I've restarted and the screen has completely stopped responding. Is there another way I can get it to work before I resort to restore factory settings?",
