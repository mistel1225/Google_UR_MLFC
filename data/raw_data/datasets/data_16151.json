    "content": "Hi there, I'm using Pixel 2XL for years, it's just a little laggy and working all fine. During these years, NFC use cases are increasing fastly in China, and my little cute device doesn't support so many NFC scenes, it just like a pain in my ass.\nIn China, NFC can be used when taking metros, taking buses, opening doors, paying money, and unlock your car, etc.\nNFC is already becoming a basic concept like dialing and messaging.\n\nSo I'm wondering if pixel 4a or newer devices support such scenes like above, cuz it only shows \"NFC\" on the Tech Specs page.\n\nHope pixel would be better, don't let the one who loves you down.",
