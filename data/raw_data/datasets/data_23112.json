    "content": "Hi,\n\nI upgrade to Android 10 last week and since then I cannot send or receive MMS any longer. I need to reset and try to change the APN settings everytime, sometimes it works, sometimes not. \n\nThe 4G connection seems to be lost as well, cause it states \"LTE\" instead - could this be related somehow? \n\nhave anyone else faced the same issue? I have a Google Pixel 2 XL and Tele2 as carrier.",
