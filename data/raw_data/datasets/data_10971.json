    "content": "I set Google messages to my default messaging app on my old S10, but even there the app can't seem to import historic outbound messages, only the inbound get transferred. That's like...only half the messages. And apparently this has been an issue for years? These are a couple of pretty mainstream devices/ messaging apps, what's the hold up? Yes, I looked at older forums, but wouldn't you know it, not a single answer has been offered to solve this and they've been locked.",
