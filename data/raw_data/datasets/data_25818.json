    "content": "I've tried clearing cache and storage for the clock app. I've also disabled and enabled. The only time it went away was when I rebooted into safe mode. The clock icon displays constantly in my system tray on the right, and from the pulldown menu it shows an alarm set for 1 minute away, and when it is that time it never sounds, about 30 seconds later it changes the alarm to the next minute away. In the clock app there are no alarms set.",
