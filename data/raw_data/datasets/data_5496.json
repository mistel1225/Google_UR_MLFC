    "content": "I’m merely trying to make a all. But, phone continues downloading something unknown to me. Won’t respond to shutting it down. When I plug in to charge I always get a musical tone. Not now. It responds to nothing. But I can see the downloading gray bar moving. That’s it. It may as well be dead.",
