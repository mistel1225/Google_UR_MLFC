    "content": "My pixel 4xl will not update to android 11. My wife's pixel 3xl updated right away to it. I've tried forcing it to update. I've factory reset my phone. I don't know what else I could do. Just curious if anyone else is having this issue. Is the update being held back because of bugs?",
