    "title": "Pixel 3A stops recognizing the sim card after several minutes of usage in cold weather",
    "content": "I've just bought a new pixel 3a phone and I have discovered the following problem: when my device is cold and I use it outside (I mean the temperature outside is about zero) it stops detecting the sim card after a few minutes. Besides, it isn't an issue of the sim card because I faced the same issue with other ones. \nSo, it would be great if someone explains me why it happens",
