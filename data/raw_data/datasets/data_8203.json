    "content": "I think after the last update my pixel does not charge correctly.\n\nProblem is that if I plug in a cable then it starts charging and then stops, starts again, and stops and this cycle is repeating each second. I have to sometimes wait and it's fixed by itself but it's really annoying me.\n\nI tried different chargers, different outlets and nothing helped. \n\nDon't you have a similar problem?",
