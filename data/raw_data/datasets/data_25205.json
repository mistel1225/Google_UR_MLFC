    "content": "I have sent my phone back to the seller because of a white line appeared on the edge of the screen, the seller said, within hours of receiving it, we are unable to fix or refund as the phone has been dropped, the phone has not been dropped and was returned to the seller in exactly the same condition as I received it, I would like to know if it is a known problem, I feel as though I'm been taken for a ride, thank you, John Jones.",
