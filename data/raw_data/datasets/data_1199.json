    "content": "My Pixel 3 is under warranty and I have gone through all of the trouble shooting steps.  The technician determined my phone is eligible for replacement under warranty, but says it will only be covered under a \"standard exchange\".  This process takes 5-10 days for Google to receive the phone and evaluate it, and how ever long for them to send a replacement.  This is a ridiculous policy and process, which seems out of step with the industry standard of sending the replacement phone first.\n\nHas anyone had success in elevating this issue to receive an exception to the \"standard exchange\"?  I love the Pixel phones and have had three of them, but this one may be my last if this is not resolved satisfactorily.",
