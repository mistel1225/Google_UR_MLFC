    "content": "Brand new Pixel 5 and with my Pixel 2 sat next to it, the 2 receives and notifies when new mail arrives to my gmail account but the 5 does nothing. Even with the screen on, the 5 doesn't receive any new mail. I've enabled notifications for every new message, tried disabling adaptive battery, disabled wifi to just use 4G. Nothing. If I manually refresh the gmail app by pulling down from the top, the new mail appears.",
