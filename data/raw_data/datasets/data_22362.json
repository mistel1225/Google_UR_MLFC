    "title": "Pixel stand cannot be found in pair new device on 3xl",
    "content": "I've been using the pixel stand for a year when one day I noticed that my 3xl was no longer acting the way it did while on the stand. It still charges but I no longer have the Google photos slideshow during the day and it no longer dims the time at night. Also the rise to wake lighted alarm clock stopped working. I tried disconnecting the stand and forgetting the device but when I went to go add it back, the stand no longer appears. I've tried multiple times now and still nothing.",
