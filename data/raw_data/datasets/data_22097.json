    "title": "Very disappointing front facing camera Pixel 3a XL",
    "content": "Was looking forward to using this phone when it arrived it's all round neat apart from the selfie camera.\n\nThe shots look blurry and have dark contrast they look awful with lots of noise, I have tried everything but it remains poor quality even in outdoor shots. I have read many people complain about the front facing camera having same issues as me. I simply can't believe the quality my old LG G3 only had a 3 mega pix selfie camera that at least have clear shots so why is this performing like it is?\n\nIt's the worst front facing camera I've ever used.\n\nThe phone is brand new so I shouldn't be looking for fixes, I've reset phone got gcam updates etc but problem persists so I've no choice now but to return it ASAP and choose replacement.\n\nI'm extremely dissatisfied with the pixel 3a front facing camera how can they ship it with a camera like this? I don't think il be choosing another pixel phone now unless someone can show if I'm doing anything wrong or it was a faulty unit.",
