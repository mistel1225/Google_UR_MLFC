    "content": "Earlier in the spring of 2020, we were delighted to learn that the Pixel 4a and Pixel 5 would not be manufactured in China, especially according to reports like the one that follows: https://9to5google.com/2020/02/27/report-pixel-4a-5-production-vietnam/\n\nAfter seeing the back of a review unit on YouTube (on October 9), it visibly indicated that the device was \"Made in China\". Will future batches of the Pixel 5 be manufactured in Vietnam? If so, when can we expect that to happen, so customers who are waiting can order those devices?",
