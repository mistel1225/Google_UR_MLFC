    "title": "Touch tones occasionally fail to sound when attempting to dial a phone number",
    "content": "I've had my new Pixel 4a(5G) for about three months, and occasionally when I attempt to dial a phone number from it, I hear no touch tones. The call does not go through and I have to restart the phone to get the touch tones working again. I can then dial phone numbers as per normal, until the next time the problem occurs. This has happened three or four times since I've had the phone. Each time it happens I check the volume control and verify that the sound levels are loud enough so that I should be able to hear the touch tones. This problem occurs whether I have my headset plugged in or am attempting the call without a headset. Please advise. Thanks.",
