    "content": "I shipped by Pixel 2 XL with display issue for warranty replacement on 5/14.  I received no emails, no calls, or a replacement after 2 weeks, so I called Google customer support. They told me it was \"no replacement phone available at this time\" issue and asked me to wait few more days. Odd since this was a Pixel 2 XL, a very common phone...  Still I waited few more day till the date they gave me. No word. So I called again, waited a long time for them to figure out the issue.  I was told by the customer representative that the warehouse said they received my package but it was \"empty\". WHAT?!? How can this be? Also if this was indeed the case, WHY ON EARTH DID NO ONE FROM GOOGLE CONTACT ME WHEN THEY DISCOVERED THAT THE BOX WAS EMPTY??? They could of investigate the issue right away instead of waiting for more than two weeks to \"begin\" an investigation. Very suspicious... It's easier to believe they simply misplace my phone or someone dropped the ball on this and didn't want the blame or be responsible. It's been a month. The deadline for update was 6/12, which was yesterday. NO SURPRISE. STILL NO WORD FROM ANYONE. Feeling cast aside and very neglected. Wow, so shocked by poor customer support system. I don't blame the customer support as they have be very friendly and supportive. I blame the system or the customer support structure they have. Now what do I do? I am left without a replacement phone for a month...",
