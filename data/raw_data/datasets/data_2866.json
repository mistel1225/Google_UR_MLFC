    "title": "Pixel 5 / Android 11 - Contact names not showing in call list, only numbers",
    "content": "Hey Guys,\n\ni am testing the Pixel 5 for my company to use it as a work device.\n\nWhen i get a call, the most time i do not see the name of the caller, but i have the contact synced on my phone. Also in the caller list, there is only the number of the caller. If i tap on the number to call it, then suddenly the name of the contact appears. \nI have tried to clear the the app storage (cache etc.)\nWe are using Android for Work since some years  with different devices, and no other device has this issue, so it looks like it is a pixel issue. \n\nPlease help me - i really like the Pixel 5, but i can not buy it, if this is not working...\n\nThanks in advance!",
