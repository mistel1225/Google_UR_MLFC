    "content": "For a high price charger, i'd expect Pixel charger is high quality too, but what came with the phone is a second rate charger. My charger just died on me just like that, i never twisted the cables or even take it with me anywhere, and it just won't charged anymore, died just like that.\n\nI know that Pixel charger is using 5V 3A or 9V 2A, although it would mostly charge at 10W, not 18W like it advertised. Would it be okay to use other brand like Oneplus charger? Oneplus charger is using 5V 6A which could deliver 30W, i know that it would only max out at 18W for Pixel phone, but is okay to use higher Ampere, is it safe?\n\nI bought Oneplus phone since it's the closest to pixel for pure android, even though software won't be as good as Pixel, but it closest enough and the hardware is way better than Pixel phone, and it's cheaper too\n\nI have a friend who have Pixel 2 and his charger died on him too, so if you have Pixel phone and your charger have died on you, it's not because of you twisting the cables or doing something to it, it's because quality of the product that is bad.",
