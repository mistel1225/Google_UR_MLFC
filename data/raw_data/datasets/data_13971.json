    "content": "My Google Fi Pixel 2 used to make and receive calls/texts just fine at home over wifi (we do not have cell signals where we live); just in the past week, however, the phone only allows Emergency Calls at home (wifi), os no calls/texts come in or go out. \n\nI did not make any change to the phone's settings - it just stopped working at home, under wifi-calling. \n\nHelp? Thanks.",
