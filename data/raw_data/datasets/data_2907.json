    "content": "I am very disaappointed with battery life pixel phones. It takes more consumption when the data mobile is active. Even worst when the mobile data is not active it takes 8-10% overnight. But when i turn off the nfc, WiFi, bluetooth, and turn off battery adaptive with no using data mobile i realised my battery percentage is not changed at all, which is very good.\n\nPlease do some update for bringing battery performance even phones in idle with mobile data.
