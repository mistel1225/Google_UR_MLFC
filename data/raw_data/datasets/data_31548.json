    "content": "Hi,\n\nMy friend was trying to order Pixel 3 after Google offered a reduced price of 599$ till 6th May. Her order got canceled multiple times. A couple of days ago, I tried ordering it and it again got canceled. We have checked multiple times that the details of payment and shipping address are correct.  Did any of you face a similar problem, or can suggest some possible issues that might be arising? \n\nThanks a lot for the help.",
