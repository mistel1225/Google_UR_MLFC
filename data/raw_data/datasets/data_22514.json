    "content": "I'm using both Pixel 4 and Pixel 2 until today and have updated both of them with the latest Android and March Update but what I recently noticed is that the picture I post in Pixel 4 in Instagram are more detailed than my Pixel 2. It's not a different picture nor took with Instagram camera. Both are the same picture took with Pixel 4 but then I sent to my Pixel 2 and post both of them but the pic UPLOADED with Pixel 4 looks more detailed. But why?",
