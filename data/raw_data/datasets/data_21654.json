    "title": "Why has a OS or phone app now rendered my entire phone useless when calling people?",
    "content": "Since the March2020 OS update and recent phone app update whenever I make a call - which includes answering a call, or clicking on a contact's number to call - as soon as I hit the answer button or the contact's number the screen goes black and the entire phone is useless.  Fingerprint doesn't wake it.  Power button does nothing.  Tapping the screen doesn't wake the phone either.  I can't end a call, I can't access the keyboard to entire in numbers for call centre menus, I can't swap to speaker, I can't put a call on hold, I can't mute, I can't even turn the volume up or down.\n\nI haven't even put the phone to my ear to set off the proximity sensor so its not that.  I have no case or screen protector and my phone is always clean.  The phone sits face-up on my desk and when I answer it, BLACK. the only time it doesn't do it is when I have the stock pixel headset that comes with the phone plugged in.  When I answer or make a call with a bluetooth speaker or in car, or other type of headset it's the exact same issue.  Only the stock pixel headset will stop the screen from going black.\n\nI have factory reset the phone, I have reinstalled the latest OS, I have ensured everything is update, I removed every non-stock app to see if it was a third party app playing havoc with the sensor.  None of that has fixed the issue.  Something is clearly wrong in the updates or the actual phone app itself.",
