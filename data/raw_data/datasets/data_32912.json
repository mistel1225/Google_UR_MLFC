    "content": "Hi there. \n\nI sent my phone to the service centre to get my Pixel 2 XL's speakers fixed. I also requested the battery to be replaced. In the process, my screen broke, and it was replaced FOC.  \n\nHowever, I suspect that during the process of replacing my screen, the front camera was damaged, or dust/dirt could have gotten into it. \n\nMy front camera has been blurry, unable to focus at all. When I use the front video, it was as if I has the beauty function turned on. It's extremely bad. \n\nI have tried restoring the app to factory settings, tried clearing the cache and using it in safe mode. All of this methods doesn't help. \n\nPlease advice on this matter as I really do not wish to send my phone to the repair center once more as the wait was quite long, and my daily work relies heavily on this phone.",
