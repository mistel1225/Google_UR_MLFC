    "content": "I have tried restarting my device but certain apps wont record voice. I tried Google Recorder, the recording was static. I tried sending a voice clip to Facebook messenger to and it had the same result. I downloaded other voice recording app and still the issue is the same. Shazam won't even detect background music. However, when I video record the camera records the voice. I also tried online video recording and it recorded my voice just fine. I don't know what's wrong with my microphone. Please help.",
