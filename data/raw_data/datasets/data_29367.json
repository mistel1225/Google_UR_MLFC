    "content": "Can you please enable exFAT formatted devices? I love my Pixel 3 phone and would like to use it to transfer data from my camera to Google Drive but when connected to USB-C port my camera shows up as incorrectly formatted USB flash drive. I realized it mounts to my Windows PC as exFAT device and not FAT32. I can use same cable with Samsung Note 9 and it works.",
