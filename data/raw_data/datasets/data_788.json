    "content": "I have been through all of the same guides that everyone else probably has as well. Just doesn't matter because the bootloader is in a locked state. My question is whether or not anyone has had any luck contacting either Verizon and or Google with a similar question. I am with others who hold the same opinion that we have paid for our device in full and now that security updates have ceased we must rely on mods, other software, or alternative operating systems to circumvent possible security risks. However due to what appears to be a large number of variants having locked bootloaders, we cannot apply a fix.",
