    "content": "I have brought a new recharger, the device does charge but only in a certain position which suggests that the jax within the device needs replacing. \n\nThe internet on the device also often crashes and say oops there seems to be a problem loading that page. \n\nFinally the speaker on the phone has gone incredibly quite. \n\nHappy for the phone to be sent off to be repaired.",
