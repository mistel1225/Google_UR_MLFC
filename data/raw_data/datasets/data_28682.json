    "content": "I chatted with the customer care agent when I was in India and as they instructed, I had done with the factory reset. But still the problem remains same. I need to know where I can get this repaired properly. As I know, there's no any authorised service centre in the country I am currently living. Kindly advise me what can I do with this. I don't wanna give my phone to any local technician as it is a big risk for the display as I realised.",
