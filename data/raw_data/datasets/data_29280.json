    "title": "How does one complain about the quality of a pixel phone just receceived. Broke withinn 2 weeks.",
    "content": "I bought this phone at atart of july and even though i have not dropped it or used abnormally the screen cracked and has now stopped working. All within 2 weeks of receipt on holiday so had to.go and buy a new phone to take photos with. I had a motorola withngorilla glass for a year without problems and the fact that a Â£400 product should be unusable within w weeks is unacceptable and means it ia not.fit.for purpose or.built to withstand normal use. I dont think ita right that i ajould pay forna repairnl coeting half the value of the phone. Its too much too soon without any accident. Uou ahould gave built it with stronger glass.",
