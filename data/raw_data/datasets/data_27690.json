    "content": "I can see in box charger works fine with other device. Other charger works fine with my mobile. However if I charge with in box charger it is detected little late and charges intermittently. \nIf I restart my mobile in safe mode or just restart it, problem is eliminated for 10-11 hours and then returns back. \nGoogle support has worked on my phone and looks like problem has returned. Only difference is, earlier i need not have to wait 10-12 hours to get problem returned.",
