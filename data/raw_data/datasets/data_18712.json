    "content": "My main camera on pixel 3 has gone blurry and unable to focus. I have tried all the google support solutions and option offered around the community and internet. I am resorting to making a claim through warranty. But I have been so frustrated by loop of contact us links google has been taking me through when I am trying to make a claim. Does anyone know how I can make a warranty claim? Where did google hide the form? Or even better, is there a number I can call? (I am in Europe)\nThanks",
