    "content": "This seems similar to that asked by others, but I have a PIXEL 4 that currently permanently just displays 1% Battery.\nIf I leave it on a charger for a long period the battery does seem to charge, but the status doesn't change from 1%.\nWhen I put it into safe mode and plug it in it displays \"1% - Charging Rapidly\" for as long as the cable is connected.\nIt means I've been unable to do any updates at all recently as they aren't permitted since the phone thinks its basically dead the whole time.\n\nI've done a factory reset but this made no difference. I've also tried multiple cables with no success or change.\nIs there anything else I can do?",
