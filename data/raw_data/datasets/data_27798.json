    "title": "Why does my battery drain 20% per hour and phone starts up automatically by itself if I turn it off?",
    "content": "My phone keeps draining battey at around 20% per hour, even on battery saver mode. Charging is also acting up, or not working at all until you disconnect and reconnect the cord several times (used 4 different cords) \n\nAlso, if I chose to turn my phone off, it will automatically turn it self back on. The only way it stays off is if I have the charger plugged in and it's charging. As soon as I take the cord out, it turns on automatically by itself.",
