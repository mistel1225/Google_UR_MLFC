    "content": "Without any changes in settings or apps my Pixel 4a does not allow outgoing calls - the usual screen appears but no connection or the usual \"beep\" sound. Also, incomming calls do not show - the caller gehts rerouted directly to voicemail. Same problem after reboot and even a complete reset of the device. Same problem with a differen SIM-card. Calls via Signal or Whatsapp work fine. Latest updates are installed. What could I do?",
