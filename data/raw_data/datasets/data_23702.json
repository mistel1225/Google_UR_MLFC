    "title": "External Microphone Not Working Anymore!! WTF?!?!",
    "content": "I have shot video on my Pixel 2 with an external microphone for the last year. Typically I use the Cinema FV-5 app and a Rode Videomic Go and it works pretty well. I just tried to hook up the mic and the app/the phone is not recognizing it. I thought maybe it was an internal app setting that I couldn't find, so I reset everything to their default settings in Cinema FV-5, selected the \"external mic\" as audio setting, still nothing. I tried a couple other camera apps, Open Camera and 4k Camera, but neither of them will recognize the external mic. They just default to recording from the phone mic. I tried another microphone- the Rode Videomic, which has it's own power source - but that isn't recognized either. I honestly don't know what happened. This mic worked with the phone for a year. Is there some phone setting I'm not seeing? Is it something post system update (I'm on Android 10). HELP!",
