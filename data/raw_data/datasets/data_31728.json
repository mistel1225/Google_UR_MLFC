    "title": "Sound only working occasionally, after it starts working a restart disables it?",
    "content": "A few months ago, probably around the first release of the android P beta, though maybe before, I thought I had lost all sound, but at some point I noticed it working, but after the phone died/restarted, the audio was lost. Since then I've had the sound work around 2-4 times, during those times doing all I can to assure my phone doesn't die or turn off. recently I had it going good for around a week and a half, but today I left my phone at home before going to school and when I returned, I noticed it had died. I charged it for a bit hoping that it may work again, but it didn't. I am just hoping to find a permanent fix for this issue instead of having to wait a long time for the sound to decide to work.",
