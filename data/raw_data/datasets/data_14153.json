    "title": "Screen stays blank after phone call - Pixel 4a - Android 11",
    "content": "After a phone call is completed, the screen stays dark and it is a PITA to try and get control of the phone. This all started after Android 11 was installed. I make very few phone calls. The proximity sensor is working correctly. Tested with AndroSensor. Current version is build RP1A.201005.006. i cannot find a way to turn off the auto off during a phone call. It seems that it used to be in Android, and now it is gone.",
