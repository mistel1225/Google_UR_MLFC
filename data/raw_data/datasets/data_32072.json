    "title": "My Pixel 3 is not receiving attached documents in text messages (photos are ok). What should I do?",
    "content": "I've looked around on the internet but haven't found an answer.  I'm not tech oriented so I haven't figured it out.  I receive photos, emojis and video clips/links ok in text messages.  If someone attaches a document to their text, I only see the text \"please look over the attached document\".  I don't see any symbol or anything for the attachment. I checked two files apps on the phone, and the attachments are not in there.  This may be irrelevant, but if I get an attachment in email I can see that on my phone. I appreciate any help with this.",
