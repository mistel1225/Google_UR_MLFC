    "content": "I'm trying to return my broken Google Pixel 4 XL which is within warranty. It took over a month for the return to be organised via advanced exchange. I now have the replacement device.\n\nThe broken device was sent back to Google on 18th Feb, today (25th Feb) it was returned because Google did not include the correct invoice for DHL to accept the return.\n\nSupport by email takes hours and hours, Google will charge me Â£929 if the broken device is not returned by the 1st March. What options do I have for support/speaking to someone/getting this resolved? All the UK numbers just point in the direction of google.com/support\n\nAny help would be appreciated before I begin fighting not to be charged for a Google error.",
