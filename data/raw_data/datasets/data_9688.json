    "content": "Just updated to the last pixel 2 patch and I am still getting the gray notification bar problem. Last time I chatted with google support they said they were aware of the problem and it would be fixed in this patch. It is still happening and this was the last patch for this phone. Is anything going to be done about this or am I just stuck with a phone that cannot use native full screen apps? Seems to be happening a lot with pixel phones on multiple popular apps and nothing is helping along the forum except for app developers being blamed. Starting to think this is exclusively a pixel problem or Android problem, anyone else still having this issue?",
