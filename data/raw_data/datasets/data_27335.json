    "content": "I've been waiting for over 3 months for Google to respond to my emails about my Pixel 2 which is basically no longer reliable or safe to use. It's so hot you can't hold it most of the time and the screen often doesn't respond to touch. Just as Google Support asked, I sent them proof of purchase, my phone's IMEI #, photos of the phone's front and back. One e-mail from Google says they will replace the phone with another Pixel 2 but I haven't heard from them in months. How can this be Google????\n\ncase ID #3-6802000027082",
