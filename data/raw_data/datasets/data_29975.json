    "content": "My Pixel 3XL has issues connecting to WiFi and mobile network. I have done a factory reset to solve it. and still no luck. I can use my phone except for connectivity via WiFi or Mobile data. I can use internet through Bluetooth Tethering. However, I am unable to get my backups and they expire in 8 days, which I am afraid isn't enough days for me to buy a new phone. Is there anyway I could restore the backups or extend the expiry? And is anyone aware of how to fix the network issue? I'm guessing the Network IC is damaged, coz reflashing software didn't work.",
