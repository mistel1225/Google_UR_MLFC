    "content": "I am have been using the same PIN for my phones for a while now and it worked fine on my pixel 3a until now. Today it asked me for my pin again as I had mainly been using fingerprint scanning but now it gives me an error and says my PIN is wrong. Is there any way to fix this without having to do a reset as I have pictures in my phone which haven't been backed up.",
