    "title": "A support agent placed me on hold for 40 minutes. Who can I complain to?",
    "content": "I have had two issues:\n\nWhen I filled out a support request to have an agent call me, I eaited almost 2 hours. Then when I received the call the agent on the line immediately put me on hold for 40 minutes until I hung up.\n\nI did a support chat after that and after an extreme wait the agent said they would not assist because I happened to establish the chat while logged into my account instead of my wife's, under whose name the phone was purchased. I said she was here and offered to log into the account but he said he would not and disconnected the chat.\n\nHow can I file an executive complaint about this service? Or is it better to go to the better business bureau?",
