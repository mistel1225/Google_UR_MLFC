    "title": "Pixel 4a minimum call volume too loud",
    "content": "During phone calls, the minimum call volume is too loud for me. I don't think it's a hardware or software issue (as in, I don't think it's broken), and I do have a bit of trouble with my hearing (especially loud noises). I was hoping to find a way to further reduce the call volume beyond the standard method of just lowering the volume. I know there are third-party apps that purportedly do this, but I haven't found any that works. Anyone else have a similar issue?",
