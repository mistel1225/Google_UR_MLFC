    "content": "I've updated my Pixel 2XL to Android 10 last month. All is good, however, the update 'broke' my rear camera unusable. I've tried everything from clearing cache to the dreaded factory reset, but nothing works at the moment. \n\nMy front camera works just fine tho. \n\nAny news whether October update will fix the 'sensor' issues plaguing some Pixel phones?",
