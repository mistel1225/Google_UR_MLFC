    "content": "Hi,\n\nCamera app freezes on Pixel 3 android 10. The screen turns black so I can see the camera interface but not the image from the camera. Also third party apps trying to us the camera crash. \nRestarting the phone helps temporally for an image or two and then it happens again.\nIt happens in safe mode and after factory reset. \nClearing storage and cache, disabling and enabling doesn't work as well. \n\nPlease help.",
