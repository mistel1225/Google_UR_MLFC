    "content": "after upgrading to Android 11, my smartphone is behaving strangely. There was a strong flicker on contact with the display, with a brightness of 45-60% and the \"smooth screen\" turned on. This makes it impossible to use the telephone. I am unable to read and print due to flickering. The battery will drain much faster. during a call, the speakerphone is often turned on. it pisses me off. is it worth waiting for any changes at all? or it is easier to change your smartphone.",
