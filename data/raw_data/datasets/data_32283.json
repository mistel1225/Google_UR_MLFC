    "title": "Pixel II XL Pairing with Bose QC35 II headphones",
    "content": "8 weeks ago, I got a pair of Bose QC35 II headphones and am having problems pairing with my Pixel II XL.  I also pair these headphones with my laptop during the day.  Nearly every day, I have a minor issue that requires me to turn off or re-pair or start/ stop a music service to get the pairing to work again.  I can live with that;  however, once a week, a more major problem happens and it ends up taking me 8+ attempts and sometimes waiting 1-2 days to get it sorted out.  During these more major episodes, I end up doing everything posted in the forums, including removing the pairing from the phone and the Bose app to start from scratch.  Often, my phone will see the headphones, attempts to pair, and then fails.  Note that I also posted an issue today with the Bluetooth to my 2011 BMW 3 Series.  I am starting to feel like the common problem is the phone.",
