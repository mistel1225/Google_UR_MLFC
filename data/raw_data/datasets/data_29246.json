    "content": "Hi guys,\nApparently I can't lower down the volume during a phone call. Even if I press the lower down volume button (or up) it stays the same...at maximum. I have to step out of the room if I call someone because others in the room can hear the person who I'm talking to. And no, it's not on speaker :)\nDoes anyone had this issue and was able to fix it somehow?\nRegards,\nRadu",
