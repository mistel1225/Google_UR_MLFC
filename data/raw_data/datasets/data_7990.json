    "content": "Hi,\nI have just set up my Pixel 5 using my Google Account. The email address I have associated with my Google account is also an Exchange mailbox. I do not use the Gmail service under my Google account. Now I wanted to add in my Exchange account (in the Gmail app), but I always get the message: \"You have already added this account.\" I guess this doesn't work since there is already an account (my Google account) added under the same email address. Is it somehow possible to connect my Exchange account anyways?\n\nIf not, I'll change the email address of my Google account. But I think something like this should actually work....\n\nThanks for the help!",
