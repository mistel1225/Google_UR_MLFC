    "content": "It's been over a month that I've been trying to process an RMA, but I'm still stuck at the same position as when I started. (Support agent keeps going back and forth with telling me that they have did not processe the RMA, to asking me for the RMA number, back to saying that they haven't processed it yet, etc.). Any suggestions on what to do?",
