    "content": "I'm not actually sure if that's what this is called, but I just bought a used 3a XL in pretty good condition so after setting it up I noticed that youtube videos would have this corruption problem. This was also happening on 3rd party youtube apps like youtube vanced. I own a 3a and a couple of other phones so I tried both the official and vanced apps and they worked fine. It was only on the 3a XL that this problem showed up. It doesn't mess with the audio, thank god.",
