    "content": "Looking for help with slow charging or not charging pixel 5\nTried new cables, new ac, wireless charging, reset phone...same slow charging, or not charging (battery goes down even when plugged in on charge when using).   If charged overnight it lasts almost all day, but once it's done takes all night to charge up again.\nStarted in may, after update (but also temperatures up now due to summer, I see both as possible issues)\n\nThanks for help",
