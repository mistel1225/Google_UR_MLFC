    "title": "\"Charging connected device via USB\" Android Notification - Preventing charge via provide charger",
    "content": "Hi there -\n\nAs of last week I've started to receive an android notification stating \"Charging connected device via USB\". I first noticed it while being charged wirelessly ('P' symbol). I'm unable to dismiss it.\n\nThe device is only ever charged via Pixel Stand. I've tried a number of troubleshooting steps after realizing headphones no longer work.\n\nWhat Doesn't Work: Charging via USB cable (with the provided charger); as well, the provided Pixel Buds no longer work (the sound comes from the phone). I don't have other headphones to try and I assume any use of the USB-C doesn't work. Any attempt to charge from the provided charger causes the phone to continuously beep and vibrate as if I was unplugging and plugging it in over-and-over.\n\nWhat Works: Wireless charging from the Pixel Stand (received via pre-order promo) and Bluetooth speakers, headsets, etc.\n\nDevice: Pixel XL 3\nPurchased from: Google Store\nCountry: Canada\nCarrier: Rogers\nAndroid Version: 9\nSecurity Patch Level: January 5, 2019\n\nI am looking for a solution to this problem without resetting the device.\n\nThank you,",
