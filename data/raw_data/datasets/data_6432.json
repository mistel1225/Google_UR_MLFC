    "title": "Cannot access my email on pixel 4a as gmail says \"this account already exists on this device\"",
    "content": "I recently bought a pixel 4a and have been setting it up.  I had signed into my google account which uses an icloud email address.  I went to Gmail to view my emails but it asked me to add at least one account.  I tried to enter my cloud email but kept getting \"this account already exists on your device\".  Tried deleting google account from device then entering in Gmail but that just logged me back in then gave me the same error.  Also tried clearing Google play data and storage then restarting as suggested by a forum online which didn't work.  Any help greatly appreciated :)",
