    "content": "Hi all. My pixel 3a keeps rebooting when I'm out and about (walking or cycling), but never when I am home. Initially I thought this was because of the cold (I got it in the winter) but now it's quite warm and it's still happening. I am often listening to podcasts on spotify or google podcasts when I'm out so I thought one of these apps might have something to do with it? But then again I do listen to podcasts at home as well sometimes, and it's never rebooted there.\n\n-My apps and system are up to date\n-I have plenty of space free\n-This is actually the second 3a device this is happening to... I returned the first one as I thought it was faulty but it is happening to the second one as well.\n-I have turned off all gestures (as I thought movement might be the issue) and the problem persists.\n\nAnyone have a clue what might be up or something else I can try?\n\nThank you so much.",
