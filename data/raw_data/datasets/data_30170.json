    "content": "I would like to edit the 120FPS footage directly in Adobe Premiere. If I shoot in slow motion (which is the only way it lets you increase the frame rate to 120, as far as I know) and then copy the files to the computer, some of it is in real time and the other in slow motion but it's all in 30 FPS. Isn't there any way I could use the native camera app (or if everything fails, a third party one) to achieve what I need?",
