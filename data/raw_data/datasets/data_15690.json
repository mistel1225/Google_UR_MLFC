    "content": "Updated my Pixel 2XL to Android 11 few days ago. After taking a screenshot it goes in bottom left corner so it could be edited or shared, however when I tap on it to edit, it loads the previous screenshot in the editor. It saves all of them and I still can edit them in Photos app, but that problem still bothers me.",
