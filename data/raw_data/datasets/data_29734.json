    "content": "Out of nowhere whenever I plug headphones into my google pixel the phone lowers the volume on its own. I'm not pressing anything and buttons are not stuck. If I try and bring the volume back.up once this happens it goes back down. Sometimes the Google assistant thing opens up too on its own when the volume goes down. \nI have done numerous restarts. Can anyone help?\nI've restarted multiple times. I've unplugged and plugged headphones. I've checked settings and updates.",
