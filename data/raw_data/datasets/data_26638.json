    "content": "When answering a call in Speakerphone, their seems to be a 5-10 second delay that the end user is unable to hear me. I've been updating consistently to the new version of the Phone app via the Play Store and issues are still ongoing. For context, this has always been an ongoing issue with my Pixel 3 (which was purchased the month it got released) My wife also purchased a brand-new Pixel 3 through the Google Store back in September 2019. Issues are still on going. We've both updated to the latest Android 10 version and received the latest November Security Patch. Could this be software related? I would like to assist on testing as this has been a very annoying issue.\n\nWould a bug report be requested for this? If so, I would love to assist on this.",
