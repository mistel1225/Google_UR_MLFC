    "content": "Using Pixel 4xl....\nWhen I play a Podcast in the background and another app I then use has sound, the podcast stops so my other app can use the speakers. So if I stop the other app, my Podcast does not automatically continue. It used to continue on my original Pixel XL.\nI am using Doublepod but today I tried using Google Podcast player and the same thing happened. I have looked through my settings but can't find anything. Any suggestions?",
