    "content": "Suddenly my Pixel 3 won't open certain apps. The Google Assistant is not working. When I try to start the app it opens and quickly closes. I thought maybe it was an issue with my Microsoft email (it wouldn't stay open either) so I uninstalled it. When I try to reinstall it the message is \"something went wrong, try again\". There is a message when I try to start Assistant \"Account Action Required - Fix\" but when I try to \"fix\" it just disappears. I found this is happening with several apps now. I am losing my mind!",
