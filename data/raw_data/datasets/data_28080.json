    "content": "Ever since I put the GA version of Android 10 on my Pixel 3 I have only been able to get 10hrs of battery, my network performance is around 14Mbps instead of 57Mbps before, it overheats and the performance is TERRIBLE. This phone is only 6 months old, awful.\n\nHas anyone else had ALL of these issues?",
