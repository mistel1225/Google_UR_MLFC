    "content": "I have noticed that on my Pixel 4a that the Google Play Store tends to use a large amount of mobile data. I have the store set to download only over WiFi, and even that is set to manual. Despite that, I have occasionally seen notifications that it is doing a 'system update' while I'm not on WiFi. Over the past 2 weeks, it has used 172M, with about 113M as 'foreground' and the rest as background. Worse, I never open up the play store when not on WiFi, so I can't see where all that foreground data is coming from.\nAny ideas on what is going on? Any settings that I missed?",
