    "content": "Recently the camera on my Pixel 4XL has stopped working, I've tried all the solutions I've seen online like deleting the cache and restarting my phone but nothing has seemed to work to get it back and running. \n\nThere was one time when it started to work again for around a week but then it cut out again, does anyone know how I can resolve this problem preferably without sending it out to Google to fix?",
