    "content": "Hi\n\nI keep getting a drop-down notification that \"Settings wants to show Google Play Store slices\"\nI get the option of deny or allow, along with a check-box saying \"Allow settings to show slices from any app\"\n\nWhat's all this about as I keep pressing deny but the drop-down message stays?\n\nAny clues please?",
