    "content": "Hello, when I click on setting, I see the settings i.e. Network & internet, Connected devices, Apps & notifications....... but when I click on one of the categories nothing happens, the screen is locked, I am unable to to open reset matter of fact I can't even get to reset being that I am not only unable to click on a setting but I am also unable to scroll up or down.\nI would appreciate if someone has a suggestion(s) on another method to reset my Pixel 3a or how to possible open a setting category besides clicking on the item since my screen is locked?\nThank you\nbOb",
