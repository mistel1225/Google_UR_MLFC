    "content": "When I take a photo/video holding my phone upright (portrait orientation), the resulting photo is saved in my gallery rotated 90 degrees clockwise (landscape). Landscape photos are unaffected, but landscape videos are saved upside down.\n\nI've tried turning the phone's autorotate on and off and restarting my phone. This problem just started a few days ago. I can manually rotate the photos upright, but I lose the motion photos if I do this.",
