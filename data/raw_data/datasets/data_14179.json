    "title": "Pixel 4XL, terrible battery life since Android 11",
    "content": "I know there are multiple topics about this issue, but, I wanted to add to the fire.\n\nMy battery life since Android 11 has been absolutely terrible. I used to average around 1 day and 5 hours on a charge, now, from what the system says, it lasts 16 hours. Actual time that it lasts is significantly less. Yesterday I unplugged around 10am, and was at 15% by 830pm, with 3 hours of screen time. Some days depending on what I'm doing, I will have to charge before going to work. Terrible.\n\nI use the stock google charger and cable, I have minimal apps on my phone, I would say the most intensive thing that I do with my phone is streaming music.\n\nDuring the A11 beta, there were a few builds where I would be able to get 5/6 hours of screen time with one charge, not the case anymore. \n\nI feel like the overall performance and feel of the device since A11 is significantly reduced, camera lags, keyboard lags, apps lag to load. Very disappointed with how A11 has been so far.\n\nBattery drain is excessive aswell, if I unplug at a full battery and it sit over night, it will drain a minimum of 15%, also terrible, precious builds used to have a max drain of 5/6%.\n\nFeedback is appreciated, solutions would be greatly appreciated.",
