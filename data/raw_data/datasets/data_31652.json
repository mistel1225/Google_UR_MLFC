    "content": "I have been having this issue for a few weeks now and I'm not sure whats going on. My phone will say I have full signal, I'm connected to the LTE network for data yet the phone acts as if I don't have data (gps wont load, cant browse websites etc.) and I get an error sending texts messages. I can make phone calls no problem. This issue will last for a few minutes then start working again. This happens on and off every 5-10 minutes throughout the entire day.",
