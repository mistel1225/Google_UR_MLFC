    "content": "I have been trying for hours to make a warranty claim for my Google Pixel 4a 5G. Read all the information in the Pixel Phone Help Centre as well as in the Hardware Warranty Center. The Warranty states \n\n\"How do you make a claim? To make a claim under this Limited Warranty, please contact the Google support team for your Google Product at g.co/pixel/support. Weâ€™ll need your name, contact information, and the serial number on your Google Product.\"\n\nHowever, all contact options are disabled and instead of showing an email address or to connect you to an agent, they just send you around in circles on the same pages. This is extremely frustrating! Google, please help asap! I am starting to feel it was a big mistake buying a Pixel!",
