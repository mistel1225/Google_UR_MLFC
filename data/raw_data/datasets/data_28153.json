    "content": "Dongles suck and everyone knows it. \n\nI haven't had a reason to use my USB-C to 3.5 adapter since I got my 3xl, basically holding on to it as backup. Well I finally had a reason to use them with some nice sennheiser headphones I got for work and guess what... the adapter doesn't work.\n\nWhen searching for a solution all that's there is the typical creative avoidance suggestions: \"Try restarting it,\" \"Try clearing the cache,\" \"Try turning off/on this or that setting.\" \n\nThose aren't in any way useful and just serve to further irritate me. The dumb 'tail' came packaged with the phone, it should work no questions asked. The fact that they've done NOTHING to alleviate the issue makes me fear for the pixel 4 inheriting the issue as well.\n\nAnd NO, I will not be submitting an RMA. Why on earth would I further inconvenience myself to correct someone else's failure? \n\nRemoving the 3.5 and adding a notch were both purely done to imitate Apple and I will never be convinced otherwise. Do better.",
