    "content": "Chrome crashes immediately after opening and continues to crash on subsequent attempts to open.\n\nBehavior can be seen here:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZHahyAvbeg\n\nHave tried:\nclearing cache\nclearing storage\nuninstalling Chrome to the base version and updating again\n\nThe crashing can be avoided for at least a few hours (usually less than 1 day) by restarting the phone.\n\nThe crashes don't happen if I don't turn on sync.\n\nI can provide logcat output.\n\n\nPlease help, this problem is driving me bonkers, and keeping sync turned off is not a solution.",
