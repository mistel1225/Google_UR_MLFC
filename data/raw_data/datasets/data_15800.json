    "content": "Even after upgrading to android 11, there is no basic feature like call recording. Google company provides android for all other branded mobiles and they are shining in the market with lot of features and apps. But why google doesn't provide basic features for google pixel phones..!! Even google pixel phones will block the third party apps related to call recordings which are available in play store.\n\nIt may be legal or illegal in the country. Am not sure about India. My concern is why google pixel phone doesn't have this inbuilt feature while all other phones support the same.",
