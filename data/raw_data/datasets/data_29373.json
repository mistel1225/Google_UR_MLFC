    "title": "Forgot original email used and PIN when first setting up Google Pixel 3 XL",
    "content": "Phone was for my son and unfortunately he set up a PIN, then forgot the PIN and then he’s forgotten what email was associated with the phone when it was originally setup.  We have done resets to the original factory settings but it appears even after resetting to factory settings, you still need to remember the email first established with the device.  I was told from Google, that this is a security setting that cannot be bypassed.  I essentially have a device that does not work as I cannot get past the email/passwords since I can’t put in an gmail password that wasn’t originally used to set up the device.  Any help would be appreciated.",
