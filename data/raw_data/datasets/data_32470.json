    "content": "Don't do it. Pixel 3xl has a fatal camera flaw. I read about the glitches before purchasing, but figured everything would be worked out. Google won't do anything unless I send them the phone for 7-10 business days. Best Buy won't help because the phone is almost a month old. My iPhone 5c was super reliable for over 5 years!! The Pixel 3XL is so disappointing, especially because the night camera feature was one thing I was really looking forward to. Just don't do it. Learn from my mistake. I spent 6 hours on the phone today trying to get help and even had to do a complete factory reset. Nothing helps. It's a hardware issue and the manufacturer DOES NOT CARE. Do not buy a Google product because they will not stand behind their product unless you can live without your phone for 2 weeks. Ironically, my iPhone 5c still works, but Verizon won't reconnect such an old phone so I can send my brand new phone back to Google. Hilarious. The phone that works cannot be connected and my new phone can't even snap a selfie.\n\nI spent 6 hours on the phone with 5 different reps who had me: disable the camera, re-enable the camera, test in safe mode, check for updates, and finally a factory reset.  NOTHING helps.  They've apparently known this for months and they DO NOT CARE.",
