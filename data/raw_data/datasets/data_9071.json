    "content": "This sounds strange, but after having restarted my Pixel 2 this morning, the device does not accept my passcode anymore.  Naturally I remember my passcode, so the passcode must have been changed overnight. \n\nEither I have changed the passcode in my sleep (which sounds VERY odd) or the phone has changed the passcode by itself (which also sounds VERY strange).\n\nAny advice from the community, other than a factory reset?\nThanks in advance!",
