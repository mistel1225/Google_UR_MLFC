    "content": "The glowing statusbar when using motion-sense breaks immersive mode. The taskbar never closes completely, but stays visible above all other apps, showing battery, clock and notification icons. Tapping near it will open it. This is incredibly annoying in fullscreen apps.\n\nThis problem is going to occur, for example, when listening to spotify while using any fullscreen app. Forcing immersive mode does not work.",
