    "content": "I recently had my faulty \"Just Black\" Pixel 3XL replaced, but was sent a \"Not Pink\" model as the replacement. I have not opened the packaging and immediately contacted the same support staff, who told me that they have escalated my case to the \"product specialist\" team who will contact me in 1-2 business days. This was four days ago now, with no contact. \n\nI have sent another email to the store support person who was originally handling my return to advise that I have not been contacted and now am not receiving any response from them. \n\nIs there any way to contact this \"product support\" team directly?",
