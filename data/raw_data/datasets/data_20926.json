    "content": "Hi\nI would like my Pixel 4 XL (Android 10) to only use mobile data, whilst staying fully connected to a particular WiFi network.\nI connect my phone to my car's WiFi connection, but this connection does not have internet.\nI would like to use my 4G whilst connected to this WiFi. This used to be possible I believe, and is possible on a Samsung device.\nCould someone point me in the direction of how to do it please, assuming I can on a Pixel device running 10?\nThanks",
