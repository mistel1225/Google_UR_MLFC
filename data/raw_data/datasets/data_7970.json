    "content": "I need my Garmin connect app to have always access to my camera. This permission is no longer an option. I can only choose while the app is in use. The find my phone feature on the app doesn't work until I open the app on my phone which defeats the purpose. I worked for an hour with Google support who had me delete the play store app updates and remove/reinstall the Garmin connect app. I know it's an Android 11 feature, but is there a way to get around it so my app will work the way it is supposed to again.",
