    "content": "Sometimes I lose signal for both WiFi and mobile network. When this happens, I can't see any WiFi network and no Sim card would work. Other devices have no issues with the WiFi network. My Sim card would work on other phones. Other Sim cards won't work on the pixel 3. The signal would suddenly work without doing anything. One time there was no signal for 2 hours. Another time there was no signal for 18 hours. Anyone else with this issue? Does anyone know if this is a phone or software issue? Is it a bad manufactured  batch of pixel 3.",
