    "content": "Icons and other elements on the screen do not respond. When touched, they light up, but don't perform the action expected (e.g. pushing the agenda button opens up a current entry but offers no way to move further). Which means I have noe way of accessing the contents of my phone let alone using it as a communication tool.",
