    "content": "How to report a spam SMS is well documented.  How to report spam MMS is nowhere to be found...\n\nIt seems the spammers are now creating a large group (mostly around 19 people in my unfortunate experience) and sending an MMS spam message instead of an SMS spam message.  \n\nThere doesn't appear to be a way to report an MMS spam.  The options do not exist in any of the menus when dealing with a group message.\n\nDoes anyone know how to do this?  Is this just not supported?\n\nMy carrier is Verizon.\n\nThanks\n\n-Mike",
