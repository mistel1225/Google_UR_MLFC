    "content": "Hello, my phone got stolen and the guy that stole it managed to reboot it, erase everything, and put in a new account. Fortunately for me, I was able to track down the guy and recovered my phone. Unfortunately I cannot access it now since the guy that stole it has put on his account and my pixel is not recognizing my original Gmail account as the previous account, therefore I cannot access my phone. I have all the papers, emails and all evidence that points to me as the owner of the phone and I wanted to know Hoy can I restore my account and access my new pixel 3 XL with the original account. Thanks",
