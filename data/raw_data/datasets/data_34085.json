    "content": "I have a new google pixel 3 xl 128.  received it yesterday. I woke up this morning and my phone had a notification stating I needed to reboot in order to finish installation of the new security patch.  I immediately did so.  Only my phone never appeared to come back on.  After further review, it *seems* like it may be on because it vibrates slightly when I put my finger on the fingerprint reader but the screen remains black.  Plugging it in or holding down the power button get no visible response.",
