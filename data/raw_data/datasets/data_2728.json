    "content": "My phone keeps telling me it does not have a sim card, thus I cannot call, send or receive texts, or connect to mobile data - even though there is a sim card in my phone. It initially worked to remove the sim card and put it back in, this stopped working. I took my phone to my cell service provider, they ran my SIM card and told me nothing was wrong with it. I bought a new SIM card just to be safe and am still having the same issue. It has been ongoing for almost a week now.",
