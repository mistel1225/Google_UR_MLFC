    "content": "Pixel 2XL would not turn on or charge. I ran the procedure in the \"Troubleshoot by connecting to a computer\" section of the page \"Fix a Pixel phone that won't charge or turn on\" (answer/7167687) and the phone is now working. I am concerned that the phone may be starting to fail.\n\nWhy did the phone fail? Is it likely to fail again? Why would the magic steps with the cable connected to the computer get it charging when the charger cable would not?\n\nI would appreciate any insights.",
