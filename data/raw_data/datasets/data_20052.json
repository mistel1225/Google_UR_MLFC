    "content": "My Pixel 3 will not charge unless I restart it with a cable plugged in.  Meaning, I won't get a charge if I plug in while phone is on, but if I plug in and then restart my phone, it will charge.  \n\nThings I've tried:\nDifferent cables, different outlets - same results on my car, work and home chargers.  \nCleaning the port, brought to a cell repair place, they said charging port is fine\nSafe Mode - no difference\nComplete factory reset - still requires a restart to charge\n\nNot sure what else to do, I'm out of warranty. Seems like it started after most recent android update, but it could be a coincidence. \n\nAnyone have any theories?",
