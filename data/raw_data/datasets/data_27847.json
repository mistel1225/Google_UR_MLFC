    "content": "Hello Google community, \n\nThe Pixel 2 XL i purchased from Google store is eligible for replacement due to defective recharge port (USB C female port). \n\nIs it possible to have Google replace my defective Pixel 2 XL with a Pixel 4 (when it comes out to the public on Google store)?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you.\n\nCheers,\nMoh",
