    "title": "Battery Health, Have I Lost Capacity?",
    "content": "It seems that my phone's power has been draining ever more quickly these days as opposed to a year ago when it used to last 10 - 14 hours on a single charge. Nowadays, I am lucky if I can run my phone for a couple hours while actually using it (aside from phone calls, which are still capable of lasting quite a while with no apparent significant impact). \n\nA few months ago I downloaded and began to utilize AccuBattery in order to try and determine the potential cause behind all of this. Since that point in time, this app has indicated that my phone's battery capacity is now 50% of what it should be. I am curious as to the accuracy of this app, and whether it is in fact indicating an issue with my battery? \n\nThank you for your assistance in this matter.",
