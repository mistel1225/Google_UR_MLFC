    "content": "I want to make it so that when my partner calls or text's me, it always rings/chimes. But for everyone else it is silent. \n\nI turned on Do Not Disturb, set \"starred contacts only\" and added my partner as a starred contact. \n\nAt first, everyone's text came through even with do not disturb on!!! :(\n\nThen I found in my messenger settings (using google messenger) that it was overriding Do Not Disturb. So I turned that off. \n\nNow, nobody's text's ring/chime/vibrate - including my starred contacts, even though I have told it to let them come through. \n\nI feel like I am going crazy - I am trying to do the exact thing this program is designed for, using only google apps and it's just not working. What am I missing?",
