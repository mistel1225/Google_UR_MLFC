    "title": "Pixel 3 Flashing Like a Strobe Light After Android 11 Update",
    "content": "I updated to Android 11 on Wednesday night, and since then, my phone has been flashing like a strobe light, which makes it nearly impossible to use, and seems to make it very hot. I've tried everything I've found online (turning on GPU only, disabling auto brightness and turning up the brightness all the way, restarting it, etc). It seems to get worse as the day goes on. Am I the only one? Are others having the same problem? Short of hard resetting your phone, have you found a solution? If not, did hard resetting work?",
