    "content": "This is with my Pixel 5. During a call, suddenly neither party can hear anything but the call is still connected. This is random. It may not happen for days, and then yesterday it happened twice within maybe 20 minutes. I have cleared the cache and data in the phone app. There is no coralation with time, on wifi or not. Since it is random and may not happen for days, trying safe mode is not an option. I have tried turning on the speaker and back off with no success.\nSuggestions???",
