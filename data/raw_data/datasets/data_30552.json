    "content": "Hi There.\n\nI'm building a Wordpress website. When viewed on desktop or anyone else's phone (iOS or Android), it looks good. But when I view it on my Pixel 3XL, the header image is missing. I'm attaching images of what it looks like on my Pixel compared to how it appears on everyone else's phone.\n\nI've viewed it in Incognito mode, restarted, cleared the web image cache, but nothing seems to work. (The website address is: https://www.digitalfuturesinitiative.org, btw)\n\nThanks for your help!\nSagar",
