    "content": "Pixels clearly have problems with their mics and speakers. I know there are lawsuits about this that google has lost. And YET they still expect me to pay a second claim fee (I already had a pixel replaced for this for which I dutifully paid my claim fee before realizing that this is a known product defect) before they will offer me a replacement of the same type of phone (given the support so far, I am assuming the replacement will be defective too). How can they get away with not covering the claim fee and replacing for free?  I see many posts about the same defect, but no solutions other than \"pay to get it replaced.\" Let me know if anything else has worked to get it through to google that they should not be charging a claim fee in this case. It does seem like they will lose customers over the poor handling.",
