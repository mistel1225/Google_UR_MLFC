    "content": "I recently received a gift. It was a stone Live Case for my 5\" Pixel 2. The inner casing has almost like coffee stains bleeding from the camera, fingerprint and USBC cutouts. I was fine with this because it was going to be covered by the hard plastic anyways. However, after trying to make a phone call, I noticed that the inner case does not have a cutout for the mic beside the USBC port. The other person on the call said that my voice was more muffled. Maybe this was Placebo, but the mic on my Pixel 2 did sound more muffled after I called myself vs a naked phone or my old case. Is the location of the mic beside the USBC port or in the speaker slot? Also, is it normal for Live Cases to not include this mic cutout? There is a cutout for the top mic and I know that the 2XL doesn't have a bottom mic so maybe that's a factor?",
