    "content": "Every time I make a video with the Google Pixel camera the smartphone crash very hard (I need to try turn off all the time it happens) if I open the Google Photos and try to watch the video was recorded. Some it happens with photos too, but it's more frequently with videos. What I already tried to solve:\n\n> To clean the cache and the data on the Apps settings;\n> Format the phone to factory settings (this was really hard and didn't solved the problem 😡);\n> Re-install Google Photos (also was a wasting of time 😒).\n\nI don't know what else I can do to solve this problem!!!\n\nI'm really considering leave the Pixel line and maybe include and 🍎 on my diet!!!
