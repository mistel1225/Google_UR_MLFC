    "content": "My new pixel xl suddenly stopped allowing me to use my pin to unlock it. I am definitely using the right pin. If I try a different pin, it tells me I have the wrong pin. When I try the correct pin it goes to a black screen then back to my lock screen. I have only had this phone since August 20. \n\nI have read all the theads I can see on this issue and it seems to be a big problem with no solution so far.  I have tried all the suggestions except resetting as restoring from Google still means a lot of time and effort for me. I don't want to be doing this every couple weeks. I was really enjoying this phone, but if this doesn't have a quick fix, I will be going back to a more reliable brand.",
