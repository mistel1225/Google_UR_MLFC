    "content": "My 2 week old Pixel 4a 5G is stuck in a bootloop. When I played music from it in my car, the power button got stuck (it isn't stuck anymore) and the phone turned off. Since then, it is stuck in a bootloop where only the Google logo and an animated progressbar is showing. I really need this phone to boot again since I just finished setting up all my 2FA and transfering all my old data to the phone and having to redo that would be a nightmare. \n\nI already sideloaded a Rescue OTA which installed without a problem. But the phone is still stuck in bootloop. I also tried to boot in Safe Mode but it didnt work.\n\nI am open to any suggestions.",
