    "content": "Callers cannot hear me when making or receiving a phone call. I have made sure my phone is up to date on it's system updates. I have tried making a voice recording and no sound will play back. I do have sound when I make a video. I have plugged in headphones, restarted my phone, shut down. Checked for it being on mute, turned off my Bluetooth.",
