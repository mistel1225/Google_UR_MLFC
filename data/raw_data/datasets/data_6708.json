    "content": "Hi\n\nI just bought Pixel 4a 5G. I updated  it to the latest android and security update.\nI'm using dedicated app for SMS (called Messages)\n\nI have several issues:\n- I can't send message, when I clicked send I got in 3s message that my SMS couldn't be sended. Thats not true - recipient in few seconds receive 4 the same messages instead of one\n- I need to wait 10--12 min  to get SMS sended by sender (even in the same cellular network)\n\nI've signed to beta program for Messages app, I'm using the latest one, but this not resolved any issues.\nIs there any option to send you some logs for troubleshooting?\n\nI temporary switched to another app dedicated to SMS, same issue has happened to me\n\nPlease help me - this is really annoying issue.",
