    "content": "Hi guys, it's the third Pixel 5 they replace me, I always notice that, since the last update (they turned up the volume) at maximum volume, in some conditions it crackles.\nThis happens especially with mid-high frequencies, it doesn't do them with low ones.\nFor example, the voice of Google Assistant, if at maximum volume it tends to distort in some cases, for example if it tells you a joke.\nI noticed this also with some songs, I notice it even more with spotifty premium and with maximum quality.\nFor example you can notice the problem with this song, turn the volume to the maximum, close yourself in a room and click on play (I recommend the YouTube audio / video quality to the maximum).\nThe problem occurs in the first 5 seconds with this strong plan going up with a filter.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYlgSFEF9vg",
