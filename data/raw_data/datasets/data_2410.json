    "content": "Contactless payment started out slow one day. I had to hold my phone to the terminal for over a minute to read. Mid way it kept saying phone was moved too fast when my phone was literally still for up to 3 minutes\n\nBy the end of day, contactless stopped working completely. I could hold the phone over a terminal for 5 minutes and it still doesn't work\n\nI tried updating, restarting, removing my sim and putting it back but it still doesn't work and hasn't worked for almost a week.\n\nHow do I fix it?",
