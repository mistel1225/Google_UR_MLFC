    "title": "Pixel 2 camera stopped working and stayed over 12 hous on G logo page after pressing upgrade to 10",
    "content": "My camera stopped working about a month ago. However, I erased the camera app and reinstalled but it did not work. I also checked this on security mode but could not find anything about my camera. I also have problems with apps. If the app allows uploading/taking pictures, would stay in black screen or would not open when you try to take or upload pictures (poshmark, instagram, chase, etc).\n\nAfter all, I also pressed a button in order to upgrade to 10 yesterday around 4pm (rebooted 3 times since it stayed on G logo page for few hours) and my last reboot was at 6pm. I woke up this morning 6:30am and it was still on the same screen. I tried to reboot, go into the security mode but did not proceed with factory reset because I still need some information from my cell phone. \n\nDo you have any suggestions?\nI am very disappointed and frustrated with these issues!",
