    "content": "My Home Mini keeps ringing my old Pixel 2XL instead of my new Pixel 5 when using Find My Phone voice command. I tried doing a factory reset of the Home Mini, this time using the Pixel 5 to setup using the Google Home app. Once setup is finished, Home Mini still rings the Pixel 2XL.\n\nI went to my Google profile and accessed the security tab. I can see I am signed in to 2 phones (rightfully so as still using both) but I can't find a field to indicate the Pixel 5 as the new default or primary device.\n\nAppreciate any suggestions on what else to try to get the Pixel 5 to be recognized as my primary phone, especially by Home Mini with the Find My Phone command. Thanks.",
