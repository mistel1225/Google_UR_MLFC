    "content": "I bought this Pixel 3 in the belief that I was buying a flagship model, that no other phone in their line up would touch. Now they release the 3a, with the same camera and much of the same hardware and looks. Yes, it's watered down, but my 3 isn't Â£350 better. And whose going to buy this now when it comes to resale? There's no difference to the untrained eye, so which do you think they'll buy, unless I sell this at around the same price?",
