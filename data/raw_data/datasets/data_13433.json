    "content": "My pixel 5 pre-order with origal ship date of 11/4 was somehow cancelled. Had to reorder & now the ship date is 11/21. Also need to figure out how to return one of the fabric case for the Pixel 5 because there was no way of telling if the fabric case s charged separate or if it was cancelled in the original order. All there is is a charge for $54 and there is no telling what that is. So it's there's two cases. One needs to be returned",
