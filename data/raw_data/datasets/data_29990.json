    "content": "I'm from the Netherlands and bought my Pixel 3A XL in the US. It started flickering (I only bought it 3 weeks ago) and I basically can't use it because the buttons don't function when it flickers. I can't contact support because there is no support for the Pixel 3A XL in the Netherlands. How can I fix the problem but more importantly: contact Google?",
