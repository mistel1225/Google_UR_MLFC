    "content": "I noticed a hairline crack in the lower third of my pixel 3 screen.  It appears to be in middle layer of the glass.  I can only see it in the sunlight.  I have used the phone in a case since I bought it in January 2019.  I also have not dropped it or anything on it.  Has anyone else seen this issue?  What should I do?",
