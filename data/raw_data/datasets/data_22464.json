    "content": "Hello\nThe touchscreen of my Pixel 3a is completely unresponsive. The hardware buttons are working and using them I could restart/power off the phone but when I start it the screen does not work again. The problem happened a few times for the last 2-3 months (since I have the phone) and a few restarts used to resolve the issue but now it doesn't help. I sent feedback via the phone back then but haven't received any answer by Google. The phone is under Google Limited Warranty. I bought it from US but now I'm in Europe and want to know how it can be repaired/replaced/refunded by Google.",
