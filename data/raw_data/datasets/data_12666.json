    "title": "Pixel 3: Mobile data not working after recent update, tried all previous suggestions.",
    "content": "My boyfriend and I both have Pixels and had our phones update automatically. Friday evening (two days ago) our cellular data stopped working. We both have the same Simple Mobile carrier but on different plans.\n\nWe spent all of Saturday chatting with Simple Mobile support trying to get things back and they said everything looked just fine on their end and they knew of no issues on either of our accounts.\n\nWe believe it's an issue following the Pixel update. We have tried to update APN settings, we have reset network/wifi/Bluetooth settings, toggled airplane mode off and on while restarting, we have scrubbed the Pixel threads trying everything and to no avail.\n\nAny suggestions? I need my phone for work and starting to get nervous. \n\nThanks.\n-a",
