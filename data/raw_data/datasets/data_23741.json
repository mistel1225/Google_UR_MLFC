    "content": "I have a pixel 2 (bought in December 2017), which is running android 10. This phone restarts once every time it touches 40-45% battery level. This issue has been going on since last 2 months (when the phone was running the last version of android). \nJust FYI - Storage remaining - 48%.\nAny help would be appreciated.",
