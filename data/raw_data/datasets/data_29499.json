    "content": "This feature worked for years on my Samsung Galaxy and worked for several months on my new Pixel. I have now tried resetting the feature and it still doesn't work correctly. Rule is sleep, on at 10 p.m., off at 10 a.m. It goes on at 10 but does not go off unless I manually turn it off. Is there a trick to get it working correctly again?",
