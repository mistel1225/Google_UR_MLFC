    "content": "When I plug in headphones using the USB-c audio adapter and go to listen to music on Spotify my phone keeps popping up google assist which I disabled and the sound cuts in and out and the volume bar pops up and will slide a little. I have been having this issue for almost a year and have bought numerous audio adapter that works for a little bit then stop, I have done everything I can find but it has had no effect. I have the Google Pixel XL 2 but I can't find much information about it but I have done everything up to turning off google assistance. This is my replacement phone they gave me as well. it was refurbished as well not a new phone. this is also a refurbished phone from google not a new replacement that they sent m for the warranty which i used to try and fix this issue.",
