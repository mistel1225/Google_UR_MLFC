    "content": "I bought Castlevania: Symphony of the Night on my Google Pixel earlier this year... worked beautifully and fully enjoyed it. However, my original Pixel fell prey to a nasty bug where it got stuck restarting constantly, and even Google Support was unable to assist.\n\nUpgraded to a Pixel 4, and decided to replay Castlevania: SotN since all my data was lost with the original Pixel. Tried to play the first level, and found that the game was running significantly faster than it should have been... maybe about 150% speed. Made it near unplayable as there was no way to put in commands fast enough. Only gameplay was affected... music still played at normal rate.\n\nI can't believe I have to ask this... is there a way to throttle game performance on a Pixel 4? I feel like I need to put DOSBox on it...",
