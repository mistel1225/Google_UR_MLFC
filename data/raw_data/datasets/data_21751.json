    "content": "When I add an attachment to send as an mms, if I click on the attachment to open it full size (to preview) the attachment shows my previous name.\nI have tried to change all of my own contacts, I've read a previous thread where there was something in settings about 'Your contact' which doesn't exist on my phone that I can find, I changed my billing name on my Google account which was the only instance of my previous name that I could find but that hasn't changed the wrong name on my mms attachments.\nHELP! PLEASE!",
