    "content": "I use a Bluetooth headset to listen to audiobooks and podcasts on my Pixel 3A. I cannot figure out how to choose which application has control over the pause start/stop button on the Bluetooth headset. Usually my audiobook app is in control, but sometimes the control switches to my podcast app. I can't find any place where I can set which app is will be used when I press the start stop button on my headset.\nI've tried different applications for audiobook and podcasts, none of them have a setting for this.",
