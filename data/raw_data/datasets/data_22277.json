    "content": "Purchasing a used Pixel 2 from someone today, and I donâ€™t really have a specific question.. more so looking for advice. Iâ€™ve researched the phone quite a bit but was hoping to hear from current Pixel 2 owners. How well the phone works & if itâ€™s declined at all since youâ€™ve purchased it. Also curious about battery life. All the reviews I read were written a year ago. The most recent review was made 5 months ago, so Iâ€™m hoping to hear some real life reviews from pixel 2 owners who are using the phone to this day. Any advice, comments or tips would be greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance. \n\nâ€” a loyal iPhone user nervous to switch to android ðŸ˜‹",
