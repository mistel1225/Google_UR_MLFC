    "content": "I have various information, such as my address and medications, on my Pixel 2XL.\n\nSettings > About phone > Emergency information\n\nMy details were added some time ago. The address and medical fields include line-feeds, meaning that each address line is on a separate line, and likewise for each medication. This is easy to read in an emergency (which is the whole point).\n\nNow, when I go to edit the information, I'm presented with everything on a long, single line, with spaces replacing the line-feeds. There is no way to insert line-feeds.\n\nHow do I keep the line-feeds? Or, to put it another way, how do I keep each medication on a separate line, the way that it used to be?\n\nThank you",
