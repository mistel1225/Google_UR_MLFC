    "content": "Audio and microphone stopped working about 1 month ago.\nIt stopped working on Phone (the local Google app), WhatsApp, Skype & HangOuts.\nI could still hear podcasts and music and YouTube. Though I did notice that bluetooth and wired headphones with microphones didn't appear to work.\n\nI tried Safe Mode.\nThe issue still occurred.\n\nI did a complete Factory reset of the phone.\nThe issue still occurred.\n\nI have only installed the apps that I use constantly, which includes WhatsApp and Hangouts.\nThe issue still occurs with bluetooth and wired headphones.\n\nIt appears to me that the microphone is broken. \nDo you agree?\nIs this fixable?\n\nThanks",
