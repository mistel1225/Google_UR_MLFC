    "content": "My Pixel Stand is not working.\nI ordered it to be purchased in November, and it arrived in my hands in mid-December. Everything was fine, but at the end of January it started to show an orange light, I disconnected and reconnected it and it kept working, but at the point it just stopped working.\nToday, when I plug it in and put my Pixel in, I get a \"Re-align your phone\" sign, and if I plug it in with the phone previously placed on it, the orange LED lights up. \nI have tried it with my Pixel Buds that used to charge perfectly and it doesn't work either.  What I can do?",
