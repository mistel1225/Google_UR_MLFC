    "content": "When I receive notifications and click on them to open the app and read the message or whatever (for text messages, emails etc), the notification does not then clear from the bar and I have to swipe it to clear it. It used to be that you could swipe it away to ignore it if you wanted, which was fine but if you read the notification, the bar would clear it.",
