    "content": "The power button on my Google Pixel 3 stopped working completely yesterday. I had my phone on the couch next to me and picked it up to check the time, when I pressed the power button to turn my screen on and nothing happened. I noticed there was no feedback click when I pressed it. I thought it might be a problem with my case so I took the case off but the button was still not giving feedback or turning my screen on. The button feels almost loose or mushy and just won't work no matter how hard I try pushing it. Is there anywhere I can get my pixel fixed without having to send it to Google to get it repaired? I bought it at Best Buy in late November so I still have the Google warranty but didn't buy a warranty from Best Buy.\n\nThanks",
