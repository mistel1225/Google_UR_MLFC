    "title": "Will Pixel 2 start with broken screen?",
    "content": "I have a Pixel 2 with a really bad battery and not any warranty. I have changed screens on phones before so I decided to try replacing the battery myself before buying a new phone. Everything went smooth until putting it back together when I noticed I had accidently cracked the corner of the lcd panel when removing it (and I can see some silicon there). I connected it anyway to see if it might show something. But the phone wont boot, I just feel a short vibration when pressing the power button, nothing else. If I connect it to a computer a pixel 2 device comes up, but it cant connect to it (probably wrong USB mode).\n\nSo my question is, do you know if this is normal behaviour that is wont boot without a screen? Tried with the screen unplugged and same behaviour. Just wonder if there I can be somewhat sure a replacement screen will fix the problem or if I might have damaged something else...\n\nBonus question: Can I somehow diagnose or control it from a PC with windows/linux? Or it's not possible without booting it?\n\nVery greatful for any help!",
