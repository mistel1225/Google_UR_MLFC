    "content": "My Pixel 1 (2016) purchased in May 2017 died on me this Tuesday morning. The battery was really poor in the last few months but I was living with it by just making changes to the settings and resetting to factory settings once.\nOn Tuesday, the phone charge was around 20% when I woke up, checked my texts and put it in the charger. After few minutes, when I took the phone to leave to work, phone was dead. Just blank screen and no LED indicators or vibration while trying to turn on. \nI tried holding the power button for more than 30 - 60 seconds, tried power button + volume down button multiple times but nothing happens. \nI let the phone charge for more than 12 hours and no change in the phone. \nThe phone display is blank, no LED notifications, no battery charging symbol. Tried multiple Google chargers.\nI am planning to replace the battery and try once this weekend. \nHowever, do you think it will be a battery issue or some other hardware failure?\nIf the battery is completely dead, should it at least show the red LED light?\nCan anyone help diagnose the problem?",
