    "content": "My Pixel 3a XL was running very smoothly and I had it set up and personalized the way I wanted it. Android 11 has wiped everything out and removed any personal or custom alarms, ringtones, and sounds. Apps keep crashing as soon as they are opened. Battery usage is ridiculous. \n\nI DON'T want to do a factory reset, I would like my personalizations and customizations back.\n\nIs there any way to uninstall this update and roll back to 10? From a simple search, it is easy to see that there was very little UX testing before this release. It is certainly a major step backward for Pixel phones when it looked like maybe Pixel was finally going to join the big leagues.",
