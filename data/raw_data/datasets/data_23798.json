    "content": "Within the last few weeks I have started having major issues with the quality of my phone calls.  When I answer or the other person answers there is a 5-20 second delay and it remains the entire length of the phone call.  Sometimes the voices echo or there is a digital sounds.  I'm at a lost on how to fix this and I've had this service for over a year now and just recently have been getting this problem.  I'm in coverage area, the majority of the time I'm on Wifi.  My phone is up to date.  I've reset it, put in and out of airplane mode, and reset app notifications, and restarted again.  I've even tried using the new beta google network with the VPN serivce.  My coverage area hasn't changes and my internet connection hasn't changed.  If I can't make/recieve phone calls properly I am going to be forced to turn off FI, never had this issue with past carriers and its a recent change with my FI service.  Phone is a pixel 2 XL, 128 GB.",
