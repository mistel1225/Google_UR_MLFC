    "content": "I don't sleep with my glasses on and my Pixel Stand is at the end of, not next to, my bed so I could really do with the clock that shows when my Pixel 3 XL is in the stand being HUGE. \n\nIdeally I'd like to have the phone on its side with pretty much the whole display taken up by the time display. \n\nIs this possible either via settings or another App?",
