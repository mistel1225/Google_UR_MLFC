    "content": "Have tried cleaning the port, different cables/chargers (as well as trying all cables/chargers on others phones, and they all work fine).\nApparently you can no longer telephone support, and have tried the claim web page that doesn't recognise the imei/serial number. Can't use chat, as you have to be a paying user. Believe I have exhausted all possibilities....?\nThanks.",
