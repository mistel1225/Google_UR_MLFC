    "title": "Struggling to adapt from years on iPhone -- help",
    "content": "I've used an iPhone since 2014, and as that goes, am heavily reliant on their ecosystem. I got the Pixel 4 XL last week and although I love the phone, I am heavily considering switching back to my iPhone XS Max simply because the little inconveniences of interacting with the people in my life who have iPhones. Photos I take look incredible on my phone, but when I text them to friends or family, they're pixellated and grainy. Any photos or videos I receive are of terrible quality. I can no longer video chat from my phone with the touch of a button -- there are all these steps to be able to contact people over video chat, completely taking the fun and ease out of the means of communication.\n\nIs there some kind of detox period? is there a guide somewhere for iPhone users?",
