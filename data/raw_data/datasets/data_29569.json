    "content": "Hello! \n\nMy 2016 Google Pixel suddenly started flashing a grey-white screen (similar to the black and white fuzzy screen on old TVs, such as this: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noise_(video)#/media/File:TV_noise.jpg).\n\nI was able to reboot it once, but it crashed again shortly after and now I can't get it out of the grey screen anymore at all. It is entirely unresponsive. Any help would be appreciated!\n\nValerie",
