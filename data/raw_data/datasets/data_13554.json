    "content": "Spotify (or any other music app like YT Music) can not override the Do Not Disturb mode from the Google Pixel 5.\n\nThe Playback option (Do Not Disturb / Apps Spotify Playback) is enabled and overrides the DND, but that doesn't work.\n\nAs soon as you enable the Media sounds option (Do Not Disturb / Alarms & other terruptions / Media sounds), it works fine.\n\nDoes this works as designed or is it a bug? ;)\nMaybe someone (me) wants to set the Pixel 5 in DND and wants to be not interrupted by any app but Spotify...\n\nThanks in advance!",
