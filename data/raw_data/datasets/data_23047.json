    "content": "Hi, so I'm trying to cast VR to my TV from my Google Pixel (Using Google Daydream) and I can cast non-VR just fine, and even cast my screen in a way where I have the two VR windows while using a VR app, but if I go into the Daydream Home, and click cast while inside Daydream (I tried both from previously casting my screen, and without) I get a black screen.\n\nThis is the whole reason I bought a Chromecast, so can someone please help me?",
