    "title": "So many bugs after Android 10 update",
    "content": "After Android 10 update, I lost most of my photos (tried the solutions online but didn't work). Many apps crash for no obvious reason (Play Store crashes, Photos crashes, even File crashes...). I thought Google would do something, but it has been one month and nothing happened. I'm extremely disappointed by Google. Bought an iPhone XR and will never switch back.",
