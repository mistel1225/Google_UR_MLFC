    "content": "In 2019, I purchased a brand new Pixel 3XL device. It developed battery issues. I asked you to repair my device under warranty, and you told me that you could only send a replacement device, not a repair on the original device. I expressed that I did not want a refurbished device and your agents kept reassuring me that refurbished devices work just like new ones. After multiple refurbished devices with the same issue, now I know it was a lie.\n\nBefore the pandemic, I contacted you again, regarding a manufacturer's error with my first refurbished replacement device and you sent me a second replacement device.\n\nThe replacement device had the same audio defect. I contacted you, and you sent me a replacement for the replacement.\n\nDuring the pandemic, I did not have a chance to test the device, nor did I have the means to pay for a replacement or risk exposing myself to COVID-19 by trying to return this device. However, I this replacement for the replacement has the same problem: the microphone makes a constant white noise and my recipient cannot hear me on voice calls. The phone cannot fulfill the original basic function of a phone: make phone calls where recipients talk to each other.\n\nDo you have any Pixel 3XL devices that do not have an audio problem?",
