    "title": "Connected Bluetooth Speaker says \"Headset\" Instead of Battery Status",
    "content": "In the quick setting I see that my Pixel is connected to a Bluetooth speaker and below it is says \"Headset\" with other devices I would find the battery status for the device. Which is more useful than the \"Headset\" information. Especially since I turned off to use the speaker for phone calls.\n\nHas someone an idea if there is a way to change that or is that a thing with the speaker?",
