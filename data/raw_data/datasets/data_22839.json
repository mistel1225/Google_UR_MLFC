    "content": "Hello,\n\nI'm a Dutch Google Pixel 3 user and I'm an Android developer as well. \n\nI've got a problem with the Google assistant Voice recognition, I am trying to get the \"hey google\" functionality working on my phone. unfortunately for a long time without result, which is crazy because after my knowledge it has always worked ..\n\nI have already contacted the Google support myself but I cannot get further here either. I have received links to the help site, but I had already completed these steps.\n\nthen I was advised to set the phone to factory settings, I did this and even this did not solve my problem.\n\nToday I've tried to change my language to English (VS) and said to the Google assistant: recognize my voice. Voila this worked, apparently Voice Match is not available for Dutch? Can someone confirm this?\n\nI've added some screenshots of my settings, as you can see the screenshot with Voice Match, only gives 1 option: add device, and this will search for devices on my network. But the device is my phone, which I'm using in that moment..\n\nI hope somebody can help me!\n\nThanks for reading,\nJoey",
