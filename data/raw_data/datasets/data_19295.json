    "content": "Recently I have realised that the optical image stabiliser on my rear wide lens has problems focusing. It has a very hard time trying to focus on objects, even when it does, it shakes violently. Only when I zoom in further and transition to telephoto does the problem stop. I have already tried clearing camera cache and rebooting in safe mode. But the problem still persists.",
