    "title": "Is there a fix for Pixel 4A battery/charging issue?",
    "content": "I recently unboxed my brand new pixel 4A.  When booting up for the first time the battery was just under 50% and successful completed the setup process.  Once the apps were downloading the battery instantaneously drained to 0% and shutdown.  I plugged the phone to charge and the phone initially would not charge.  After several hours of charging the phone started showing sporadic battery percentages.  For example the phone would show 85% charge once plugged in but then once unplugged it would mediately reboot and show 4% battery.  This problem has persisted for several days sometimes charging and sometimes not, spontaneously rebooting several times a day and showing sporadic battery charge percentages.  I am assuming the phone is a dud which is unfortunate as I have had two previous pixels with issues.  The most recent was the pixel 4 with 50% battery issue where regardless of how much it was charge the battery always showed 50%.  That phone eventually died and never would take a charge.  Before that was a pixel 3a where the phone would sometimes take a charge and sometimes not.  I assume that was a port issue.  I always use the Google provided chargers.  Love pixel devices but the hardware is really making me reconsider.",
