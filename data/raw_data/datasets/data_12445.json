    "content": "Camera app not working immediately after updating to Android 11. Will not even display a thumbnail after taking a picture. Camera app notification saying \"Processing HDR+\" that will only go away with a forced stop of the app. Video crashes the app. Tried a recently updated camera APK and thumbnail for photo appears for a couple seconds then vanishes. Turned off HDR+ but same result. Only way to save a picture is to take it within a text message then download to photos. Also discovered I am unable to take screenshots in any app or even the home screen. Get system error message \"Taking screenshots isn't allowed by the app or your organization\".",
