    "content": "Tried all the suggestions and nothing it just goes back to a capital G with a line moving under it! Went to AT&T they couldn’t do anything to unlock it, then went to a another cellphone company and they couldn’t get it unlocked. I was told you have a lock on it. \nWould loved to talk to someone about getting this phone fixed or replaced under my warranty!",
