    "content": "My pixel device was manufactured in Oct 2016. Once i face the issue, I had contacted the Google support and they had collected device from me and sent to the Service factory. Got response from service factory that device is working fine and again after 2 days same issue occurred. \n\nSent back the device to service factory through authorised support team and got back device mentioning that no issue was observed. Again faced the issue next day and sent back the device to factory. Now the technician is coming back telling that there is an issue with Motherboard and it needs to be changed and it will cost me around 20k.\n\nI had tried SAFE MODE, Factory reset. Issue was persistent in both the modes. Got some blogs where in USA, Google had replaced/repaired the devices with this issue.\n\nhttps://www.greenbot.com/article/3179145/google-responds-to-pixel-microphone-issues-with-official-replacement-program.html\n\nHope this replacement policy is supported in other parts of the world where people have bought Pixel phones. Not sure whether to go about for the motherboard change. Would be helpful if Google takes proper action not only in USA but for all the phones manufactured and issue reported. Please let me know how can i take up this issue - pay the 20k amount or could contact teams from Google.\n\nGoogle support team is not so helpful to check the issue occurrence and how to deal with its customer. Customer support was not upto mark which everyone expects to be in.",
