    "content": "Hi, I am trying to restore my google pixel tablet to factory setting using the Android repair option. However, it send me to a screen which says \"no command\", with the Android laying down on. Then, I hold the power button and volume up to progress to the next screen; this is when I end up on the \"waiting fastboot command screen\" without progressing. Anyone has a similar issue?",
