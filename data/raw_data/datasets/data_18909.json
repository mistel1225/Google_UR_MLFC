    "content": "This is the second of 3 phones I purchased that has had the ringer stop working.  The other was within the first month,  this has lasted 11 moths without a problem until about two weeks ago.  I have tried everything we tried on the first phone, at which time the young man we were working with said that it was bad and needed to be replaced.  Still under my year warranty, don't want to miss getting it fixed while still under warranty,",
