    "content": "Ever since I got my Pixel 3 XL about three months ago I have had issues with the At a Glance weather disappearing. It would disappear and reappear, but the lengths of time it is gone have increased and now it almost never shows the weather. This is really irritating because whatever weather they use is the only accurate one for my area. I've downloaded about 5 other weather apps and none of them were nearly as close. \n\nIs there anything that can be done? The Pixel XL I had before did not have these issues in the same location and it doesn't appear to be related to whatever beta issue that happened a few months ago.",
