    "content": "I have issues where my left ear hears better than my right ear, and so when using dual channels things just sound off. Is there a way to adjust sound levels in either ear? If not, I know this is a feature on samsung phones, so why has Google not allowed us to do this without rooting. When catering to disabilities, the only option is to make sound into one channel it seems. Why doesn't Google cater to the hearing impaired?",
