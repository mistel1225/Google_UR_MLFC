    "content": "So after the may security patch, my pixel 5 is crashing as soon as I either swipe left and click on an article on the homescreens Google now page, or I go to the Google app and it redraws and bring up the message to either force stop the app or wait as it's not responding. \n\nIt's really really buggy, some time when I swipe up into my recent apps the apps cards is way off centre, either all way to right or left.",
