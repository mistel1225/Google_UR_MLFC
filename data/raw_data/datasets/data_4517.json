    "content": "That's about it. I've contacted the carrier, and they haven't figured anything out yet either.\n\nTexting out and calling still work. Nothing comes in, with Messages or 3rd party apps.\n\nThe phone is also prone to an error where bluetooth and internet stop working. Usually it's fixed by some time in the fridge and restarting. I wonder if this texting thing could be a related hardware issue.",
