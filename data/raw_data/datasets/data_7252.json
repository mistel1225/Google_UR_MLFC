    "content": "After updating to Android 11 on my pixel 3xl, I am unable to make (says not connected to mobile network) or recieve any calls (straight to voicemail) - I can use data with no issues through.  Not a provider issue as my wife is on an iphone same network with no issues and I had no issue pre update.  Looked at all settings and cannot see what may have changed.  Any suggestions are appreciated..",
