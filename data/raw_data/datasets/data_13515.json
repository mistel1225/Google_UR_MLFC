    "content": "Hello.\nAfter I updated to Android 10, suddenly my phone starting became buggy.\nWhen I press the power button to lock my smartphone, wait at least 1~2 minute, and suddenly when press again to unlock, the phone stopped working, nothing works: vibration, screen, nothing.\nI need to press the button for 30 seconds to reboot my Pixel to continue using my smartphone.\n\nThis can be bypassed using a media player running in background. But this will drain the battery.\nI wait for Android 11 to see if everything is going to be fixed, but sadly, another problems came out.\nMy Pixel 2 XL cannot be recognized by Windows after I updated to Android 11, so, I cannot rollback to Android 9.0",
