    "content": "Hi, I'm a new Google Pixel 3 user, and have just deleted my photos and videos off my device for the first time having backed them up to google cloud at original size, but now when I look at the photos using my phone that are no longer saved to my phone and just saved in the cloud they are terrible resolution, all the benefits of having this great camera have disappeared! Is this normal and have I lost the quality of my images?",
