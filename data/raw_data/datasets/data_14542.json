    "title": "Phone \"Dies\" If Not On Charger, Even If Battery Shows Charged",
    "content": "This started sometime during the first week of October. My phone would be fully charged, and once I took it off the charger the phone would work as expected until the screen slept. Once the screen slept it would not wake/power on. I would have to plug it back into the charger, where the battery would show that there was still sufficient charge, and then I would be able to power it back up. \n\n-I checked for updates and am at the most current version. \n\n-I have tried letting the battery charge to 100% while powered off, and this works the best, but still perma-sleeps after an hour or two. (At least gets me to work to charge it again). \n\n-I don't think it is a battery issue since the battery seems to maintain its charge between being \"dead\" and plugging back into a charger. \n\n-I have not installed any new apps in the last few months; I have removed several after this started trying to see if it was a memory issue, with no success. \n\nI am at a loss for troubleshooting, but I do not want to do a factory reset unless absolutely necessary because of the pain of getting everything backed up.",
