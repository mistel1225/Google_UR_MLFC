    "content": "Wifi calling on pixel 3 xl no longer works, my carrier supports it and it is enabled. How to fix?\nSome additional information that might help: I got a roommate that I allow to access my wifi, but I didn't want him to know my password, so I reset my router with a new password and signed into my wifi again on my phone. Ever since the reset, my wifi calling no longer works. I live in a room with very little signal and now I can't have a conversation. Very annoying. Any ideas?",
