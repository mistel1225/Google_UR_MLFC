    "content": "I have rebooted my phone fully, sent it in to get fixed, etc. (When i got the phone back the issue wasn’t fixed, despite it being there 3 and a half weeks, even though the maximum time is 2 weeks). I got it back last week and it was fine apart from the camera app still not working and the back camera not working on other apps. But I updated my phone yesterday (big mistake) and now snapchat won’t work, the torch doesn’t work and neither does youtube. I can’t even log into snapchat as I tried uninstalling it, also a very big mistake. The people at car phone warehouse said they could replace it and I was waiting for s replacement, and went in yesterday to ask when it’ll be in. Turns out you have to pay for s replacement even though I’ve only had the phone just over a year. Could someone please advise on this and whether google can even replace this phone as I’m fed up with trying to fix an issue that even the google team cannot fix.",
