    "title": "Instructions to change notifications for Messages totally inaccurate. No Settings option????",
    "content": "Not always getting Notifications of Messages (sometimes dot and audio notification don't happen). Tried to change. All online Help refers to list options that DO NOT APPEAR under More. within Messages app ... as if written for a different phone other than Google Pixel 3a. The list options under More are Details; Search; Archive; Delete; Help & Feedback ... and as I say, the Help instructions are wrong.\n\nUnder I've also checked Apps and Notifications under Settings and found no help there.\n\nAlso checked Sound. Call volume, Ring volume and Alarm volume are all on (I'm guessing Alarm volume is the same as Notification sound, but no guidance is offered). Media volume  isn't on; I'm guessing that's for playing music and radio. Nothing for adjusting Notification sounds.\n\nI'm updated to the latest Android version (10). Any ideas what is going on?",
