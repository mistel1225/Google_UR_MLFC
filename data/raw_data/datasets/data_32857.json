    "content": "Purchased the Pixel 3, and the actual phone function was awful if it worked at all. Took it back and got a new handset hoping it was just a bad phone. Nope! The call quality and function is horrible or non-functioning. I am beyond frustrated that I can not use my phone as a PHONE!!!!",
