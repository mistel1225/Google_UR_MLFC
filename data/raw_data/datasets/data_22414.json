    "content": "Hi\nI have a Pixel 2 XL and I have been experiencing problems with my camera app.\nIt keeps crashing and it doesn't seem to a hardware problem. Because it works for a short time after a re-installation. Today, for example, I received the March update and the camera worked for a short time after the reboot but now it is crashing again.\n\nSteps taken to solve this problem:  \nBefore the march update of today I tried a factory reset twice!  Once through the recover menu and the second time through the GUI.\nI tried also cleaning the cash of the camera app\nRebooting the device many times\nClosing and restarting the camera app.\n\nNow I think the problems started after installing the update before the march update. I am not sure if this is cause but it might.\nAnyway.... I need help! I miss using my camera... \n\nThanks in advance for the advice.\nKind regards \nJose Hoyos",
