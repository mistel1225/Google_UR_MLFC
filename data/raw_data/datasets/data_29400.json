    "content": "Pixel 3XL seems to have given up only after 3 months. System UI not responding, wont wake up when you pick it up, unlock via fingerprint or pressing the buttons. Usually have to wait between 12-30 seconds for the screen to come on. Vibrate no longer works either. Have wiped and reset to factory settings 3 times, no improvement.",
