    "content": "All my contacts have vanished. Yesterday I attempted to restore using contacts.google.com where it indicated I had 445 contacts. Restored to 24 hour previous and nothing happened. Today I tried again and it says I only have 77 available. Adding contacts new will not save. Based on my searches this is not an uncommon event. Where are my contacts!!!!???!!!!",
