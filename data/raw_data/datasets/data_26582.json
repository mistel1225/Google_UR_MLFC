    "content": "I was capturing selfie with just lifx led strip light on. Colour was set to purple. Selfie with night sight mode was like a photo with blue filter applied. In normal mode, screen changed to bright white for few seconds and app crashed. In second attempt in normal mode, again the screen changed to bright white but no crash and picture was better than the one captured in night sight mode. It's happening all the time in that light condition.",
