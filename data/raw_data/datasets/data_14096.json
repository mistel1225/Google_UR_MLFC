    "content": "On my keyboard input method I have two options: Russian Gboard and Google voice typing. When I open on-screen keyboard setting I have two options Gboard (Russian) and Google voice typing. I am not sure why my input is in Russian and I am not able to change it to English (or any other language). I do not have Russian added as a language in my languages on Gboard or anywhere else. Why is it set up this way, am I able to change it to English?",
