    "content": "I have been trying to get a pixel 4a delivered from past few days and thanks too Google for opting a hopeless ecommerce in India which has no stocks all the time she not delivering the phone all the time to multiple pin codes all accrors the country , this issue will definitely impact on the sales of Google in India considering the one plus Nord stocks on Amazon , please choose a good ecommerce site for the sale . Flipkart is being too smart my not selling the phone while there is a discount offered \nHoping to see some changes and a stock refill soon \nGoogle needs to take some action with this issue \nIt gets frustrating to wait so long and still not be able to order the phone",
