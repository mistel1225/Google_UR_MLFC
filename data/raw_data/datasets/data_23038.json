    "content": "I accidentally upgraded to the newest patch when i restarted my phone. dumb mistake to do. Ever since, my LTE connection has been having issues with apps. However, when I speed test if, I get 50mb/s download speeds. When I try to stream youtube, netflix, or open a webpage, it is really slow. I can't watch anything. web pages take 30 secs to load. everything worked fine before the update. I tried resetting network connections, no luck.",
