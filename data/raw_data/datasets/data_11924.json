    "content": "I've tried cleaning the Sim card, reset network settings, prayed over it, threw it across the room backwards over my right shoulder 3 times and my left one twice, performed an exorcism over it, cried about it, got counseling to cope with the fact I may be forced to take a bite out of the apple like eve did. Google please don't make me jump ship. Help please.\n\nWe are also having issues receiving and sending texts. We get some messages days or weeks later and I've installed textra and switched back and forth to get it to try and detect settings better it seemed to have helped some. Time will tell. \n\nReset phone app, cleared cache, set to wifi preferred set it back to cellular preferred, it does it with Bluetooth, on speaker phone, incoming and outgoing calls. Did 12 factory resets while standing and my head. Got drunk and begged it for forgiveness me and asked it to love me again and it's obvious I think it's ready to divorce me.\n\nAlso noticed screen burn in on both devices where the time and cellular signal is pay attention when the background is white it's pink time etc when switching between apps. Etc.",
