    "content": "I am having the issue in using the phone at home using WiFi.\nI am having the same Fibre network for more than 7 years and all of my other devices, including TV, laptops and one iPhone are connected to this WiFi  network and working fine. Connection is Excellent. Also, I'm having 2 routers and the problem it's on both of them.\n\nWhen it comes to my phone, apps like Mobile.de, Apple Music or Twitter does not work at all or loading very very very slow when using WiFi. When I'm switching to mobile data, everything is working fine.\n\nCould not able to figure out the issue. Tried the following:\nRestarted home WiFi router, Forgot home WiFi from my phone and reconnected, I uninstalled the apps and reinstalled, Cleared data and cache (cookies), Restarted Phone, Tried to fix through Broadband provider which they reset my network.\n\nYou can see the problem in this video:\n\n https://streamable.com/ykxweg\n\nNothing worked. Tried searching in forums for solution, where some people had similar WiFi not connecting to specific app issues, but no fix solutions.\n\nIf any of you guys know some solution for this please suggest\n\nMany Thanks reading the big post.",
