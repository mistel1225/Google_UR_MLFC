I have Airtel 4G enabled sim card i am not able to use VOLTE wit airtel sim card this irritates me a lot especially when i am on call i am not able to use my 4G Internet, while you get so many cheap phones in market which supports this, i feel shame on google they are still not fixing it with a minor update,  i have received latest security patch of 5th June 2019 and still on same issue.  \n\nWile it works with Jio Network \n\nI have uploaded a screenshot that display Enhanced 4G LTE Mode is misiing when i put Airtel Sim Card\nand also with with jio simcard where i can see that option.\n\nPlease Fix this at earliest.\n\nDisappointing by Google \n\n\n\nScreenshot using JIO sim card\n\n\n\nScreenshot using Airtel sim card",
