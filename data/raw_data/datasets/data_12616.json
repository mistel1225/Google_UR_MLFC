    "title": "Pixel 4a: cannot have 4 app icons in a row, to have bigger icons on small phone?",
    "content": "Pixel 4a (Android 11) is a small phone, which is MAIN reason why my father (70 years old) has bought it.\nHe had an old samsung, same size. He didn't want a Xiaomi like me, too big, even if it is half price.\nOn his old samsung and on all Xiaomi even with much bigger screens, it is very easy to have only 4 icons in a row: it allows to have much bigger icons, more legible, with significant space between app icons (less risk to select wrong icons for elders with hands that shake a bit or person with big fingers).\nEven on my 6,7\" Xiaomi I chose for myself to have only 4 icons in a row.\nI have been able to set the Pixel 4a exactly as he wants, but could not find a way to have only 4 icons in a row in bottom bar. \nIt seems pretty basic feature to have 4 icons in a row: is there a hack to have it with built-in launcher?\nIf not it should be on top of priority list for updates...\nI do not want to install other launcher like Nova, because there are some side effects and it would mean loose some nice features from built-in launcher.\nThanks for any help...",
