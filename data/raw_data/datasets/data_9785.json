    "content": "hi - can you help/have you experienced something similar?\nI recently bought new Pixel 5 and followed instructions to transfer data and apps from my old Pixel 2. \nI used the transfer cable.\nSome, but not all, of the apps came across.\nThere are a large number still not come across - like 30+. Which is too many to reload manually.\nI've updated phone software, all apps were bought from Google Play Store.\n(Is it because I have two gmail accounts? Or is it because some apps are a couple of years old?)\nAny help, appreciated. \nthanks\nIf you could keep your help simple, no 'curse of knowledge' in the way, that'd be great. thanks.\nChris",
