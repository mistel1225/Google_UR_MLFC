    "content": "I have Pixel 4 XL. After a fall on the floor when it's off, I fail to turn it on. I have tried many times, and every time the Google logo and then the spinning G appear a few seconds after I press and hold the power button, but quickly the screen turns black. I have never been able to turn it back on.",
