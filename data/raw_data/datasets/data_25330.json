    "content": "I Have the doodle wallpaper on, and brightness set to 100, I'm in a app and I get back to the home screen pressing back ( not by swiping the home button) so if I exit a app by pressing back and get to the home screen my screen flickers on the bottom and top very briefly, they look like waves.  I'm wondering is my phone broke or does everybody have this problem somebody please let me know",
