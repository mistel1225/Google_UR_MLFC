    "content": "Hello, the device might have been exposed to some humidity and it works properly but every time the phone reboots the hour is set to 21:16. Could this be a hardware issue? Another thing to have in account is that the phone currently has no sim in it and I can't put one right now, I couldn't connect to WiFi either, it the wifi if it's essential I might be able to connect but the sim no. I really need to know if this could be caused by humidity and what component would be damaged, if it's possible.(I say this because I've had some bad experience, not from google btw, but if a hard reset didn't help they said it was the mother)\nAnother thing to note is that the screen is quite cracked.\nThank you for the support\nPD: the device it's not actually mine, I would take care of it as gold",
