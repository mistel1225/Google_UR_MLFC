    "title": "Pixel 3a XL: Key presses no longer recognized by automated menu systems",
    "content": "When I call an office or a business, I can't get through the menu system where I have to press a number to continue. When I press the key, I can hear the tone, but the menu system behaves as if no key was pressed. This seems to happen regardless of who I'm calling. My wife's Pixel 3a doesn't have this problem. What could be going on?",
