    "content": "Chrome and Android System Webview will not update on my Pixel 3. I have tried every recommended solution (clearing caches and forcing stop/disable on Play Store, Play Services, Chrome. Uninstalling, restarting, etc) from multiple threads, but nothing has worked.\n\nClicking on Update in Chrome app seems to do nothing. Clicking on Update in Android System Webview just circles on Pending forever but doesn't seem to do anything.\n\nCan anyone recommend how to solve this?\n\nI have been spending many hours/days trying to get this resolved. Very frustrated. ðŸ˜©\n\nThanks so much!",
