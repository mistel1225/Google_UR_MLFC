    "content": "My Google home mini disconnects from my Bluetooth after 2-3 minutes of being paired. Also when I ask google home mini to disconnect from Bluetooth it says it can’t turn off Bluetooth. Also I’m not sure if this is related to the Bluetooth issue but when I ask google to turn off my smart lights it does so but also says “can’t connect to lights at this moment.” Is there a connectivity issue with my device?",
