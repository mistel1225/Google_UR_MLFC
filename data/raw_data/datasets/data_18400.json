    "content": "I updated my phone when I saw it was available. Upon waking up and trying to use my phone, it now take from 10-15 seconds to turn the screen on. This happens with both the power button and finger print unlock. I have restarted my phone multiple times to no avail. I have no installed or uninstalled anything since the update.",
