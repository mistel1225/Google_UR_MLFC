    "content": "Hi all, I have a weird 'oily' smear on my screen. (see attached images)\n\nI have a gorilla glass screen protector, which has been on my Pixel 5 since new. The other day I noticed this weird oily effect - it is on the screen, not the protector, and growing. Before I take the glass off, any idea what this is or what could be causing it?",
