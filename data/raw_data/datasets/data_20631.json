    "content": "I have been told that at least on the 3 model a Google Edition imei starts with 99, is there a place where this info is available for all pixels? A list by model?\nMy pixel 2 starts w/ 35 and its a Google edition.\nThere is so much confusion, so many sellers who don't understand what you are wanting to know when it comes to bootloader, they really shouldn't be selling phones, at least not Pixels.\nThanks in advance",
