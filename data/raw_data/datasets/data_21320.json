    "title": "Pixel 3a XL Unable to Be Turned On, Repeatedly buzzing. Power button has no effect.",
    "content": "My phone was regrettably run through the washing machine. It's been dried in a bag of rice, and is currently dry. Every second or so it emits a \"buzz--buzz\" which I can do nothing about. The power button does nothing. Occasionally the buzzing will stop for a second, change in pitch, and then resume as \"normal\". \n\nIdeally there is a way to turn it on and fix this.",
