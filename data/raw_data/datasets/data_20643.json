    "content": "My Pixel 2's screen will not turn on. The device is still working as I was able to receive a phone call and answer it just by blindly swiping around. I can feel the vibrations from finger print, active edge, etc ... but the screen just won't turn on.\n\nThere were no drops of the phone, it getting wet, or anything like that prior to it not working any more. The batter was at ~10% and I put it on the charger. Came back ~2 hours later and the screen wouldn't turn on any more. \n\nI have tried to hard power cycle the phone and it seems to have reset, but did not fix anything.",
