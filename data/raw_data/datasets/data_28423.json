    "content": "I dropped my pixel 3a and the screen cracked (despite having a screen protector). The problem is, while I bought the phone in the US, I now live in Sweden, and I can't figure out how to get it fixed here, if I even can. Going through the customer service webpage to try to find out just leads me through a loop as the contact link ultimately leads me back to the same page. Is there even a way to just email customer service?",
