    "content": "My phone is intermittently failing to connect calls properly. After restarting the phone, I'm able to make & receive calls fine, but after a few hours, any calls coming in or out appear to connect but have no audio coming in or out. It's getting pretty absurd that I can't actually use the phone as a phone... Anyone else had this issue and found a fix/have suggestions?",
