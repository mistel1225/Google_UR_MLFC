    "content": "My Pixel XL has disappeared. I'm 90% sure it was stolen and turned off before I had the chance to use the locator. Here's the twist, I know the fucker who stole it and he completely denies it. There's a slight chance I dropped it in the snow and the cold made my device shut down. If there's any way I can check shutdown logs remotely, it will let me know if it was shut down manually or if it was booted down because of the cold. Anyone know how to help me?",
