    "content": "I have send my faulty phone 2 months ago and I still have no replacement phone! The customer service is giving lots of excuses, some is following up, the shipping company have not answer in a month, they are conducting an investigation in the warehouse...BS! The shipping company answered me in less than 4 hours, and I don’t care what is happening in the warehouse, Google have the proof via the tracking number that they have both my faulty phone and the replacement device and still, nothing! So I have no phone for the past 2 months! Nightmare!",
