    "content": "I cracked the screen months ago but there was no problem since then. Yesterday the screen flickered a little bit and then stopped working. I can turn on the device, and it somewhat response to the fingerprint sensor, but doesn't seem to log in. I think I need to get a new screen but I don't know where I should do that or if I should send it into Google somewhere. Please advise!",
