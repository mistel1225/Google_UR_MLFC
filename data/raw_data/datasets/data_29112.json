    "content": "What good is a PIN number for SCREEN LOCK, when the GOOGLE PIXEL TALKBACK speaks the PIN NUMBER for SCREEN LOCK OUT LOUD so everyone can hear the pin number?  I just hope, the KEYPADs at the grocery stores don't start speaking out loud for accessibility, because then the pin numbers will be outloud, outside of the ears of artificial intelligence, which hears the pin numbers!  \n\nIs Google able to read my BRAIN, because sometimes I think Google is hearing what I am thinking, which I actually find believable, but I can only say this here!  So can Google make an unlock screen where I think the numbers & my screen unlocks?  It would not be much different than the mechanical arms, where the human brain tells the arm to move!  Can I have a THINK button to THINK my computer on, without talking to it?    That would be really cool!  \n\nHow come Google TalkBack SPEAKS OUT LOUD the SCREEN LOCK NUMBERS?",
