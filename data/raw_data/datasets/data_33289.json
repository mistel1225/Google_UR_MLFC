    "content": "Smart Lock's trusted locations is problematic. I have set my home to be a trusted location. When I go to use the phone I have to use a password or fingerprint about 70% of the time. My home doesn't move around a whole lot.\n\nI had seen someone say that the Home settings for Smart Lock doesn't always work due to a mismatch between Google's map location of a street address and the actual location not perfectly matching. It suggested editing the location by moving the pointer in the map slightly. I did this, and I still have issues.",
