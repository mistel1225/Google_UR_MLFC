    "content": "I'm using Google Pixel XL and my car Bluetooth supports A2DP / 4.2 + EDR bluetooth. I can connect flawlessly but no media is being played. Sometimes the sound managed to be played but it stuttered terribly. I figured that it's not my car bluetooth problem because my iPad and other Apple devices work perfectly fine. I have done everything including reset my network settings, unpaired and re-paired, changed the audio codec, changed the AVRCP, restart my phone and so on!!!\n\nI read that I should try to enable the A2DP however it is impossible to do with my phone as the phone will restart and the button would be greyed again.\n\nI have other wireless speaker and it can connect and play music flawlessly after pairing it with my Pixel XL. I have no idea why my phone can't play any media through my car Bluetooth. It's extremely frustrating. Please help",
