    "title": "April 2020 Update Destroyed my Pixel 3 functionality",
    "content": "After the update restart, my Pixel 3 lost all of my screen saver & wallpaper settings.  Fingerprint lock stopped working.  Home button at the bottom won't do anything (I can't see open tabs or go to home screen from the button).  Swiping down from the top won't show more than the first line of phone settings (so I can't see phone options without actually opening the phone settings app).  \n\nI've tried restarting the phone.  I've tried just waiting and hoping the issue will go away.  I've tried starting in safe mode.  Nothing is working.  I haven't done a factory reset yet because that will be so annoying but at this point, that's my next step if I don't hear any other good ideas.  I just want my phone back.  \n\nMy phone went from running perfectly to becoming a worthless piece of junk with a single restart.  Help!",
