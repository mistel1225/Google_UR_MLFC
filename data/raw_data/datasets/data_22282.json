    "content": "Hi – I hope you are all safe and healthy!! I am currently in Thailand and my phone mic is not working. Can’t make a phone call since no one can hear me. Top mic works (can record audio on video), but bottom mic does not. A few weeks ago, C to C charging (OEM) stopped working. Not sure if they are related or happened at the same time – I didn’t realize about the mic until 2 days ago.\n  I’ve tried safe mode and a hard reset (total nightmare!). And nothing is fixed. Google REFUSES to help at all.\n“I see that the device is covered under device protection, however as you are outside US, I´m sorry we do not have the possibility to replace the device. Sorry for the inconvenience” Good thing I’ve been paying for that device protection for 2+ years. I am so angry at Google! In a world when someone actually has the means and resources to help, when there is so much we cannot, they choose not to.\n\nI’m stranded and can’t make a phone call. Any ideas on what I can do?",
