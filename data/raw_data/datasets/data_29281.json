    "content": "I have a Gmail and 2 outlook email accounts set up on my pixel 3a. Since getting the phone over a week ago nine of my emails from either accounts will deleted. Once the phone syncs they reappear and it is driving me mad! I have cleared the cache and cleared the storage and also deleted and reinstalled the email accounts. I have also completed a factory reset. \n\nAre there any other suggestions please?",
