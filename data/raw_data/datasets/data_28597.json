    "content": "Here is my experience and why Google has driven away a good customer since nexus 4.\nMy pixel 2 camera bricked the first week of July. After many calls, and referencing this thread, I finally got a rep to understand. He checked my MEID and suggested the phone was stolen. After 3 attempts getting proof of purchase from VZW, I finally revived it three weeks later.\nI called Google , emailed the proof.if purchase and received and Rma and a guarantee of a 5 day turn around... 7 days later no phone. My business requires a cell phone .\nI stated a chat with google to get a basic update., An hour later and 7 chat chat transfers I got shipping. The rep told me they were out of phones and had no idea when I would receive a replacemnt. What , no phones ? No I'm SOL and going to have to buy one tommorow as I can't go without a phone for anothernweek. Lesson learned , no more Google hardware for me . They say it was an update that bricked my camera but won't provide a replacement or even a timeline of when one will be shipped , while they have my phone for 4 days now... No solution except lesson learned. Google will not stand behind their product ( a bad one at that). Google.does care about you as.a customer... Dont send yours in and expect normal reasonable virtuous service.. how can such a sophisticated company be so unorganized.\n\n\nWaring.",
