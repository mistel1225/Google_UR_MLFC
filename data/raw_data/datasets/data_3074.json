    "content": "Hi,\n\nI live in France and i have a Google Pixel XL (bought in UK) that stopped charging. I would like to get it repaired but through the \"repair\" process i am forced to confirm that i agree to delete the content of the phone.\n\nThe reason why i want to repair it is actually reovering some content that was not properly back-up.\n\nI need to understand if Google can fix my phone without erasing and how to do that.\n\nAs a long-time google user, I am a bit disappointed by the fact that is totally impossible to get in touch with the assistance.\n\nThanks for your help",
