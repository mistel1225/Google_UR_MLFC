    "content": "When I receive an incoming call to either my Pixel 2 XL or my wife receives a call on her Pixel 2 the incoming call UI displays. We attempt to answer by swiping up, The screen goes white and one would assume it is answering, it does not. It will then again display the incoming phone UI looking again to be swiped up to answer. But by this time the caller will either be sent to voicemail or will have already hung up.\n\nEdit: It appears after the last June security update the issue was resolved (or at least I have not seen it reappear as of yet)",
