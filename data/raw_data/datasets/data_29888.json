    "content": "I have a 1st Gen Pixel. I was taking photos today and noticed that several of them are not showing up in the Google Photos app. I took about 30 pictures within about 30 - 45 minutes. I don't think I changed anything on my phone or in any app while I was taking the pictures. Now, only about 20 of the pics are showing in the Photos app. \n\nIf I open the camera app, and hit the little circle in the bottom right corner to see prior pics, the photos are there. But they are not in the photos app. I tied looking under the Camera Roll folder in the app, and they are not there either.",
