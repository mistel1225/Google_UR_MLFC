    "content": "I am so confused by the photos app. What is on my phone? What is backed up by Google? Why are there all of these albums automatically created by Google? I will be unable to find a picture and then find it in a random album that I did not create. The albums that I created are in a totally different section.\n\nI guess what I am looking for is a step-by-step on how to use this app effectively. I go into it and get completely overwhelmed.",
