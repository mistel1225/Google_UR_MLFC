    "content": "I am setting up a new Pixel 5 and am trying to open Chrome tabs from my previous phone. The previous Phone is a Samsung Note8. Both phones are currently set to sync Chrome tabs, however, I cannot open the tabs from one device on the other. I have followed multiple how-to's but have had no success. Can someone help me open my tabs from the Note8 on my new Pixel 5?\n\nThanks in advance.",
