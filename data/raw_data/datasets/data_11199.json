    "content": "The main camera on my phone (not the front facing camera) isn't working very well at all. It keeps going blurry and wavey when I try to take pictures or videos and I can't do anything to stop it. It isn't a dirty lense or just being out of focus and I've tried deleting and reinstalling the camera app and that didn't solve it either. Please can someone help me as the main reason I bought this phone was for the camera ðŸ˜«",
