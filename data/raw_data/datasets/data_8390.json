    "content": "We're migrating my wife's Samsung S7 to a Pixel 4a. On her Samsung she used a Samsung email app to directly access a Netzero.net email account, but the Samsung email app didn't migrate and we can't find one in the app store to run on the Pixel. Without using Gmail (she wants to keep her Gmail separate), which email app could be used to set up POP3 and SMTP for accessing her NetZero account? Instructions on the NetZero website do not appear to be current.\n\nWe've already tried BlueMail with the same POP3 and SMTP port settings, but it can't connect.\n\nThank you for any guidance. (We won't be migrating from Netzero, due to its use for a business account.)",
