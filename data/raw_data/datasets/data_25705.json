    "content": "I am trying to take down notes on Google Keep but when I talk, it doesn't register sound, and thus turns off. I could be dictating 5 bullet points, stop for a breath, and it stops recording but does not write down what I'm saying. Or, I could be mid-word and it just stops recording with nothing written down. I'm sure you can imagine that it's quite frustrating. Please let me know how I can troubleshoot this!",
