    "content": "My husband's phone (we both have pixel 2s) is going to be paid for entirely this month. Suddenly his phone crashed this morning and won't load past the starting up screen. The furthest we have gotten is the \"updating\" screen and that was only once. It's very warm when charging. He didn't drop it or anything, it just suddenly stopped working this morning. Apps early this morning started crashing so it's stuck at the booting screen when you restart it. Any help?",
