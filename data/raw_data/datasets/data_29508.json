    "content": "I have been using the Pixel phone since launch and just bought the Pixel 3 phone. While the phone itself is wonderful, I can't help but notice that the curvature at the corners of the display changes when booting up. I later confirmed this on https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/10/19/18001278/google-pixel-3-screen-corners-rounder-software-display-change.\nWhile I understand that Google might find the new changes better, I just prefer the original one. The changed curvature just make the battery and time display unaesthetically closer to the top of the display. \nSince I bought the phone, I would like to be allowed to use every pixel in the screen instead of having some of them locked by Google.\nPlease just give us the option to decide for ourselves if we want to have this feature.",
