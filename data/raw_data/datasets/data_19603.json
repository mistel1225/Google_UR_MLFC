    "content": "So I got my new Google Pixel 3a like one week ago, I haven't installed anything on it, I just took it from the box, turned it on and started playing with it and I noticed this issue. The scrolling is really not working well, you can see it in the video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZhFt6M7IO0\n\nYou can see in the video that horizontal scrolling is not working well and it blocks everything. Any ideas on what could be causing the issue? It's a brand new phone, I am assuming this is not normal behaviour.\n\nThank you very much.",
