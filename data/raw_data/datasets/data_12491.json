    "content": "Hi, \nI was hoping someone here knows of a solution. I've tried a few things now and seen a lot of this issue across the internet and am still no further. I have tried contacting support but they don't seem to know the answer. \n\nA couple of days  ago randomly my wired earphones (the original google ones) and the adapter with regular earphones, are not recognised by the phone. Sometimes i can get a 'Charging connected device via USB notification' but that's about it. Sound just continues to play out loud. However, am having no problems with charging.  The device is almost 2 years old but there doesn't seem to be a particular reason for this starting. \n\nSo far I have tried, gently cleaning the port, rebooting the phone, a factory reset, deleting recent apps/booting in safe mode, disabling assistant through headphones and checking that the  USB - audio routing is off. \n\nHas anyone found another fix, really dont want to be stuck without music ?!!",
