    "content": "I came out of Windows Phone environment and am new to Android. This is taking way too long to learn.  I keep accidentaly turning stuff off or on. The on-phone tips are barely useful as they are too general.  It's really frustrating.  An in depth manual would be a God send.  Reading these tiny screens gives me a headache after a while.\n\nWhy isn't there a manual?",
