    "content": "I've had the 3a for about 10 months now. I routinely back up my photos to my computer via USB, selecting 'File transfer/Android Auto' on the phone.\nThis stopped working about a month ago. The computer beeps as if it's seeing something but calls it 'unknown'. The phone settings are all correct. No window opens for the phone, nothing happens except for a computer beep.\nHow do I get file transfer back?\nThx,\nEd\n\nPixel 3a with Android 10, now 11, up to date.\nWindows 10 build 2004, up to date.",
