    "title": "How do I set apps default sounds to \"App Provided Sounds\" in Android 10 on Pixel 4 XL?",
    "content": "About a week ago I got the Pixel 4 XL and overall I love it.  The only big issue that I have is that my notifications for every single app are the same.  I know how to change the notification sounds, so no I don't need advice on how to do that; but selecting \"Default\" or going through my ringtones and picking one of them is not what I am looking for.\n\nOn Pie, apps like Snapchat, Facebook, Messenger, etc all had the option for \"App Provided Sounds\", which meant they each defaulted to their own unique (and embedded) sounds (like Facebook's iconic \"pop\" sound).\n\nIs the lack of this feature from 10 intentional?  Is it a bug?  Or am I just missing the right steps to accomplish this?\n\nI do love this phone, but it is frustrating not being able to identify what the notification without having to look at the phone each time.\n\nNO THIS IS NOT A DUPLICATE, there is another similar thread, but it is LOCKED without a Solution - which is useless if you actually want resolution to this issue.",
