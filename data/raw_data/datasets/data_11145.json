    "content": "I have had issues with sending and receiving MMS on my pixel 3a ever since I bought it. I have tried setting the right APN. Checked all the settings in my network and messages. Still no success. I am close to changing my phone but want to make this one work. The same sim card is able to receive MMS on my old device.\n\nWould appreciate help with this.",
