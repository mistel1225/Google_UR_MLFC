    "content": "My pixel 2 phone have an echo problem. Any receiver of all calls hears his self back.\nIf i used the speaker, there is no echo heared by the receivers.\nIf I turn off the speaker, the receiver hears an echo.\nI have updated to the latest android , still problem exist.\nI do not know if it is hardware or software issue. Problem disappears when I use speaker mode on my side.\nI switched to safe mode and got the same results.\nI've gone through all the troubleshooting steps on the phone with Google support. No safe mode doesn't help.",
