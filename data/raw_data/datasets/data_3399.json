    "content": "My wife and I got 2 new Pixel 5 phones when they came out.\nHave had no issues until yesterday, when all of a sudden my wife's phone lost her connection to the cellular network. My phone continues to be connected and have no issues conncting.\nWe are in Kelowna, BC on the Shaw mobile network.\nWe have a weak signal in our area, and often are in Wi-Fi calling mode.\nIf I turn off \"automatically select network\" on that phone, it can see 6 networks (2 Shaw LTE & 3G, and 4 others)\nHowever, it will not connect if I try to connect to any of them.\nShaw support up to this point has been useless - they are saying someone will get back to us in a few days.\nIn the meantime, my wife's phone can't receive phone calls (goes straight to voicemail) - even with Wi-Fi calling turned on. We can exchange SMS messages between our phones, but she can't send to anyone else?\nCould this be a hardware issue, or are we at the mercy of Shaw at this point?\nWe were going to head to the store for a SIM swap to see if that helps.\nAny ideas greatly appreciated.",
