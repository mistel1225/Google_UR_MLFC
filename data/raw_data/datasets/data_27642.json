    "content": "Yesterday my wifes pixel 3 lost its operating system. Her phone is now stuck in fastboot mode. \nWhen I Access fastboot by pressing volume down & power I get the options for recovery/bootloader/barcode/power off/start.\n\nThe only progression is to the barcode page. All other option take me back to warning screen pictured.\n\nI am unable to run recovery, power off or start fast boot.\n\n\nI have tried holding down power button for 30 seconds but it just leads me back to below page.\n\nI've spoken to the service provider EE & their technical support could not help after 30mins of trying.\n\nThis phone was purchased on 31st Dec 2018 so is under warranty.\n\nCan anyone advise on what I should do next or how to start a warranty claim with Google?\n\nThanks,\nAndy",
