    "content": "I can't connect to any Bluetooth device with my phone, I did buy it off eBay so I don't know if this is just a problem because it's a refurbished phone. but this is a big problem for me, I rely on this heavily to connect to Bluetooth devices, and the fact that it won't connect to any Bluetooth devices has me very concerned. It won't connect to speakers, or vehicles or headphones or anything.",
