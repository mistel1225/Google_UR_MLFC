    "content": "I went through the process to buy the new Google pixel 5. I was going to do the payment plan, which I thought was going to be the easiest part. I got to the page for the Google credit application. Which I assumed after finishing, I had been approved. It took me to the checkout page, but the total for me buying the phone was the full amount. Confused I cancelled my order, and here I am now. Was I not approved for the credit application, or was I supposed to wait for something? If I did something wrong, what do I do when I go through this process again? If you have any ideas please let me know.",
