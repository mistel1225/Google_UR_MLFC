    "title": "Google shipped Unlocked Bootloader on refurb 4xl with an error message",
    "content": "Shipped as a replacement.  Shows the following:  The bootloader is unlocked and software integrity can not be guaranteed.  Any data stored on the device may be available to attackers.\n\nI chatted with Google and they sent me a second Refurb.  When it got here it wouldn't power up and just shows a flashing ? on the battery icon.\n\nI chatted again and the rep escalated it, but said I would have to wait for an email.  Nothing has come.  I'm a school teacher, trying to do remote teaching and stuck without a phone.\n\nShould I consider just using the first one with the unlocked bootloader?  It seems like we have a quality control problem with the refurbs.  Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.",
