    "content": "It seems like every so often, the phone stops listening for voice commands. Saying \"Hey/Okay Google\" doesn't work and neither does the \"Now Playing\" feature. The only fix that I have found is to restart the device but the problem keeps coming back after a few days. I spoke to support and they had me go through the process of having the device relearn my voice and updating the Google App but none of this has worked. Anyone else have this issue? Any chance of getting a new device from warranty?\n\nThe absolute worst part is that I bought this phone full price on the day it was available.. such a big mistake since it is now $250 off... Thanks Google.",
