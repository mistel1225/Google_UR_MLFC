    "content": "I am trying to set the volume on A pixel 4a5g to stay loud for calls and notifications but the volume won't stay up. How do you stop the volume turning itself down on its own. I have never received a call or notification that I heard from a ringtone. Everytime I check the volume level it is back to zero just for the ringer.",
