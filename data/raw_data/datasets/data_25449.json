    "title": "Restore a cloud backup without device password",
    "content": "Hello, \nI hope someone from Google can help on this. I recently changed my locksceen password but i used it in combination with fingerprint. Yesterday my device restarted itself and, as usual, was asking for the password instead of fingerprint. Unfortunately i couldn't remember it and after quite a few failed attempts, i factory reset my phone through recovery mode. When it powered on again, through the device setup steps, i tried to restore my last cloud backup. I understand that the backups are encrypted not only using my google account password but also the lockscreen password. As mentioned, i cannot remember that password so again, after a few attempts on that process, i got a message saying my backup will be deleted after 5 more failed attempts. Not sure if there is any way to call tech support at Google or even if Google from inside can restore this for me, provided i have any google account info needed on hand?\nThank you",
