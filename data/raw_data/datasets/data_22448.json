    "content": "Over the past couple of months, I have noticed that the camera on my Pixel 3 has been having a lot of issues. 1- The front-facing camera distorts photos after it goes through the \"processing stage\" making everyone's faces look squished, making the photos pretty much unusable. 2- Pictures are coming out fuzzy, and even when I log onto Google Photos on my PC, they are fuzzy and look like they were taken on a phone 10 years ago. 3- Videos are also insanely blurry both on the phone and when I try to view them on my PC. \n\nThe main selling point of this phone when I bought it last year was how exceptional the camera was on it, however that quality has seemed to change for some reason. I have tried reaching out to Google and have tried all of their recommended ways of fixing this issue with no luck, other than them offering me a new Pixel 3 (which I would have to wait 15 days for once they received my old phone). I'm 99% sure this is a glitch with the Pixel 3 system but figured I would see if anyone has found a way to fix this.\n\nThank you!",
