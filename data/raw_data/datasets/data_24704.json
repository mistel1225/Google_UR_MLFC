    "content": "The problem is as follows. Always used smart lock on the phone, but recently I noticed that the phone is not blocked. A fingerprint is used to lock, and a graph key. Rebooting the phone helps eliminate until the first unlock. First encountered this problem 2 months ago, resetting to factory settings helped. Use language ukrainian. Can you do something about this? Can there really be such problems for the pixel 3XL level? Help me!",
