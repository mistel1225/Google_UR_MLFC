    "content": "PLEASE HELP!!!!!!!\n\nI never had an issue before on my Pixel 3 XL.  I now have terrible pop-up ads on some websites.  I have gone thru the settings and site settings on the device and ads and pop-up/redirects are disabled.  I have gone to two different Verizon Wireless stores and still no one can help me.  I never used an ad blocker and should not need one now.  I have cleared cache and anything else I can think of.  I don't believe I have a rouge app and don't feel like deleting my apps one at a time, rebooting after each deletion, and checking to see if the problem has gone away.  This is beyond frustrating.  Isn't there an easier way to pinpoint where this issue is coming from?  Last ditch effort would wipe and restore the device but I fear that won't help.  Thank you!",
