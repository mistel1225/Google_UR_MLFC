    "content": "I enrolled my device to the android q beta. After my device prompted me to restart it so it could apply the update my phone couldn't boot. Every time I turn on my phone the error 'can't find valid operating system' appears. I know this needs the phone to be replaced, but I can't find the pixel support phone number and chat appears to be out of service. I just want to contact a google representative.",
