    "content": "Edit: The issue resolved itself after a few days.\n\nEdit 2: The issue has reappeared immediately after the June 2021 Security Update, exactly as described below.\n\nAfter the May 2021 Security Update, the top speaker of my Pixel 5 has started exhibiting audio clipping / distortion almost all the time, but most evident with 's' sounds in speech, and higher pitch noises.\n\nCan you please investigate? I have submitted feedback in the Settings app.\n\nAnyone please comment if your Pixel 5 top speaker is also clipping / distorting after the May AND June 2021 Security Update.",
