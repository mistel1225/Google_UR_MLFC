    "content": "I just purchased a Google Pixel 4A 5G phone and I can't figure out how to set up a different notification sound for each of my apps instead of them all using the default sound. I want to be able to know if I have a text message, an email or a Facebook notification by what sound plays on my phone. I tried a suggestion on a similar post here but it doesn't work with my phone.  I would assume this is a basic setting since I was able to do it on my last 2 much older Motorola and Samsung phones. Can anyone help me figure this out?  Thanks!",
