    "content": "I have factory reset my phone but didn’t know you have to disconnect all accounts and I have factory reset this phone before but now it won’t connect to any of my accounts and won’t accept my pin.  No one else has used this phone and I have not changed anything.  I need to get it completely wiped so I can give it to a friend who needs a new phone.  How do I reset it and be able to set it up like it is a brand new phone with no previous info connected/on it?  I have tried following the power button and arrow button reset/recovery but that isn’t working either.  What can I do?\n\nOn a separate note the new update for the Pixel 3 is screwing up my phone.  My camera vibrates and the screen goes fuzzy and my background disappears out of the blue then comes back on.  As well my internet doesn’t stay connected and I have to reboot my phone to get it to reconnect.  Why?\n\nThank you in advance.",
