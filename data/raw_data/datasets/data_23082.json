    "title": "Pixel 4 Not Recognizing Pixel Stand, But It Still Charges Wirelessly",
    "content": "It started after the January 2020 security update. I got my Pixel Stand in December and it worked. I was able to take advantage of all the Pixel Stand specific features. Then I downloaded the January 2020 security update. I lost my Pixel Stand features and it just acted like a normal wireless charger. So, under Connected Devices in Settings, I tapped Forget next to the Pixel Stand to see if I could unpair it then repair it and get my features back. But, my Pixel 4 XL would not recognize the Pixel Stand. My guess is that there was something in the code of the January 2020 security update that removed Pixel Stand recognition. And no, the February security update did not fix it.",
