    "content": "I have to swipe down twice to get to the media player. It used to be only once which felt better to use. The issue is the same in the lock screen where i have no media player on the lock screen itself but only in the notification drop down.\n\nI have all notifications enabled from spotify and no settings hiding sensitive content in the notifications. \n\nIt has been like this for a long time, i just recently got fed up with it. Hence why I don't think its any recent update that caused this.\n\nI've also rebooted the pixel launcher and my phone multiple times which is what some others have suggested.\n\nThanks in advance!",
