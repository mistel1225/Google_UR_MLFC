    "content": "I am attempting to setup an old Pixel phone for my sister. I have performed a factory reset through the bootloader screen since I couldn't remember the PIN I used to unlock it.\n\nNow, when I try to setup the phone I'm unable to use my gmail account, which I used to setup the phone when I bought it, nor am I able to use my sister's gmail account. When I successfully authenticate with either of the accounts, I get the error \"Please sign in using one of the owner's accounts for this device\". How can I overcome this error?\n\nThanks in advance for any help.",
