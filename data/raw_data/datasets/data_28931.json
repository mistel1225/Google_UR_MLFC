    "content": "I have recently had my pixel 2 replaced under warranty as I had a previous issue with its charging port. I had it replaced with a new pixel 2. \n\nThe phone keeps randomly shutting down (usually when it drops below roughly 40%). It then won't start up again until it's plugged into a charger. \n\nI have tried doing a factory reset as it seemed to work for others, but unfortunately I am still having the same issue.",
