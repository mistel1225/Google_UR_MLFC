    "content": "I have a very long text notification tone for a specific contact. When I receive a message it fires the tone. I am able to silence/mute this with a swipe down. The tone is long so it wakes me up or I hear it if my phone is not near me. It's assigned to my on-call number. This all works great as it did on my pixel 1 and pixel 4 XL\nNow on pixel 4 XL with Google usb-c earbuds connected the tone is not silenceable/mutable and nothing I do will stop it playing..removing the headphones makes it play out the speaker. All I can do is let it play out for 10min as that is the duration or restart the phone. It will not play during a phone call. But if the phone is doing nothing and the buds are in the tone must play to the end...it is very frustrating. I don't mind the disturbance but it needs to be silenced when I want to just like when the ear buds are not in.",
