    "content": "I have tried a bunch of settings I was reading a post and I think in the last update the Receive incoming calls did not have an option to turn off. It seems it is off by default. I haven't noticed it before. My screen just goes black when I try to make a call but the drop down menu is still visible. I also can connect to google to use assistant with my voice. Nothing works",
