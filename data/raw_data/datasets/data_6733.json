    "content": "My brand new pixel 4a seems to be stuck in September 2020 secy update. I have restarted the device multiple times, loaded it in safe mode but still the update check says the device is up-to-date. I have done a factory reset but still the issue persists. I contacted Google support but they were unable to fix it and asked me to submit feedback and I've raised it. I have got no response so far and not sure when this will be fixed. ",
