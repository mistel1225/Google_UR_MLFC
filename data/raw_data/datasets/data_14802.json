    "content": "I can't seem to update a Pixel 3a XL I purchased second hand to Android 11 that is stuck on Android 9 because of a installation error. It's a Verizon variant so the bootloader cannot be unlocked, now I can't access recovery mode when I hold the power button + volume up button. The warranty is also expired three months ago. What can I do to update to Android 11?",
