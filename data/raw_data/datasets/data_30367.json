    "content": "I do not broadcast my home wifi SSID.  Until the last few days my Pixel would connect to the hidden network as soon as I pulled into the driveway.  The last few days I noticed it would not connect.  After trying all the suggestions online I decided to enable SSID broadcasting on my router and suddenly it connected (after resetting all network settings, forgetting the network a number of times.).  I've tested it multiple times and I am 100% certain, the phone will no longer connect to my wifi network unless it is broadcasting the SSID.  When I disable broadcasting it once again drops and can no longer see the network.  I have many other wifi devices in the the house and my wife has my exact same phone and no other device in the house is having this issue.  Any ideas?",
