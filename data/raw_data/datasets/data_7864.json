    "content": "I have used RCS on few Android phones in past months without any problems - works perfect. Now I got Pixel 4a and I'm not able to use it. When I changed phone I started to use eSIM and for x days works good. Now I'm not able to activate this service. From time to time I got also error while sending sms \"Wrong phone number format\". I have reorganized all my contacts numbers to the same format, but not help. Its random error and don't know if it's related to RCS. I have chagned my eSIM card twice time and not help to. Cleaned storage and cache for Messages and Services app and still nothing. \nI have tried this https://support.google.com/messages/answer/9363493?hl=en but not help. \nIt's really annoying because It's my first Pixel and first time I got, so many problems with Android...",
