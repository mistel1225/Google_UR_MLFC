    "content": "Hello Google team,\n\nIn my Pixel 5 phone, \"Hey Google\" voice command is not working. \n\nI checked google assistant settings. I have already turned on Hey Google voice match and retrain voice model. My phone is not in battery saver mode. Still it does not respond to my voice. In addition, I also turned on continued conversation feature.\n\nWhat else can I try? It used to respond to hey Google previously. Somehow after recent phone update it stopped responding.",
