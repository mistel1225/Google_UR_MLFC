    "content": "Hi all,\n\nHow do I display contacts from only a specific account in the Phone app? In the contacts app, I can pick contacts from which account to be displayed. But not on the Phone app. I only want contacts from a specific Google account on the Phone app.\n\nI have already disabled contacts sync for the accounts I don't need contacts from.\n\nThanks!",
