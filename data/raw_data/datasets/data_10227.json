    "content": "Hey, I have a weird resonant rattle/tick sound at the end of every haptic vibration. (I.E  incoming Notification).\nIt seems like it's coming from the back of the chassis speaker or mic hole (the left one). I can hear it from 30 cm away.\n\nUpdated the phone yesterday to December Pixel 5 update. \n\nAnybody else noticed this. Is it normal or something loose inside?\n\nThanks",
