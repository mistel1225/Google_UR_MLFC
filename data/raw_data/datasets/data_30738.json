    "content": "I've read a ton of stuff and scoured the settings but I can't find a place to block foreground data? This really sucks because I'm on a small data plan and patchy wifi, and this would be a really helpful feature. I switched from an iPhone and I don't understand why pixels can't block foreground data? Besides that, Datally (from my understanding) removed it's foreground blocking feature, and that seemed to be the best app for data management. Any tips/ suggestions? I am tired of turning on/ off my data everytime I want to receive an MMS or picture",
