    "content": "I keep closing notification that requesting restart to finish upgrade of Android 10. I never even did first step\nAll the reviews are horrible what this upgrade does to pixel phone. Im not happy that Google is not stopping this from ruining customers phones\nWhat are you doing Google?? Are you not concerned at All? It appears the upgrade puts bugs in the pixel. I don't want the headaches everyone is reporting after this upgrade. I'm sorry I switched to pixel. Your customer service is as ridiculous as this jumpy horrible key board. That types everything wrong.  Wish I stayed with Samsung. Be nice if you actually had a call in center. That was available.",
