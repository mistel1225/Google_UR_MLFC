    "content": "I got my Google Pixel 3 yesterday and am having an issue with one of the 3 email accounts I've added. When I get an email come through on one of the accounts in particular, I delete it only to then keep getting the same email. The emails shows in my deleted folder and just keep coming through to the inbox intermittently showing the original send time. I've deleted the email account and set it up again but that hasn't sorted the issue. Any help very gratefully received.",
