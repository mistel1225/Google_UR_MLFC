    "content": "Yesterday the buttons on my USB-C earbuds stopped working having been fine since I got this pair in February.  I've tried plugging them in both ways up, restarting the phone, booting into safe mode and also trying the earbuds in my laptop where I have the same issue.  Strangely I still get audio just fine in both ears and the microphone still works.  Has anyone else seen this issue before?",
