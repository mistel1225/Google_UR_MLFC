    "content": "Due to a hand injury I cannot use my phone (pixel 3) manually, so I'm using voice access to control it. However, I'm finding it extremely unreliable. Sometimes after unlocking my phone, and starting voice access I get the blue icon in the top left with the dots to signify that it is listening, however nothing happens when I speak.\n\nAt other times in the day I will try again, And now and again it does work, however often it does not respond at all, and I find it's about 50-50 chance of being able to use it whenever I want. This is really frustrating especially when I really need to check my phone and I end up having to use my hands which causes me pain.\n\nI am actually considering switching to iOS for a more reliable service, as being able to use this feature is really crucial for me. However there seems to be no explanation for why it is not listening to me. Can anyone help me?",
