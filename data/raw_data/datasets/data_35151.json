    "content": "I found that my pixel 2 xl has two wired issues\nThis problem can found in night time or very dark room\n1. When screen turns off and clock displayed by amblient display we can find some flickering or gray tone from bottom half of the screen \n\n2. When playing media on device top half portion is dark as compare to half bottom (It is very annoying when watching dark movies)\n\nTest this by closing all tabs of chorme (when all screen shows white colour) lower down brightness to zero you can clearly find that bottom half portion of screen is bright compare to upper\nOr\nTest by any gray image",
