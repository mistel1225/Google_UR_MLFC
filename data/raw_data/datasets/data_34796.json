    "title": "Pixel 2 XL won't connect to LTE B28 from Claro Paraguay, despite device supporting that band.",
    "content": "The carrier Claro Paraguay (744, 2) just deployed support for Band 28 (700 APT) for LTE-A, but the device only connects to the Band 4. The download speeds didn't improve. The Pixel 2 XL specs shows support for both Band 4 and Band 28 and also LTE-A, CAT 15 (800 Mbps DL/75 Mbps UL), 3x DL CA, etc..\n\nI tried configuring a new APN settings, changing the SIM card from the carrier, but I still didn't found a way to enable LTE-A. I hope to find a fix.",
