    "content": "Is there any hope that Airtel and Google will work together and make this feature accessible? Some people confirmed on the issue tracker website that VoLTE is working for pixel 3 and 3xl after the feb update. Airtel says my phone isn't supported, Google says the carrier will have to collaborate with them. Is there a way to know what the heck is actually going on? Google's team has never updated un on this on the issue tracker page. I personally think Google isn't putting enough effort into this. There are number of similar issues with other international carriers too. Literally every other flagship out there supports Volte for major carriers out of the box.",
