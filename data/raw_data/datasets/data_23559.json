    "content": "My Pixel 4 suddenly turned black this afternoon when I was using google classroom. I tried to restart the phone several times but it still didn't work. My phone is still able to vibrate when I switch it on. However, the mobile phone screen has no response, it is always black. \n  It's not the first time to have this problem. it has happened 2 times before, but then I solved the problems by restarting. This time restart it doesn't work. I want to know what's happened to my phone and how to solve this problem.\n  Hope I can get help, thank youÔºÅ",
