    "content": "Not sure what's wrong or what I've done, but when I go into the Brightness settings and swipe it to the left to reduce brightness, the screen starts to completely disappear from about 60% and less.  Intact I made the mistake of going to far and my screen went blank, luckily I guessed where the brightness bar was on the screen and managed to increase it again.  I'm not touching that again, until someone hopefully gives me feedback in this.",
