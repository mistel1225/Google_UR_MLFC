    "title": "Pixel 2 Crashes Constantly, Triggered by Camera issue",
    "content": "I starting having the known camera issue after the Andriod 10 update in May intermittently, maybe once or twice. Then after the camera update in July it started happening with increasing frequency until for the last week I haven't been able to open or use the camera really at all.\n\nThis has increased and seems to have triggered a wider issue where now I can barely use my phone at all. Will be fine for about half an hour in the morning then if I try to do anything that involves any access to any images (try to send image on any messaging app, try to open photos folder, try to open either camera) or sometimes just open any app at all it will crash once, then crash repeatedly every few minutes and show battery dead sign, but will allow me to restart after five minutes, then after about 3 seconds will crash again and show battery dead sign - but in the time that it was awake I could see that I have 80% battery, and the phone was fully charged (literally 30 minutes after taking it off charge) before the crash happened. It also gets very hot while trying to get it to restart, leading me to think its a battery issue - but it does seem to be linked to the known camera issue and has only started happening in the last week. The battery has been fine until this point.\n\nThis has rendered my phone completely useless, I can't use it for anything. It is about 2 years old (purchased March 2018) and is running all the most up to date everything. \n\nI'm doing a factory reset right now, but don't have high hopes if I'm honest.",
