    "content": "Since the last update, my Pixel 4 no longer charges wirelessly on my generic QI charger.  Also, wallpapers are disappearing after being set, default or photos.  My Pixel 4 had no issues prior to the last update and I don't believe in coincidences where my charger died same time as the update came in.\nAppreciate any ideas.",
