Can they see everything I do on the net? Crazy things happen to my phone when I'm at home. Every sense I have moved into my apartment people come and go in and out of my apartment almost every time I leave. They stole money,food, cigarettes by the cartoon, brand new 501 Levi's,new Nike's. When I made a fuss about it that's when my phone started going crazy. I live in housing authority appointment. I pictures, sound recording, pictures of people in my apartment when I was gone. They tell me I'm crazy. I want to know can they do that stuff to my phone? If so how can I stop them. Let's put it this way they have a key to my front door and I'm the only one should have one. \nHELP PLEASE",
