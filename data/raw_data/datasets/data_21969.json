    "content": "My phone keeps asking for PIN in a loop. I just can't use my phone anymore. \nThis started on 19th March 2020. Still not resolved. \nI seriously don't want to do a factory reset. \nIs there any other way to deal with this?\nMy phone has become unusable from the past 14-15 days.\n\nCannot see any acceptable solution to this issue in the forums.\n\nNote - The PIN entered is correct. Whenever I enter a wrong PIN, I see 'Incorrect PIN' message.",
