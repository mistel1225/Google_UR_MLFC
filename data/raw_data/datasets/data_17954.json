    "content": "My Pixel 2 XL has been having endless WiFi issues. It disconnects every 2 minutes on every network and when it is connected, it barely works. Also, it's not the router, as everyone else in the house doesn't have this problem. Anyways, I've tried switching the WiFi between metered and unmetered. I've gone into safe mode. Nothing works.",
