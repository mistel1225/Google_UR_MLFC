    "content": "Hi,\nMy Pixel 3a have a 1 interesting bug, or issue\nFrom time to time, the phone itself starts to lower the notification shade.With all this, I can neither go back, nor perform the action \"home\". In the screenshot you can see that the shutter is closed and not lowered.\nThe display has no scratches or chips.\nIf you see on screencast - the area near the top edge of the screen does not always work correctly. Any other time - everything is fine with the screen.\nIt's software or hardware bug?\nThanks\n\n\nUPD. Bug on video \nhttps://youtu.be/l4dEypFeTqU",
