    "content": "Hi All,\n\nPreviously Photos used to automatically back up on to Google Drive, then Google Drive automatically sync up on to Computer.\n\nNow, no Photos backed up onto Google Drive - unless is there's a way to turn it On, to automatically work?\n\nI see Photos backed up and available online. How do I set this up to automatically download to Computer / sync? \n\nI'm thinking to Upgrade to Pixel 4 .. but not being able to automatically backup Photos to computer is a bit frustrating as this is functionality they've removed, which was working with Google Drive, rather than having the option to Opt out.\n\nUnless, it's not available via Google - is there any recommended 3rd party tool?\n\nThank you",
