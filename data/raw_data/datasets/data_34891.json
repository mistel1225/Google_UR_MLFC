    "content": "Called pixel support, and who is referred to uBreakiFix. I sent my phone to uBreakiFix.  They are having trouble fixing it.  It's been 7 days so far, now they say it will be another 2 or 3 weeks.  I cannot be without a decent phone for that long.  I cannot speak with the pixel support team without my pixel.  I want to request a loaner device.",
