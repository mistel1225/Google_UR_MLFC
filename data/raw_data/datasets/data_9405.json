    "content": "I cannot take a picture. I hit the camera button and I see a black screen. Then after maybe 10 seconds it crashes and goes to normal homepage screen. \n\nI've tried clearing cache, uninstalling recent updates, starting in safe mode to see if camera works (does not work in safe mode either), uninstalling camera and installing different camera (still does not work).\n\nI tried video and turning camera around for selfie (camera still does not work), confirming all apps updated, and I'm sure many more steps but nothing is working.",
