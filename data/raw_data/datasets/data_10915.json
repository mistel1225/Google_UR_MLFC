    "content": "Installed a new screen and when I go to unlock my phone the screen flashes white before displaying the unlock screen. \n\nSecond issue I'm having is my keyboard isn't very responsive, if I type fast my input doesn't get registered and is inconvenient. \n\nI've recorded videos of the issue but it doesn't seem I can upload videos.",
