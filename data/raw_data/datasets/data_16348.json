    "content": "I have a Pixel 2 XL that recently updated to Android 11.  Before the update, the clock would display on my lock screen, but not display once the screen timed out & went black.  After the update, the clock started displaying even when the lock screen times out & turns black & I want to shut that off, but can't seem to find a setting to do so.",
