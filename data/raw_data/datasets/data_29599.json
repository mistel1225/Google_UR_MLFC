    "content": "Hello, Everyone, I am new here, I got one question about charging the phone through a laptop. my laptop is ROG GL502VS, it has a usb-c port. When I used Razer phone, I always charge my phone through the laptop (USB-C to USB-C) the charging speed is so fast, i could say the speed equal to use adapter. but, when i change to Google Pixel 3 XL, i use usb type c port to charge my phone. it is really really freaking slow. I am really surprised. i don't know what happens, do you guy have the same problem as me? how to solve this problem?\nFYI, Razer Phone have 4000 mAh battery bigger than Pixel 3 XL",
