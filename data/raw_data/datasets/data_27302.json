    "content": "I'm trying to update my phone to Android 10, but the update keeps pausing after a few seconds. It has nothing to do with the screen locking, as it pauses way before that could happen. I'm on unmetered WiFi as well, and it's set to that in my settings. It appears some of the new features are actually installed (dark theme) and yet it still says I need to update, but it won't allow me to do this for more than a few moments before pausing again, for literally no reason. It's fully charged,  I've restarted the device and the wifi, made no difference.",
