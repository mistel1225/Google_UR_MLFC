    "content": "Microphone volume is way too low on my Pixel 5. It has all the latest software updates installed.\nIndoors If I record a voice note (using Google Recorder), audio is terrible low;  phone calls too, microphone has low volume.\nWhen I'm on the street, and there's a lot of noise; the volume is improved, it works OK,  so would that discard a hardware problem, right?\nIf I record a video, volume for audio recording is OK.",
