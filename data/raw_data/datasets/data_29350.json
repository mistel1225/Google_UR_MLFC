    "content": "The phone use to emit a high pitch squeal for nearly 30 seconds and then shut off. And today out of no where when I locked the screen it went static. I cant restart it or turn it on or off. It is in a case, I don't drop it, nor has it been exposed to extreme heat or water. Suggestions?",
