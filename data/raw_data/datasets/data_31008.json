    "content": "Hi,\n\nI believe I may have had spyware installed on my Pixel 2 via the recent WhatsApp hack: https://sg.news.yahoo.com/whatsapp-discovers-spyware-infected-call-030145335.html\n\nI received a WhatsApp call from an unusual number last week (May 7th or 8th) before the patch to fix the bug and have noticed unusual battery behavior since. I'm concerned spyware is running in the background.\n\nIs there a way to either/both:\nVerify whether my device has been infected\nEnsure that the spyware is removed even if I take steps to reflash the bootloader and OS (if possible) or perform a factory reset\n\nThanks!",
