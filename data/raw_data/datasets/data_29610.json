    "content": "I bought a brand-new Google Pixel 3 XL the other day. Today I was supposed to be woken up by an alarm at 6.30 am. At 7 I woke up on my own, and noticed that the phone wasn't even on. When I turned it on, it greeted me with a message saying that there had been two missed alarms, at 6.30 & 6.35 (I have two alarms so I don't fall asleep after the first).\nFortunately I wasn't late for work, but I have read on Reddit that this issue happened to other people even with the original Pixel, which does not make me feel a great deal of confidence. Will this be fixed or do I have to keep an old alarm clock?",
