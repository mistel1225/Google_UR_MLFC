    "content": "Hi! \n\nEver since my official Google dongle broke, I've tried various kinds of different brands that all were compatible (the official Google one isn't sold here). The thing is that when I'm listening to Spotify over my headphones using those dongles, with only the slightest touch or breeze of air against the cord, the music stops or skips to a different song or sometimes even my Google Assistant opens up. It is incredibly frustrating! \n\nDoes anyone have advice on what to do? Is this a problem in my phone and could I fix it with settings?",
