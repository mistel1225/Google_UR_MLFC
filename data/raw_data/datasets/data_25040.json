    "content": "My pixel xl phone isn’t turning on, the battery was drained this morning after that it came on a few times after a steady restart happened.... I’ve tried holding the button for 10 seconds which restarts it but nothing happened for long.... then I’ve tried factory resetting it that didn’t work either",
