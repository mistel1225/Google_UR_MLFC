    "content": "Another user on here described the issue very succinctly, but the issue has been locked with no solutions.\n\nBoth me and my wife have this issue and it is driving us bonkers. If we charge our phones with the pixel stand and have two alarms set, the second alarm will change to a different more jarring alarm tone. She has a pixel 4 and I have a 3. It's a terrible thing to wake up to for those who are not morning people. \n\nIf we don't change any settings and charge with a cable, there's no issues. Both alarms are the selected ringtone. \n\nWe have tried to delete the stand and re-connect it, we have tried clearing all cache and data for the alarm app. Every time, it fixes it one time and it's back again. It's a very repeatable bug and we can't get it to stop. \n\nHere's the link to the other thread with the same issue: https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/56338955?hl=en\n\nI find it hard to believe we are the only 3 people in the world with this issue as the intersection with the number of people with two alarms, without that god-awful ringtone, and charging with the pixel stand. But, I can't find much of anyone on any forums that are talking about this.",
