    "content": "I have an issues with my Pixel 4 XL.\n\nThe 'screen attention' functionality stops working after a while, this is fixed by a reboot. It appears that the phone is going into some kind of sleep mode that is shutting down certain functions.\n\nI have tried changing the battery optimisation settings for the 'Google' app, but this didn't help.",
