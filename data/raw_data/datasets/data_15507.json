    "content": "Worked fine last week, but today on Zoom, my front-facing camera is so dark that you can't see me. I even pulled over a ring light and it didn't change anything. Zoom doesn't offer tech support unless you pay, which my company does not. Zoom is so important these days. Please help us with a fix!",
