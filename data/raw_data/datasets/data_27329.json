    "title": "Pixel 3a problem and Google Customer service is very poor",
    "content": "Got the pixel 3a for more than 3 months. All of the sudden, the phone starts to lost connection to the Carrier (T-mobile) and needs restart. Sometimes it shows up twice per day. Asked the Google Customer Service (CS), who has no clue what is going on. And after one hour of trouble shooting, which I told them I already did, so basically wait 1 hour on the phone. They only provide a repair and need to mail the phone back. WTF??? Google. OK, asked if I could trade in for a Pixel 4, they said yes. Working with the CS for another 30 mins, and they said, oh, you cannot trade a Pixel 3a for a Pixel 4. I was like??? I asked this the very first beginning and you said yes. What are you doing, Google????\nI am very disappointed in Google.",
