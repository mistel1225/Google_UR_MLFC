    "content": "I have a Pixel 3 that stopped working a year ago and was told the motherboard could be broken and I gave up on it. I stuck it in the drawer and attempted to turn it on yesterday... It did turn on! I was even able to pop a SIM card in it and gave it to a friend that spent a couple of hours updating it etc. We stuck it on the charger, a brand new Google cord and plug, and now it won't turn back on again. This does not seem like a motherboard issue anymore since it did turn back on?",
