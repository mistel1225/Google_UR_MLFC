    "content": "Out of the blue my lockscreen now has an extra screen that i have to slide over to get past. Once i slide it over it lets me access the original lock screen. This is really annoying and inconvenient and it pops up with adds on this screen. I've been trying to find a way to get it off but it won't disappear. I have screen shots if that helps but im not sure what to do.",
