    "content": "I will be connected to wifi, but in certain corners of my building i lose LTE connection. when this connection is lost, my date gets reset to may 2001 and so my phone won't connect to the wifi either. When the LTE connection is restored, the date and time becomes corrected and my phone will connect to the wifi again. This happens with any router and regardless of wherever i lose LTE.",
