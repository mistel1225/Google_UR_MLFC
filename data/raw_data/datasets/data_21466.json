    "content": "I bought my phone directly from Google and set it up with Verizon about a year ago. This month, I tried to switch my phone line to T Mobile, but when I put in T-mobile's SIM card, I get an error message saying my device is locked. \n\nI called T Mobile, Verizon, and Google. Here is what each said: \n\nT mobile: When they put out the request for Verizon to transfer my phone line, it should automatically unlock my phone. If it's not working, I should contact Verizon.\n\nVerizon: My phone should not be locked in the first place unless it has been reported missing/stolen or if there's a payment due. I should contact Google since that's where I bought the phone.\n\nGoogle: Agent tried out a couple different solutions (turn on Developer option, do a factory reset), neither of which worked. He finally told me to contact Verizon because my phone says it is \"carrier-locked\".\n\nDoes anyone know how I can unlock my phone???",
