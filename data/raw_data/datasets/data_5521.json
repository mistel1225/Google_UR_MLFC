    "content": "about 2 weeks ago my microphone icon disappeared from my keyboard on my 3a. I could no longer voice text to sms or email. Calls to T mobile support failed to find a solution. my own search of settings also failed to find a choice.\n\nFrom google support on the smartphone, I was guided to the G 3 keyboard upgrade. When I pressed on the button for the upgrade, the screen only allowed me to uninstall, but no explanation or text.\n When I uninstalled the upgrade, the microphone icon reappeared.  voice to txt has returned.\n\nNo one on t mobile support staff at several sites and levels was aware of this upgrade problem for 3A.\n\ndrm",
