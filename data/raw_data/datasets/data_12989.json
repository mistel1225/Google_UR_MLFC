    "title": "Is there a \"master\" volume option for the volume buttons?",
    "content": "When I change volume, I most often want to make the entire device (media, call, ring/notification, and alarm volumes) louder or softer depending on my particular location. How can I set up my phone to change all of these at one time with the volume buttons (just 1 master volume)? Right now I have to change each volume setting independently. So, I've resorted to just using \"Do Not Disturb\" for a quick and easy way to be quiet in certain places where I would rather have ALL volumes be at a low volume, but I don't always have the luxury to open my volume settings to get the volume I need for all four volumes. \n\nThis volume design must work for most people, but it's infuriating to me.  Why not include an easy to find option to just use a single master volume with the buttons? Or am I totally missing something in the settings? Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!",
