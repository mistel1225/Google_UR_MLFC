    "content": "This has happened since last security update. Every couple of days, once I disconnect from a bluetooth headset/speaker, my internal speakers and speaker phone do not work. Re-connect to any bluetooth device or home device (which makes me feel it isnʻt isolated to just BT), sound works. I have to restart phone to get phone speakers to work again. Since Iʻve only noticed the issue since the last update, I am hoping this will get resolved in next update. Iʻve sent feedback via the phone which include log. I have tried the following fixes:\n\nRestart (only solution so far but needs to happen daily now)\nReset Connections (does not fix)\nFactory Reset (does not fix)",
