    "content": "I came here looking to see if others have an issue with the 4a's power button not always working, I typically have to press it 2-3 times... ie it seems i need to get it \"just right\" or it stays turned off.\n\nI thought maybe it was a software issue so waited for the Nov. Update to Android 11 but it did not help this issue at all , so now I am thinking I have a hardware Issue instead.\n\nThanks\n\nKB",
