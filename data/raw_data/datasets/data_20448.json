    "content": "So my phone has a ghost touch where I cannot touch certain areas of my phone and it opens things and clicks things without me either touching the area it touches and it opens things I never clicked, the only screen crack I have is near the bottom right corner where the speaker area is like (the USb -c bottom area) I cannot use it at all Its been going on for almost a year now and i don't even like using it often like  i cannot use it to log my shifts at my fire department as i cannot rotate the app, cant text as it will touch the call button when i don't want it too and it also cannot play videos on it as it skips ahead and is very frustrating and more",
