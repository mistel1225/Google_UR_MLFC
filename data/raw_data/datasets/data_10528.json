    "content": "I am confused by this and I would like Google to explain why customers using a specific carrier have to wait longer for the security update that everyone else already received.\n\nIf there is a technical reason that is fine but I would like to hear the explanation either way.\n\nA big part of why I purchased a pixel phone is for the frequent and timely updates just to find out that I happen to be on the one carrier that isn't receiving them when they are released.",
