    "title": "Why can't I send texts to some contacts following the Android 11 update on my Pixel 3?",
    "content": "Following the Android 11 update, the Messages app (or the underlying database) isn't working on my Pixel 3 phone with Google Fi as my carrier.  Some of my contacts aren't receiving my texts; I can send individual texts to two contacts, for example, but neither will receive a group text made up of the same two contacts; a search result when looking for an existing conversation will start the scroll focus at the beginning of the conversation (5 years ago) and will only contain about a year of the conversation thread; if I start a new thread, then it will bring up the previous conversation with the scroll focus correctly at the end.  I have tried deleting old conversations, starting new ones, and I've done a factory reset.",
