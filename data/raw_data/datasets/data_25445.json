    "title": "Pixel XL won't charge",
    "content": "I bought a pixel XL from eBay. Seller tells me that it charged fine when they tested before they shipped but when I try to charge it with my USB-C charger from my Nokia 3.1 A, it won't charge. It gets very hot around the port, the metal on the charger is burning hot when pulled out, and the port has an odd smell. Is this a charge port problem or what is the problem? I don't have an OEM Pixel charger or a 15 watt block. I just have a cable from my Nokia and the 5 watt block",
