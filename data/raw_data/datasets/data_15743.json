    "content": "I have tried re-enrolling fingers, however it does not recognize that there is even a finger there. I have tried a factory reset. I have tried to clean off the sensor. There is no visible damage to the sensor. The main confusing fact is that the fingerprint gesture still works, but the fingerprint scanner does not seem to be working.",
