    "content": "Whenever I make a call from my favorites it connects immediately. If I happened to misdial, it's impossible to hang up before the call has gone through. This invariably results in the \"did you just call me\" call back a few seconds later...usually when I am on the call that I had intended. Is there a way that I can add a two second pause, or possibly a confirmation screen that requires a second tap, before the call connects to the other party?",
