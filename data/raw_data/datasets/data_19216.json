    "content": "I am having the same battery indicator stuck on 50% as many other phones. It switches off when in my pocket as well. This started around 3 months ago and I have been trying to contact Google for a warranty claim. I keep going around in circles using their website and community page. Can someone please advise on how I can contact them? Thanks, Terrance.",
