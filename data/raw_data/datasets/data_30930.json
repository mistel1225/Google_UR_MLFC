    "title": "no cellular connection after restart",
    "content": "This happens about 80% of the time (sometimes it gets cellular after a restart just fine): I restart my P2 and when it comes back up, it has no cellular connection (wifi is ok). the little triangle in the bar at the top is just an outline and 'emergency calls only' is shown. I must then restart it 5 or 6 times for it to regain cellular connection. I've removed and re-seated the SIM card (tho no SIM card errors are ever shown) and I've waited and waited before trying another restart. anyone else seeing this? I'm on t-mobile in the USA and otherwise have no problems.",
