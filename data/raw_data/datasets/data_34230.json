    "content": "Recently usb C headphones (including the ones that came with the phone) aren't recognized by my phone. The Google assistant doesn't give any headphone options, there is no headphone volume control, it's like I didn't plug it in. This is also true for headphones connected through the dongle, but charging my phone seems to work fine. I tried restarting my phone but it didn't fix the issue.",
