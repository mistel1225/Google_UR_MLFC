We build apps, so we would like to test that with different os.\n\nCurrently the phone has android 11 os.\nSo I did the unlocking manual steps: https://source.android.com/setup/build/running#booting-into-fastboot-mode\n\nI saw a lot of different article and videos, but when I would like to use the \"fastboot flashing unlock\" command, my device didn't recognized the connectivity with my computer.\n\nSo here is the command list what I did:\n- Download the platform-tools\n- call platform-tools>adb devices\nList of devices attached\n03QAYV2EFH      device\n- call the platform-tools>adb reboot bootloader command\n- after that the phone went to fastboot mode\n- call the fastboot flashing unlock command. The command gave me an aswer:\nplatform-tools>fastboot flashing unlock\n< waiting for any device >\n\nSomehow when my device went to fastboot mode, the phone lose the connection with my PC.\n\nCould you help me ?\n\nThanks Gabor",
