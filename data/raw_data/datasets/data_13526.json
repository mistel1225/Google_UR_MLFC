    "content": "Not only is my Always On Display setting on, the actual AOD stops being always on after 10-15 min. I also get dozens of open tabs in chrome every time I unlock my phone (usually erectile disfunction ads) ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è So I rebooted in safe mode & the AOD works just fine & the open chrome tabs don't appear when unlocking phone. In regular mode (not safe mode) I have tried uninstalling dozens of apps to see if an app was the problem & nothing has remedied it yet. There has to be a fix/remedy for this as I really don't want to reset the phone. Google Pixel 3 XL",
