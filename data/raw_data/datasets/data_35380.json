    "content": "My Pixel Xl is not responding after updating with android 9 and It is always freezing ,showing black screen ,very slow, hangs when somebody calls me it take time to show the dialer pad. It is very hard to use this phone after this update. I bought this phone after spending so money  thinking this is the best phone i am buying and It's been just one year and now I need to look for other. Doesn't expect this kind of  service and product . Nobody can't expect this. Battery backup is reduced. Can somebody listen this and  do something.",
