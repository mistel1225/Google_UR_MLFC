    "content": "I just received my new unlocked Pixel 4a from the Google Store. When I opened the SIM tray, I found a shiny silver chip in the tray with microscopic numbers etched on one side, nothing on the other side, and small holes in either end.  Is this a SIM card? I thought all SIM cards were gold colored on one side and possibly a brand name or logo on the other. Do I have to replace this item with a SIM card purchased from my wireless carrier?",
