    "content": "Hi,\n\nHow is that possible that I just bought a phone from you and somewhere else it costs much less?\n\nhttps://www.johnlewis.com/google-pixel-3-smartphone-android-5-5-4g-lte-sim-free-64gb/p3793555\n\nIt's unbelievable, has buying directly from Google now become a disadvantage? \n\nPlease give me an explanation regarding this, my new phone is still sealed inside its box as just went to collect it and I am really really tempted to send it back\n\nThank you \nNaomianna Fusco",
