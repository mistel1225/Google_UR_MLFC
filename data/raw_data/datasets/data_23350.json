    "content": "My pixel 3a used to have pretty good battery life before the android 10 update.\nNow these random things happen:\n1. Phone is plugged-in overnight and gets fully charged. I take it off the charger and it's at ~80%\n2. Battery drains from 100% to 80% in less than an hour just sitting on my desk\n\nNow, I have did a factory reset and has helped this issue a little. Today, I unplugged my phone it said fully charged but then I unplugged it and it was at 80%, I charged it back up again and since then it has only gone down 5% which is acceptable.",
