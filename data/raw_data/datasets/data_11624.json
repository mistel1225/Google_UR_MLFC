    "content": "After updating my Pixel 4XL to Android 11, I noticed this black semi-circle above my wireless signal indicator. Initially, I thought it was a few dead pixels, but after taking the attached photos with my DSLR, it seems too uniform, a perfect semi-circle, so I was wondering if anyone can shed some light on what this could be, and how to remove it if at all possible.",
