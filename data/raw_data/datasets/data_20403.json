    "content": "My husband and I will receive occasional messages from both Android and iPhone users that show as an item we have to tap to download. Then we'll tap to download and after trying to download for a while it will say it's expired or not available but we're downloading them immediately. This just started happening about a week ago. It's extremely frustrating and we've tried changing our message settings to make sure auto download is enabled and the messages app has all permissions it needs. Why did this just start happening all of a sudden? I'm also having visual voicemail issues but my husband isn't.",
