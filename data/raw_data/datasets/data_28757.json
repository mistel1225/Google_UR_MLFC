    "content": "By default, the Date & Weather widget at the top of my phone's home screen is tapped it displayed my Google Calendar. Recently I switched that widget to display Outlook, but when tapping on the date the Outlook email tab displayed instead of the calendar.\n\nSo I'd like either to get the Date & Weather widget to display the Outlook Calendar when tapped or, if that's not possible, to simply go back to the default and display the Google Calendar. I can't find any settings to do this, including the one I originally stumbled over to change this to Outlook.\n\nThanks in advance.",
