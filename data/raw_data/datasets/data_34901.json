    "content": "I've been in chat with tech support for hours today doing the same thing I did before I contacted them. Waste of time it still doesn't work. Rolling back the Google app helped temporarily, maybe the phone immediately did an auto update. I just need the damn thing to let me voice command so don't die when driving.",
