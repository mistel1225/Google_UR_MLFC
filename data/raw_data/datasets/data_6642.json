    "title": "Why does my Bluetooth and Wifi automatically shutoff? It automatically shutsoff after a few seconds",
    "content": "If my phone has been on, my WiFi and Bluetooth will not turn on. If I restart my phone, I am able to turn them on and connect but soon after they turn off. It's super frustrating in the car especially. I make a phone call and it's coming out of my phone on speaker mode. I also can't use my phone as a hotspot anymore so I assume it is related. Attached is a screenshot of the hotspot menu showing an error. No error pops up for Bluetooth or wifi",
