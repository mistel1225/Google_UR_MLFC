    "content": "Since the November 2020 update, I am unable to attach pictures within a website. The attach paperclip icon is present, but the functionality to browse for a picture or document does not function.\n\nSimilarly, when in a chat window and wanting to share my back camera the functionality to change has become lost, nor can I see a video preview, or any audio controls.\n\nAll the above worked fine before the update.",
