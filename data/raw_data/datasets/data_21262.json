    "content": "Throughout the past I've used discord mobile to stay in contact with my friends. I've always used a Bluetooth headset with my past devices to talk to them with the microphone through voice call. When I downloaded the app on this device and tried to use the headset, the audio plays through the phone speakers and the headset is unusable. I tried a wired mic headset and then a pair of earbuds and the audio played through the headset but only the phone's mic was picking up my speaking. Could anyone offer support as to why this happened?",
