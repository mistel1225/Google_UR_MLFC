    "content": "- I sent my pixel 4 in for repair on June 2nd.   \n- It arrived June 6th.  \n- ~7 days later I consulted live chat on the status.  They said it was received and being repaired.  \n- ~7 days later I consulted again, same response, to wait.   \n- ~7 days later I contacted again, was told its being escalated and to wait 3-5 days.\n- ~7 days later,  I tell them I've waited for response and received no response via email.  \nI was told all I can do is wait.   \n\nYour process says 7-10 business days.   \nToday is July 8th, more than a month later.   \n\nSo let me ask,  is Google a bunch of thieves?   \n\nI've tried communicating over and over and over AND OVER!! that I need my phone or a refund.   \nI'm told to wait.   Do you want me to wait forever?",
