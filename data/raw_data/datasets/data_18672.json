    "title": "Wifi Calling Stopped working on Pixel 4",
    "content": "Wifi calling worked great and about 1 week ago it stopped working.  It may have been after the most recent security patch.  I have done a system network reset a couple times now.  If I call someone it is automatically going to network even though I set it to do wifi calling.  Also, If I turn airplane mode on and connect to wifi, when I try to call someone it says \"turn off airplane mode or connect to a wireless network to make a call.\"   In airplane mode I am able to search the internet, so wifi is working for sure.",
