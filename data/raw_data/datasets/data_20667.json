    "content": "Hi \nMy pixel 3 XL suddenly rebooted and keeps rebooting without stopping.\nIt reboots and the google logo appears for a second then the phone reboots again. I tried to force shutdown, but it doesn't shutdown.\nI tried to boot into recovery but the phone doesn't response.\n\nThe phone is getting warm now, and nothing is changing.\n\nPlease advice",
