    "content": "Phone is rebooting itself and either gets stuck on a white screen (e.g. in the middle of the night and gets stuck there for hours) or if I force the power button it returns the message \"your device is corrupt\". This happens a few times a week. Plus randomly it can't see my SIM card so I need to restore all the connection settings. Extremely annoying phone. I have regular social media, banking, health apps, no games, nothing scammy.",
