    "content": "I have just started using the pixel 4 xl, and although I knew the face unlock would not work with third party apps, I had thought it would work on all Google security checks. \n\nFor example, on my old pixel 2 xl, if I went to my Google password manager, I was asked to prove it was me by using the fingerprint scanner. \n\nI had thought with the pixel 4 xl I would need to look at the phone for it to check it was me, but no. I have to type my password. \n\nDoes this mean Google does not fully trust it yet, or is this something they will implement later. Or am I just missing something?",
