    "content": "Hello, I would like to preface this by saying that I love the Pixel 2 XL, but it has provided an endless stream of problems for me. I live in Canada, and purchased what were labelled as  a \"Certified Refurbished\" Pixel 2 XL. Twice. It's important to note that I purchased it from Best Buy Canada, through a wholesale company, but from what I understand, the process for certifying the Pixel is done by Google.\n\nThe first phone I received had a defective charging port, and defective bottom speaker. I had it refunded. The second phone, the most recent one, simply stopped working after approximately 2 weeks. I am currently being sent the replacement (also refurbished). This has left me wholly unsatisfied with the Pixel experience. I was wondering if anything could be done (on the part of Google), to resolve this issue.",
