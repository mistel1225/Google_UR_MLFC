    "content": "Hi all,\n\nSince Android 11, my camera is sometimes behaving weird. I need to reboot the phone to restore the feature but it fails a few days after.\n\nWhen I zoom in the camera, all is good. When I take the picture, the zoom is ignored and a unzoomed picture is taken instead.\n\nIs this something known? I haven't found anything yet about this issue.\n\nThank you.",
