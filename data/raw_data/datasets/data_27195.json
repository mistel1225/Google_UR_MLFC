    "content": "My pixel 3 volume and power buttons were not working yesterday.\n\nI thought it might be a software issue so I waited for the phone to die to have it restart.\n\nNow the power button still is not working so I can't power the device on.\n\nI am looking for a way to boot the device via and adb command or something similar.\n\nWhen I run adb devices it does not show up.\n\nJust trying to back up some of the data before I get a new phone.",
