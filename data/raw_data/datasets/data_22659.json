    "title": "After disconnecting from bluetooth, no audio plays until phone is restarted",
    "content": "The title describes it pretty well; after using my phone via bluetooth (either in the car or a portable speaker), after I disconnect no audio plays from the phone speakers. If I restart the phone, audio plays properly again, right up until I connect to another Bluetooth device, then the cycle simply repeats. Audio does work properly over bluetooth. This has been happening for about a week now, since I installed the latest Android 10 security update. I've performed a full factory reset, which resolved the issue for about 24 or so hours, but its reared its ugly head again, and with me a mere two weeks outside of warranty status.",
