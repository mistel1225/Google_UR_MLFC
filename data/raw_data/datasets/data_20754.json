    "content": "When I use an external mic with my Pixel 3a, I get an awful amount of clipping. I'm primarily trying to get a Boya lav mic to work - other review say it works fine on other users' Pixel 3a's. \n\nI've tried 2 other mics and am having the same problem. I've tested all the mics on other devices, and they work just fine with no audio issues, just not my 3a - it's almost as if the 3a is too sensitive or recording at a too high gain setting. \n\nPlease help! I need to make videos for work.",
