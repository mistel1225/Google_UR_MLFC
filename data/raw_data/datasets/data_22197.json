    "title": "Pixel 2 Battery Issue: looks like it's charging even when not plugged in, but not actually charging.",
    "content": "I noticed earlier today that my phone said it was only at 45% which made no sense because I charged it overnight and had hardly used it. By that point in the morning it should have been down to maybe 80%. \n\nAs I was looking at that, I noticed the battery icon showed as charging (had the lightening bolt instead of power level) and when I opened my settings it had a time left until fully charged estimate . \n\nI figured I'd try restarting the device but that didn't resolve anything. I'm now down to 20% despite having my phone actually plugged in for the last hour or so. Current estimate says \"1 hr 14 minutes\" until fully charged, but as far as I can tell it's not actually charging. \n\nThe charging icon remains whether I'm plugged in or not, but my phone doesn't do the little vibrate thing it usually does when I plug it in so it doesn't seem to actually be aware it is plugged in or actually be charging.",
