    "content": "Since the recent update, my calls are continuing to drop constantly.  This is a bit frustrating when you are taking calls for a meeting and having to dial in again and again.  I have performed the following:\n\nFactory reset\nRebooted the phone\nWent into settings to ensure T-Mobile is the proper carrier selected\n\nNone of these options have worked for me so far.  I'm wondering if any Google Pixel 3 users are having the same experience.",
