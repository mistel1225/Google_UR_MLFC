    "title": "Pixel 2: No audio/inaudible during phone calls, very quiet during recording/video, no voice to text",
    "content": "Over the last couple weeks, my microphone audio has become inaudible, especially during regular cell phone calls. My understanding is that the people I phone can not hear me at all. When taking a Recording or a Video, the audio is extremely faint when played back despite speaking at a normal volume. My voice-to-text feature either does not function at all, or there is a significant delay and only the last few words are captured.\n\nI have tried cleaning the physical microphones at the top and bottom. My phone has been restarted multiple times. My cell provider was also unable to fix the issue.",
