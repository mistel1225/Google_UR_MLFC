    "title": "How do I get downloaded MP3 ringtone to work as ringtone on Pixel 3a (nothing helps!)?",
    "content": "The ringtone (from site MyTinyPhone) is on the phone, in the default Ringtones folder; however, it can only be seen there when the Ringtones folder is reached via Settings-->Storage-->Files or the My Files app. And it will only play as an audio file, never as a ringtone.\n\nIf I use Settings-->Sound and go to \"Phone ringtone\", the number \"20\" is shown; if I click that, I get a screen that says \"No data\" and has \"MyTinyPhone\" across the top.\n\nI've already tried various things, including installing the My Files app (which enabled me to move the ringtone from the MyTinyPhone folder to the default Ringtones folder) and downloading the ringtone to my PC & copying it to my phone's Ringtones folder, but nothing seems to help.\n\nI've also contacted my provider (Tello/Sprint) to find out if they block downloaded songs from being used as ringtones at all, but this doesn't appear to be the case.\n\nAbout the only change I've seen is that the ringtone's title appeared initially under \"Phone ringtone\" Sound, but has now been replaced by \"20\". Also, the name of the ringtone file itself differs slightly between the one downloaded directly to my phone & the one downloaded to my PC (but that's probably irrelevant).\n\nI've spent literally hours and hours on this, with nothing to show for it so far. I'm at my wit's end!\n\nCan someone please let me know how to get this ringtone to work as a ringtone on my Pixel 3a?",
