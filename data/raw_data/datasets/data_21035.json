    "content": "I keep getting a charging notification noise randomly, even when not on a charger.  I have the charging notification sound turned off.  I also have the NFC turned off as I've read that could be a culprit, although when this noise happens it's never when it's near credit cards.  Just started doing this in the past few weeks.",
