    "content": "In my group chat I can't tell who's saying what. It's pretty confusing. How can I make sure whoever's talking has their name shown?\n\nIn the image there are like 5 different people talking and I can't tell who.\n\nEDIT: i guess this is because the chat is in regular MMS but that doesn't answer my question. Can I change it to show who's talking? Or is the chat always going to be stuck like this? Is there a way to change the group chat from MMS to RNC on my phone?",
