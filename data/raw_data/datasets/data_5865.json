    "content": "My phone battery has been steadily getting worse for months. Every night when I get home from work I have to charge it, or even charge it at work.\n\nAs of the last few weeks it's becone nearly useless. I charge it to full and it dies multiple times per day. Yesterday it was in my pocket all day, I barely touched it and it died. It gets to about 10-13% battery and then it shuts down. \n\nAs of today I spent hours following the Google battery drain tips. I backed it up and reset it to factory settings after doing all the other steps. Now of it gets to 20% I can watch the per tick down 1% per second and crash...\n\nI posted to @madebygoogle twitter and they gave me a generic list of things to try. The only thing I didn't do besides paying here was to put it in safe mode. So I did that tonight to see the power drain is caused by an app (and yes I already deleted junk files, opened up storage, deleted unused apps, deleted widgets, and battery check says everything is normal...) Yet I still lost power fairly quickly (less quickly since nearly no apps are running, but had 4 hours on this charge) and as soon as it got to 20% it began to crash. I showed my boyfriend as it just dropped 20, 19, 18, 17....3, 2, 1...\n\nSo if Anyone has Any suggestions besides the battery just plain being dead I'm listening. My phone does not get hot when it's charging. Although it has done that before, though I don't recall that happening before this started. The phone is only 18 months old! I thought it could at least make it to 2 years.",
