    "content": "My wife's pixel 3a is having issues through the standard google app. She is only able to send/receive texts from some people while connected to wifi or data. Since she works at a rural school, she does not have ready access to either of these and therefore cannot receive or send texts while at work. We have verizon as a carrier.",
