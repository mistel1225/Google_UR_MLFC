    "content": "I have my 3rd Pixel 5, all 3 have had issues with the GPS signal being lost whenever I am driving. I happens every 2-3 minutes intermittently. I have tried factory reset, safe mode, I’ve used the SIM card i have in other phones, i have a family account and none of the other phones have this issue, I have also had the same problem with a Pixel 4a that i bough and returned for the Pixel 5 specifically to try and resolve this issue. It appears to be either a consistent hardware issue between the 2 phones or a software issue when the phone is moving faster than 15 MPH while using GPS\n\nI have been testing this issue 5-6 times a week and using every step i could think of, I cant get any help from google so I’m hoping someone can assist or has had a similar issue,\n\nI have also documented that the phone struggles to regain GPS signal and when doing so it over heats, sometimes to the point of being dangerous to hold. This has happened to 3 different pixel 5 phones and a pixel 4a",
