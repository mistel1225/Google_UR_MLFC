    "content": "So, I have a Google Pixel 1st gen from 2016. Phone has been working like a champ... until I upgraded to Android 10. Now it won't make or take calls. I have to go through hoops to make it work like clearing the phones cache and rebooting every time I want to make a call. I have been on Google Chat 4 times with no real result to fix the issue. Just want to say that the phone was working just fine on Android 9 with zero issues. The phone has been factory reset 4 times. The 4th time was just the set up with no extra apps downloaded from Google Play, just factory. Same problems same issues. Android 10 pretty much bricked my phone. Go figure. The last Google Chat fella suggested I send my phone to uBreakiFix to have it repaired because it's now out of warranty.  \n\nI upgrade to Android 10, my phone no longer works as it should and Google is telling me to send it away and pay for what... some place to tell me they couldn't fix it? It was THEIR firmware that f'd it.\n\nI come to the Google community for any thoughts or ideas for help.",
