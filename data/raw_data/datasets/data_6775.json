    "content": "My pixel 4 had \"permissions removed\" turned on without my knowing  and it isn't clear how to turn it off. It started deleting information from some of my older apps that I didn't want deleted, they have just gone unused because of the pandemic. It isn't clear how to turn this setting off now, or if it is possible to restore the files that were deleted. Thanks!",
