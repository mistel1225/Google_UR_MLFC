    "content": "After configuring my Pixel 5, an option to enable App Suggestions appeared, suggesting that I enable them on my home screen. Wanting to try it out I enabled it, however I don't think it's for me, so I disabled it. However this feature created some row on all of my home screens that is now unusable and sits empty, taking away from my screen space. I tried resetting the grid, but it didn't help. At this point I don't know how to remove this empty row without doing a factory reset, which doesn't seem like a customer-friendly option.\n\nSo the question is: how do I remove this empty row on my home screen after disabling App Suggestions?",
