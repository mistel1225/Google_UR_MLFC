    "content": "My partner and i have both the same issue:\nPartner: Pixel 4a en i have a Pixel 5.\n\nSo far we really love the phones but this problem isn't something you can live with.\n\nOn both phones the exact same thing happens and that is that the internet connection suddenly drops.\nit does it when connected to wi-fi and as well on mobile data, i checked home wifi but it is running perfectly and other devices (tablet, other phones and every other device in house) works without issues.\nbut as i said, when we're outside the same issue occurs when we're on a mobile data connection.\non a full day the connection drops about 20 times!\nstrange thing is that every app that needs a internet connection will stop working and say that you don't have a working internet connection. but the icons in the notification bar don't indicate that there is a problem.\n\nactivate and deactivate airplane mode or a device restart immediately solves the issue but it's not funny when you need to do this 20 times a day.. :-(",
