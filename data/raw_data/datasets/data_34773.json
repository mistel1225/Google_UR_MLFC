    "title": "Pixel 2XL stuck with battery warning, even at 99%",
    "content": "Just downloaded the OTA update for Android 9 this morning on my 2XL (Verizon), and when the phone restarted in immediately gave me the \"do-do-do\" alert for low battery. I check notifications and it says \"Battery may run out soon. Phone may shutdown soon (99%).  (Attached is a screenshot)\n\nClearing the notification only has it make the sound and come back when it ticks down another percentage. It's stuck there, and I don't see a setting that might be able to turn this off.  Any ideas?\n\nThanks,\nErik Coleman\nUniversity of Illinois",
