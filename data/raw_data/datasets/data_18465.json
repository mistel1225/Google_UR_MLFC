    "content": "Around last week, my Pixel 3a suddenly wouldn't charge anymore. I went to the Google help center and I saw that I could get my phone repaired under warranty for no charge. I then took my phone to UBreakIFix to get it repaired and I mentioned to the employee that I still had a warranty on my phone.  \n\nNow here's where things get messy. The employee told me that he would charge me for the repair, but that he would give me a receipt that I could take to Google to get a refund. I took his word for it, got the repair done and got the receipt. Then I tried to contact a customer support agent to request a refund. However, the agent said that he would only be able to offer me a replacement for my device. I told him that my device was already repaired and that I only wanted a refund for the repair, but he said that he could only offer me a replacement. \n\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, I haven't been able to call Google customer support as there is currently no one working the hotlines. How can I get my money back for the repair that I got under warranty?",
