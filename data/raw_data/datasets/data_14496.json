    "content": "I have powered off, selected feature to ring when doing this I received vibration to ALL INCOMING CALLS I have cleared all cache, followed all the steps from the community. I will not conduct a factory reset because I will lose all my data. I have to place the ph in my pocket minute by minute to receive my calls. I TOOK IT TO AN AUTHORIZED DEALER,  they conducted a thorough test and was told that this problem could not be repaired??!How dreadful.. I did not have any problems before the updates. Now it's at a ten. I deleted any and all unnecessary third party apps as well.",
