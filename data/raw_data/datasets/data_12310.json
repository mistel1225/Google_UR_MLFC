    "content": "Hi there, \n\nI have yesterday updated my phone to Android 11 and today I have noticed that there is no possibility to take screenshot of my home screen. \nI can do it of any app by swiping from screen from down to up, but when you want to take screenshot of your screen, it is not possible. \n\nIs this maybe a android bug, or local bug. Or there is new way \n\nbest regards,",
