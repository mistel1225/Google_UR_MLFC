    "content": "Bluetooth connected devices list still has my watch on it, but not connected. Tried connecting it manually using Samsung's Wearables app by tapping on \"Connect\" button but it just shows the processing circle and doesn't connect at all. It only works when I reset my watch and start the connection process again, that too lasts only for a day or two and then it disconnects again by itself.\nI also tried connecting my watch to my old Samsung phone, it works fine with that phone.",
