    "content": "Have done tried the troubleshooting with \"Fix problems with your camera on Pixel phone\" and reset to factory setting and the problem is still there.\nSome app has broken too such as Youtube/Instagram/Facebook.\nNotice my len keep moving and continuous making ticking sound.\nAny idea with this problem?\n\nThis is a replacement from the US, I live in Taiwan.\nAll the team here just ask me to send it back to US for another replacement.\nThe shipment fee and the tax can almost get a new one so I'm not going to do that again.",
