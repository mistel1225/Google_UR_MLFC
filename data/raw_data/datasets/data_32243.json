    "content": "I can't hear music, calls, audios or anything unless it is on speaker, not even with headphones or similar. People can't hear me either, whether on a call or audio. I tried cleaning the microphone, unplugging and plugging different headphones, turning off Bluetooth... Nothing worked so far. I must clarify that the phone is new.",
