    "content": "For the last month I have been having an issue with my Pixel 3 Force shutting down.  It is not booting back up after the shutdown.  I did a hard reset about a month ago.\n\nInitially, I thought the issue was tied to Android Auto, but it may simply be heat related, as it just occurred at my desk.\n\nAfter it shuts down, I can force it to boot up by holding down power button, but it usually goes through the same cycle a few times before it finally starts working again.  This leads me to heat issue also.\n\nIs there a log that can be viewed to see what is causing the shutdown?  Or is there a better means to troubleshoot this?",
