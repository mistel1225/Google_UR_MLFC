    "content": "I am sending my phone back to the distribution factory in Poland as requested by the assistant I spoke to as my phone charging port is faulty. I wanted to know:\n1. How long it would be until a replacement arrived?\n2. Should I send the phone in the original box (without the accessories as requested) or in something else? How secure should it be?\nand \n3. What will I use while I am waiting for my replacement to come? I am paying a lot of money for a contract and not being able to use this for a considerable period of time for a reason out of my control seems ridiculous.",
