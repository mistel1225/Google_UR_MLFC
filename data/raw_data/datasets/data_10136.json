    "content": "Hi, guys. I got a new screen for my Pixel 2 and it didn't come with little protective mesh for speaker and mic. The guy already installed it without telling me that they weren't there ....\nIs there any way I could cover those holes to prevent dust from getting inside without taking the screen off?",
