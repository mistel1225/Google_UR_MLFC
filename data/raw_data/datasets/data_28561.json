    "content": "The day prior my camera was freezing up when taking photos, but ultimately continued to work. I took a bunch of photos the following day, and about the first 20 or so that morning are missing. They are not on photos.google.com, they are not in trash, they are not archived etc. But when I look to add photos via Strava or Instagram apps, I am able to see them! Where are they and how do I restore them to my traditional camera folder!?",
