    "content": "I have been having issues with my pixel now for two months (owned since boxing day 2016). Initially, the headphone jack went crazy whenever I plugged headphones in, and now just does not work whenever any AUX is used. Can deal with that. Within the last 2 months, battery has gotten worse and worse with the phone shutting down whenever it feels like it (can be at 60% and just shut down), so I've got a new battery ready to be put in the phone when a friend gets time. Within the last 24 hours, along with the constant shut down, the phone app no longer will take or receive calls without restarting the phone (after which it still doesn't work). Other call apps (e.g. Facebook Messenger) also don't work. Tried a network reset, deleting unused apps, updating all apps, checking for a phone update. None worked. Backed it all up (thanks Google drive, at least you're a winner) and did a factory reset. Could actually connect a call very slowly but no voices could be heard at either end, and I couldn't hang up but the phone would reset again. Tried putting the phone in safe mode and same deal, phone app (and phone) freezes and restarts. Is the phone just cactus now?",
