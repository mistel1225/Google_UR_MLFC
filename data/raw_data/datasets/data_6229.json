    "content": "I recently bought a Pixel 4a 5g.  After transferring the files, etc from my Pixel 2, I noticed that the home screen fonts are white, as is the notication bar.  This is annoying, cause I have a \"snow\" background & the fonts are not very legible.  My Pixel 2, with the same background, has black fonts & notification bar.  How do I get black for my new Pixel ?",
