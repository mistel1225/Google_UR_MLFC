    "content": "Today my Pixel 5 got food spilled on it and I performed a normal cleaning with a wet cloth. Since the Pixel 5 is waterproof is also let some water drip on the bottom since there seemed to be some dirt in the usb-c port.\n\nAfterwards I got the notification that no more liquid was detected and I could use the USB-C port again. But since that moment my speakers started to give me distorted sounds, there is sound coming from the bottom one but very very quiet and the one under the screen is very high pitched.\n\nI can't seem to find anything in settings and I shipped the Pixel 5 from overseas so I'm not sure where to go for fixing this issue?",
