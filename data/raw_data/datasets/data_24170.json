    "content": "Since the new update, I cant seem to disable the \"pop up on screen\" for message notifications. It worked before, but now no matter how many times I try to disable the pop up function, it won't apply. It's annoying to see messages or notifications while I'm watching a video or doing something else on my phone. Please help!",
