    "content": "Is anyone else upset they spent $900 on a phone that behaves and functions as a $400 one? My fault for not doing proper research before buying I guess but I am extremely disappointed. People were saying good things so I bought into it and it came with more bugs than useful features. Even the camera, the most advertised feature, doesn't compare to phones with the same price tag and has it's own ant farm worth of bugs. Who do I talk to for $500 back",
