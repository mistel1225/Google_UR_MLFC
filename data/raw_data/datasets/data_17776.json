    "content": "Seems like others are finding similar. Towards end of last week discovered that the other party on voice calls cannot hear my voice  when using the standard internal microphone. If go hands-free 'speaker' they can hear fine. Have tried booting to Safe mode, also factory/data reset without automatic reinstall of apps, checked for updates (was most up to date at time of writing Android 10 qq3a.200805.001), also followed the troubleshooting advice on this page https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/9706190?hl=en\n\nNothing has fixed it so far. I did get the security update pushed OTA last week so I'm wondering if that's messed things up. Looks like I'll need to have to do the warranty route - not exactly the sort of thing I want to be doing on my holiday break but there we are",
