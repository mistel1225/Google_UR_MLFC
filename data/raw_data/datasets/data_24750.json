    "title": "Pixel (Sailfish) no longer charging from PD charger",
    "content": "BUG: After extended running, my 1st gen Google Pixel phone (Sailfish), which had been working on a PD charger, stopped charging on the PD charger, although it still charged on non-PD chargers. I verified that the PD charger and USB type-C cable were good with another Pixel, USB type-C cable, and PD charger. I was only able to solve the PD charging problem by powering off the Pixel and powering it back on. Apparently during the extended running, it had gotten itself into a state where it would not recognize PD chargers. \n\nDevice model: Google Pixel (Sailfish)\nAndroid version: 9 (PQ2A.190205.003)\nCarrier: T-Mobile USA",
