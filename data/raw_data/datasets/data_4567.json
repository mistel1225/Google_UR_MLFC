    "content": "Today gmail, google search and other apps I use daily started crashing. I have already restarted my phone 3 times, disconnected from wifi and nothing changed. What could be the problem? The only thing I can think about is that I have visited many websites the previous days in search of an item to buy and I may have come across a virused website. Other than that I reinstalled uber app today, but I don't think it's correlated. Please help me",
