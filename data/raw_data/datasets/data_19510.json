    "content": "My Pixel 4XL is not turning on unless I keep holding the power button. If I let go, it immediately turns off. It also turns itself off as soon as it finishes loading, even if I'm holding the power button. I tried charging it, but it doesn't solve the issue.\n\nRestarting in recovery mode (by pressing power + volume down) also doesn't work, as soon as I let go of the power button (to navigate and select options from the menu), the phone turns off.\n\nI've followed the troubleshooting pages for Fix a Pixel phone that won't charge or turn on and Fix a Pixel phone that's restarting or crashing (the steps I could, at least). It doesn't seem to be a problem with the phone not charging. Nor it seems to be a screen issue, as I tried calling it, but it won't ring.\n\nIt seems to be a hardware issue: I've been having problems for a few week with the battery stuck at 50%, but otherwise the phone was working normally, until today. Unfortunately, it seems impossible to get in touch with Google's customer support: every link I try (\"contact us\", \"Chat\", \"contact pixel phone support\"...) redirects to the self-help page. I live in Brazil, so there's no authorized Google tech services here. It'd be willing to mail it to the US, but how can I get in touch with them?",
