    "content": "I can get directions with Google Maps, but the whole time it says \"Searching for GPS...\". I have to look at the list of directions and memorize it because of this. Seems like it always thinks I'm a few blocks away from where I really am. Clearing the Google Maps cache did nothing. I restarted my phone once and tried getting directions again and that seemed to work, but only that one time. It's not just Google Maps--Pokemon Go is just as inaccurate with my location. I've been trying to get directions in areas where it's always worked for me in the past with this phone. Any help is appreciated.",
