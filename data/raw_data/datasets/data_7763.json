    "content": "Hi all, \n\nLong story short, I've bought a 4XL that I found had the bootloader open. I've followed instructions on here to flash it and close the bootloader, thinking all would be fine. I've now basically got a blank phone, bootloader still open with a message saying no operating system if I try to close it.\n\nCould anyone advise me on how to restore the phone to a normal/stock state as if I'd just purchased it from a shop/Google.\n\nThanks,\nRyan.",
