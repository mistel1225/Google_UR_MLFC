    "content": "I recently applied the latest system update and since have been having a problem with the touch screen. It does not type the letters I am pressing and makes gestures I have not indicated. For instance, when I type a text message the system screen will slide down from the top or it will send without me pressing that button. I restarted the phone and it did not fix the problem. Is this a problem for other people? Any suggestions in fixing it? I am afraid to downgrade the software as I might lose my texts, etc. Thanks for any help.",
