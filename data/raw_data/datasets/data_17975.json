    "content": "Google Assistant keeps randomly triggering and acting erratically on my Pixel 4XL. At first I thought something was wrong with the Active Edge, so I turned off \"squeeze to activate Assistant\" but the issue continued. I then tried turning off Assistant on the phone. Active Edge is working fine to silence calls, etc, and Assistant no longer keeps popping up. So, I am assuming it is a Google Assistant software issue. Anyone else experiencing this?",
