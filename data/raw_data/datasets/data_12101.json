    "content": "My blocked number list is extensive - many, many screens worth.  I want to check to see if I am blocking a specific number.  However, the list, as shown, is unsorted, and I cannot reliably search by inspecting each and every number in the list.\n\nHow can I go about getting the list sorted?  Alternatively, is there some way to search the list?",
