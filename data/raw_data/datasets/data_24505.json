    "content": "I am unsure if this is normal for Pixel 3 phones. Here is the performance of my phone:\n\nBattery will be at 10 percent by the evening. I unplug my phone from its charger at 7am, and listen to podcasts throughout work, and by the time it gets to 6pm, my phone will be at the edge of dying.\nMy phone is always on Battery Saver, Bluetooth is always off, only WiFi, Location, and Data is on constantly.\n\nMy coworker has the same phone, and he listen to podcast constantly, but his phone can last two days without charge with Always on Display.\n\nOn top of my battery issue, my phone is slow at loading some applications (ie, Facebook Messenger), and will restart randomly if the phone become slow. I am not sure if it is related to my battery setting (since I am on Batty Saver).\n\nSo the question is.... is this normal for a Pixel 3?",
