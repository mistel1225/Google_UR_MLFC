    "content": "On Android 10 I was using user mode since administrator account was locked by password. For some reason, after a couple of days I couldn't enter with my password or fingerprints. It solved the problem, but I didn't have any security on my phone. \nWhen I installed Android 11 - one month everything was fine and I was using adminitator account(with password and fingerprints). But once I installed last Android update few days ago - same problem. I can't enter with my password/fingerprints. After reboot user changing option is freezed. GG. \n Can you test your updates before you release it, please? And how I can return to Android 11 without any updates?\n\nP.S. Killed a day to reroll to Android 11 first September release. Hope it will work like it was untill I installed October updates.",
