    "content": "I've just gotten the pixel 3a and i'm getting really annoyed at how I have to swipe up twice to access the main menu with all the apps. If I swipe up once its the 'suggested' apps but I have to swipe up again to see all the apps.\nAm I missing something here? Is there a way to get rid of this annoying extra step?",
