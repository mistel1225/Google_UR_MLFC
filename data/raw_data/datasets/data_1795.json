    "content": "On all of my previous Android phones hitting a volume key when not listening to music or a video would adjust the ringer volume.  Now it adjusts the media volume even though I'm not listening to any media and I can't find a way to set it to the ringer.\n\nMy previous phones we an LG Thinq v40 and a Samsung a50.  I have to adjust the ringer / notification volume several times a day at work and it would be nice to just use the buttons like I used to instead of having to unlock my phone, and click the screen several times to adjust a slider.",
