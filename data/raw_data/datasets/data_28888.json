    "content": "My 1 year old threw my phone accidentally into a metal fire grate and it shattered the screen and the display has 2 horizontal lines accross it. Beneath the line it goes crazy flashing a green light across the whole display intermittently at random. \nIts basically on the fritz. \nI am in regional australia and want to get it repaired but retain its waterproof rating. Guess ill need to mail it somewhere? any advice?",
