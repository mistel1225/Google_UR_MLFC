    "title": "Pixel 3a Sound/Speakers not working (except Alarms) - No response from Google Support",
    "content": "My Pixel 3a is less than 2 months old yet has multiple problems.\n\nFirst it started randomly shutting itself off and bricking itself until being plugged into a power source. This only happens a couple of times a week and while it is annoying I wouldn't have contacted Google over it.\n\nThe more infuriating problem that started happening a week ago is that all media and call sounds (YouTube, Spotify, Calls, any other apps) stopped working. The only sound my phone is able to produce is via alarms. (Headphones do work normally).\n\nI have tried rebooting, safe-mode rebooting, clear cache and other suggestions but nothing works.\n\nWhat's most upsetting is that Google Support in Japan is not responding to my inquiries (I am a resident in Japan). I have send at least five phone call requests and submitted a text feedback.\n\nIf this issue is not solvable I would like to request a refund or phone replacement, but I have no idea how since Google Japan is not answering me.\n\nI hope someone here is able to help me out. Help is much appreciated.",
