    "content": "Phone was just continually rebooting this morning (or trying to) as it just goes from the white google screen to black and back again. Tried doing a factory reset multiple times and it would just go back to the white google screen when recovery mode was selected. Finally got it to complete a factory reset and now I am back to it cycling through the white google screen and crashing. This is the third pixel phone that my husband and I have had this same issue with over the last few years. If i have to replace it definitely will not be with a google product!!",
