    "content": "For over a year I used my pixel 3a (that I bought from Amazon as unlocked and able to work with any carrier) with Sprint.  Now Sprint users are migrating to T-mobile.  When I tried to get a new sim at the Sprint/T-mobile store, they told me my phone is not compatible with their network and I would have to buy a new phone soon.  My phone has an esim right now.  I have talked to Sprint tech support and T-Mobile tech support.  Both have told me, after being transferred to several techs, that a pixel 3a phone is not compatible with T-mobile even though they sell pixel 4a phones.  So I contacted Google support.  They tell me my phone will work with any carrier.  As per their instructions I have refreshed the sim and reset the mobile network.  What could be the problem?  Is it the esim?  I really like this phone and planned on keeping it for at least 2 more years.  Why is T-mobile insisting it is not compatible?",
