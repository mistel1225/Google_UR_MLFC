    "content": "Now I know what you're going to say. Take it to repair, that's what official support told me. And I did! But lets just say that I'm in the middle of a complaint being made against a certain Carefone Warehouse store that will hopefully result in certain members of staff there being retrained >.>\n\nIn the meantime. I have a first Gen Pixel Xl that, out of no where, switched off, stopped charging and would not turn on.\n\nAll chargers work fine with other phones.\nI have left it on charge for over 30 mins, tried with multiple chargers.\nThere is no charging symbol or lights at all no matter what i do.\nThere is no dust or damage in the phones USB port.\nHolding the power button down for any length of time (I sat there for a few minutes) yields no response, same goes for power and volume keys, I tried up and down for the fun of it, again, no response in the slightest. Have also tried this while plugged in and while not plugged in.\nThe only thing close to a response i can get from it is when i plug this into my PC and it will make the usb detected sound, however the phone does not seem to appear anywhere on my PC.\n\nIs there anything else I can try?\n\nI've exhausted every option i can think of and the repairs option is currently not up for grabs. If I can find a fix without having to deal with Carefone Warehouse again I will be super happy.\n\nIf anyone has any hints at all it'd be much appreciated.\n\nThanks in advance.",
