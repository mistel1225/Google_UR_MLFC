    "content": "My Google pixel simply won't charge. \n\nHave read several other posts and it is neither a case of using a different charger nor a screen problem. Have tried connecting the phone and charging for over 30 minutes. Have tried connecting via my laptop. It seems you have to have a PhD to troubleshoot this phone OR find a way to contact Pixel! \n\nThe battery icon shows on the screen (so as I mentioned this is not a screen issue) but continues to have a flashing red light showing low battery. Have tried several charges, various USB ports, two computers.\n\nCannot contact Pixel Support because the phone will not turn on! Pixel's customer support experience is horrendously painful!!!",
