    "content": "Hi, my Pixel 3 won't turn on and EE have said they can exchange it which is great, However how do I erase all the data and apps, logins etc on the faulty phone before syncing to a new device? I've been through all the Help sections and it seems most of them need to ensure a setting was activated on the phone when it was turned on? I have some financial and trading apps with access to my accounts, as well as 2FA on the phone. How would I resolve and should I be concerned?\nthanks",
