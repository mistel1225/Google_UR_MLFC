    "content": "I just received my Pixel 4 and accidentally left my charger at home. I tried using my friend's USB-C cable from her Huawei P30 to charge my phone but it does not work.\n\nHowever, I know of someone else who also has the Pixel 4 who is able to use a different USB-C charging cable without any issues.\n\nI also have a 3rd party USB-C to 3.5mm headphone jack adaptor to use before receiving the original adaptor from the Google store but it doesn't work either.\n\nIs this an issue with my phone? It seems that Google uses standard connectors. I moved over from an iPhone so I'm not too sure.",
