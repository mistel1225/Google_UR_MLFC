    "content": "Recently, any contact that is a company name (no first name, no last name) does not appear in my contact list by company name. Instead, each company appears in the contact list of \"unknown.\" How can I get them to appear in my contact list by Company name if there is no first name/last name? I'm guessing a setting needs to be changed that shows contact by company or first/last name - whichever is part of the contact.\n\nDue to software and possibly hardware issues, Google had to replace my Pixel. The problem started with the replacement phone, so it may be as simple as changing a setting. Thanks for any advice!",
