    "content": "Help - I backup and catalogue all my photos with the Photos app on a Mac, but lately the app won't see photos in our Pixel devices (mine or my wife's). I also use my Pixel for to film video every week, so I need to be able to import to the Mac easily, so this is a pretty annoying problem. \n\nI load Photos, and it recognizes the existence of my Pixel 3a under \"devices\" in the column, but, when I click this, it will not load any photos in the app for importing. I have tried ever USB connection setting, and tried this with Android File Transfer running or not running at the same time.\n\nThe same thing happens when I try to import with Image Capture. \n\nAre Google Devices simply no longer compatible with the macOS Photos app? \n\n(the only workaround I've found is a pain in my bottom - it imvoles dragging all my photos from File Transfer to a desktop folder, then importing into Photos, but this means I will have to go back into my Pixel and delete all the imported photos, and hope none got skipped/lost in the process - I just want it to work directly through Photos [like it used to])",
