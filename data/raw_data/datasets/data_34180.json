    "content": "Nothing wrong. Just wanted to repost a Reddit post that I feel very strongly about. I hope that we'll keep our navigation buttons; I personally hate how iphones users have to navigate through their phones with swipes which is one of the reasons why I'll never switch.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/as38pz/i_love_the_back_button/\n\nIf anyone from Google reads these posts: Please, for the love of all that is holy, leave the back button alone!\nI just read an article that the back button might disappear from the next Android release. Personally, I don't like gesture navigation, and I'll be incredibly angry (and avoid updating) if the back button is removed. I'm a huge fan of giving people the option to choose between gesture and normal navigation, but I hope Google doesn't try to force everyone to use gestures. Sadly, it seems a lot of the more recent Android changes have been all about removing the ability to choose and customize...\nWhy would I ever want to have to make a sweeping gesture to do something when I can make a simple tap? The back button is a beautiful thing, and I absolutely hate using phones without it (most of my family are a bunch of quitters and have iPhones). Even if I'm in the minority, I'm sure that--at the very least--people with arthritis would agree.",
