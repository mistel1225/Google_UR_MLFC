    "content": "I'm having a pixel 3 and it's no more functional after june update, i can't even factory reset it because the recovery mode is also not working. My device's warranty is running out and not many days left. I called B2X and they resumed their services from 8th june, it's 13th and still google is not providing repair  service from it's end. It's very difficult to live without a phone in this work from home regime. Please at-least give us a date or something.",
