    "content": "The phone shows no signs of being on or even uncharged. I have switched from outlet to outlet and when I tried to boot it up again nothing happened. The device was in charging all night and only started this when I woke up this morning so I didn't drop it or damage it. I have tried to enter recovery mode and tried to force a boot up but nothing happens. I have held the buttons down for well over a minute. I tried to connect to my phone with find my device to see if it is a screen issue, and Google could not connect to it. Any help would be appreciated.",
