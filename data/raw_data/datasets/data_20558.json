    "content": "My Google Pixel 3 XL has a charging issue. It will not charge UNLESS it is plugged in while on the \"hard reboot menu\", which is accessed by holding the power+volume down buttons for ~20 seconds. If it is turned fully off and plugged in, it shows the \"charging battery\" symbol for 1 second, flashes the battery percentage for 1 second, and then repeats the process without charging.\n\nHas anyone else experienced this problem?",
