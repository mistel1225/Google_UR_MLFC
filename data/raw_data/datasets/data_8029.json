    "content": "My current location on maps always points to my previous place of reaidence. Tried different location settings, cleared cache, recalibrated compass, played around with time settings as someone had discussed in one of the forums. \n\nThere is one solution on YouTube that works but only if you dowload 3rd party applications and keep resetting the gps. But I would like the phone to do it properly. Honestly, this is the first time I have faced such a thing and it's pretty annoying to find anything nearby.",
