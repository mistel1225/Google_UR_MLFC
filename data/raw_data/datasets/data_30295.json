    "content": "My phone is stuck in bootloop the last few days,, and here are the things I have tried....\n\n1) let the battery die and turn it back on. Nothing!\n2) I pressed the power and Vol down button till I get to the menu. I try selecting any option and it wont let me select anything, it just goes back to bootloop.\n\nI don't have my cable on me to connect it to a computer, I left it in a work car. Should I try connecting it to a computer and try formatting it that way? Or should I just smash it with my hammer?\n\nI am very upset with google on this. I love the phone and software, but when I first got my phone 6 months down the road I had to send it to them and they sent me a referb. phone! That really ticked me off! Now this is happening to that phone! (Just a little rant you can ignore!)",
