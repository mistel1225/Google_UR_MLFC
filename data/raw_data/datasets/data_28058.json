    "content": "I must have squeezed the phone and google assistant turned on.  This has disabled scrolling (swiping motion on the screen).\nSo I am trying to disable google assistant.\nI walk through the steps: Settings -> Google Assistant -> Assistant\nNow in this screen I am unable to scroll down to find my device.  \nWhen I try to scroll I get voice that transcribes the item my finger is on, movement of finger upwards just keep transcribing the other items.  So I am unable to scroll and reach the bottom of this screen to disable Google Assistant.\nIn fact on any other screen I am unable to scroll.  Tap, double tap are the only items that work, swiping motion is gone and hence cannot scroll.\nI have restarted the phone to no avail.",
