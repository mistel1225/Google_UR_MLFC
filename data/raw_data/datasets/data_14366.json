    "content": "Lost power the other day and realized that my power banks that I used to use on my previous phone are micro- b and not USb-C so they won't work on my Pixel 3A.  I have a cable that is micro-b to USb-c but it doesn't seem to work.  Is there some other kind of adapter I can get to save these power banks or should I just buy new power banks compatible with this Pixel?",
