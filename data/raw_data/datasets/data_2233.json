    "content": "After the March 2021 update my Pixel 3 XL stops wirelessly charging at 91%. I spoke with Google support and went through all of the steps, including doing a factory reset. All for not, it's still broken. Google support was next to useless in assisting in the matter. Is anyone else experiencing this issue?",
