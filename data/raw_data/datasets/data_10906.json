    "content": "Anyone having lots of problems with proximity sensor during calls? \nI think it is because they didn't arrange the hardware correctly in this phone. The speaker is under the display, so you can't rest your ear at the top of the phone like with every other phone on earth, you have to put your ear like a quarter of the way down the screen, and I think doing so makes it harder for the proximity sensor to detect that its on my ear. After the call the screen doesn't turn back on to hang up, and when I press the power button to turn it on, usually several settings are changed, e.g. the wifi is off, the hotspot is on, and the settings menu is open.",
