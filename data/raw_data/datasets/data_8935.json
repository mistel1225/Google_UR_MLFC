    "title": "Pixel 4a Vibrating during playback for no reason!",
    "content": "My Pixel 4a sometimes (and in very annoying situations) vibrates when I choose to play media from certain apps. I actually can't use Soundcloud because it just vibrates constantly throughout song playback, I have found any online video stream that isn't Youtube has the same result. Its almost as if its letting me know the media has finished downloading or something. Its very annoying and definitely wasting battery.\nI work in Phone Retail aswell and am very confident theres no setting in the world to control this.",
