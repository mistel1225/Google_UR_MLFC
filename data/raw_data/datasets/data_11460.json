    "content": "Recently sent a Pixel 3A away for screen repair. I was instead sent a refurbished phone by Google which would not receive signal from my SIM. I contacted my provided and tried a brand new SIM, which had the same issue.. After contacting Google again I received a 2nd refurbished phone that was experiencing the exact same issues. After again contacting my provider and checking the phone's IMEI number I was informed there is a block on the phone and no network signal will be received until it is removed. I have then again had to contact Google for resolution - to be told it would be escalated to the relevant team, with no guarantee of resolution, and that I would hear back in 24-48 hours. It is now 50 hours later with no response and chat support have simply fobbed me off to say I must await the response. \n\nI paid Â£140 for the repair and have so far had to spend 10+ hours of my time contacting my service provider and Google in order to get a working mobile phone. I still have no resolution or idea when it may be resolved and wish to formally complain about this ridiculous situation - why I was ever sent blocked phones to begin with is another question entirely. \n\nHow am I able to complain about this poorly handled repair and the ridiculous delay I am experiencing through absolutely no fault of my own?",
