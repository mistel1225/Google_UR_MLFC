    "content": "I installed the personal safety app last night and the June update on my Pixel 3A. I went in and set up the application and this morning after reboot because my messages were not working correctly I had a notification that car crash detection had been disabled because of my location. It said that it was not available in my country. I live in the Southeastern United States. I have location turned on and all permissions enabled for the app. The only option available under settings, detection and alerts is crisis alerts. I tried clearing cache then data, disabling, uninstalling updates then reenabling and reupdating. It just keeps disabling. I notice the USA is listed on the country list, is this old information?",
