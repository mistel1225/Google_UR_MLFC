    "content": "Every time I am on a phone call with my partner (who recently bought a pixel 3 upon my recommendation), once one of us picks up the phone, the first 10 seconds are blank and neither party can hear the other... Then there is a lot of interference during the call , my partner drops in and out on the other side of the phone call ... This can get quite frustrating when we have to keep repeating ourselves... This was not an issue when she was using her iPhone, and only started when she switched to the pixel. Please help!",
