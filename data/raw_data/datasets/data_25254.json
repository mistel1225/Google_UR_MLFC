    "content": "Does Google's warranty extend if they replace your defective phone? I have a Pixel 2. It had an extended 2 year warranty because of Pixel 2's screen issues. Earlier this year I got it replaced by Google cuz of noticeable screen burn-in. My warranty from the first purchase expired in early November. I assume not, but would the warranty be extended for the replacement, like another 2 years, or is it based off the initial purchase, and thus be over? Thanks.",
