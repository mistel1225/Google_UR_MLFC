    "content": "Previous versions of Android showed 9 tiles on Quick Settings by default. The current version of Android 11 on my Pixel 4a 5G has only 6. I routinely use more than 6, and it would be nice to have access to more tiles with one swipe. Is there a way to change the number of tiles that get displayed?",
