    "content": "I have connected my Pixel 2 to my Windows 10 PC via USB. In Windows, I open File Explorer, and browse to the Pixel 2, and then open Pictures > Screenshots. I can see all the past screenshots I have taken.\n\nIf I take a new screenshot while connected, the screenshot will show up in File Explorer in Windows as 0 bytes. If I double click the screenshot to open in Windows 10 Photos, I see a message saying \"It appears that we don't support this file format\".\n\nThe workaround is on the Pixel 2 to go to Settings > Connected Devices > USB > and toggle once between File Transfer and PTP (or vice versa - I switch to the other).\n\nHow do I have it so that new screenshots don't show as 0 bytes while the Pixel 2 is connected to my Windows 10 PC?\n\nThanks.",
