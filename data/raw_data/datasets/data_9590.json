    "content": "After upgrading from Pixel 2 to 4a I only get text notifications from half of my contacts.  When I go to the notification screen for those contacts (and default) I get the message \"at your request android is blocking this category of notifications \" and I cannot change the slider to \"on\" status.  Restated phone and cleared Textra cache but that did not help.  Any other suggestions besides clearing out storage or re-installing app?",
