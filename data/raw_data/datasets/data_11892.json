    "content": "Hi there, this has happened three or four times (twice today): When going on a call using a speed dial shortcut, the screen goes black and I can't do anything other than talk on the phone. I am unable to disconnect from the call or reboot because I can't see the controls on the screen. When the call concludes, I'm unable to hang up and have to wait for the others to hang up and the call to drop. It's completely random, and frustrating.",
