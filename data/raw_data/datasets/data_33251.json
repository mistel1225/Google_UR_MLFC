    "content": "I have had my Pixel 3XL for about six weeks and have been really pleased with it. Then tonight it suddenly started shutting down and restarting for no apparent reason.  I have tried everything, even a factory reset but it has now shut down and every time I restart it it shuts down within a minute or so. Are there any answers to this issue to will I need to return the phone?",
