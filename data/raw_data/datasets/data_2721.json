    "content": "The created date and time of my videos on my Google Pixel 4 a is different when I download them to my computer. When I download them to my computer and check the details of the video file, I see discrepancy in the date and time. It could be a day off or it could be a few hours off. These videos are original and have not been edited. I don't see why the created date and time would be different once downloaded to the PC.",
