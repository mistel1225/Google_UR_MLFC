    "content": "I have a 4a 5g and have been SUPER disappointed with how the pixel usb-c headphones work with it. Once I pause podcasts with the centre button they won't turn back on again unless I do it on my phone, it will randomly skip back 30 seconds, sometimes it just pauses randomly or will lower the volume to 10%. It also won't read my messages to me when I click the top buttons. I'm getting so frustrated with them, I could barely use them today because it just kept stopping.",
