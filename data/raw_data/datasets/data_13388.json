    "content": "Hello,\n\nI had a Pixel 3XL with Sunrise Alarm and morning routines set up. Really useful.\n\nI changed to Pixel 5 on launch day and set the Sunrise Alarm and morning routine accordingly. However, they just will not activate at all. My alarm rings at the correct time, but the screen does not brighten before my alarm as the Sunrise Alarm should, nor does my morning routine kick in (activate bedroom lights, play the latest news, etc.).\n\nAnyone else facing similar issues, or able to advise how to solve this?\n\nWhen I try to set up the Sunrise Alarm and morning routine on the Pixel 5, a popup alert comes up saying something about the settings page, but the phone automatically opens the settings page before I have time to read what the notice actually says â€“ and it disappears.\n\nAny help or advice very much appreciated.\n\nThank you.",
