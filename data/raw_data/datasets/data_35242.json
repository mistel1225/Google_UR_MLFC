    "title": "Do not disturb turns on all exceptions arbitrarily after I turn most off. Is it a bug?",
    "content": "I'm not sure what I could do to try and fix this. I set my exceptions to only allow alarms and repeat callers, but after a few days or weeks it will arbitrarily set itself to allow everything through much to my annoyance when I'm woken up by a phone call when I'm sleeping during the day after my overnight shifts.\n\nBehavior will randomly set media and touch sounds to on and set notifications to custom.  It randomly sets allow calls to anyone instead of none with repeat callers on. It randomly sets allow messages to \"from anyone.\" It does these all at once, not one by one, arbitrarily after an inconsistent about of time had passed. \n\nI find myself long pressing the quick setting in the drop down menu to make sure the settings haven't been reset often, find that they usually are fine and cease to check until it happens again. It's infuriating. Will this bug please get a fix?",
