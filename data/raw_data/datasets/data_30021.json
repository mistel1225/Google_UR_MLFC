    "content": "The screen goes black when I press the power button to silent the call, but after sometime it comes back on. This issue came  after this June update. It's quite annoying when the phone is in the pocket and you try to silent it. Earlier the screen used to stay locked if power button was pressed, but now it stays on and the call get picked up while in pocket.",
