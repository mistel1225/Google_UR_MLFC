    "content": "After updating to Android 10 my phone needed factory data reset to reboot.Which I thought was a one time thing.(the phone was showing my update file may be corrupt which shouldn't have happen regarding it was an ota update by Google).\nBut only after 20 hours or so after that data reset phone got stuck in a bootloop.I tried forced rebooting which took me to the same screen saying I need to factory reset all my data.Really didn't expect this kind of software issues with Google phones.Absolutely disappointed.",
