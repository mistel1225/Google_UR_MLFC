    "content": "I wanted to file a complaint about the replacement process. \nI have a problem with my phone's camera and I contacted the warranty department about it and after few checks they informed me that I can get a replacement device. But then they informed me that I should fix a crack that I have on the back top glass panel before they can start the replacement process. I do not understand this step since the phone is gonna be replaced. \nI had to spend 100 dollar to go to a google authorized repair center and change the back top panel. which they did a really poor job. They have added few more scratches to the phone while changing the panel. This is google's responsibility since this is an authorized repair center.\nAfter going through all these trouble,when I contacted the person in charge of my replacement process, they have informed me that I need to send my phone to them before they can send me a replacement. I asked twice from them about the whole process so I can decide if this is worth my time and the money to go through all these steps, and never they informed about this step. Now I have to spend another couple of hundred to get another phone so I can send this device back to them. The whole process is costing me more than if I wanted to get a new phone. This is absolutely unacceptable and look like a rip off to me. No other company would have done this and they would have changed the device on the spot.\nI wanted to reach out to see what can be done about this problem.",
