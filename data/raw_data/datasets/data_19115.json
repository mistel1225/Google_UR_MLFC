    "title": "Night Sight Not Working After Taken",
    "content": "I've been trying out the Night Sight mode on my pixel to take some great shots of NEOWISE, however I've encountered an issue. While the picture is capturing, I get the most stunning view of the galaxy. It's hooked up to my telescope so I get some great shots. Once the minute long timer stops, I get a beautiful picture of the universe. However, with all 30 photos I took, after the image is sent to Photos I only get black. All the beautiful colors are gone. Why is that? I actually have to take my wifes phone and take a picture of the screen once it finishes its capture in order to even share my pictures, as otherwise there's nothing there.",
