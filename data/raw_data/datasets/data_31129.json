    "content": "my pixel 3xl is lagging...using voice, using different programs, switching to camera...just overall...my pixel 2xl seems faster in these transitions.   Last time I tried to ask about this the tech had me erase all my programs and storage cache for programs...and it did nothing to help the device and just frustrated me because i had to erase all the data and re-enter it for all the programs.   So if there is not a solution I need to stop using the Google products and go back to the Samsung Note.   Please help.",
