    "content": "I bought a pixel 3 in eBay. I think it's Verizon unlocked version because there is a Verizon card inside when I received the phone. However it works fine with my TMobile card. But it's keeps showing \"Network unavailable, please try again later\" while the connection to TMobile LTE is fine.  This is really annoying. Is my phone seeking a Verizon Network?",
