    "title": "Photos I edit on my Googel Pixel Phone, upload Unedited (to Google Photos in Google Drive on PC)",
    "content": "If I take photos with my Google Pixel 2 phone camera, for example, and edit them on the phone (cropping, changing colour settings/contrast etc.) then get onto Wi-Fi, I find that the ORIGINAL unedited photos upload to Google Drive, but not the ones that I actually edited to how I wanted them.\n\nThe photos that I've done this with remain in the \"Camera\" folder on my phone.\n\nOnce I edit a photo and click \"Save\", rather than \"Save a Copy\", I want the old one to be totally gone, and I want to only ever see the recently saved one. I thought that would be pretty intuitive.",
