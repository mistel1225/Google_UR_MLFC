    "title": "How do I permanently disable the \"enter your pin/password for additional security\" feature?",
    "content": "Approximately every 48 hours, my device will ask me to enter my PIN number when I attempt to unlock it with my fingerprint and give me a message on screen: \"Please enter your PIN for additional security\". The device has not been rebooted, this seems to be a so-called \"feature\" of the device.\n\nI have looked through the device settings and security settings in particular, and I cannot find a setting to disable this so-called \"feature\".\n\nIt's extremely bothersome and the only alternative I can see, is to completely disable all security on my phone and have it completely unlocked!!! This is not an option I want to use.\n\nI also do not want to use the \"on body\" unlocking, as that is equally unreliable. I simply want my fingerprint to be the method used to unlock it, with the option of using my PIN code as and when I chose to use it! I refuse to be FORCED into entering my PIN code every time the phone thinks I should use it.",
