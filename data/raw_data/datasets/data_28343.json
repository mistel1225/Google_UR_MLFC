    "title": "First gen Pixel experiencing major slowdown--factory reset and others fixes not working. Help!",
    "content": "My first gen Pixel has experienced major issues, including crashing and freezing, over the last 3 days. Delays occur when unlocking phone (up the 15 seconds approx) and when making calls using Google Phone app (the app either takes 30 seconds to place/end a call or crashes with an error message altogether). I've uninstalled/reinstalled, ensured apps are updated, deleted all apps I don't use regularly, conducted a backup/factory reset...all today 090919. Still experiencing the same issues. These issues began in the day or so leading up to doing the latest Android update--unknown if related. Zero of the troubleshooting tips provided by Google have helped. Anyone else experiencing this? And any fixes found yet?",
