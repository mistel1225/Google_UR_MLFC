    "content": "The media control notification will show controls for videos that I no longer have open. There is no way to clear the notification. When I click on the video it doesn't open anything nor will it play the video. This happens when watching a video on a webpage, like a news article. Closing all the app does not remove it nor does using clear all on the notification tray. Restarting the phone does remove it. Is there any other way to fix this?",
