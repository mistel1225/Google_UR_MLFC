    "content": "Hi everyone, after installing Whatsapp and following the initial installation steps, the app is not finding the last Chat backup I made on my old phone which is visible in 'backups' in Google Drive on my new phone. I tried signing out of Google on my new phone and signing in again but this did not work. I understand that Whatsapp should show 'Backup found' before asking me to restore it but this is not happening. Instead I am asked to 'Add account' and then taken to a Google sign in page and when I type in my gmail address the error message is 'this account already exists on this device'. Is there perhaps a bug in the app or am I missing something? Thanks in advance!",
