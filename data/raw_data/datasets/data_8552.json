    "content": "Sometimes when I turn on my bluetooth headphones and watch a video, through the volume buttons I can choose to switch my media output to speakers or bluetooth. More often than not I do not have the option and I have to turn off my bluetooth headphones so I can go to speakers. I have a brand new Pixel 5 so there's barely any setting I have changed.",
