    "title": "Autocorrect still functioning even though I have disabled it in settings. Is there a fix?",
    "content": "I have always had autocorrect disabled, but now I'm seeing that my words are still being autocorrected at times. This happens while texting in the default message app as well as when typing in the Google search bar, etc. It is so incredibly frustrating. Autocorrect will change my (even correctly spelled) words after I've already typed them and will autocomplete words that I haven't even finished typing yet. \n\nSometimes, I need to go back and manually correct a word several times as the autocorrect/autocomplete won't stop changing the word I typed. It's so frustrating. ðŸ˜«\n\nI have all default texting apps, Google keyboard, and launchers. I'm not sure why this is happening suddenly. I was not aware of this with my Pixel 2, seems to be a new issue with the Pixel 4XL? \n\nI've attached a screenshot of my text correction settings for reference.",
