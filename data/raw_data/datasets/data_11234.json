    "content": "I have had my pixel 5 since the beginning of November bought it directly from google store and has been working great until this morninig.\nI had my phone plugged into charger all night but as soon as I started using it the battery percentage was going down 1% every min or so.  I decided to reboot the phone when it hit 80% and when it came back on it was at 20%.  The only thing I did was check email and facebook but the battery usage at first was showing nothing and then after reboot it just shows facebook.  \nHas anyone else had this issue?",
