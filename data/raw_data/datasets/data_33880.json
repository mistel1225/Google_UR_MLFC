    "content": "Hi all, anyone else having this same problem?\n\nFor the last few months, anytime I hit the \"install\" button on an app in the Play Store, as usual, the download indicator pops up, but the app never downloads/installs.\n\nIn order to get the app to DL/install, I have to restart the phone at least once.  One time it took at least 2 times...maybe 3 (memory is not serving right now :-D).\n\nThe phone is a Pixel XL, if I am not mistaken.\n\nCome one Google, fix this please.\n\nThanks for any help anyone can provide,\n\nCTB",
