    "content": "I'm planning on selling my 2XL and need to do a factory reset to do so. The problem is I haven't received my 3XL yet. Can I factory reset my 2XL, sell it and when I get my 3XL log into my Google Account and retrieve all my data, apps, call logs, text messages and everything else or do I need both phones to do a data transfer?",
