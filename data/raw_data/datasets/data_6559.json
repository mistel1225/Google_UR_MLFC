    "title": "Pixel Stands not charging Pixel 5's",
    "content": "I have 3 Pixel Stands and 3 Pixel 5 handsets. The stands are not charging the handsets, no matter which 'pair' I use (they are all registered with each other). \n\nThe stands use the adapter they came with, but even trying the 5 chargers doesn't fix it.\n\nThe devices have cases removed when put on the stands\n\nOften the handsets actually completely discharge while on the stands\n\n\nThe only solution I have found so far, is to go into apps on each of the handsets, find Pixel Stand and uninstall updates. This gets the charging to work properly - so a faulty 'update'?\n\nBut of course the next time they update it all stops again.\n\nThis would seem to be a problem with the Pixel Stand update? Is it a known issue, is it being fixed, and if it can't be fixed, how do I stop the app updating until a fix has been found\n\nThanks in advance..",
