    "content": "So I am a drummer and use the SoundBrenner app as a metronome. Last night was my first time using the phone at band practice. I plugged my in ear monitors in and only a very faint sound was coming from the app (and only on the right side). I checked Spotify and sound worked great. For safety I check the Google Play app and songs played just fine. Went back to the metronome app and again only faint sound. I unplugged the headphones and the app worked fine. I uninstalled the app and reinstalled it. Same problem. I also tried another metronome app and same thing. Just wondering if there is some setting I am missing or if anyone has had a similar issue with other apps. A fix would be amazing.",
