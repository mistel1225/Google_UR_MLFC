    "content": "I have held the power button to try and switch my phone on but the \"Google\" logo will come up and it just turns off again. I have tried holding the power and volume-down button together and selecting \"power off\" but when i switch it on it just turns off again. I have also tried selecting restart bootloader and that makes no difference either. Please help.",
