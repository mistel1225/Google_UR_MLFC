    "content": "Looking for a decent alternative to youtube music.\nBack in the old days of play music you could buy an album, download it, and then play it whenever you want. Now with youtube music if there's an interruption in your network DESPITE THE SONGS BEING STORED LOCALLY ON THE DEVICE the song won't play.\n\nCurrently searching for an alternative, just want something that will play the music I've paid for without a network connection.\n\nI should clarify, I have unlimited data, so that's not the issue - the issue is coverage. or random youtube downtime like today.",
