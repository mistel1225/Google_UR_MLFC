When I try, it takes me to \"Activity Controls\", and under \"Devices on this account\" it shows my old phone - now disabled - and above it my new phone, but only called \"(this device)\" and there is a box saying:\n\n\"There was a problem getting this setting. Please try again later.\"\n\nI've tried signing out of all my other devices as recommended elsewhere - it didn't do any good. Google Maps is already set to \"Allowed all the time\" for Location, and Maps works fine otherwise. But without Location History being on, i can't share my location with anyone. It just says \"Something went wrong. Please check your internet connection and try again.\"\n\nWhat can I do?",
