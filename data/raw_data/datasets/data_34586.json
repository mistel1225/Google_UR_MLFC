    "title": "My phone regularly produces an odd static like sound accompanied by fuzzy image quality.",
    "content": "The phone often, usually when I tilt it or bump it (i.e. setting it on a table), makes a sound siimilar to static or an electric shock. When this happens, the camera also distorts and becomes very fuzzy. I get the impression of something being losses within the phone but I cannot say for  sure. The effect rarely lasts longer than a few seconds. I have tried taking the phone to my local Verizon dealer. That was not helpful.",
