GOOGLE are totally ignoring my emails and are not willing to do anything! as they don't believe they have? do they think that I've blacklisted it? check the dates!!!!!! check the IMEI from whom you got it from in the first place! \n\nThis GOOGLE forum is a total waste of time!  I'd seriously think twice in purchasing any GOOGLE products \n\nIs anybody from GOOGLE inc actually reading this???????????? \n\nLove to get a reply.",
