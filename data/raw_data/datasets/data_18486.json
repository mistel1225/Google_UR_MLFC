    "content": "How do you revert to the old google camera app? The menu button is constantly hidden by the camera controls when it is open. I'm literally screaming at my phone right now. The camera controls are directly on top of  the menu button so I cannot exit. I'm left constantly swiping and shaking my phone in the hopes that I can select something other than \"night mode\" or \"panorama mode.\" I want to exit the app!!!!!! I'm swiping up and down to summon the controls and they don't appear consistently, if ever!  I hope they fire the jerk who approved this. Holy cow.",
