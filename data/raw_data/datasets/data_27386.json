    "title": "Why did Voice Recognition on Android Messages on Pixel 2 stopp after Oct 8, 2019 update?",
    "content": "Voice recognition (Voice to text) on Messages on Android on Pixel 2 stopped functioning several days ago, after an October 8 2019 update to Google Search.  I cannot find any settings that have changed, or any guidance online to fix this.  Have others encountered this problem?  Is there a fix?  The exact behavior is that clicking on the microphone when trying to dictate a message causes it to change color to blue (the usual behavior to indicate it is recording) but it immediately (much < 1 second) returns to black.  Nothing is recorded or recognized.",
