    "content": "I don't have any Google Pixel phone yet. I even never saw Google Pixel phone in real life. But I obviously want to get one. Specially the Google Pixel 3a or the larger one. The reason is I want the 1.8 F-Stop+Wide Angle+2K killer camera. Also there is a secret reason. Therefore I want to send an email secretly to Google Pixel team. Unfortunately I didn't find any dedicated email address or web form. Do you know any direct chatting, email or web contact form of Google Pixel Phones? If so please let me know in comment section. Your help will be highly appreciated.",
