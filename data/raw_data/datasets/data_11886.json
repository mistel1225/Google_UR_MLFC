    "content": "I have tried twice to reset the Pixel following all the instructions from google and forums.\n\nUsing the cable with adapter, I connect new Pixel 5 to old iPhone7, after turning off iMessage and Face time and location services on the iPhone.\n\nI go through the various prompts and it takes a while to copy the data.\n\nBUT it does copy my google account (that is managed by a Brand Account that I myself own and manage) but NOT A SINGLE APP IS PASSED FROM THE IPHONE.\n\nI mean banking apps, meteo apps, photography, FREE APPS... but not a single one is passed...\n\nI have been looking all over the place but cannot find anywhere how to copy FREE apps.\n\nThe phone is ONLINE and with a SIM card with unlimited data... but it is not downloading any app or anything... it says set up COMPLETE.\n\nANY CLUES?\n\nTHANKS\n\nGIORGIO",
