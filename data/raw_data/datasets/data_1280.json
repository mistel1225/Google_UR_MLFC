    "content": "The touch screen on my Pixel 4a stopped working. This has happened before, but it was up and running within an hour or so. It's been 6 hrs now, and I haven't been able to use my phone and I'm getting extremely frustrated as I have calls I need to make! I've attached a video to show that it's on, just the touch screen doesn't work. I had to use my husband's iphone to film this. I've also tried restarting like a thousand times and still doesn't work.\n\nhttps://photos.app.goo.gl/aKUJoTGaErchbT9V7",
