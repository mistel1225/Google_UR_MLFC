    "content": "Hello,\n\nEver since my Pixel has received the April security update I have noticed that the Bluetooth performance is very similar to when the Pixels released back in 2016.\n\nI remember Bluetooth being one of the major pains of the first gen Pixels and was pleased when Google released a software fix months later. However, it seems that the similar static issues are making a comeback.\n\nI've already tried deleting my Bluetooth devices from the Pixel and repeating the setup process, as well as just restarting the phone, but it ends up only being fixed on several occasions.\n\nI'm wondering if anyone else with the first gen Pixels are experiencing the same issue.",
