    "content": "My screen is permanently frozen. I received a replacement phone and can't transfer using the cable because I have to accept the transfer on the phone with the frozen screen. I restored the new phone with the last backup from the old phone but have lost the most recent text messages I was unable to get because of the frozen screen! I have also lost all pics in texts that weren't saved to the gallery. Is there a way to get the screen to respond on the old phone so I can get my texts and wipe the phone before sending it back?",
