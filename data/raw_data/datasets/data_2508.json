    "content": "I've followed instructions online to transfer videos to my computer. Everytime, I've clicked 'File Transfer' from my phone and a pop-up wizard shows up on my computer saying I have no photos or videos on my device and 'Next' is greyed out so I can't click it. Does the computer usually look for files on Google Photos or is there a specific gallery I need to download and transfer them to first for it to recognize my videos and other files?",
