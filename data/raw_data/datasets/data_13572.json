    "content": "I haven't been able to receive any phone calls at all. I tried the reboot, safe mode, turned off and none of the troubleshooting were working. However, I found out if I have my phone plugged in on a charger, then I was able to receive calls. (Did a various testing with two friends and figured that once I remove the charger from the phone I'm not able to receive any calls). Does any one have the same problem or have any solution to this?",
