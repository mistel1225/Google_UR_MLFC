    "content": "When I first got my phone the camera worked beautifully, and now after the update, it no longer works. I've cleared the cache, restarted and restarted in safe mode. The camera still crashed in safe mode. Oh and the flashlight no longer works. I have a $1000 phone with a useless camera now.",
