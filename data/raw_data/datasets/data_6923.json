    "content": "My 2XL allowed me to take a photo and then circle or draw lines it to identify elements of the photo.  My 4a doesn't give me that option.  It was very useful when I put crab pots in a river and could draw lines and arrows to indicate exactly where they were for later retrieval.   Can some one tell me if the pixel 4a allows this?",
