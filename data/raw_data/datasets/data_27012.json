    "title": "since Android 10 update my pixel 3 XL is almost useless! Wi-Fi big problems, apps not working, etc.",
    "content": "since the Android 10 update my phone is totally freaking useless and I just want to throw it out! My only option is to return it to Google and they will send me another one but I will not have a phone for 10 days... My other option is to pay $150 deductible with the insurance through Verizon... This is a Google phone and problems are because of them you think that they would at least do something to accommodate us! Have made several phone calls, have factory reset my phone three times I have done everything humanly possible except throw it across the room.\n\nI cannot print half the time, my apps either do not load or only halfway work, contacts just disappear off the face of the Earth and then they reappear, my battery drops from 100-60% in a matter of 5 minutes half the time this is just freaking nuts and I wish I would have never bought a Pixel",
