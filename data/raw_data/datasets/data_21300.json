    "title": "Bubbly audio on speakerphone",
    "content": "Not sure if I can explain this, but when I'm on a phone call or on a video chat with Skype or WhatsApp or Duo, it seems that people on the other side hear my voice bubbly.\n\nI made tests with a few recording apps, even WhatsApp audio recordings but all seem fine. Then I tried with Skype audio test and I was played back a bubbly audio. Of course I tried of course with my wife, exchanging phones, via WhatsApp and indeed I could hear my wife's voice as bubbly. Yet again, registering an audio with WhatsApp or any other recording app, it's fine.",
