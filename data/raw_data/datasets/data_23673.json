    "content": "Hello\n I was just wondering if you can start looking into supporting the Pixel 3 / Pixel 3 XL for eSIM compatibility in Australia. Specifically the major telcos like Optus/Telstra/Vodafone\n There is no reason why Google cannot support eSIM as iPhones already have been working with eSIM at the moment with Optus etc.\n Thanks",
