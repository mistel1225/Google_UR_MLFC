    "content": "When looking at the screen on the phone, especially when in dark mode, I'm noticing almost a shadow effect above the camera that faces me while looking on the screen. It's a very small area, but I'm concerned this is not normal. I just opened the box and have gotten on the phone. This is maybe a two-hour old phone, so I know it's not something that I've done. Does anyone know if this is normal or expected?",
