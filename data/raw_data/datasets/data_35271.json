    "content": "I'm curious about my battery life. The battery's percentage seems to drop pretty quickly but saying that, I've been using this phone a lot for gps and streaming and get through a whole day easily without running out of battery. \n\nWhat is your \"estimated battery\" time when at full charge? I can't quite gauge if it's ment to last longer or not. As I said I seem to be ok with the amount of use VS the time it gives me but because of the drain rate am wondering if there's a problem or not. Especially because the first 10% drops very quickly. It will drop too 99% almost immediately after disconnection from charger\n\nAny input would be great, thanks",
