    "title": "Problem connecting Fitness Tracker",
    "content": "My Pixel 3A will not connect to my budget Fitness Tracker, but my 4 year old Lenovo P, now passed down to another family member has no trouble accepting it. I have tried all the usual fixes, but nothing works. I am willing to buy another fitness tracker, but am concerned that the same thing will happen, and there seems to be no way of knowing in advance if it will connect ok. Wondered if anyone could tell me of a fitness tracker or smart watch which they have connected successfully to the 3A. Not looking to spend more than Â£100. Thanks",
