    "content": "Hello. I traded my P3 for a P3a and I love the battery life. I can get 2-3 days on a charge, but the past week or two have been rough with Instagram. Drain is normal and pretty low for most of the apps, Instagram has normal drain while being in the app, but after exiting and closing, it persistently uses battery. I used Instagram for 40 minutes since yesterday, 8% in the app. I checked today, and I noticed that it used 34%, even though I didn't use it since yesterday. This was at 4:00 pm. At 8:00 PM, I hadn't open instagram and it jumped to 37% usage from the battery, showing that it was used for 2 hours and 50 minutes in the background. I force stop the app and background restrict it and still used the battery to 39% consumption of battery. I forgot to screenshot before deleting it, but those are roughly the stats since yesterday. Why is it using so much battery in the background and why does it use battery in the background even if I restrict and force stop it? How can i resolve it? I've deleted the data, clear cache, reinstall, same result. I could get 3 days on a charge, but this is screwing me over. I'm thinking of using the web version in the mean time..... Please help! Thanks",
