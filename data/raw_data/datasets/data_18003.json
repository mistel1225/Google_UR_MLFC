    "title": "Using voice calling, \"Hey google, call [Name Here]\", phone calls party not on contact list.",
    "content": "To my understanding and reading Google's description of voice command and calling features at the pixel Safety and Regulatory page it states:\n\n\"Allows you to dial a\n\nnumber by speaking the person's name, if it is stored in your contact list (a personal \"telephone book\" you create in your phone)\"\n\nExample:\nLet's say I have a friend named \"Kitty\".  I want to call them.\n I say\" Hey Google, Call Kitty\". \nWhich instead of proceeding to call the person in my phone, decided to call: www.kitty.com customer service and sales department ....for feline consumer products. \n\nYes this happened and the customer rep was equally as surprised as I was. \n\nI've never shopped there, been in their website and I reckon my phone shouldn't have that service. But since it happened exactly like that, I've since disabled voice calling. And I of course double checked that the number did not exist in any of my several contact list. I.e. Google contacts, Android, Gmail, previous devices (Motorola phones mostly) also take note it did not happen on wifi but 3g/4g whatever G were up to this week. I was traveling in a vehicle ðŸ˜‚\n\nAnyone ever have this happen?",
