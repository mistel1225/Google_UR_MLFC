    "content": "Mine was working then stopped. I deleted the face and tried to put it back in and the grid that was on the setup isn't there. I managed to do it on the \"fast setup\" but does not work as well as it did. Spent alot of time with tech support. They said factory reset. I did it. Lost a bunch of stuff and its still doing it. First problem with the phone only one week in,",
