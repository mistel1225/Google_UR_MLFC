    "title": "Pixel 2 xl will not charge with factory power supply. Shuts off when charged with any other supply",
    "content": "I recently have encountered the pixel 2 xl shutting off when plugged in for recharging. The factory power supply does nothing when plugged in. All other chargers shut it off but it does charge. Have tested in safe mode as well. Based on the forums, this is a known hardware issue? It's impossible to find contact information for Google to call directly. Phone is maybe 7 months old.",
