    "content": "The device clocks around 39-42Â°c with normal use such as browsing and listening music. Is this acceptable temperature because the phone does get warmer around my hands and I don't even play games. \n\nPlease advise so that I can proceed to get a replacement if it's a problem since the phone is brand new and it has only been one day of usage.",
