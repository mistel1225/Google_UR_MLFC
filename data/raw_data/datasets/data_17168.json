    "content": "Hi \nWhen I used to make call, the other person is not able to hear me. This is occasional, when I disconnet and try to connect after some time the issue resolves. \nI did check my microphones with voice recoder app and vedieo app. this is running quite good.\n\nCleaned the debries around speakers, usb port and microphone hole on top, still the issue pressisits.\n\nI don't have any difficulty in listening to music or vedieo till date. I am only facing the issue while making a call. One more thing I did try to put my phone in speaker mode and Bluetooth speaker mode to check the issue. Yes it still persist\n\nCan anyone suggest solution, it will be really helpful",
