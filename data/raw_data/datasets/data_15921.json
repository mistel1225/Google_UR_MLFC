    "content": "My Pixel stand stop charging after updating to the latest Android version on Monday, 9/21/20. When I put my Pixel 4 on it, orange light is on and a few seconds later, white light will be on, then turned off. Then it's no longer charging. After that, a minutes later, orange light is on solid. It has started after I updated Android to the latest.\n\nI tried troubleshooting and no change. It seems if the phone is already 100% battery, Pixel stand behave normally.",
