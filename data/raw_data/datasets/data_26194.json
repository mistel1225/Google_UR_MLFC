    "content": "When I (Pixel 3) call my wife (Pixel 2XL), she will pick up and I will see the timer start, yet I do not hear anything. This happens equally as often as when she calls me. We usually have to call and hang up three times until we hear each other. A few months ago it was just once, we thought it was Verizon dropping calls. It is now evident that it's not just a dropped call. \n\nWe are both up to date with updates. \n\nAny thoughts?",
