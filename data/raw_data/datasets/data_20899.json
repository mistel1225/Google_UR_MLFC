    "content": "Goggle had to extend the android & security updates program to atleast 5 years for the Google owned pixel devices and this could be revolutionary change when compare to the competitors like apple. No other device is offering continuous updates  expect apple. It's not enough for us to stick with pixel phones. Android updates, pixel camera this is the only reason to buy pixel phones and also it's not worthy to spend lots of money to pixel phones if there is no longer updates after 3 years and it's disappointing factor. Also it tends to the main drawback of Google devices. After every 3 years all of us can't upgrade to new device so this should be undertaken\nThe newly introduced Pixel Feature Drop. We want that to be released at least every 2 months once or monthly basis\n\n\nAs a Fan of Google Pixel this is the request from not only me , whole fan club of Google Pixel family.",
