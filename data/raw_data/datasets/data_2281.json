    "title": "Pixel 5 overheats when recording, only 6 minutes tops at 4k60fps",
    "content": "Today I tried to record a video as any other day, at 4k 60fps, everything was great untill the phone stopped filming, again, now at 6 minutes 37 seconds, it said that my phone was \"too hot\" and that it had to cool down before continuing filming, what?? I was in a room with an AC on, at 21Â°C, had the phone in my hands without a case and it overheated at just 6 minutes of recording, this is unacceptable. \nIt's not the first time that this has happened, I searched for the issue online and I'm not the only one that has suffered from it, people just post about it everywhere else except on these forums I guess, but even in the google support (this one) I'm not the only one with the issue, is this because of a defective number of units?\nHow am I supposed to save my memories? I bought the Pixel because it's supposed to be the best of the best from Google, but what matters if the phone locks at 6 minutes on recording at high quality, and don't even think to say that you recommend to lower the quality and record at 1080p, because if I wanted to record at a lower quality I would have bought a 2013 phone, not a 2020 Google's flagship Pixel 5, it's supposed to be the best camera of yours, how does this happen? I would like to have a replacement, If my unit is broken I want to make valid my warranty, I will be waiting for a response, thanks in advance.",
