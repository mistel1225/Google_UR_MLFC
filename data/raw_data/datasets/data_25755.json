    "content": "My assistant was working OK by voice until about two days ago. Now, my assistant will not set timers or alarms via my voice. The assistant says the alarm is starting, and opens the clock app, but no action is taken. I did find that the assistant works fine when I squeeze my phone. \n\nI followed a few of these google community posts and uninstalled the updates for the google app, then re-installed. I have also rebooted the phone several times. None of this has made a difference. What is the fix to this???\n\nI have had previous issues with the assistant, but everything smoothed itself out after a few weeks, until now. My assistant used to start a series of alarms, then was fine, and now nothing. \n\nDevice: Pixel 4XL\nCarrier: GoogleFi\nCountry: US\nAndroid:10",
