    "content": "Earlier today, my contacts app automatically updated. Before then, contacts from Outlook (my business Office 365 account) showed up in my contacts, thus names were also displayed in the Messages and Phone Dialer app. Now all that are displayed is numbers. No names when calls come in. Or on messages. I'm beyond frustrated. I've tried connecting it manually in the Contacts all, but now it appears that unless it's a Google account, it won't let you. Previously if I created a new contact, my phone asked whether I wanted it stored in my personal Gmail or business Outlook account. Not anymore. I can't believe they too away this basic functionality. Anyone else find this issue and find a way to fix it (beyond manually exporting and importing contacts - my change daily).",
