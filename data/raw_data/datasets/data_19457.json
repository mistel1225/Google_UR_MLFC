    "content": "I have tried factory resetting, turning Bluetooth on and off, forgetting existing Bluetooth connections, etc. The Bluetooth will periodically skip/cut out when listening to music. The songs continue playing but random bits just cut out for a less than seemless experience. I have the latest update that was supposed to fix some Bluetooth issues.",
