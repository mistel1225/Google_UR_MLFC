    "content": "I've turned off my phone for about ten minutes, I did put a bit of twisted up tissue down the jack port which soaked up a lot of liquid and wiped down the whole phone. Didn't realised that doing so isn't advisable untill looking it up. \n\nThe phone was half submerged for like two seconds before I got it out and immediately started whipping it down with tissue. Usb port has been automatically disabled, what should I do now?",
