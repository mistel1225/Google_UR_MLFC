    "content": "A message randomly pops up asking how I want to complete an action. Does it in the middle of texting, phone calls, working out, just sitting there, even while driving. Sometimes I'm holding it, sometimes I'm not near it. No particular reason. It only offers media apps as choices, mostly music ones so I think it has something to do with an audio thing. Can't figure it out though. If I choose it to always select an app, then it will constantly opens that app. It makes using the phone a miserable experience. Anyone else having this problem?  Has anyone found a solution. I partly wonder if it has something to do with my Fitbit Charge 3. ",
