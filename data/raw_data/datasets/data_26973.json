    "content": "Hi community,\n\nwhat is the optimum setting within developer settings for DPI? Currently the \"small\" setup is not small enough. I owned a pixel 2 prior to the new pixel and also altered the DPI settings to get more space on screen.\n\nDoes one recommend a good DPI setting which does not tamper with UI // causing other issues when using apps?\n\nBoris",
