    "title": "My Google Pixel 4 can't play embedded Twitter Videos in the Chrome Browser. Any update coming?",
    "content": "I want to be able to watch the Twitter videos in Google Chrome that news sites embed in their articles and pages. At best, it is very stuttered and at worst doesn't play the Twitter video at all. I get sound to come through, but the video will not play or, if it does, skips terribly. Sound also has a tendency to skip if the video jumps. I spent 30 minutes with Google Tech Support yesterday and it didn't resolve a thing.\n\nOther video systems within the browser tend to work just fine.\n\nIs this a common issue or is my phone defective?\n\nI want this repaired with an OTA update or a new, functional phone being sent to me. I do not want to waste any more of my time trying to get my nearly-$900 phone to perform a basic function.",
