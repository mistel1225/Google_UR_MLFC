    "content": "The Google Pixel I bought on July 2017 now is totally unreliable: when it is approaching 30% of battery charge, the phone will shut down, and it wont start anymore. I need to charge it for 15 minutes before it could just start. \nI am totally disappointed, i believe i bought the best phone ever, instead it is the MOST expensive phone i bought and it lasted less than any other phone I bought in the past.\nTotally disappointed.",
