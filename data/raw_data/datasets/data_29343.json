    "content": "My usb-c to headphone adapter has stopped working completely. I use it every day, I have not twisted it at any strange angles to damage the port inside. My charger is still working so I know there is nothing wrong with my phone. I have tried cleaning the slot and the dongle and tried to make it work through different positions but it seems to have died. What do I do?",
