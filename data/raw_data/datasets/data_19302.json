    "title": "Replacement phone not being shipped despite repeated conversations with customer service",
    "content": "Due to address issues my replacement device was shipped back and now even after repeated conversation with customer service my device is not being shipped back. At first the customer service representative told me phone would be put on hold and I can get the phone from the fedex distribution center but contrary to what was said the phone was shipped back to the sender. A day later I asked the customer service to send the replacement phone and they said the matter is escalated to concerning team and they would get back to me asap. Fast forward 2 days later I contacted the customer service team and they had the same robotic reply that the case has been escalated to the required team and they cannot do anything and I should wait for the team to get back to me. A day later I again got back to the customer service team and they replied with the same reply that the respective team would get to me within 48 hours for sure. Fast forward another 2 days nobody contacted me and at this moment I think if the team which will contact me even exists. Despite repeated conversations with google customer service team my case was not resolved and nobody had any idea to do anything. This is the WORST customer service experience. I am wasting my hours to get this issue solved but all in vain. Highly disappointed and never buying a google hardware again.",
