    "content": "When I post an image to instagram it doesnt save to my google photos.  Save images / posts to device is \"on\" in the instagram app.  Previously on my S9 the images woud autimatically save to the device under the \"instagram\" file in my photos. Now this does not happen, actually I just edited and posted several images and only (one ) of them saved to my google photos \"instagram\" file. Very frustrating.  i deleted and re-posted one of them and it still did not save ??  What is the problem ?",
