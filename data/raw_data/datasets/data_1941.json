    "content": "When I tried to use Google's camera app today, it completely shutdown the touchscreen! It happened to me a couple of days ago as well, which I was able to fix by hardware-restarting in the boot-manager and choosing the recovery mode. It may have been a fluke though, because it doesn't fix the issue now.\nDoes anybody have an idea on how to get my phone working again? Preferably without doing a factory reset (for now, since I don't have a backup and am currently not able to make one).",
