    "content": "I've had my Pixel 4a for about half a year and suddenly stopped hearing any sound from my wired headphones. It shows that the wired headphones are connected, I've tried playing with the audio settings and all, restarted the phone 3 times, tried different headphones, checked for lint in the headphone jack but nothing seems to fix the problem. Audio plays regularly without anything plugged in and my Chromecast ang Google home work fine. Is this a hardware problem? Should I reach out for a new phone?",
