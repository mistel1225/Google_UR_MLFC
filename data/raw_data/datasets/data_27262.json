    "content": "I play a lot of games on my Pixel 2, PUBG is the one that I play most.\n\nHowever I get very irritated when the NavBar pops up with the gesture in middle of last round. \nThe Auto brightness keeps changing now and then, hence ruining my gaming experience.\nNotification popups keeps covering the area while playing.\nPhone turns to battery saver mode at 15%(though this is set by me but when you are in middle of a game one do not realise the battery percent and when the battery saver is switched on or off the game just exits). AND SPECIALLY WHEN ANY APP IS USING THE STORAGE OR IS DOING ANY READ WRITE OPERATION THE IS A LOT OF LAG WHILE USING ANY APPLICATION. \n\nSO IT IS MY HUMBLE REQUEST TO PLEASE CONSIDER THESE POINTS IN YOUR FUTURE OS UPDATES SO THAT EVERY GAMER USING PIXEL DEVICES GETS GOOD EXPERIENCE.\n\nThe reason I have written this in CAPS is that I am really frustrated, that even after buying a flagship phone made by the Owner of Android is not delivering a simple UX when it comes to Gaming. I was about to throw the phone, but just realised that I had paid a good amount for it and I cannot afford to buy another device.\n\nThank you for listening to me, hope to get a positive response.",
