    "title": "Pixel 4XL Camera and Video zoom freezing the camera.",
    "content": "This is happening on my Pixel 4 XL. \n\nWhen I use the zoom function on either the camera or video, once I get past 1.6 the image freezes. I am still able to move the slider, and even change modes, but the image locks. I can move the phone around, but the image on the screen will still be the one when I slid the zoom past 1.6.\n\nI have tried\nclearing the cache on the camera app\nclearing up space on the phone\ncleaning the lens\nFACTORY DATA RESET\n\nNone of this has worked. Even after the FDR, I open the camera app, and it does the exact same thing. Get to about 1.6 or 1.7 and it freezes. I would contact Google support about this, but apparently support through phone or chat is no longer available.",
