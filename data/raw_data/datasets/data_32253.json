    "content": "Hello I have a sort of serious problem, I have had a google pixel 1 for almost 4 years and I think it may just be old but for the past 6 months I have had my phone with only 6 apps installed with 4gbs left of storage, battery saver on, brightness low, location off, Bluetooth off, and service turned off. My phone when I'm on it goes dead around 41% I only get 90mins out of my phone if I'm lucky, also my phone battery drops when I'm not on it. I will have my phone in my pocket all day at 100% but as the day goes on it drops. I usually loose 30% in an hour. I really need some help I want my phone to last because I can't afford a new one. Please if you can help in anyway please do!",
