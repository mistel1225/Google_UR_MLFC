    "content": "I have tried Android 12 recently and since I didn't like having some issues on it, I decided to go back to Android 11.\nOn the way, of course it did factory reset, and I expected that Wifi networks passwords will be restored (using Google login, just as address book contacts get restored), but for some reason they are all gone. That's while they always got restored in the past.\nHow could it be? Any way to restore them? Maybe need to do a factory reset again?",
