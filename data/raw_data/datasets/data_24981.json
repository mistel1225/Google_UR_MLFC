    "content": "On incoming calls tapping the green \"answer\" box sometimes simply makes the box disappear without picking up the call.  That leaves the incoming call still ringing.  I have tried going to the phone app to try to answer the contact, but there is no clear way to do it.  I'm left having to try to call the person who was trying to call me.  Is there a way to answer after the \"answer\" box disappears?",
