    "content": "Hello,\n\nOnce a picture on my Pixel 3 is backed up, I no longer want to see it on my phone.   \n\nI don't want to see my photos from Google Cloud on my phone once they are backed up. \n\nI read the thread about deleting photos - and if the option to delete from the device is not there, then they are uploaded and you are viewing them from the cloud.\n\nHow do I turn off seeing photos from the cloud on my phone?\n\nSuggestions?\n\nThanks,\n\nV",
