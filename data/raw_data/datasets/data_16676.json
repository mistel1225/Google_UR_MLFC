    "content": "I upgraded to Android 11. When I tried to access the phone after the reboot, I had to enter my pin. I keep getting incorrect pin messages. The phone is not registered with Find My. I understand I need to do a hard reset to get around this.\n\nI cannot get the locked reset to work. How do I do that.\n\n--\nMatt Johnson",
