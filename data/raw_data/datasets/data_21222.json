    "content": "Just noticed a few days ago that my wife's and mine Pixel 3's are getting super slow data speeds (0.3-0.5mbps).  We are currently on total wireless, and have had zero issues until this month.  I noticed the issue the same day the latest security patch came out, the 5th of May.  However i have no idea if it has anything to do with the issue we are having, or not.....  On the other hand my parents are also on my account, who both have Samsung's and are having zero issues of any kind.  \n\nI have tried everything that's listed out there on the inter-web to try an resolve the issue.  APN settings, app settings, other mobile data settings, hard reboots, network reset, sim card pull, etc.....  I also tried putting my sim into a factory reset pixel 2, and still have the same result.  Only thing I have not tried yet is a total factory reset.  Tech support is non-existent at TW, which I have called 6 times now.  All other network settings are fine too, phone calls, texts, mms, and wifi have zero issues.\n\nAny comments, ideas, links for help would be awesome.  Thanks!",
