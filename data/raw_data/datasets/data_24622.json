    "content": "Hi, \nSince the March 2019 security update installed this morning the battery life on my pixel 3 is plummetting. I usually get about a day and a half. Now with the phone face down AND battery saver on it's still losing ~10% battery an hour! Battery usage shows says nothing is using it. Ambient Display is the biggest drain at 8%, follwoed by chrome at 3%. Considering my phone only has  8% battery left, that's a lot of battery being drained by something!\nThis is in addition to some horrific lag mostly when switching apps. Using the swipe right gesture to \"quickly\" switch between apps can result in the screen just showing the task switcher thumbnail of the app it's going to open for up to 5 seconds. While this doesn't sound very long, it used to be almost unnoticable. That's one example of performance degredation, I've have frozen black screens and an unresponsive UI a number of times too.\n\nThis update has really done a bad number on my phone. I don't know what to try to fix it. The obvious reboot didn't help. Factory resetting my phone would be a nightmare based on how many 2FA accounts I have set up on it.\n\nAnyone else suffering this or have any advice?\n\nCheers\n\nPete",
