    "content": "My pixel 4a is not charging anymore. Did recently update to android 11. At first it would only charge when phone was off. Now, no charge at all. Use the charger that came with phone and works on other devices. When it was at 4% tried factory reset but still couldn't charge. Try recovery mode and said no connection. Tried several button combinations and could not make it to recovery mode, battery at this point under 15%.",
