    "title": "Incoming Call Notifications - Show Silently",
    "content": "So I have had this problem since my Mi A1, recently just upgraded to Pixel 3. \n\nWhenever there's an incoming call, phone will ring but screen won't light up and show the call. I have to pull down the notification window to accept or reject the call. \n\nDid some research and found out about the settings to control the notification but it says \"Show Silently\" but it's grey out and I can't change the settings. \n\nI have attached a screenshot of the notification settings. \n\nPlease help!
