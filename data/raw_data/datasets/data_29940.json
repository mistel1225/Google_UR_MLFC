    "content": "I brought a new Google Pixel XL and the battery loses like 10 - 20% of its power in an hour. I have tried many ways to slow it down but it was getting faster. I don't know if it's a battery problem or something it just soaking the battery life. In Setting > Battery and you can see a thing that says the how long the battery lasts with a full charge. I saw that it went from 19 hours to 18 hours. I don't know if that is normal or something is wrong.",
