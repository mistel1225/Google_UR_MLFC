    "content": "Over the past week my phone has not been receiving text messages from certain contacts. I have come to believe the majority of these contacts are Apple users. The messages are both text only and photos. What can be causing this? Was there a new Apple update that is messing this up or my phone? I have tried turning off/on and restarting my phone, but still nothing. I have AT&T as a carrier. I had this same problem when I first got the phone a few years ago, but it cleared itself up somehow.",
