    "title": "Android 10 Pixel 2XL Apps Auto Closing After OTA Update",
    "content": "I just updated to Android 10 OTA yesterday on my Pixel 2XL 128gb. I noticed that some of my apps (IE: Facebook Messenger) are auto closing right away on me. For example, the Facebook Messenger app chat heads usually stay popped up over other apps for quick access. However, with this new Android 10 update, if you try to have those chat heads stay open on the side of the screen, it just auto closes right away and is super annoying as I have to manually go in my app list to relaunch it everytime I want to use it. I've checked all settings are correctly configured in the app settings (IE: Stay open over other apps and Optimized) but to no avail. It's just a few apps similar to Facebook Messenger that have this issue and I made sure all apps are up to date in the Play Store. The apps don't really drain the battery that much to warrant an auto-close feature so not sure what's going on or why they'd change that. Any others having this issue or know of a fix? Thanks.",
