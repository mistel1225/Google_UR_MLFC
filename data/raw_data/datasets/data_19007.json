    "content": "I have a pixel 2 which is continuously rebooting from last 1 month, i tried to battery drain and do lots of thing like trying to go in the recovery mode but all in vain. I am not even able to put my phone in recover mode so that i can factory reset it. After press volume down + Power button the boot loader shows up and after selecting the recovery mode option via pressing start button the phone again starts to boot loop. Is there any fix?\n\nAll details regarding the troubleshooting i have tried please see below link\nhttps://issuetracker.google.com/issues/159411902",
