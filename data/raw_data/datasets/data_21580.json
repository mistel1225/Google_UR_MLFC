    "content": "I love my phone, but for about a year now my phone will randomly restart without warning. I find that this issue happens more often at low battery and especially if I am talking on the phone. It will always happen if I am talking on the phone at low battery (around 25 or 30%) and try to open any app like Facebook or Snapchat. However, around 30% battery life the phone has restarted itself even without me touching/ using it at all. Sometimes it will just say battery low and turn off. \n\nHas anybody had these issues? I love the phone but I am getting close to switching to a different phone.",
