    "content": "My Pixel cannot connect to my home wifi or any other wifi network or hotspots except for windows hotspots from my computer. This is a huge problem. I've tried everything possible including reseting, safe mode, updating android, going back to stock and updating again and nothing works out. I tried to connect to open wifi networks as well but still it doesn't connect. \n\nMy question is why does it only connect to windows hotspots? Why can't it connect to the normal home wifi which I normally do with all my other devices?\n\nPlease give me a solution if anyone knows a fix for this.\n\nAny help is most gratefully accepted.\n\nRegards,\nSandaru Tissera.",
