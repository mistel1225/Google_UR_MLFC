    "content": "After the Feb patch, my pixel is frustratingly slow. Even with developer options enabled and all the animations turned off, it's just...arrgh. Tried a full factory reset to see if that would help, and my pixel is even slower post reset. All my internet research just shows other people having the same problem, aggressive background app killing seems to be back to infuriating levels after the Feb patch too.",
