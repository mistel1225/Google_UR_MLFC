    "content": "Hey guys, unsatisfied with Googles shipping speed, I opted out of my purchase and went with JB Hi-fi instead, today I've broken my rear glass when it slipped off my coffee table while vibrating onto wooden flooring... It's about 40cm from the ground. I'm super annoyed & JB said I'll have to pay for the repairs & be without the phone. This is the flimsiest phone I've owned, coming straight from a Nexus 6P. Anyone got any suggestions for how I should handle this? Quoted $200 repair through Google store & ~$120 elsewhere. Apparently warranty isn't worth the paper it's written on. I'd call this fair wear & tear.",
