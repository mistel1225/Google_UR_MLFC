    "content": "My front camera starts to viber and make loud noise like it is going to explode when I turn the camera on. One of my friend who is a technician said it seems to be a malfunction of OIS part.\n\nThe rear one is fine. I think this is definitely the hardware issue. I would really like to have a repair or replacement of this. Using a pixel phone without half of its camera function is so funny and ironical.\n\nHere is the video, please turn the volume up.\nhttps://photos.app.goo.gl/8RcNur2hGcaLtBkT8",
