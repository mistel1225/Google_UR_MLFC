    "content": "I have a OnePlus 6T and I just recently got the Pixel USB-C buds and I love them. They're awesome. My only issue is about half the time when I use them and I tell Google to do something (i.e \"What time is it?\", or a Google search) it says \"Sorry, I'm offline. I can't do that.\" even though my phone would have full WiFi connection or LTE+.\n\nThis is extremely annoying because I purchased the earbuds mostly for this feature and it doesn't even work half of the time. I would greatly appreciate if someone can help me out.\n\nOS: Android 9.0, Jan. 2019 Security Patch",
