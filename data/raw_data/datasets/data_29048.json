    "content": "After backing up my 64 GB Pixel 2 xl photos and videos, and deleting them from my device to save space, under storage it shows I have 10.76 GB free.  When I try to download a 144 MB video (which I backed up) back to my phone I get an error \"Can't download video - storage is full\".  I've tried everything, including emptying the trash, and keep getting the same error, which is very frustrating.  Any ideas would be greatly appreciated.",
