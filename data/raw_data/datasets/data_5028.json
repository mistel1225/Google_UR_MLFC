    "content": "I've gone through the cars setup. I've checked with spotify as well. My buddy thinks it's an issue due to the default bluetooth setting.. or whatever hardware. He suggested going in as admin to change the default setting in pixel to something else. I was unable to figure out where I could adjust the default bluetooth configuration. I will legit send a custom tiedye shirt in whatever color pallet you want to whomever gets me past this issue. Thank you all for guidance. I don't like scrolling through my phone while driving. It's not safe, and I do allot of driving. ",
