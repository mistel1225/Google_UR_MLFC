    "content": " I believe that this is because under Settings > USB Preferences > USB Controlled By, the option \"Connected device\" is selected instead of \"This device\". When I try and select \"This device\", the phone begins to charge. Every time I connect the charger I was asked to select the usb preference.\nPlease advise how to resolve the issue.",
