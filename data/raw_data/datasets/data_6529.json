    "content": "I've been trying to connect to my school's network, but I can't seem to be able to. It's asking me a domain and I asked help from the technician of the school network, but he hasn't been able to help me connect saying that my phone doesn't want to connect.\nIt worked perfectly with my old phone it was the same exact model, but not the same SIM card.\nHow can I fix this??",
