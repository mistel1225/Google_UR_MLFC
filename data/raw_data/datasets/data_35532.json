    "content": "I'd like to be able to to turn off all vibrations and now it seems like I have to do it one app at a time, and some apps don't seem to have an option to turn it off at all. I just don't ever want my phone to vibrate. Why isn't there or where IS there a master setting to just stop my phone from vibrating?",
