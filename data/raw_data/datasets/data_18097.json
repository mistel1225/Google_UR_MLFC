    "content": "Hi, my Pixel 2 XL device was replaced by Google a few months ago under warranty, but recently I have noticed that the phone turns off and restarts itself. Upon further investigation, I realised this happens in the phone is turned upside down in my bag or pocket. If I shake the phone, I can feel something heavy inside moving. I contacted Google for help, but as the phone was out of warranty, they couldn't do much. Has anyone had a similar issue?",
