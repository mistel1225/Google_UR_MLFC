    "content": "I am trying to get my phone to charge at its usual fast pace, however it's been charging very slow for a while now. Takes well more than 3 hours to charge from 20% or 30% to 100%. Sometimes the cable has to be reinserted for it to begin charging. I've even bought a new usb type c-type c charging cable from the Google Store, but even that didn't do the trick.",
