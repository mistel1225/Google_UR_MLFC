    "content": "I took my Pixel 2 XL in for a warranty repair (cracked screen.) The ubreakifix technician informed me that during the repair, the motherboard was damaged and a new one would have to be ordered. Fast forward a few days -- I pick up the repaired phone, reinstall everything (updates, app, accounts, etc). Anything that is graphic heavy like videos or games and it goes all choppy. Crap video card? Processor? I'm at a loss.",
