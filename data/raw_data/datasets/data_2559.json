    "content": "Hi everyone!\nI noticed that in the beginning of every video there's kind of vibration sound. It seems fair in camera app since it's vibrating when you push \"Record\" button, but the problem is still happening when I do it with instagram's camera (it doesn't have vibration on start of recording)\nI attach 2 videos where you can hear it: from camera app and from instagram camera",
