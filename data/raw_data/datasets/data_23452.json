    "content": "Caller cannot hear me, I cannot hear the caller. \nOnly when I turn speaker phone on will mic/speaker work\nUsing Pixel 3, system up to date Android 10 with 10/5 patch\n\nSolutions tried:\n- Phone Restarted\n- Uninstalled/reinstalled phone app\n- Uninstalled/reinstalled google app\n- Start in Safe mode did not work\n- Even air blasted the USB-C/speakers\n\nOnly option at this point is a factory reset, honestly I don't want to do this. Suggestions? Anyone else dealing with this?",
