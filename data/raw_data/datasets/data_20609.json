    "content": "Hello there,\nDue to Covid I am stuck in a country with no google stores or repair services available. Can I send it to another country to get repaired and get it sent back to me , if yes what country would be the best if I am currently in Latvia.\nUK repair says it send only back to the country it has the repair service booked. But Could I send it to say Germany and get it sent back to Latvia?\nConsidering that the mail in address Google provides is in Poland on the mail-in slip , can in not be sent to another country afterwards?",
