    "content": "My Pixel 3 suddenly and unexpectedly stopped working completely. I need to recover the data from the internal memory, however I note that if I send it back to google for a warranty claim, a new phone may be provided but the old phone and it's data may be kept by Google. What are my options to have the data recovered before the phone is replaced? Noting that recovering the data is the priority. Thanks.",
