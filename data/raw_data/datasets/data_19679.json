    "title": "How do I add \".co.uk\" to my options when typing in email/urls?",
    "content": "When typing in an email/url you can hold down \".\" and it gives you options for ending the email/url but it does not have the option \".co.uk\"\nI send emails to people who have the \".co.uk\" ending and have to type this in myself and just wondered whether there is a way I can add that to the options already there. \nThis is especially an issue when I am typing in my email address as I do not use a gmail account but I use a \"hotmail.co.uk\" account and this is not suggested when a website asks for an email and then is even longer to type in manually. \nAny help appreciated! Thanks in advance",
