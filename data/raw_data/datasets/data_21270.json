    "content": "My Pixel 4 won't turn on.\n\n1. Pressing the power button and holding it will not turn on my phone, like I need it to, but it will snooze my alarm after varying press and hold times.\n2. Calling myself from another phone will not make the phone turn on, or turn the screen on, but it will ring.\n3. Plugging my charger back in does not turn on the phone/screen, but the phone still makes a noise to say that a charger has been connected.\n4. Twisting the charger to make sure it's oriented correctly and plugging it back in does not turn on the phone/screen, but yields the same results as #3.\n5. Taking off my case and wiping my screen clean does not make my screen turn on.\n\nHow do I:\n\n1. Get my phone to turn on?\n2. Get my phone to stay on?\n3. Prevent the same thing from happening again?",
