    "title": "why does my ringtone volume drop as soon as a call comes in?",
    "content": "tl;dr Every time a call comes in my ringtone volume drops to below 25%. How can I fix so that it always stays at max?\n\nI open up the Sound settings. All volume controls set to max. I call my number from another phone and while it's ringing, the Ring & notification volume slider goes 3/4ths of the way to the left!! I hang up without answering and the slider goes back to max.\n\nWhat is going on??? This is very repeatable. Both Google Voice and Sim number calls come into this phone and the same things happens no matter which actual number I call. There are no rules set on this phone.\n\nHow can I keep the volume on max?",
