    "content": "I've had this issue with 2 pixel 4xls now. The first one I returned. The 2nd one I got as a replacement is in the process of being returned. So hopefully 3rd time is a charm? \n\nI'm getting like a reddish blotch on the bottom left corner of the screen, and just above that is like a washed out green blotch on the left hand edge of the screen, just above the red blotch. \n\nMy first phone was really bad. It just kept getting worse and worse. The green blotch on the left edge eventually turned into a bright purple line. The 2nd phone isn't quite as bad, and I kept thinking I was just being picky. But, whenever I am reading an article with a white background, the red blotch is insanely distracting. I figured I shouldn't have to deal with this for the price I paid for this phone. \n\nI notice it mostly when white and grey is displayed on screen.  I was curious if this is an issue other people are having. Or if I  just had bad luck by getting 2 defective screens in a row. \n\nI'll post an update comment and let you know how the 2nd replacement performs.",
