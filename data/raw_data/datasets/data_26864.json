    "content": "My Google News Feed articles have included Ads for the last few months which is bad enough.  However, now I'm receiving clickbait-titled Ads encouraging me to open the link to find out what they're talking about.  This is disheartening that Google would allow this and although I've never owned an iPhone but with this latest provocation you can guarantee I'll be looking to abandon Google this fall if these practices aren't reversed.\n\nThis is shameful.",
