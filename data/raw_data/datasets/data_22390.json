    "content": "When I listen to podcasts in my car through the bluetooth stereo, the notification audio does not go through the stereo. The phone's built-in speaker plays the notification sound, but it's at quite a reduced volume, and is sometimes impossible to hear over the road noise.\n\nDoes this work for anyone else?",
