    "content": "I have a google pixel XL and have recently installed the latest android update. Yesterday I tried to unlock my phone and the screen went black for 1-2 seconds before returning me to the unlock screen. This happens both when trying to input my password and unlocking with my fingerprint.\n\nI have tried restarting the phone multiple times, with no change.\nI tried opening the phone in safe mode, also no change.\nI turned off the phone and let it charge for a while before turning it on again, no change.\n\nI would be reluctant to do a factory reset because I don't want to lose my notes but would be willing to do so if it fixes my phone. Unfortunately, as I can not unlock it, I can't do a factory reset so I would appreciate some advice on how to do this if my issue cannot be fixed. Thank you.",
