    "title": "USB-C Pixel Buds Inconsistent Voice",
    "content": "I am having issues with my Pixel Buds (USB-C) voice settings.  In assistant, I have selected the \"Orange\" voice and it is used when I squeeze the phone or use the assistant without the Pixel Buds.  My issue is that all Pixel Buds notifications come through using a female voice (sounds very robotic --- not even as good as the regular assistant voice).  This happens when I am connected to the internet and appears to be a pixel buds issue.\n\nIs this an intended feature to speed up the Pixel Buds response time or a bug?",
