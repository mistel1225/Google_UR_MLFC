    "content": "I recently upgraded to andoid 10 on my pixel 3xl, and it was bliss until my battery died. \n\nUpon charging:\n-The home button doesnt work- I can't swipe up to see all open apps\n- The screen capture button has gone missing - When I hold the power button there's an emergency option and a power off option only.\n- Instagram- if I'm looking at my DMs and recieve a notification of a new dm, I have to close the Instagram app and reopen it to read the message.\n\n\nI've restarted two more times hoping it was a fluke. \nWtf happened to my phone amd how do i fix it?",
