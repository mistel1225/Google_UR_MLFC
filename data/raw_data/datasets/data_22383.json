    "content": "When I play back a Marco Polo that I recorded, it has a rhythmic tapping sound in the background. It's becoming quite distracting and I use MP a lot. This is just when I record polos. My friend's polos are fine. My husband has the Pixel 4 and his polos have the same issue. How can I fix it? I think it's a mic issue.",
