    "content": "I have had this Pixel 2 XL for about 8 months. Even from the beginning, I'd only managed 4-5 hours SOT. At this point, I'm getting 1-2 hours SOT. I've noticed my battery doesn't charge to 100% often, but if it does, it immediately drops to 98% right after taking it off the charger. I use the original charger as often as possible and only charge it when I need to. I've tried every solution Google says and other people's solutions. I've talked to Google Support a while ago and she recommended format my device. I did, but that didn't help. I got the same amount. A normal day for me is waking at 6:30, unplug phone at 7 and leave for school, then get home at 3:00. A normal day is 1.5-3 hours of use. I'm usually at 35% even after only those hours. I'm not sure what's causing all of this. Should I talk to Google about a replacement phone, replacement battery, or go through uBreakiFix? I can spend any amount of money, reasonably. I'm just mostly worried about time. Google could take 7-10 days and idk about uBreakiFix. Any suggestions?",
