    "content": "I have a brand new Pixel 3a, straight out of the box, and I can't get the fingerprint sensor to register anything at all. I can't even set up a fingerprint - I put my finger on the sensor, and nothing happens, no errors, nothing, as if it's entirely dead. Tried restarting it and no difference. Tried skipping this step during setup and going back into it under the 'security' menu - still no difference. I can only find comments about the fingerprint sensor being poor or finicky - nothing about it never working at all in any way.\n\nAm I missing something or do I have a defective phone?",
