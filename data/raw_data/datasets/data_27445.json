    "content": "It's so unfair to not have fixed the camera right away.  Many Pixel users, as indicated by the Camera app reviews, are having issues with using the camera. No, no troubleshooting steps work. The Camera ALWAYS stops working. It will might work once in a blue moon but 99% of the time the app CRASHES!!! A large amount of people, including me, bought the phone for the camera and the camera hasn't been fixed. What is being done to fix our camera app??",
