    "title": "Pixel XL (Gen 1) dead after Android 10 Update (Not powering, No indication)",
    "content": "Hi All,\n\nWhat Happened:\nUpdated my Pixel XL (Gen 1) with Android 10 software on 20th Sept 2019. \nDirectly after the update the phone did turn on but it reset itself 3 times when I went to use it. \nI left it overnight on the charger and when I woke the phone was completely dead. \n\nSymptoms:\nPhone will not power up.\nNo battery low indication when phone turned on or in charger (Screen completely black). \n\nWhat I have tried:\n- Every button press configuration (power, power+volume, all buttons) - (no change)\n- Different charger/cables (no change)\n- Connected phone to computer. Computer gave the sound like a device was connected but could not see phone in windows explorer and still did not get any indication on the phone. \n\nQuestions:\n- Has the software bricked the phone?\n- Has the software stopped me from charging the phone?\n- Am I supposed to just accept that after the Android 10 update my phone is now dead and I need a new one? This is completely unacceptable.\n\nIf other Pixel XL (gen 1) users that haven't updated to Android 10 yet, then I would be very careful. I waited 17 days before updating and still had issues with some sort of bug. \n\nCan the Google Pixel team please register this as an issue and help the community to resolve. \n\nThank you,\nMargaret",
