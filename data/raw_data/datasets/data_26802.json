    "content": "Hi there, \n\nJust got the pixel 4 xl recently. However, when k want to sync my google photos from my previous phone, it keeps on saying getting photos. Hence, i believe it is creating the lag in deleting pictures and taking pictures using my cameras as i cannot always preview my pictures right away. Has anyone know what to do to solve this?\n\nThanks",
