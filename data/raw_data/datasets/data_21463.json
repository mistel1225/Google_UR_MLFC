    "title": "Pixel 3XL will not charge from a cable",
    "content": "I have 2 Pixel 3 XL phones that have either won't charge at all via the charging cable (my phone) and one that will only charge sporadically (my wife's phone).\n\nThis is my second Pixel 3 XL as I had the same problem with my first phone, and had it replaced under warranty by Verizon.\n\nI was hoping someone might have a solution since this has been a recurring issue for us.\n\nWhat we have tried so far to resolve it:\nCleaning the charging port with compressed air\nCleaning the charging port with a pin\nCleaning the charging port with a small piece of a business card\nRestarted in Safe Mode\n\nFor one of the phones, the headphone jack continues to work even though it won't charge. For the other phone, the headphone jack works sporadically.\n\nBoth phones are out of warranty, so I am hoping to find a solution to this issue.\n\nCurrently we are using a wireless charger to keep the phones charged, but this is a pain, and a slow charging solution.",
