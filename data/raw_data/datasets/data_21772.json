    "content": "Last night when getting ready for bed I noticed that I had an update available for my Pixel 3a.  I started the update process, and all seemed well.  I logged back in to the phone, checked the weather for the next day, then set it by the side of the bed.  This morning it was displaying 4:32 as the time when I got up at 7:40, and was unresponsive.  I held the power button for 30 seconds, which caused it to power off, but now I can't get it to wake up.\n\nIt is currently connected to the factory charger, but nothing displays indicating that it is charging, and holding power button for various lengths of time does nothing.  Any suggestions?",
