    "title": "My Google Pixel XL running Android Q has been stuck in a bootloop for over a day. Help?",
    "content": "I've tried draining the battery and recharging the phone. I've gne int the bootloader but recovery mode (predictably) didn't work - it ust returns the phone to the bootloop. The only thing I can do through the bootloader is turn the device off. I have no idea what to do now.\n\nI really hope Google - or just anyone really - can help, cause I don't have any active warranty and I'm not in the greatest financial position to consider buying a new device. I'm currently deeply regretting upgrading to android 10 if this was the outcome that awaited. \n\nP.S.\nPlease, Google, don't ask me to find an authorised Google repair center cause I don't believe such a thing exists within my country. I just need a way to get my phone back. I've only had it for ten months and that's not really enough time to establish as a lifespan for any phone.",
