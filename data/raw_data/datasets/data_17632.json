    "content": "On my Pixel 2 XL, when connected to WiFi, any WiFi, the messages on all major social media (Instagram, Facebook, WhatsApp) get delayed (sending/receiving), sometimes never sent if I close the app. The moment I switch to LTE they instantly get sent/received. I have tried all the fundamental solutions (resetting router, factory resetting phone, adaptive battery disabled) with no result.",
