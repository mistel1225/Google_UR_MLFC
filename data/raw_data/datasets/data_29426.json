    "content": "I have observed a notable difference of charging time when my Pixel 2 is turned on compared to when is turned off.When is turned off is taking about 1.5 more hours to fully charge compared to when is turned on.Although this issue seems weird,I have read on different forums that the charging is done faster when is on due to software,compared to when is off and the software is not helping in the process of fast charging.Have you experienced something similar?",
