    "content": "I've noticed an issue with my Pixel 4 that other people have described but there doesn't seem to be a fix. If I charge my phone wirelessly above about 80% the battery percentage will jump to a higher number. For example it will jump from like 82% to 89% after taking it off the charger. Restarting the phone will reset it to the correct number of 82%. Also after a full charge the phone will hang at 100% but restarting it will also reset it to the correct 93% or 94% after using it for a little while. It's very annoying to have to constantly restart the phone to get an accurate battery reading. Apparently the March patch fixed this bug in 4a and 5 phones but I am still having this issue with my Pixel 4.",
