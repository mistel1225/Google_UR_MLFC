    "content": "I purchased a PIXEL 2 XL 218gb from Carphone Warehouse in JANUARY 2018, around a year later i developed problems but i just lived with it however as of recent the battery drain since the recent updates couldn't be ignored at this point the device is around 17 months old.\n\nGoogle customer support recommended on the 2nd of AUG a warranty replacement / RMA, so they sent labels and i shipped the phone frustratingly as i didnt purchase through the google store they cant send out replacement until they receive my old phone first.\n\nOn the 14th Of AUG i finally get my refurbished warranty RMA device and this device immediately has the well known Low Volume, No speaker phone, Fading Sound Issues, thinking it might have been a issue with the software i immediately updated the phone and backed it up using my cloud back up, this fixed the issues, only for it to come back under 24 hours later.\n\nSat on the phone all afternoon again to customer support who apologised and suggested yet another RMA warranty replacement, so this is the second time i am due to be without a phone for a significant period of time, if this 3rd pixel device is defective what are my options as i dont have the time to be printing shipping labels and going to the post office every 10 days.\n\nCarl wouldn't provide me with an email address as i really want one so i can make a formal complaint in writing .",
