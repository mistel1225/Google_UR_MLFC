    "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nI have some issues with the GoogleFit. \n\n1) The app does not update GPS data often for its route in walking except Google Maps or Camera is running and the screen must be on. In case the screen is off or those two apps aren't running, the route looks very rough, there's just few straight lines connected each other.\nI do not know how to force the app update GPS often when I am walking with my phone is in a pocket so that the route history should get more detail (smooth).\nNote that Location Accuracy and Location History are enabled and Fit notification is off.\n\n2) Sometimes the app does not save data of route for the current day, instead it updates GPS data overloading to route of the day before.\n\nI would like to know if there any solution for the issues.\nThank you.",
