    "content": "Updated to Android 11 this morning and now my phone won't display a percentage higher than 30%. Two different chargers and both keep flashing between 'charging' and  'plugged in, can't charge at the moment' within the battery settings screen.\n\nNeither charging cable is plugged into a computer. One is into a power board and one is into a rapid wall charger. I have also restarted my phone and it's still the same. \n\nAny thoughts or suggestions on how to fix this? :)",
