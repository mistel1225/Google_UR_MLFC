    "content": "For the longest my 5GHz hotspot worked fine but recently it has become suddenly unfindable by devices I used in the past to connect to the hotspot. When I switch to the 2.4GHz band, devices can see the hotspot again but the internet is unbelievably slow to non-existent. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",
