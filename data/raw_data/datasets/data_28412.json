    "content": "Hi,\n\nI have a 1st generation Google Pixel. I have been having problems with the phone for months now. I can't make or receive calls. When I receive a call, I answer and then the phone freezes and I have to restart the device by holding the power button long enough. Sometimes I answer it and it just returns me to the call menu (I don't know what its called, the menu when you receive a call where you can accept or reject the call). Sometimes it does successfully accept the call but there is no sound. And very rarely I accept it and I can hear the other person but the sound cuts like 20 seconds into the call. Same problems when I try to make a call as well. And not just with the Phone app, same problems occur when trying to use WhatsApp call. I have tried disabling some services, tried deleting the updates for the Phone app, tried deleting some apps and then all apps, tried Safe Mode, Factory Reset with my apps restored and Factory Reset with none of my apps/settings restored. None of it worked so far. The screen is cracked on the top left corner (I don't know if its related). I would like to know, is this a hardware issue or a software issue? Because (as I live in Turkey), there won't be much I can do in terms of repair if it is a hardware issue. So depending on that I will buy a new phone.\n\nThanks in advance.",
