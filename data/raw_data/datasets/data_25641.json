    "title": "Fast battery draining after Android 10 update on My Pixel XL",
    "content": "I have a pixel XL which was performing perfectly fine until I have upgraded the OS to Android 10. The battery is getting drained super fast after this upgrade. \nPreviously my phone's battery drained approximately 8 -10 hours after a full charge. Now its draining within 3-4 hours of minimal use and If i use the camera or Map application, it is draining more super fast like in 30- 45 mins from 100% to 0% percent. \nI rebooted the phone, cleared the cache, deleted unnecessary apps without any improvement. \nLast night when I went to sleep, it was having 85% charge. and in the morning my  phone is totally discharged and switched off.\nAlso My phone is heating like hell and performing very slow and started lacking after this upgrade.\n\nAnd I have sent an bug video that comes after this Android 10 upgrade to the id which is written on the Google Playstore. Please check that also. The issue is that task manger is showing the apps even though you clear them several times and if you try to open them from the task manager , It gives you a message that App isn't available.\n Please respond to this. I am not able to find any other way to contact you so raising this on your community. \n\nI am hoping you will see that and respond to me.",
