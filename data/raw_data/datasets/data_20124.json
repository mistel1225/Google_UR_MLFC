    "content": "The notification to control music playback disappears less than one second into a song. I can get the notification back if I launch the app, which is useless. Each new song brings the notification back - for less than one second.\n\nYES, I do have ALL of the notifications ENABLED for this app. The app is broken (google hates and wants to kill their play music app/service so I'm not surprised as much as I am incredibly inconvenienced) so I'm not surprised)",
