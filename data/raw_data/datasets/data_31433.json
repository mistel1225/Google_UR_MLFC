    "content": "I have an email in my junk folder that I delete to trash. When I empty my trash the email goes back to my junk mail. It is clearly someone trying to hack my account. No matter what I do, I cannot delete it off my Android Phone. However, it does not show up on my laptop email. How do I permanently delete this attack email?",
