    "content": "When receiving calls, the pixel will often not give any indication, or only vibrating - not ringing. This doesn't always happen, but quite often. I can have the phone in my pocket or right in front of me, and only notice the missed call much later. It is not in quiet mode, and the volume is plenty high.",
