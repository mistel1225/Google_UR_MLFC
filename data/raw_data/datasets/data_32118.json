    "content": "When I'm speaking on the phone occasionally the screen will change. Perhaps I hit it with my cheek or something, and when that happens the person I'm talking to can no longer hear me. With my old phone if I was on a call it didn't matter if I was texting or some other screen was up, I had no problem. Is there something that I'm not doing right?",
