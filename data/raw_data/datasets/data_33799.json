    "title": "certain apps notifications is not shown",
    "content": "I have installed a security app called \"YI Home\" to handle all YI IoT devices.\nIn all of my NON-Google devices the apps notifications are shown in the appropriate timing,\nONLY on the Pixel device the app's notifications are not shown even though they are fired.\n\nI have 2 more apps with the same weird behavior.\n\nI already made sure that all settings (General device's & app specific) regarding the notifications enabling & etc. are all correctly configured. Moreover, I have tried disabling / enabling the \"Adaptive Battery\" functionality with no change.\n\nWould appreciate any assistance in resolving the issue.\nThanks,\nOran",
