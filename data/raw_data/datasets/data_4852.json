    "content": "I bought a new Google 4a on 30-12-2020. After a very small crash in the first week (felt on grass) the Oled screen started to show some lines. Within a day the screen went completely black and I was unable to use my new phone. A repaircenter replaced the oled screen and the phone was working fine for about a  month. Then the same thing happend again! This time without a crass, liquids or pressure problems. First one line on the screen, then more and after a few days the screen went black again. Phone is still on but unable to use. How is this possible with a brand new Google Pixel 4a??",
