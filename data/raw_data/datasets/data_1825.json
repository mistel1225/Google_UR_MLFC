    "title": "Pixel 5 SMS Notifications repeating",
    "content": "When I open a new text message, I am getting notifications for other unread text messages again. \n\nTypical scenario, I send a text and they respond with \"OK\", I don't need to read it as I see the entire content of the message in the notification. I leave that message as unread.\n\nLater on I get a text from someone else that requires me to open and read it. When I open this message, I get notified again (with sound and on screen notification) of the prior unread message(s)\n\nThis seem to have a started in March.\n\nAnyone else experiencing this or know how to turn it off? I tried Google support via telephone and ended up disconnecting as I knew more about the phone than the person I was speaking with.",
