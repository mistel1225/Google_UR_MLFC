    "content": "My pixel 4 suddenly started giving issues last month. I returned it to Google in early March under warranty and was expecting a phone back in about a week. But nothing yet!\n\nOn top of it, they have stopped replying to my queries over email and left me hanging in uncertainty. Only thing they say is \"we are working on it\"!\n\nAnyone faced similar issue. They are not even ready to give me refund or my old phone. So I can't even move on! Worst customer service experience!\n\nCan anyone help or give suggestions?",
