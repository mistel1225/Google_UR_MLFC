    "content": "My phone has recently started randomly shutting down or restarting while the device still has plenty of battery power. If power levels are high enough (over about 50%), it restarts. If lower, it just shuts down. The battery also seems to be depleting quickly. I have tried all of the steps on the Google support page for this issue, including a factory reset, and it the problem has not been resolved. Any advice?",
