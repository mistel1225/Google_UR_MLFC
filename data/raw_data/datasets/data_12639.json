    "content": "i think since the OS upgrade, the charging station show orange light even when phone is not on stand.  I need to unplug/replug a few times and them the light turns to white and operating normally.  I tried all checks with the phone but the issue seems to be in the stand itself.  very aggrevating.  do these stands crap out?  its less than a year old",
