    "content": "My old Google Pixel 1 is stuck in an infinite boot loop. Neither recovery mode or the bootloader work; the phone goes right back to the white Google loading screen. I know this is an old phone, but I wanted to get a few more months of use out of it and it seems that no one has a solution to the problem. My question:\n\nWhich iPhone should I get to replace it?",
