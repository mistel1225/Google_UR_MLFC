    "title": "Google Pixel pattern not recognized",
    "content": "I was using my phone as normal, and for a moment, I turned my phone off and left it. When I came back to it, it would not recognize the pattern I have been using since I got it in November. I use my fingerprint most often, but I also occasionally use the pattern, which is how I noticed it wasn't working. Fortunately, I could still use the pixel by unlocking with my fingerprint. So I unlocked my phone that way, and went to settings to try to reset the pattern or something. Of course, I can only do that by using the pattern itself. It didn't work there either. There are no problems with my screen or anything at all, my phone just no longer recognizes the pattern. Is there anything I can do? I haven't tried rebooting it because I'm worried that I'll end up permanently locked out when I'm required to input the pattern. I did just make sure everything on it is backed up, so if I need to, I could completely reset it, but that's honestly such a pain, and really, this could happen again anyway, so I'd like to understand what in the world is going on here and know an easier way to fix this. I have been really happy with the Google pixel so far, after switching from Apple phones that kept having endless problems, so I hope this can be fixed. Thanks.",
