    "title": "Chronic connection loss on cellular network on Pixel 4 XL",
    "content": "I am coming from a Nexus 6P where I would stream content during nearly 2 hours of driving and now I drive the same routes everyday that I did with my 6P on the same network (Sprint). My Pixel will often say \"not connected\" and will stay like that unless I select the airplane mode and then press again to deselect after a few seconds. Then LTE will engage again and everything will work okay for a while then it does it again. It does it so often that it's actually embarrassing when I have passengers and very frustrating. I don't quite know what to do. I have restarted and checked for new updates top no avail. It has done this store the first day I've had it. I don't know if it has to do with eSim or what but I wanted to find out.",
