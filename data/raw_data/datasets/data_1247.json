    "content": "Since the May update. I am facing a strange issue. \nWhen on home screen. Everything works. I'm able to interact with the full touch screen and access the notification panel.\n\nAs soon as I open any app. The top 1 cm of the touch panel becomes unresponsive. I can't access the notifications panel or interact with any button in that space. Like if I open chrome. I can't click on address bar or the refresh button etc...\n\nIf I change view to landscape. Everything with work except the 1cm area to the extreme left.\n\nI feel this is a bug.\n\nPlease help as I love this phone.",
