    "content": "Phone suddenly in white screen bootloop today. Endlessly scrolling progress bar under Google logo. Turned right back on after forcing it to shut off to same screen. Tried safe mode startup. Would not boot to boot loader, display diagnostic responded though and gave message about update of some sort. Now, won't go past dead robot and no command screen. Volume keys don't respond, so I can neither turn it on nor can I turn it off - it just restarts itself. I can't do a factory reset because I can't get to the safe mode screen because the volume keys don't respond.",
