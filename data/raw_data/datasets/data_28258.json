    "content": "I hate auto-rotates so I always have it turned off. I never have it turned on. There are some apps that force the phone into landscape, which is fine and unavoidable. But apps that should work fine in portrait (and usually does) sometimes force my phone into landscape and then it gets stuck there. How do I disable auto-rotates entirely? It really drives me nuts. I want my phone to stay in portrait and not randomly rotate to landscape.",
