    "content": "My Pixel 4a is not able to connect to mobile network. I am not able to call, send SMS or use mobile data. There is a little X on a signal strength icon. Also in the SIM status in about phone it shows that network is unknown. The phone is SIM unlocked and I did all the updates.\n\nSteps I tried so far:\nI tried turning airplane mode on and off,\nturning the phone on and off,\nremoving / reinserting the SIM card,\nusing a different SIM card,\nusing an eSIM instead of a SIM card (it connects successfully but there is not connection),\nfactory reset.",
