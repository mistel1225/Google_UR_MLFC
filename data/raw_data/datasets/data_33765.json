    "title": "Why is Google not fixing the widespread screen defect on the Pixel 3? Green wcreen and flashing",
    "content": "My screen is defective. Appears to be a widespread hardware issue. Brand new phone, 5 days old and every time I try to use it, it blinds me with sporadic green screen and flashing and text can not be read or seen. $800 and not as good as a $50 phone from Wal-Mart. Very unhappy and about to return it and never purchase another Google product again. Seems like this could be a huge class action lawsuit for selling thousands of lemons. Google can't fix this issue and continues selling then and pretending they don't know about it, yet it is on every forum you can find.",
