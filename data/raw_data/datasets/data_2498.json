    "content": "All icoming calls do not show up at all, only when I check call history I see them. For messaging, any text sent from an iphone does not show up. I de-registered my number from iMessage, yet the problem persists. Lastly, all texts do not show up in any form of notification, even after trying all the options in settings.",
