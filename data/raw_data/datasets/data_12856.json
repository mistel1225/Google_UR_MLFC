    "content": "Got this phone a couple months ago and randomly I'll try to open and app and it starts to load and then crashes and brings me back on the homescreen. Cache wiping does nothing, and the only thing that can \"fix\" this is a restart. This phone is friggin' new and it's ridiculous that this happens about once a week/two weeks.\n\nAlso, once this happens NO app can open. It does it for all of them.",
