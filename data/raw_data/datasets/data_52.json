    "content": "I reset my phone going from Android 12 beta back to 11. I went to backup in settings and backed up everything that I could (it was set to automatically do so every day but I did it in case something was not backed up since it did it last 8 hours prior). After resetting the phone and setting everything back up, I noticed all my files are gone including folders pictures and videos, audio, and downloaded documents. I assumed files along with system data and settings would all save just like they do when uploading other devices onto a new phone but only stuff like Photos, Contacts, etc. saved. Would there be a place to find any of this? Google photos doesn't have any of those folders and the Files app is empty.",
