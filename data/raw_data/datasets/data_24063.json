    "content": "Hello,\n\nFirst of all, i had issues with bluetooth. A message said me it stopped working. I tried in safe mode and it was working so i tought about a new app installed which can cause the issue. I have uninstalled all the latest installed app but i was always having the issue. Then, it occured with the WiFi. Same symptoms. I have tried in Safe Mode (in order to backup and make update) and now it doesn't work anymore.\nSo, today my phone has no connectivity except data provider.\n\nCould you help me please ?",
