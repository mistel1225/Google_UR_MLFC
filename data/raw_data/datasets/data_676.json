    "content": "I have deleted hundreds of pictures and dozens of apps trying to create storage space. Whatever I do does not affect the phone. It still reads that I'm maxed out for storage space and my apps will not work properly. This phone is as useful as a pile of Buffalo dung. This is the last Google phone I will ever own.",
