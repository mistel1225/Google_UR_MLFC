    "content": "Hello from PH! A friend of mine bought a Google Pixel 3XL in Canada last year; he gave it to me just recently (at least 2 months ago). There was no problem at first, but few days after, it shuts down randomly even if the battery is not yet empty. Weeks after, every time I watch videos online (e.g. on Facebook/Youtube), it also shuts down. Then one time, it just didn't want to charge; I even thought the problem was with the charger because when I tried charging it in a convenience store, it worked. However, now, the problem came back - it doesn't want to charge again. I even tried on a convenience store but didn't work this time. Whenever I plug it, an icon of a charging battery blinks but the charging won't continue; also, the phone can't be turned on. Please help me. Thank you!",
