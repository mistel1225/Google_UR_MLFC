    "content": "Hi! So we've recently got ourselves a Google Pixel 4XL. I love everything about the phone so far, still trying to figure it out but anyway. I play a lot of mobile games and a few of them run extremely slow. It's not the internet connection either, as some run better than others. What kind of options do I have in regards to having a game that runs without loading for more than 30 seconds? It'll just sit there and the little blue circle will spin. I came from a Galaxy S10+ and it had no issues running the game im trying to run on the Pixel. Are Pixels even decent for gaming? I figured that since Galaxy and Pixel were both Androids and Google Operated (just about), that it wouldn't be an issue running the same game. Please help!",
