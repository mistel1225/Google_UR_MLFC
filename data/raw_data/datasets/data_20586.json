    "content": "I bought this pixel 4 XL on release, since then it's worked great. Since the November security patch my face unlock is broken and will not work on my device. \nI've tried simply removing face data and re-enrolling. \nI've tried booting into safe mode and trying there. \nI've even went as far as resetting to factory settings and trying again but no dice. \n\nIs this a hardware issue? If so how do I go about RMAing this device?",
