    "content": "Yesterday, after updating to Android 10, everything went smoothly but my devices, when connected, show no internet access.  So far I've tried a Windows 10 laptop and another phone.  I have done a Network Setting Reset on my phone, but it did not help.  Any other ideas I could try?  This is the same across bluetooth, usb tether, and WiFi using Android 10 OS.  If I use pdanet's functionality it works, but my carrier kicks me off after about 20 minutes.  I confirmed with my provider I have tethering and hotspot on my account (AT&T).",
