    "content": "Starting last week my Pixel 4 battery indicator only shows 50%.  It dies within seconds of being unplugged.  When I try to turn it on it will show either a battery charging icon or a battery icon with a question mark in it.  It won't turn on until it's been on the charger for a few minutes.",
