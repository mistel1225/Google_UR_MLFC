    "title": "Pixel 2 XL not receiving all group chat messages at&t",
    "content": "Like several others lately (past week/noticed huge uptick in new posts in last 24 hours on old threads across various forums) I'm not receiving MMS messages through group texts. This seems to be an issue on Pixel 2/XL although I can't confine it to AT&T since several other are posting about it on the Google Fi forums as well. Seems to be very similar to what happened this time last year and the fix for at&t customers was to disable \"4g lte enhanced\" switch in network settings. I've tried multiple sms apps, verifying apn settings, resetting network settings, nothing works. Only thing I haven't tried is factory reset. I did just turn off enhanced 4g lte switch so I'll reply back tomorrow if that works. Can we get an investigation into this Google? Just started up again in the past week.",
