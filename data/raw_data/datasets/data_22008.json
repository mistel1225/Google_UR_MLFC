    "content": "Twice this has happened now. I'll be using my phone and the screen will become unresponsive, then go black. I'll try a restart but will get the android logo saying my phone crashed and has corrupt data. I factory reset the first time.\n\nIt happened again just now except it went black and now wont respond at all. I can't get it to power on. I have it plugged in a charger and there is no indication that it is taking a charge. I had over 60% battery upon crashing.\n\nI've held power over 2 minutes straight with nothing. I've held power and volume down with no luck.\n\nHow do I get it to start and at least factory reset if the thing is completely bricked?\n\nI haven't downloaded any new apps recently or damaged the phone in any way. Why would it act up twice out of the blue?",
