    "title": "The microphone is not working in speakerphone mode",
    "content": "When I switch to speakerphone mode on my Pixel 4 XL, the microphone stops working, i.e., totally muted. I can hear the other party perfectly but they can't hear me. I can talk on the phone when it is next to my ear (not speakerphone). I can't tell if it's a software or hardware problem.",
