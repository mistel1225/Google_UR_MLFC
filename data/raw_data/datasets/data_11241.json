    "content": "Looking for guidance here, 6.5 weeks ago I sent my Pixel 4XL in as the back panel was separating from the phone. It was deemed a manufacturers defect and they mailed me a refurbished phone. The phone never arrived, I have filed a claim with FedEx and Google. Google just keeps emailing me saying the escalation team is working on this, FedEx says it's Google's issue to deal with. I can't get any answers, nor will Google send me my original phone. I feel like I've been ripped off, and I can't get anyone on the phone to help with this. Am I missing something or should I give hope? Thanks in advance for the help!",
