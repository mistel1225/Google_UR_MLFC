    "content": "In the last week or so my bottom mic has stopped working, I tried the recording app and calls etc to confirm, speaker calls work as normal so it's the bottom mic failed, did factory reset and hey presto it worked again, reloaded all my apps etc and it stopped working again, figured I had a problematic app, did factory reset again and without putting old apps on tried the bottom mic and still not working, how do I actually get it fixed by Google, phone is less than a year old on a 2 year contract, first time Google phone owner after being with apple and huawei for years without any issues. Please help as I loved the phone (pixel 4xl) until now.",
