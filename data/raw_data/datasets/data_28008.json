    "content": "After updating to android 10, my Google Pixel XL constantly reboots after getting to the G logo and gets really hot for no reason when i turn it on. I don't think it's a battery issue because it does the same thing when it's on a wall charger. When it actually does load me onto my lock screen, it reboots again after about 15 seconds. Is there a way to revert back to android 9 or a way to fix this?",
