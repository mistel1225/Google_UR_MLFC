    "title": "Unable to set Ringtone using My Sounds",
    "content": "I've encountered what I can only think of must be a bug.\n\nSo when I first started using my new phone, I could set up custom ringtones with ease using the Sound settings and adding ringtones to 'My Sounds'. However, I downloaded a custom ringtone maker and edited a track to create my own ringtone, and used the ringtone maker to set it as my default ringtone.\n\nI deleted the ringtone maker after some time, which has essentially locked my phone from using any other ringtone than a generic one (labelled 554). I can't set it as any built in track, nor a custom.\n\nReinstalling that ringtone maker allows me to use it to set my ringtones. It appears to be the only way I can set a ringtone now.\n\nI am not sure how to remove that app so that I can go back to using the built in Sounds settings app.",
