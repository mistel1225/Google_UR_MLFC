    "content": "I  know how to turn off auto update for apps. I've turned it off and off and off! It seems to turn itself back on and update all my apps without my permission. Suddenly, I will notice an app is different and sure enough, it has updated and auto update is on. So, then I turn it off. A few weeks later, same thing happens. Is Google/Android turning it back on somehow?",
