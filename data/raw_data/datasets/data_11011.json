    "content": "Trying to use a wired headset for calls in a pixel 4a, the person on the other end only hears a loud buzz sound initially, then just some white noise for about 10 seconds, then buzz for about 20 seconds. Only after 30-35 seconds the person on the other side is able to hear me.\nThe same happens when I try to record any audio to test. The same happens in video. Safe mode also has the same issue.",
