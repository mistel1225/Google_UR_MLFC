    "title": "The bottom speaker on my pixel 4 xl is not working after the Jan 2021 security update",
    "content": "a) phone is not ringing\nb) calls with speaker function not working\nc) videocalls on Whatsapp and Facebook messenger app is not audible\nd) no alarms \ne) no message notifications \nf) only vibration\n\nI've tried safe mode, cache cleaning and factory settings reset, even visited the ubreakifix partner. Nothing worked.\n\nThe service partner said it's the recent security update but Google support is saying this is not a software issue.\n\nNot sure what to do with this unusable phone here. Extremely disappointed with a company like Google handling customers.",
