    "content": "What possibly could be the reasoning for restricting available colours in different countries?\nBlack, White and Mint will be available in Canada but not Orange...because?? \n Even if the orange is too popular and so out of stock, just make it available later as production catches up.\nSometimes, Google's decisions are quixotic.  Not that colour affects the device performance but it does affect some people's choice.",
