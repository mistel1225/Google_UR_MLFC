    "content": "Phone spontaneously displayed \"Data Corrupted\" message.  I attempted to turn it off.  Eventually ended up on a FastBoot Mode screen that continues to return an error message.  I cannot turn it off.  I cannot reload factory settings.  NADA.  I am not technical.  I am panicked because I depend on my phone and cannot afford to be without it while I mail it in to the factory.  Google wants me to use my phone to call support.  HaHa!  I would love to -- but my phone is broken.  I can email -- but that takes 24 hours.  Where is Chat?  Not working!",
