    "content": "I was upgrading my phone to Android 12 beta 1 and it forced me to factory reset the phone. Post the reset, while setting up the phone, on the Copy apps & data page when i choose 'Don't copy' it prompts me to enter the lock screen pin, after entering the correct pin, it gets redirected to Copy apps & data page. Even when i choose the google account instead of pin, it gets redirected to Copy apps & data page. \n\nHelp needed!",
