I have tried 1) restarting the phone, 2) turn on the safe mode, 3) turned off the phone, but nothing seemed to work. \n\nI have tested the affected part of the screen based on this article and the quick bar and notification move but releases in the middle of the screen. \n\nPlease kindly assist what I should do.
