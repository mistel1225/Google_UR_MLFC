    "content": "The camera on my Google Pixel 2XL stopped working a few weeks ago. The Google Camera app is FLOODED with users saying they are experiencing the same issue (black screen, app crashing, flashlight unable to be used). Google/Pixel Support is denying any knowledge that this is mass issue, but online forums and app reviews indicate otherwise. Users with Pixels 2-5 are reporting this issue, so Google's claim that it's a hardware issue for my individual device is a lie. Has anybody found a fix? I've tried everything. I'm trying to hold out for now, but ultimately I'm going to need to purchase a new device, and it will definitely not be another Google product after this terrible, negligent experience. I've cleared data, cache, uninstalled app, safe mode, airplane mode, sent bug reports .. everything! Help!",
