    "content": "Hi,\n\nI'm trying to install the latest version of the factory image for the Pixel 4 XL, however I'm not sure which one I should use.\n\nI'm from France (carrier Orange), however the phone I bought is from a local reseller without any carrier link (therefore unlocked version).\n\nI would be tempted to use the all carriers version, however on the November update the OTA was QD1A.190821.014 (which is for USA and UK). For December, should I use the QQ1B.191205.011 or the QQ1B.191205.012.A1 ?\nFYI, the Google post isn't the same as what is written on the factory image download page, so kinda hard to guess.\n\nThanks for your help!",
