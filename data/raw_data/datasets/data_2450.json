    "title": "Pixel 4a touch screen has dead areas",
    "content": "a few days ago, the screen on my Pixel 4a stopped responding in some areas.  It's as if there are \"stripes\" of dead screen.  the top 1/4 inch does nothing, but other alternating stripes are still responsive.  If I turn the screen to landscape then I can click a widget that doesn't work in portrait mode and vice versa.  I cannot scroll the screen either without it stuttering as it goes.  Most of the time, whatever, I'm touching initiates a \"click\" rather than a scroll\".  So, on a news site, instead of scrolling, it clicks on an article that I did not intend.  I'm just trying to scroll, but my swipe registers as a click. Very frustrating.\n\nI need a replacement phone or screen.",
