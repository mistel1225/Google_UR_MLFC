    "content": "January 2020 update,This made my phone even worse, my pixel 3 xl had the \"Bluetooth keeps stopping\" bug where wifi and Bluetooth won't work so I had to turn off the phone completely for 30 seconds, then it would work for a while until it dropped again, I updated my phone and now not even that works, I tried to factory reset too and it just crashed the set up screen because while trying to connect to WiFi the Bluetooth keeps stopping error kept popping up, making the phone unusable, had to set up with cellular network, I don't understand why this happens because I had a regular pixel 3 before this and that one never had any issues, any advice? Right now I'm using cellular network because wifi and Bluetooth won't even turn on anymore after the update and if I try to the \"Bluetooth keeps stopping\" banner keeps re appearing every 5 seconds,  sometimes if I try to turn them on via the notification shade they just crash the settings app all together. THIS IS AFTER COUNTLESS FACTORY RESETS, I've tried downgrading to Android 9, reseting networks, force closing Bluetooth, nothing works, absolutely nothing.",
