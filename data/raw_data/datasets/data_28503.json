    "content": "Needed to replace a pixel 3 device and don't have access to the original phone.  When I log in to my account and choose the backup to restore it asks for my lock screen password and after I enter it, it spins for a bit and then asks me to check my network connection which I know is good in addition to the fact that I've tried on multiple networks.  Not sure if there is anything I can do to restore this backup?",
