    "content": "I'm unable to connect to a 4G Network when using my Pixel 2 phone using Sky UK.\nWhen I have used an EE SIM in my Pixel I was able to receive a good 4G Signal, but since switching to Sky mobile I'm only able to receive an LTE connection.\n\nIs this a know issue as I've read other posts that have had similar experiences.",
