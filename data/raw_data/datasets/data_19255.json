    "content": "Not 20 minutes ago I had an update notification (pixel 4 XL) which being out of band I assumed must be important, so I installed it, it was small around 2MB. I can't find anything on it but I do not have a newer patch date, still July 5th and I noticed that play protect was off which isn't supposed to happen since my account is on advanced protection? Anyone have an information on this update? ",
