    "content": "I want to set the fixed hotspot channel number in my pixel4a hospot. But I don't find the option. I configured wds bridging in wifi router with pixel 4a mobile hotspot. It works fine. But when i stop hotspot and start again, connection breaks possibly due to change of channel number in hotspot. I woild need to factory reset the router and reconfigure everytime which painful.  Some phones like Samsung have an option to set this channel fixed. I don't find that in pixel. How can I have that option in pixel 4a also?",
