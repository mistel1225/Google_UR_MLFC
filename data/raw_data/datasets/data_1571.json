    "content": "Millions of complaints about microphone on Pixel 3/3XL after switching to speakerphone during wifi or cellular call -> receiver hears nothing/ horrible echoing / intensive rustling/ robotic voice. Will Google admit its failure?? Stupid advices as restart, reinstalling app, clearing of cache, changing of sim card, turning off bluetooth, switching to 3G network, booting into safe mode, factory reset ARE NOT WORKING!!! \nThe Pixel 3/3XL were announced in 2018 and since then the problem has not been solved. Seriously?? Google is a trillion dollar company and is not capable of repairing it??",
