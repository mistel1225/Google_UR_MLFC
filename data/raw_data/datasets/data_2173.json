    "content": "I can't get access to my virgin media unlimited data. Have i accidentally switched off my data, if so how to I get access again. I have no problem with making receiving calls or texts. The phone works fine when I've wifi but when I'm away from the house I can't access the internet. I only have the phone awhile and can't guarantee that I had access to my data plan from the get go. Had anyone else had this problem.\nThanks,\nGary, Ireland",
