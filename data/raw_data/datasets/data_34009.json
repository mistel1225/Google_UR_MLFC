    "content": "I've been experiancing some intermitted issues lately (yes reset device) and requested an advanced exchange and was told they will only do this for a device purchased from the google store and to go back to my retailer. Well the retailer is a 2hr drive away and the receipt shows a 14 day exchange policy, i've had it well beyond that. So now i'm expected to ship my device to Google and wait up to 15 buisness days to have it returned. Who in todays world can be without a phone for 15 buisness days? I have no land line and primarliy use my device for work, I will be crippled without it. I can't beleive this, years ago when I had an iphone 3 the home button stopped working and apple did this for me even though I had purchased it from a Rogers store. I have 2 Google Home Hubs, Google home speaker, Google mini,  2 pixel phones, chromcasts and recently purchased wireless charger unopened. Seriously doubting my investment in the Google ecosystem. I've asked Maddie to have a supervisor/Manager contact me. I really dont get it, I'm willing to have a hold on my card Google you have my money.",
