    "content": "My side gaps are minimal, but I'm wondering about the front screen gap all around.\n\nI have no Pixel 5 to compare to and I have been waiting for a few days but I don't see anyone posting about it.\nI compared it to my Pixel 4a, and 4a is completely fine without this issue.\n\nCan others also post some photos of the front gap?\nI barely used it since i'm still waiting for my screen protector, it's still siting in the box btw.\nIt's already collecting dust and they are unclean-able.\n\n\n\nI don't want to swap for another phone that might have bigger side gaps if this front gap is normal.\nIf this is also a defect, I guess i'll return it for another one.\n\nThank you all!",
