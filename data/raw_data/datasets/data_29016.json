    "content": "I have a Pixel 3a. I have multiple audio files on my phone (music and podcasts in MP3 format), but when I check the Audio folder, it remains empty. It finds my pictures and videos just fine.\n\nThis is causing Sonos to not be able to play any music off my phone. I have a Moto G5+ which finds podcasts and music just fine, and syncs them to the Audio folder.\n\nI've tried copying podcasts and music directly to those folders, I've tried deleting the \"NO MEDIA\" file, but the Audio folder still does not update\n\nThoughts?",
