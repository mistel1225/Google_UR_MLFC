    "content": "On whatsapp I noticed 4 old photos in \"recent\" which I didn't send or received recently. They were random and not in the order they were taken. Then I noticed that in Google \"files\" on my phone there were plenty more old photos, random and out of order under \"recent\". When I click \"photo info\" it says they're still in their original location in the album and says \"modified\". You can see in photo attached the files names(dates). Should I be worried I've been hacked? Is there another explanation? Please help! ",
