    "content": "Since getting my Pixel 4XL in June, the phone has restarted itself <5 times. But beginning this morning, the phone has restarted approximately 20 times. I can barely use apps, and when I try to it restarts. The batter has been fine and it is not losing battery with the restart. It will also sometimes not allow me to lock the phone. When it's about to restart it freezes, gets bright, and turns of. I really do not know what to do.",
