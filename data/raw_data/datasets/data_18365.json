    "content": "I have had my Pixel 4 since November 2019 so I’m entitled to get it fixed under warranty. It’s stuck in a reboot loop, it isn’t able to turn on and it just shuts itself down, tries to turn on again and can’t and shuts down again. I have tried the soft reset and the factory reset.\nI can’t get through to Google on the phone as they aren’t taking calls, the support centre has been extremely unhelpful as far as actually enabling me to make a claim under warranty. I could get through to the Repair Centre  and I typed in my Pixel 4’s IMEI and it said “For the device with this IMEI or serial number, you’ll have to check the hardware warranty centre to see your repair options.”\nMy phone is less than a year old and should be able to get fixed under warranty, I just need to speak to someone.",
