    "content": "My fingerprint scanner has been working fine for 2 years with this Pixel 2. Last night it seems to have just become disabled, no haptic feedback when touching it. I downloaded DevCheck and the fingerprint scanner is not listed. I backed up my device, did a factory reset, but it still didn't seem to work, so I restored the backup now. I have also noticed lag spikes while typing in text that weren't previously prevalent. OS is Android 9, Jan 5th, 2019.",
