    "content": "Hi,\n\nI recently purchased a Google Pixel 3 device.\nI'm having serious issues with syncing my Google Calendar and Google Keep notes.\n\nIn Google Calendar when I attempt to add an event I get a \"the requested event wasn't found\" error.\nIn Google Keep when I open the app it just shows an endless spinner.\n\nWhen I open the \"Accounts Sync\" page I see that there is a message saying \"Sync is currently experiencing problems, it will be back shortly\", however this message is showing for 3 days now.\n\nI tried pretty much everything:\n\n* I've updated to the latest version of Android and installed all fixes.\n* I tried deleting the cache and data of the Google Calendar and Google Keep apps\n* I even tried to remove and re-add my Google Account.\n\nCan someone please help me fix this?\nI rely heavily on Calendar and Keep and my phone isn't usable to me without them.\n\nThanks,\nIdo",
