    "content": "My Pixel 3 had hardware issues after 2 months from purchasing in from the Google store. Google gave a very hard time and basically sent me on a wild goose chase from department to department when we originally contacted them to get the replacement phone. They replacement phone was finally sent but Google sent it to the WRONG address (not sure how that was possible). Google then recalled the phone from the wrong address and is giving the SAME hard time and wild goose chase that they were giving us the very first time after they already have all the necessary information. This is unfair since this was a mistake that they made. It's been over a year and I still haven't received my replacement phone. VERY poor customer service on Google's part and I honestly expected better from such a large company. Need to speak to a sales rep ASAP.",
