    "content": "Hello,\n\nI have a Pixel XL.  After wiping and installing factory .zip for Android 10, whatsapp, email, etc apps go to sleep if you don't use them for a while, and will not update until I open them.\n\nI have tried adjusting battery optimization, etc, to no avail.\n\nI am missing notifications, etc because of this.  Email, for instance, will not update until I manually open it and update it.\n\nPlease, how to fix this?",
