    "content": "Hi, I am a physical therapist for a school district. I see multiple students each day and hand write my notes. How would I use this so that each transcript I do for each student ends up in a digital file under each individual student's name. For example: daily notes for Susan, Tom, Bill, etc.  So if I went to Google drive or something like that I could look in one spot for all my daily notes for Susan or Tom from the last 6 months. Thanks for helping figure this out!",
