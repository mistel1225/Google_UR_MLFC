    "content": "This morning my alarm went off on my phone, but when I went to pick up the phone, the screen wouldn't turn or respond. I was able to get the alarm to stop playing by holding down the power button. I have tried restarting the phone several times but I have no indication of it it is on or not since nothing displays on the screen.\nThe entire time the fingerprint button on the back has been stiff and won't click, also the power button on the phone is mushy and hard to press sometimes. \nThe phone was a refurbished replacement I got 5 months ago, It has no cracks or damage, a case has been kept on it.",
