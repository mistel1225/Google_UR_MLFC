    "content": "I got a Pixel about a month ago and have been taking photos on it. As a Pixel owner I should be getting unlimited storage at original quality.  However in the last couple of weeks I have been getting warnings that I have just passed my 15gb and asking me to pay for more storage. How do I solve this as my photos are not being backed up?",
