    "content": "Good day. Hope to find help here, as Google photos community didn't help me.\n\nFaced to unusual problem with free memory on device. Kind of disappointed with the device as it suppose to be \"no limits\" back up till 2023. Where is that?\n\nYou can see that almost all of the space is occupied with \"images\"\n But if I'm looking deaper inside the category \"images\" there are only around 20 old pictures. They just cant be 42 GB. All other pictures supposed to be not on a phone, but on the cloud storage\n\nTrying to prevent all the standard comments:\n\n- yes, I do using \"free up space\" inside the Google photos app. For now I don't have pictures that wasn't saved to Google storage \n\n- yes, automat sync is on in the settings\n\n- yes, all folders have an on \"automatic back up\"\n\n\nMore of that. Looking inside the Google photos app (on web link) I have \"filled\" memory. It propose to buy me additional memory. So where is the free space till 2023? Cant find the answer",
