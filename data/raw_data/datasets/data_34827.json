    "title": "As of last night, my 1 month old Pixel 3 started crashing withing several minutes of being turned on. I noted that it is in the process of installing a security update, but the install can't finish due to the frequent crashes. In fact, I can't do anything to troubleshoot the phone because of the crashes. I even tried Safe Mode and it still crashes. What can I do? This phone is a recent purchase - this past December, so is very new with few apps on it.",
    "content": "I tried to finish the security update install, even in safe mode with no success.  I googled my problem and saw similar stories, but from back in November, with promises the problem would be fixed with Dec update.",
