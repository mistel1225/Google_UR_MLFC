    "title": "Phone Dialer always minimized",
    "content": "At some point very recently the Dialer app has stopped going full screen when I answer a call.  95% of the time I use speaker phone so this adds and extra step to every phone call as I answer the call, it is minimized to the left side of the display, I have to tap it, then select \"back to phone call\", then I can turn the speakerphone on.\n\nWhy is it doing this?  How can I switch it?  I don't see any options in the Dialer settings or the display settings.  When I'm in a call I want it to default to maximize unless I choose to minimize it.  Right now it's the opposite and it's driving me crazy.\n\nTIA",
