    "content": "Ive had the phone for barely a month and I noticed today that the sides give way when I'm gripping the phone. I realise the phone is made of plastic but it sounds like a problem that'll eventually lead to a separation of the phone screen and case because from what people have said it's due to a gap of the casing and screen.",
