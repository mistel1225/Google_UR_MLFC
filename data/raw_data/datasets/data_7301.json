    "content": "An app I've used often requires location to be on all the time in order to work. It can't push the information I need to notifications unless it has background permissions for location.\n\nYet when I go to the permissions, the most open option I can choose is \"only when using the app\". Therefore I can only get notifications when I open the app.\n\nHow can I set this app to have location permission \"all the time\"? Why isn't the option available?",
