    "title": "Why does the Phoenix browser appear no matter which installed browser I click on? [Pixel 3a]",
    "content": "New problem on my Pixel (3a) phone today:  I have about a dozen browsers installed for web testing, and right now no matter which one I pick, I seem to get the Phoenix browser.  It has the stylized 'P' logo at the upper left, and the screen layout behaves identically for all of them.  I've reinstalled Phoenix and Firefox, rebooted, and still Firefox identifies itself with the 'P' logo.  DuckDuckGo does, too, as does Chrome and Dolphin.  They all work (of course;-), but since they're all the same now, it sorta shoots down my attempts to verify that web pages work correctly on all those other browsers. \n\nAny Idea what I may have done inadvertently to cause this?  Is there a way to fix it, and get the other browser's behavior back?\n\n(Also, I tried looking this problem up in various ways - with several browsers and this forum - but couldn't find any keywords that got anything relevant. Am I the only one seeing this misbehavior?)",
