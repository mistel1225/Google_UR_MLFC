    "content": "I'm trying to update from the Android 10 to the newest security update. Whenever I go to update, it shows a loading bar that never gets progress and always pauses for no reason. I've powered off, restarted and left it over night but to no avail. Just doesn't do anything. Any ideas on what I should do?",
