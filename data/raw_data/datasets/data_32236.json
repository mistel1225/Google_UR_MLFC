    "content": "I send my device for service repair due annoying audio like rattling from both speakers. More than 15 days but didn't receive my device.  Tring to contacting Google  Support Team but they fail to provide proper response now I am fearing about my device. \nThis is not what we hoped for  ,from a respective companie like you . Is this service  which we have paid for. .? Now after this horrible  experience I have to say other is better than you in term of service like IOS replacement and service policies. \nThis is not the first time when I face this horrible experience  with google , a nexus 6p which is dead due to processor  failure become paper weight after google deny to provide service as it is out warranty  (but in some country google replaced device's but I not lucky enough ) . That is not ended up  before 6p with 2 nexus 5 and one nexus 4 I was faced same experience without my fault.  That's why I am feeling fear. Please  Google not again otherwise you faced a big loss by losing your best customer who truly believe in you.\nPlease see in this matter as team is unable to provide solution for a long time and also make fake promises , they promise me  that they provide update on Monday but sun is setting  down now but no response from your team . I am requesting you to please look into this matter and provide my device back as soon as possible . \nCase ID [9-8285000025876",
