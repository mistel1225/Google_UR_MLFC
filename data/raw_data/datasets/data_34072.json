    "title": "My pixel 2 periodically locks me out - it wants me to enter my PIN instead of using my fingerprint, but then doesn't recognize the PIN (which I'm sure I have typed in correctly since it's my wedding day). Usually a few days later the problem resolves itself and I can start using the phone again by unlocking it with my fingerprint. It's really aggravating though! When I tried to deactivate the PIN system, it immediately went into lock-out mode. (Not funny). Any ideas what I can do? I've updated everything, so it's not that. I'm running the most recent version of Android9.",
