    "content": "The fingerprint stopped working after the April 5 security patch. Not only did it stop working... There is no option for fingerprint anywhere in security and location where it was nor any where else. I've restarted in safe mode and it's not there I've done a factory reset and that didn't fix it either. I've seen feeds with a few similar cases and they sent their phones in only to be replaced with a refurbished phone. My pixel is only 3 months old and I love It and don't feel good about a refurbished replacement. I've gone that route in the past and had to send 3 refurbished devices back. Please help...",
