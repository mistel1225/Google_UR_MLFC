    "content": "After upgrading to Android 11 when I pull down the quick settings and press an icon, wifi, airplane mode etc nothing happens. In order to change anything I need to go into settings and toggle whatever.  Have restarted the device, doesn't help.  Can anyone help with making the quick settings responsive again. All was good in Android 10",
