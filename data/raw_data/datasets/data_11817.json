    "content": "On my phone there is no audio when I make video calls using various apps, (hangouts, messenger, snapchat, etc.). Voice calls without video work just fine across all apps, and the audio works for all other purposes (music, games, etc.)\n\nPeople on the other end of the video call can hear me, but I can't hear them.  This has been going on for months.  I have been unable to find any solution.\n\nHelp!",
