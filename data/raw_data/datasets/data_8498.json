    "content": "Android 11.\n\nGPS is on.  I've refreshed my location in google maps.  Yep, I'm in the right place.  I've re-selected the saved location multiple times with no success. Every time I do \"Edit Address\" it shows the main part of the townhouse area here.  I drag the pin to THIS location or touch the GPS icon, it goes to where I am, I hit \"Select this location,\" then message saying \"this place is already trusted\" appears. I go in to edit the location again, but the pin is NOT where I am, and it's left me OUTSIDE of the effective radius. It must be using the office address and NOT this townhouse, even though I've shown it where I am multiple times.  Software FAIL. What's the deal?",
