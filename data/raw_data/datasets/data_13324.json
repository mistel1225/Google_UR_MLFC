    "content": "Soon after I upgraded to android 11, I got a warning that my storage is almost full. I try to look for the cause and in the storage page, it shows that my \"system\" take 32GB of storage. I tried to delete unused things, just to found that my \"system\" creeped and ate more and more space as I deleted more things. Now it uses 38GB out of my 64GB and I can't do anything further. Is this normal? Is there anything that could be done? Anyone else having the same problem? Please help.",
