    "title": "[Pixel 2 Android 9] No Backups Available after Factory Reset/New Phone",
    "content": "Hello all,\n\nI received a new phone via RMA. I backed up my old one and checked to see the backup was listed in Google Drive. When I was setting up the new phone, it said no backups found. I finished the set up and went to update the OS all the way. There were 2 or 3 updates and reboots. Did another factory reset and it still shows no backups. \n\nI remember back in the day iPhones wouldn't let you use an iCloud Backup restore file if the iOS version was dramatically different. But, it would still show the restore there, but it would be grayed out and actually say \"iOS version mismatch\". I assume the same is true for Android? If so, it just isn't showing my backup at all.\n\nI'm not sure where to go from here. I haven't found very many articles out there regarding this issue. Thanks in advance for any help or ideas!",
