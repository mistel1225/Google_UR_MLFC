    "content": "I bought my Pixel 4 used and it's been stuck at 50% no matter how much I charge. Contacted Google and they say: \"that this device is not eligible for a warranty replacement/refund due to previous illicit activity\" with no details. So basically I'm stuck with a phone that is under warranty and doesn't function properly. Thanks Google. Never will buy another phone from them again.",
