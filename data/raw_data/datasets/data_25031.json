    "content": "I just picked up the new Pixel 4 XL phone and noticed that when I just started setting the phone up an NFC toggle showed up in the drop down menu, but irrespective of what I did, I couldn't get the NFC to toggle on or off. \n\nI setup a few credit cards in Android pay and then tried the service and the button just disappeared. Did a full reset and couldn't find the toggle anymore.\n\nIs this bug known or am I dreaming?\n\nI would hate to have to return the brand new phone because of this missing feature.",
