    "content": "Gesture Navigation\nNot sure what's happening with my Pixel 3 but the swipe home gesture navigation stopped working. I can still swipe back and forth to get to other apps and swiping from the edge to go back still works. The other navigation options work fine tho. If I do the swipe left option to go to another app in a recent app and then quickly swipe up I can go home.With the gesture navigation enabled in apps like WhatsApp I can't tap the area to start texting.\n\nTouch Screen \nIn fullscreen apps especially games the lower section where the navigation gestures are doesn't work during gaming but work otherwise.\nThere is also a section from the top of the volume button to about 2-3cm down and horizontally that doesn't touch most times either. Like for example when I go to the Play store search for app and then tap on the app on the big horizontal green install button I cannot tap it I have to scroll to get that button out of the area and then press install.\n\nI have tried factory resetting however that almost locked me out of the phone because the lower section when you're just starting up that says \"start\" I couldn't touch it. I had to use the magnification option to get it a little bigger and then repeatedly tap it.",
