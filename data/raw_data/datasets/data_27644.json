    "title": "Music won't work all of a sudden on Bluetooth in my car. Pixel 2, 2015 Ford focus, Google play music",
    "content": "I was listening to music via Bluetooth in my car as I always do and received a text message from a friend. My music cut off and have not been able to get it back since. I can still make and receive phone calls with no issue. The Meta data appears on the car display but when I hit play on the car buttons it plays for one second then cuts again. If I hit play on the phone it just plays through my phone and the metadata stays on the car display screen. I have done the idiot steps like turning Bluetooth off and on, restarted my phone, unpaired and re-paired the phone, deleted the Bluetooth pairing on both the phone and the car but nothing has fixed. \n\nCar is a 2015 Ford Focus using SYNC\nPhone is a Pixel 2 updated to Android 10\nMusic App is Google play music",
