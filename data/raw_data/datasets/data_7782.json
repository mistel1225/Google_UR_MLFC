    "title": "Any fixes for bluetooth connected audio skipping for Pixel 4a 5G?",
    "content": "When I have my phone connected to bluetooth audio (headphones and vehicle), music streaming/audio tends to have a point every 5 minutes or so where it misses or skips a beat (will slow for half a sec then jump back to the correct audio). I have no issues when my Pixel 2 is connected to these devices. \n\nI've restarted my phone, uninstalled and reinstalled my music streaming app, downloaded the songs for offline listening, disconnected and reconnected to the bluetooth devices, and still have the same issues. When my phone is connected to my car's audio via the headphone jack there are no problems with ten music/audio.\n\nAny help or additional suggestions is appreciated! Thanks!",
