    "content": "Hello I am having an issue with my Pixel 3XL. I was charging my phone as per usual during the night, no issues and then when I tried to turn it on this morning, it would not turn on. I have tried all the recommended troubleshooting instructions like power on long, factory reset, longated holds, massaging the phone, fast pressing the buttons, etc. But when I charge it into the computer, i can hear a response indicating that the phone should be on. Unfortunately I cannot test this by calling my phone because I had flight mode turned on prior but I am quite sure the issue is not battery related. That could only be the screen, as even the red light indicators don't work. \n\nHow can I fix this issue if I am quite confident that I have narrowed the issue down to the screen and not the power?",
