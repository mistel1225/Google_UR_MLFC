    "content": "Any AUX cable I plug into my Pixel 4a triggers the Google Assistant after about a minute and continues to do so over and over to make listening to anything over AUX just unbearable. Even with only an AUX cable plugged into the phone and nothing else, it still triggers these events. I don't use the Google Assistant and don't want to use the Google Assistant but it is incessant. I've tried 3 different cables all with the same results. Any advice?",
