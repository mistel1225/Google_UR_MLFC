    "title": "Always on Display during wireless charging",
    "content": "I just purchased a wireless charger (mophie charging pad).  My Pixel 4 XL charges without an issue.  However, as apposed to when I charge the phone with the USB cable, the always on display stays on overnight.  I would prefer to automatically switch off in the middle of the night while sleeping (as is the case when I charge via cable).  Is there a way I can get the phone to do that automatically rather than manually switching the always on display off every time I go to charge it overnight?",
