    "content": "Sound started to occasionally cut out about a month ago restarting my phone would fix this, in the coming weeks my volume would more often cut out. I decided to factory reset my phone thinking it would solve the problem, but no sound doesn't work at all. Headphones also don't work. I have no idea what to do, any recommendations would be appreciated.",
