    "content": "I have a Pixel 2 and 3.  Both were updated to 11.  Battery issues on 2 and it completely blew up the 3.  Called google for help after going through multiple resets.  Google checked on warrantee and said oh, out of warrantee by a couple of months.  Too bad.  For you. Of course, it was the 11 download that did it.  We will never use Google/pixel again and will make sure our tech reviewer knows it.",
