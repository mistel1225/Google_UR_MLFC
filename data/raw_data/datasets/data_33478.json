    "title": "Pixel 1: Why does my phone lie to me about availability of monthly security updates?",
    "content": "When I turned on the phone this morning (yes, I turn it off overnight), I checked to see if the March security update was available. The status said that the last check was at 5:46AM (it was 5:47AM by the clock) and no update was available. On a whim, I hit the check for updates button and was immediately offered the March update.\nSo, why the erroneous report of the update being unavailable, just a minute earlier?",
