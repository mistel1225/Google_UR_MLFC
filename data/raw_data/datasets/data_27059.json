    "content": "I recently got an unlocked 3a XL and have been trying to activate the Visual Voicemail function through the Phone app. I have the voicemail icon in the phone app. I have activated notifications, visual voicemail, and voicemail transcriptions. But, I can't seem to get VVM to work. Is it possible for the native Android visual voicemail function to work while on MetroPCS? Or should I give up and try to find a MetroPCS visual voicemail app instead (I'd really rather not)?",
