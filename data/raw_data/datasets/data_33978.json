    "content": "I picked up a new Pixel 3XL back in December 2018 and almost immediately noticed an issue. The speakers seem heavily distorted and when you turn it up mid-way plus, it almost seems like there is a 3rd speaker in the center rear of the device.\n\nI would have thought that the sound would be much clearer and consistent.\n\nAnyone else had this issue?",
