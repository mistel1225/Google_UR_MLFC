    "content": "Hi all! \n\nWhen speak on the phone normally and don't use the Pixel USB-C Earbuds, everything is fine. However, at least once a day when using the wired Earbuds, I am told by the person on the other end of the call that they cannot make out what I am saying and that I sound like a robot or metallic. Usually, I just unplug the Earbuds and plug them back in and the problem is resolved. I actually obtained a new Pixel 3 as part of a warranty replacement and decided to buy new Pixel Earbuds, just in case. Ironically, the exact problem has persisted. I can't seem to find any information online regarding this issue which is stranger considering I had the same exact issue with a new Pixel and new Earbuds. Any help or advice would be very appreciated! \n\nCheers from Canada!",
