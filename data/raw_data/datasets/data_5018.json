    "content": "I work for a wireless carrier and have heard numerous reports of Google's Live Caption feature not working for voicemails but working everywhere else. I tried this on my personal Pixel 3 and saw the same thing, where I can use Live Caption for any media playing on my device except when playing voicemails from the Google Phone app. If I share the voicemail via SMS or Google Drive, I can play the same audio file and it is captioned as expected, but for some reason when playing that file from the Phone app it doesn't get captioned. Is this the expected behavior or a bug?",
