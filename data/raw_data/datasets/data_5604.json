    "content": "I have tried to fix my bluetooth connection by resetting my bluetooth and it still looses connection.\nAlso my phone has been freezing and my phone screen is going black, so I took it into vodaphone and they told me to hold down the home button and volume buttons for 7 seconds to restart it and it has kept freezing occasionally. What else can I do or how do I send my phone in to get fixed?",
