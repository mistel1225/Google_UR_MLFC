    "content": "Hello everyone!\n\nI've broken my phone's screen. All I can see is battery percentage:\n\n\nI've tried casting my screen to my laptop with various software, but unfortunately I was unable to do it without developer options turned on :(\nI bought a USB-C/HDMI/USB HUB: https://www.havit.hk/products/havit-h408/\nUnfortunately Pixel 4 is not compatible with this... Thank you Google... But now at least I can connect mouse/keyboard to it :)\nI'm from Poland, so unfortunately I guess that if I wasn't able to buy a case for 2 months here, then I won't be able to buy also a screen replacement for this phone...\nCan anyone help me in this? I have a Chromecast. I'm using it for casting screen on my other devices... \n\nThank you in advance.",
