    "content": "Phone call volume and speaker (when phone ringing or playing music) is very  quiet even though all sound levels are set to max. \nGoogle assistant will here my comments but then not do the actions \"hey google, call mum\" shows on the screen but then wont make the call. \n\nMic seems to be fine as other can clearly hear me on phone calls i struggle to hear them. \n\nPhone will also show full service then randomly end a call show no service available and then moments later have full service and allow me to call again. \n\nHave tried safe mode and resetting the phone . \nNothing has worked.",
