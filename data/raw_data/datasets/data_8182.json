    "content": "When I'm in landscape mode; playing games, watching, videos, or even just on my home screen, the notification panel won't fully pull down to the quick settings! This doesn't always happen but it happens! I have to restart my device to fix it but it shouldn't be this way. Please fix your bugs, Google!",
