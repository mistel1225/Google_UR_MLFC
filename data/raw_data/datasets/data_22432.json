    "content": "I have been having an issue after I updated my 3XL device to Android 10 with battery not even reaching to 100  but down to 1 percent. My phone keeps going up but draining more and never have reached to 100 for the past several days. I have already rebooted, restarted and tried everything listed on this help center and it's not helping at all.",
