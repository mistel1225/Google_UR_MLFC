    "content": "I just got the Google Pixel 1 a couple months ago.  The screen could be larger but it is fine for the most part EXCEPT....when I take a picture and crop it or (God forbid) edit it more...it will take an unusually long time to save.  I'd be watching the round circle spin and spin and spin.   What could be the problem?  Is it something in the settings?",
