    "title": "Issues with Google Android Pixel Security Update - Feb 2020 on a Pixel 4 XL",
    "content": "Since the February security update my 4 XL keeps powering off when in my pocket. It also randomly powers off when I squeeze the phone to activate the assistant, I have to press the power button to start again. I have a Google supplied case to protect it, I have removed this and the problem persists. I have also removed recently installed apps and booted in Safe-mode(several times), factory reset twice, still no joy! My UK service provider does not have a clue, any ideas?",
