    "content": "Hello. Unfortunately I forgot my password for my phone. I read that the only way to be able to use the phone again, was to do a factory reset. So I did. Problem is now, that it's asking for my old password to proceed with configurating the phone, but that was exactly why I did a factory reset in the first place! I have read that you need your Google Account information and I do, but it's like I can't even get to the point where I can enter my Google Account information, since it starts by asking for my old password... What to do? I would be very sad if I have to buy a new phone just because I forgot my password...",
