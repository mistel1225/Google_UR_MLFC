    "content": "The screen on my Pixel 2 quit working, and we're attempting to repair it.  However after we placed the repair order, it doesn't show under my orders and our credit card has been charged.  We do not have a confirmation email, and Google has been telling us it's a \"bug\" for the past 5 days.  We've asked for refunds, and to talk to someone who can actually help.  However, the only response we get is \"rest assured\" some one is looking at it.  \n\nFor the time being we're without a phone paying for the service, and have already been charged by Google for the repair that isn't happening.\n\nHow can i actually talk to someone that can get our money back without having to file a fraudulent charge report with our Credit Card company?",
