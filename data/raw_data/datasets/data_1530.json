    "content": "Suddenly my Pixel 3a stopped connecting my home Google Nest mesh wifi router system. All my other devices (iPad, Amazon Fire tablet, etc) connect fine to wifi.  Pixel 3a will connect to other wifi, eg McDonald's.\nRunning Android 11.0\nI have tried:\n1. Forgetting network\n2. Deleting all network connections\n3. Rebooting Pixel in safe mode\n4. Rebooting router\n\nI would appreciate any suggestions.",
