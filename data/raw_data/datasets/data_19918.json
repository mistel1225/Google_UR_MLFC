    "content": "I have a Pixel 2XL phone. I am not able to merge two calls.\n\n1. A person calls and i lift the call, now a second person calls and if i lift that call as well, i can see only swap option between the calls. I am not able merge two incoming calls.\n\n2. If i receive a regular call and 2nd person calls to my Google voice, im still not able to merge calls. All i can do is swap calls. \n\nCan someone help me out ???",
