    "content": "So, I have a Pixel 3a from Sprint. It is payed for each month along with the data/service bill. Now, I really want to root my phone. So, I went to the developer options in settings, and went to OEM unlock. The option is grayed out with a message saying that OEM unlocking is \"Unavailable on carrier-locked devices\". Does anyone know a way around this?",
