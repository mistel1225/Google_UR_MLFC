    "title": "Can't answer a call (pixel 5)",
    "content": "Pixel 5, last version of updates. More than 50%(or even 100%) of incoming calls are not able to answer. The phone rings without vibration, there is no notification or at all, I can mute the sound of incoming call only by turning on vibration or mute, but when I turn them off, the ringtone still sounds. If I try to call someone, while I'm called in such a way, it is busy(of course), but this doesn't stop the incoming. I have already tried un-updating the phone app, clearing its storage and cache, changing notifications in the phone app and restarting the phone but the problem still appears. Extremely sad by this situation with the really great smartphone but useless phone, please help me!",
