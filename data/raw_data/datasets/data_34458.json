    "content": "I had this phone now for two weeks and it has caused me so much headache.\n\nWhen ever I get a WhatsApp notificatiin, the notification sound goes off in a loop the same melody(tried changing it/still the same song),wherever it's on dont distribute or loud.\n\nIt only stops when I restart the phone until the next message pops up. Turning the volume down helps till you forgot you did it and want to watch a video.\n\nHope someone can help me from this nightmare.",
