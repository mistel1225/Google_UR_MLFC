    "content": "My pixel 2 was in the Android Beta Program for Android Q and had some performance issues so I wanted to downgrade back to pie. I followed all the steps on the google website for downloading the factory image, unlocking the bootloader and running the flash-all script. After the script was completed and told me to exit, I unplugged the phone from my PC and booted it. It booted for a second and then booted into recovery mode and says at the bottom ERROR: Slot Unbootable:  Load Error  and is now stuck. When i try to put it in download mode it says operation denied.\nWhat can I do?",
