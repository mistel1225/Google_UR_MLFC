    "content": "I have been searching for two days, people saying activate ambient display, but I no longer have that option, I don't have battery saver turned on. Another problem that even other people have that I'm getting, is the phone screen staying locked when receiving/making calls, which leaves me to think that it's the proximity sensor, which is fine, but other people are saying it's an Android 10 problem. I would like some assistance as these features really helped sell me the Google Pixel. And something that I'm noticing too is that my display isn't turning on showing new notifications, even though it's on. I have all options turned to ON (double tap, lift to wake, and new notifications)",
