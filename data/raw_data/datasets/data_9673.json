    "content": "When people ring me there is no sound or ringtone. Its not on silent or on do not disturb. Just recently I can't even answer on screen as any incoming call is just set as a notification so I have to unlock, swipe down and answer by pressing the screen accept. Last few calls I received have just not registered at all. Really frustrating and would appreciate any answers.\n\nMany thanks,\n\nSam.",
