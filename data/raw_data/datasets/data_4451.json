    "content": "I have a Pixel 5 bought for work. My problem is I must unlock the bootloader for a project. I understand that's \"you're on your own, pal\" country. \n\nMy problem is I can't identify what carrier's phone this is. That is, is it VZW, T-Mobile, AT&T, etc. The \"bloatware\" apps aren't carrier specific (no My Verizon, for example). \n\nThe question: Is there anything (for example, About Phone) that identifies which carrier this phone was built for?",
