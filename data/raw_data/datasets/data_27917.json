    "title": "Original Pixel 3xl, about a month old. Camera focus mechanism failed. RMA phone DOA today.",
    "content": "Bought a Pixel 3xl from the Google store 30-40 days ago.  Everything was going great until Sept. 18th, when the rear facing camera stopped focusing. Contacted support, got an RMA underway, with me placing a temporary hold on my credit card to cover the cross-shipped device.  The RMA phone arrived today, and it was completely DOA. Wouldn't power on, respond to a charger.  Contacted support again about the DOA replacement phone, and after a lot of explaining that it was the refurbished replacement phone that was also non-functional, I was advised to put the refurb phone in the packaging and ship it back using the  label I was e-mailed.  I did so, and now I'm being told that I cannot receive a different RMA phone until the first one arrives at the shipping location, then I can start another RMA.  \n\nIn essence I've been without a fully functioning phone for 6 days, and it will be at least another two until they receive the DOA refurb I was sent before I can start yet *another* RMA to get another refurbished phone that may or may not work.  In essence I'm looking at at least another 5-6 days without a fully functioning phone.\n\nThe quality control on the refurbished units is obviously non-existent and I'm not sure the next replacement will be functional.   \n\nI'm seriously considering a return/refund and I'll just buy another manufacturer's  phone elsewhere. The support has been nothing short of horrible and frustrating.",
