    "content": "I would love to know how to save all photos from all apps to one single place --- the \"camera roll\",  just like iPhone would be able to do. Whenever I save photos from Apps like Snapchat & photo editing apps, the photos are always saved to its individual albums, which makes it very hard to find.  \n\nThis creates many mini albums and the only way to centralized all the photos right now is to manually select all of them and move them to \"camera roll\".  \n\nCould someone please help me if there is a setting thing that I missed?  Thanks!",
