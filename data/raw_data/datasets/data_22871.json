    "content": "I bought a Pixel 3 like 3 months ago and i have been having this issue from the start, there are some apps like Netflix/Snapchat/Houseparty that work fine with mobile data but do not work over WiFi, i thought this was an issue in the android pie beta so i waited but even after the update it doesn't seem to work, I have tried updating Netflix and restarted my Pixel, most apps like Instagram/Youtube work fine with WiFi along with all other apps but only few apps require mobile data.. I really need a solution since i cant stream Netflix over mobile data all the time.",
