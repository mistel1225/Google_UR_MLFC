    "content": "In YouTube on randomly clicking anywhere in the timeline to make the video move forward/backward to the exact time, it seems not working in pixel4a(but on dragging,it works), but the same works on other mobiles. \nAnd sometimes pinching for zoom in/out the video isn't working. \nDoes anyone facing those issues?\n\nplease let me know the solution as no current updates available for YouTube.",
