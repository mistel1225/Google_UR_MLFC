    "content": "I have mobile data turned off but it doesn't turn off. I have turned wifi off and mobile data off and then open up YouTube or a web browser and go to a website I haven't been before so it isn't loading a cached site and it works when it shouldnt. I restarted my phone and it didn't allow data when opening YouTube or web browser, it just said no connection after I restarted it but then the next day it started using data again even though it was turned off.
