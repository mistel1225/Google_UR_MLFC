    "title": "Pixel 3XL Battery Failure/Bloat and support nightmare.",
    "content": "I'm having a complete nightmare with Google support on this issue.  I've gone through all of the troubleshooting steps besides a factory reset.  A factory reset isn't going to unbloat the battery anyway.  But before I perform a reset I need to disable 2fa and I don't know my password to disable it.  Last time I used the forgot password function, even answering everything correctly, I was locked out of my account for over a month.  \n\nThats not acceptable when I need access to this email.  The support can't seem to understand this.  It's as if they literally aren't understanding what I'm saying.  They then claim to have helped me and disconnect from the chat.  I bought this phone from Google, as part of project Fi, and even enrolled in the protection plan\n\nIf this phone catches on fire people can die.  This isn't some minor issue.  Google needs to address all of these phones experiencing bloated batteries if they don't want blood on their hands.\n\nI've had an Android since the OG slider, I've argued for Android constantly.  At this point I'm so fed up and disappointed with Google's support, hardware, and service I doubt I'll ever buy an Android device again.  I've already cancelled my Nest orders.",
