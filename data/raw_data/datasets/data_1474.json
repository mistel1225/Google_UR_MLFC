    "content": "My Pixel3 has been intermittently sending all calls to voicemail.  I've checked always forward (OFF).  Turning my phone off will reset so that it will ring vs go to voicemail.  It'll work for a day or two then forward again.  Problem started mid May.  Was this a update?  Is some app I'm using causing mobile brain damage?   A lil help would be appreciated.",
