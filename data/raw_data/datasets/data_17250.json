    "content": "I purchased a second hand Pixel 1 but could not use it because of FRP. The seller, who cannot remember the PIN, has tried all other recommended recovery options using his long-standing Google account that is now connected to his new Pixel 2.\nHaving entered his email and password, he is allowed to progress up to a point when he gets the error \"Something went wrong there, Try again\". No matter how many times he tries, he always ends up with this error.\nHe has posted this issue in this forum (in russian) without success, so I'm crying out for help to get this phone operational?",
