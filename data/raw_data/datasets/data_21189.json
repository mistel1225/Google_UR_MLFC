    "title": "Pixel 3 XL doesn't charge properly on wireless charger since Android 10 upgrade",
    "content": "Ever since I upgraded to Android 10 on my Pixel 3 XL, the wireless charging doesn't charge my phone to 100%. This is the wireless charger that came from Google so it isn't some rubbish OEM knockoff. I would dock my phone into the charger at night and usually I wake up and my phone is at 100%. Ever since the upgrade, I would wake up and my phone is never 100%. I have woken up with it being at 60%, 98%, 45%, etc. Something is seriously buggy with Android 10. Anyone else have the same issue?\n\nSept 23 update:\nStill happening. Today I woke up with 40%. I did make sure the phone was docked properly and made that buzzing noise.",
