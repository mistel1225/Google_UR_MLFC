    "content": "I am trying to back up my photos from Pixel 3 to Macbook (running OS 10.12.6). Using Android File Transfer, I can navigate to see my DCIM folder. However, many of the photo folders are empty (earlier ones) while others have the files visible. I can see the corresponding photos clearly on my phone, but on Android File Transfer window it shows an empty folder. I tried clearing cache and restarting phone, didn't work.",
