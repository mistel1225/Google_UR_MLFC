    "content": "Phone is \"USB charging connected device\" \nalthough nothing is plugged into USB.\n\nIt won't let me switch to controls \"on this phone\" it is stuck on \"on connected device\" so I can't turn this off.\n\nI've rebooted the phone, I've turned on developer settings and turned off the USB setting under media in developer settings.\n\nNot really sure what to do. This is absolutely killing my battery",
