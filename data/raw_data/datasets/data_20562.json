    "content": "For about a year or two my audio playlists on my Google Pixel 3A will not show. all the music has downloaded properly and I can see them in the artist folders, however the playlist where I carefully set up how the music should be played are not showing any of the music inside the folders or are non-existent. I have tried several different music player apps and none of them will work, I can recreate the playlists however that will take days or months trying to reconfigure it properly. I have looked up the problem and it appears that the Google Pixel update to version 10 was where this all began about a year ago. A lot of people have the same issue.",
