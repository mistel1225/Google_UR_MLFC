    "content": "My Pixel XL has been constantly rebooting itself for the past day. It will freeze for around 15 seconds, then restart to the google splash screen, sometimes taking 2 or 3 cycles to get to the lock screen. I did a factory reset (4 times) and managed to get to the lock screen to reset my data, but it's still restarting (as I type this, it's restarted 4 times). When i download an app (such as wear OS), it restarts. When it has to contact google servers for info (such as data sync), it restarts. If it sits for more than 2 minutes without being unlocked, it restarts. I'm still trying to \"finish google setup\" but of course it keeps restarting.  After i put it into safe mode, it took about 5 minutes, but it still restarted restarted. I'm about to take this $800 POS and discus it out of my front door. Any help is greatly appreciated.",
