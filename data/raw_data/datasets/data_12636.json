    "content": "I got the phone today. Used normally for 4 hours and connected to the charger when the battery reached 9%. I checked after a minute and found the phone is off. When I tried to boot, it showed 0% and didn't boot.\n\n2 hours later, I checked my phone and found it at 4%. After several attempts of booting, the device started with 80% charge. However, the percentage was reducing by 1 every 15 seconds. At 68%, I connected the charger and it instantly shut down showing 0% charge. I tried to boot again, it showed 100% but shut down before it started.\n\nRight now, it's not charging as it's not showing anything in the display. I also can't start the phone.\n\nHere are the things I have done:\n1. Tried different chargers, wall sockets, and cables, none worked.\n2. Tried to start holding the power button for 7 seconds, nothing happened. Tried power button and volume button together for 20 seconds, nothing happened.\n\nQuick info:\n1. It's running on android 11, was already 11 when I started the phone\n2. This is the US version, bought from Amazon\n3. I'm currently living in Bangladesh, and there are no service centers available in the country",
