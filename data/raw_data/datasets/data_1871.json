    "content": "Hi there!\n\nI recently bought the Pixel 5 and have noticed that the volume on my wired earphones is incredibly low. I thought it was a dongle issue and ordered a USB-C DAC and switched to my Bluetooth earphones while I wait for it to arrive but even with BT earphones the sound is just barely audible and drowns out completely the moment there is even mild background noise. I see no appreciable increase in volume after going from 50% on the volume rocker through 100. \n\nAnyone facing similar issues? How can I work around this? As it stands, I don't think I'll be continue enjoying this device if there's no way to fix the volume.",
