    "content": "One thing that really frustrating me is that when I press the power button to lock the device, there's very good chance that it will unlock itself when I'm putting it my pocket or something.\n\nI use the tap to unlock screen feature, and of course also the fingeprint. So if I press the power button to lock it, if I accidentally touch the screen, or fingeprint sensor while placing the phone in my pocket or table etc, the phone wil unlock again.\n\nTo me this feels like a bad design - those unlocking features should be disabled for at least 10 seconds after manually locking with the button.",
