    "content": "After installing the Android 10 update I have noticed that many apps will no longer load they will sit with a screen with the little circle as if it were getting ready to load up its content but it never does. Force closing sometimes helps but most of the time it doesn't do a thing it still just sits there even Google's own YouTube no longer loads. I did have problems with the making and receiving phone calls, and removing the my Verizon app did seem to solve it. But now my phone is just a dumb phone instead of a smartphone.",
