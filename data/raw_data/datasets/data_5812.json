    "content": "I have bought a google adaptor USB-C 3.5mm and an external mic - followed all the suggested fixes to no avail.  \nFound this in a thread dated 2018\n\" Hi, folks -- Isaac here from the Pixel Camera engineering team. I have been keeping an eye on this thread since the beginning and have good news. At the same time as Pixel 3 launch (October 18th), we will introduce support for Android-compatible plugged-in external microphones in the default camera app for all Pixels. I hope you all enjoy the update.\"\n\nI have an old Pixel 2XL and a brand new Pixel 5   Cant make it work on either. As far as I can see am using all the right hardware...\n\nI would like to enjoy that update...  and I would appreciate a response from google on this.\n\"",
