    "content": "My pixel 3a fell approximately 1 ft and hit the corner of a step. Although it was not a hard hit and the manufacturer case was on(and no cracks in screen), I was surprised to see that there was an immediate problem.  The screen just showed lines and I was unable to turn the device on it off. I waited for the battery to run out,  charged it, and there was still no response to the on button. My husband is a googler and reccommended I contact support.",
