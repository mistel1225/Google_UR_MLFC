    "content": "My pixel 3xl is stuck in a boot loop . I tried to turn it on after it randomly shut itself off in the middle of the night. Occasionally it gets hung on the 'Google' boot screen and requires a soft reset to get it back into its boot loop. It took dozens of boot cycles for one to persist long that I could make it to the factory reset option. A reset didn't solve the problem. \n\nI eventually was able to make it through initial phone setup after the reset (after 1 reboot interruption), but the phone promptly shut itself off again and reentered its problematic state. Current battery level is 40%\n\nmy phone is now 100% unusable. Before the reset I was also able to capture the following in one of the boot cycles. Times like this make me wish that there was a genius bar equivalent where this situation could get resolved quickly. \n\nBuild: PQ2A.190205.001\nsecurity patch: feb 5 2019",
