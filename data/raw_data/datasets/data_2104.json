    "content": "When using the camera I use Framing Hints and the Golden Ratio grid to frame my photos correctly.\n\nHowever, taking pictures of the horizon, the grid lines always match the horizon but the framing hint says that I'm off by 1 degree.\n\nIs there a way to calibrate the rotation sensor/accelerometer?\n\nWhen using level apps, I can calibrate the level there, but that's only on that app, not the System.\n\nAny tips?",
