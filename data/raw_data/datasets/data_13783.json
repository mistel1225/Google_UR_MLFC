    "title": "Notification Vibrations Too Strong on Pixel 4a - Feels Like Something Loose Inside",
    "content": "Hello!\n\nWhen I receive notifications, the vibration that goes with them is so strong that it feels like something is loose inside my Pixel 4a. It even sounds a bit like the speaker is crackling, but I've tested listening to some songs and taking calls through the external speakers and they sound fine, great even! I've also tested the various notification sounds and those don't trigger the vibration motor and they sound fine too, so I'm wondering if others have noticed this as well? And if it's a characteristic of the phone and just a too strong vibration motor? Or if my phone is defective and I should contact Google for a replacement?\n\nThanks!",
