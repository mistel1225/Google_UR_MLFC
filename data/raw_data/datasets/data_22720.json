    "title": "Problems playing music with Live Caption off",
    "content": "Recent problem has popped up while listening to music with bluetooth earbuds (Jabra Elite 75t).  Randomly, it seems like I have to have Live Caption (LC) turned on in order to get any sound.  If I turn LC off, it mutes the music.  Music is not paused, just muted.  Have used Google Music, YouTube Music and Hi-Fi Cast apps, and all behave the same.  One song will play normally, next song is muted if LC is off.  When I turn LC on music plays normally.  I don't want to have LC on all the time as it obstructs the screen and also used more battery power.  \n\nHave not yet had any issues with podcast apps, or when playing music to internal speaker or to an external bluetooth speaker.  Only seems to happen with bluetooth earbuds so it may be a Jabra issue.\n\nAny ideas?  Never had this issue until LC was added in an update.  Is there any way to completely disable LC?",
