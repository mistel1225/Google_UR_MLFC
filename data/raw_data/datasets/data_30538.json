    "content": "For a few weeks now my bluetooth hasn't been turning on. I can switch it on, it'll try turning on and then automatically switches off.\n\nIt's been updated to the latest software update and it was working before and after the update. I cleared the cache, I've forced stop the bluetooth and restarted like a Google rep has instructed me. I finally factory reset the phone and it's still not working.\n\nHas anyone else gone through this or seen an issue like this?",
