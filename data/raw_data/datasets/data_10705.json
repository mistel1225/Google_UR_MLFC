    "content": "Hello There,\n\nI wanted to report the problem with Pixel 4XL that I have experienced since the Android upgrade to 11.\n\n1. When locked, the face unlock won't work and even when swiping the screen up in order to get the num pad, the swipe won't just work (Yes, my screen is clean & has no screen cover that can cause issues)\n2. When expanding the notification shade, the notification is divided into two sections, one at the top of the screen and another at the bottom of the screen\n3. When locked, tapping or double-tapping the screen to wake up does not work sometimes\n4. After face unlocking, the phone screen in a dim state with no icon nor any menu. To fix, lock and the phone unlock again.\n\nI am hoping you guys are aware of these bugs/improvements. Happy to share any inputs to further help you fix this problem. \n\nThank you for your time. Stay safe",
