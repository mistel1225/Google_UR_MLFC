    "title": "Pixel 3XL sluggish or will not wake up from power button or double tap",
    "content": "When device goes to sleep it will not wake up (unresponsive) with the power button or double tap sometimes for 10-15 seconds, and sometimes requiring me to hold down power button to reboot the phone.  I have tried factory reset as well as booting to safe mode and this does not resolve the issue.  I have toggled ambient screen on/off as well as battery saver also with no difference.\n\nCorrect time is displayed even when the phone is not responsive to wake up.  When receiving a call, phone rings however screen remains blank and unable to answer, often screen comes back on in 1-2 minutes stating \"missed call\".\n\nWhen rebooting it seems to take a long time (5-6 mins) on the white GOOGLE screen when compared to my previous android phones.",
