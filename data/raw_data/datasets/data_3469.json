    "content": "I don't know where the text interface went to. I can see received texts but they have no keyboard attached so I can't reply. A keyboard does pop up if I initiate a text, but that's it. \nThe second problem is phone calls not showing up. I can hear the ringing but see nothing to indicate who is calling.",
