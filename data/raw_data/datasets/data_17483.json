    "title": "Need to repair Pixel 4 XL in India. Broken screen & Facial Recognition. No clarity on loud-speaker.",
    "content": "I cracked my Pixel 4 XL (bought in Australia, not insured ) and I am currently in India and I want to get it repaired. The screen is cracked but functional except the facial recognition sensor. Also, the speaker during calls is somehow not properly functional. I get a dampened voice instead of a loud and clear voice. B2X, the official partnered repair centres in India doesn't seem to be catering to the google services anymore, hence, I need support from google as to where can I send my phone for repair and get it sorted? Any leads?",
