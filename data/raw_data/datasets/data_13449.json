    "title": "Why is my Pixel 4A disconnect and reconnect every 2 min. after paired with 2017 Buick Envision?",
    "content": "I have followed all of the troubleshooting protocols but my Pixel 4a continues to disconnect after a couple of minutes and then reconnects to my 2017 Buick.  This continues until I delete the device from the car. As a result I cannot use hands free in the car. I never had this problem with my Pixel 2.",
