    "content": "Pixel 2 xl few years old.  The phone app crashes when I press any number on the key pad.  I have re started in safe mode and the problem still exists.  I can use the phone in any other way - using the assistant to voice command a call, for instance -  but it still behaves the same.  I have not sequentially uninstalled apps ( I don't have a lot of them) but the problem was not synonymous with the installation of any apps that I have recently installed.  Is there a way to locate the issue without a reset??",
