    "content": "When Focus Mode is running, the icon typically appears in the notification bar. It gives the option of taking a break or turning the mode off.\n\nI don't know what happened, but the icon is no longer present. In order to take a break now I either have to turn it off in the settings or select an app that I blocked and choose to use it for five minutes. I don't get the pop up offering to take a break for 5, 15, or 30 minutes. \n\nHow do I get the icon back? I tried the quick toggle icon but all that does is turn it on and off.",
