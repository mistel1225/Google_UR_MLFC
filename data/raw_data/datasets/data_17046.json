    "title": "Pixel 3 XL Android Beta Install Failed",
    "content": "I have Android 11 beta installed on my current Pixel 3 XL, but I just received a brand new Pixel 3 XL from a warranty return and restored everything, then joined the beta again on this phone. It downloaded and tried to install which after reboot takes over 20 minutes then fails and reboots again with the message \"Couldn't update Installation problem\", and it has \"Try again\" button which I did once with the same result. This is a brand new 128GB, not reconditioned so I have no idea what would cause this? Any ideas?",
