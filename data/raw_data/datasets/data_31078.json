    "content": "I love the easy setup for my new Pixel 3a XL. Just connect by cable and copy all my stuff from my Pixel XL. But when the process was finished, I was presented with a page that said that except for contacts and photos nothing was copied. Call history / device settings / music / SMS messages all did not transfer. Too bad. Shall I send the 3a back and wait until the setup works?",
