    "content": "A few days ago my cellphone (google pixel 2 XL) got wet in the pool. Immediately it began to fail. First it did not turn on, then turned on but the speakers did not work, then the speakers began to work but the phone went off and did not charge. Now that it charges, the cell phone is on (you can know that it vibrates), but the screen is black, so you can not see any images and it does not emit any brightness. They told me that I could restore it to factory mode but I can not do it since the screen does not work and I can not enter settings on the cell phone. Is there another way to restore it without using the screen? Is there any other solution for the screen to work properly? Thank you.",
