    "content": "In my home when I say Ok Google my google homes spring to life and start listening, at the same time my Pixel phone also starts to listen.\n\nAfter completing my request depending on whichever device heard me clearer/closer it is the one to answer. However for some reason, my phone will sometimes be stuck in the 'listening' mode and never turn off the screen unless I manually turn off/exit the mode. Even when it is stuck in this mode giving it a command/asking a question does not prompt the normal assistant response. It just stays on the listening mode",
