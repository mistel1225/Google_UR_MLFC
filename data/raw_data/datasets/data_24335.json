    "content": "So I upgraded to Android 10 this week on my Pixel 2 and I cannot turn off audible notifications from Email or text messages. I was working with Google support and they said they don't have a fix for this. Anyone figure out how to fix it without putting the phone in Do Not Disturb?",
