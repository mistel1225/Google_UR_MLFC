    "content": "Hi,\nI'm using the recorder app to 'write' a novel draft. It doesn't seem to recognise punctuation commands like 'open quotes' etc. I may be missing something. At the moment I'm using a random word to indicate the start and end of dialogue but this will mean going through the doc with find & replace. Any ideas if it's something I'm doing wrong or something that's missing and if so will they add it?",
