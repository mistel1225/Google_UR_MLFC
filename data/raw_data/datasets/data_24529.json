    "content": "Recently I purchased a Pixel 3a and trying to use it in China. So frustrated that when connecting through WIFI, it kept telling me no internet connection. It is because Pixel/Android was trying to connect to a google server to determine the internet connectivity, unfortunately google service is not available there. I saw similar problems/questions in this forum dated to more than 2 years back, and the problem is still not fixed after two years. Shame on you, google engineers.",
