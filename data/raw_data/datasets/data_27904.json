    "content": "My WIFI keeps turning off after being connected for about 5-7 seconds, then it stays off for 2-3 seconds and turns on again.\nI've checked the network, it works on all my other phones and laptops. I've tried Safe Mode to eliminate the possibility of it being a malfunctioning app.\nI've tried turning it on and off again, switching networks, deleting recently installed apps.\nNone of it works. \n\nAnyone knows how to fix this because this is quite frustrating...\n\nThanks in advance!",
