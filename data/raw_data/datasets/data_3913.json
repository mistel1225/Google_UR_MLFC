    "content": "My Google Fabric case for the Pixel 4a 5G fits very snuggly. However, when the phone is in my pocket, the right side seems to pop out a bit, often pressing on the power button and switching the phone off which is really annoying.\nI'm not sure how this is happening as to pop off the case actually takes a fair bit of pressure, but its happening nearly every day and I only know about it when I take the phone out of my pocket.\n\nHas anyone else experienced this or have a solution?",
