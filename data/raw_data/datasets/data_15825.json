    "content": "When I'm outdoors the Google Pixel 4 XL I own overheats. It seems to do this at around 100 degrees. Since I live in Phoenix it is over 100 degrees quite a bit of the time so this is a big problem for me. Some apps stop working and the phone drops down from 4G to 3G. It often takes a reboot even after the phone cools to get 4G back again.",
