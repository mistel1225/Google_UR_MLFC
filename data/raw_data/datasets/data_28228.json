    "content": "My Pixel 2XL, as of this morning, powers off on being plugged in. I'm not 100% sure it's tied to the update since the phone was happy for the day or so after upgrading, but I've never seen this issue before.\n\nI woke up to my phone powered off and fully charged. I turned it on and everything was normal. Later, when plugging my phone into my car charger, it powered off after about a minute. Turned it on again and everything was normal. Now at work, the phone powers off nearly instantly upon being plugged in. Every time it just goes straight to the powered off charging screen, no error screen or something like that in between. \n\nThe same thing still happens in safe mode. The charge has been 80% or more this  morning, so I haven't tested lower battery levels to see if it still happens then. This is still occurring after cleaning out the USB-C port.\n\nIf I turn my phone on after it shuts down while leaving it plugged in, everything appears to be fine. It stays on and charges normally for a bit at least, but sometimes turns off again after a few minutes.",
