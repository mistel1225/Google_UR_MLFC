I tried to do a normal restart and it didn't fix the problem.\nI tried a full reboot, using the volume key and on/off switch, but the android icon says no command and I can't scroll down to anything, and the only way out of it is to go back to normal restart.\nPhone is only 5 months old. \nAny ideas?",
