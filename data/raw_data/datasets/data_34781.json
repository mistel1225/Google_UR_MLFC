    "content": "This phone has the worst phone call quality!! When on a call, I can hear everyone clearly, but they complain that my voice cuts in and out. This happens on every call, with wifi and bluetooth off. Never even set up wifi calling on this phone as it is right out of the box. There are list of complaints on forums about this problem. I am disappointed, people are still reporting the same problem even after getting replacement phones. It's a great phone but the actual phone or microphone is crap. Just upgraded from a Pixel 2 XL and so far regretting it. Help!!!!",
