    "content": "Why has Google decided not to sell the Pixel 5 in Spain? It's not regulatory: they sell it in other EU countries. It's not support: they sell the Pixel 4a (and 4/4xl) in Spain. I don't understand what possible expense or barrier would prevent Google from simply offering a phone model through an existing store/channel when everything is already done.\n\nAt the very least, they could let people in Spain order from France or Germany via their store.\n\nWhat gives Google?",
