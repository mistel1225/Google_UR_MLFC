    "content": "I had my phone turned off while in the movies. When I turned it back on I noticed the screen was continually turning on for 15 -20 seconds every minute or so. When I tried to us it I got error message \"Process system not responding\". I tried to reboot but found the power and restart commands would not respond. Also if I attempt to continue with opening an app, within 30 seconds the phone would restart on it's own. I tried a \"hard restart\" but that made no difference. I can't receive or make calls texts or data. can you suggest anything. Thanks. Regards, Les.",
