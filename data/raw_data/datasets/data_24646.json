    "title": "Google Pixel acting strange. Reboot randomly. Freezes frequently. Unable to do simple tasks.",
    "content": "The Device is Google Pixel and I am facing some serious issues. I am getting a dialog randomly that System Process isn't responding. Sometimes the device is unable to detect the earphones until I reboot it again. Sometimes when I am listening to music via earphones, I hear a click sound after that my device starts behaving strangely like videos unable to stream, speaker not working, fingerprint sensor not working and I have to reboot it again. When I make a call, the sound is not transmitting and the device hangs and unable to cut the call since the device freezes. Sometimes, if someone is calling i am not seeing it on my device.",
