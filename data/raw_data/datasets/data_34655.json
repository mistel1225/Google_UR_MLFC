    "content": "Hi, I just switched from a Note 9 to a Pixel 3 XL, but I am missing many functions I got used to. Hopefully you can help:\n\n(1) Multiple Facebook and Instagram accounts: since I am using both personal and business facebook and instagram accounts, I was able to put two different facebook / instagram apps on my screen. Apparently, this is not supported with the Pixel 3 XL?\n\n(2) I want to be able to see e.g. how many new mail messages I got, but at this point I can only choose to show a dot for new messages\n\n(3) On my Note I used to have a short video instead of a simple background on the unlock screen. How can I change that?\n\n(4) Apparently I dont have the ‚flip to shhh‘ functin. Is it because I am using a business profile for GMail?\n\nThanks",
