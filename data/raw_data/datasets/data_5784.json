    "content": "I just got a Pixel 5 and have set it up.  After going through the process and finishing the setup process, I realized that my messages did not auto-download when I opened the app.  When I go to setting to look for \"Finish Setup\", it isn't there any more.  How do I get back to it so that I can transfer my messages from my old phone (Samsung S8+) to the new one?",
