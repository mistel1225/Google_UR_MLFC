    "content": "After the October 2020 update, my pixel battery only lasts about 5 hours.  This is with everything disabled and I mean everything disabled.  I charged it to 100%, removed it from the charger, disabled everything and let it set there.  About 5 hours later it was completely dead.  I used to be able to go 2 to 3 days between charges.  Started it up in safe mode and it does the same thing.",
