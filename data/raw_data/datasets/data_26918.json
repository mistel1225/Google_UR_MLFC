    "title": "Use Amazon Freetime as Launcher",
    "content": "Pixel 2 recently upgraded to 10/6/19 security patch, version 10.\n\nI use the Amazon FreeTime app for my kids to use my phone in 'child mode' (limits access to phone features). As of the upgrade, the app consistently asks me to set it as the default launcher before I can use it, even when I select 'Use Always'. Previously, the setting was applied once. Now, every time I open the FreeTime app I have to reset it to as the Launcher. When I go through the Setting > Apps & notifications > Advanced > Default apps to set it as the Launcher it is not listed as an option. I'm tired of having to reconfigure this every time I try to share my phone with my kids (>1/day).",
