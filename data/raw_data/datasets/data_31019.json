    "title": "When using a Jabra Talk 45 earpiece Assistant behaves completely randomly when using SMS",
    "content": "Has anyone found Assistant to respond completely randomly when trying to send/receive SMS messages?  It randomly tells you who the incoming message is from.  It has tremendous difficulty in replying to messages.  It NEVER marks the message as \"READ\" after reading the message which means I hear all the old messages over and over till I manually read them.  Overall I find it completely useless - and as I use it in my work truck to deal with messages from clients it is essential to me.",
