    "content": "Hi, I have just bought a brand new Google Pixel 2 (couldn't afford the 3) and the flash is terrible! I'm so disappointed. I got this phone as the camera was meant to be amazing. But flash pictures produce terrible red eye. Anyone experience the same? And video and pictures are terrible in low light conditions. Very pixelated.",
