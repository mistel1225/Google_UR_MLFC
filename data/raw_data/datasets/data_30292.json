    "content": "I recently bought a Pixel 3 and I have multiple apps (iNaturalist, Hangouts, etc.) that bring up the recent photos folder when uploading photos. However, there is never anything in that folder. I have to navigate to the sidebar and to my photos folder which gets very tedious after a while.\n\nWhat might be the problem here?",
