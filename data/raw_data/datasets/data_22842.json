    "content": "For the past two days my phone won't ring when someone calls, I can't hear anyone on my Duo Calls, WhatsApp calls, or speaker phone calls on the regualr phone app but I can hear all of my IG videos and youtube videos no problem. I have spoken to 6 support people via google and did ALL the trouble shooting. Does anyone have any other ideas? Has anyone had this happen to them?",
