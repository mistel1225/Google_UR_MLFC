    "content": "My Pixel 3 XL has been glitching and giving me System UI not responding randomly without me doing anything on my phone. Also, my Pixel doesn't want to connect to the WIFI or Bluetooth, it doesn't even detect.  \nIt's frustrating because it glitches and reboots.\nI did all the troubleshooting, I even DID a Factory reset on my phone to see if that helped? and still having the same issues, So I flash-booted the O.S Image manually and the problem is still there!",
