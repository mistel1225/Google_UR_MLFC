    "title": "Android December Security Update essentially bricked my Pixel 2 XL",
    "content": "After reading about the terrible permanent denial of a service problem, I installed the December Android security update, which installed without any issues. Immediately after though, My phone became essentially unusable, because it continually says: \"Pixel Launcher keeps stopping\" \n\nTo do ANYTHING, you have to press \"close app\" then quickly try to type a letter or press onscreen, because our good buddy \"Pixel Launcher keeps stopping\" will pop up in less than one second. \n\nI have tried safe mode, I have tried everything, and it still does it. I'm going to have to do a factory reset now, after maddening attempts to get a couple of crucial files removed with the fast press method described above.\n\nI would warn anyone who wants to install the December update that they do so at their own risk, based on my experience. I am a long-time android user, very experienced, and don't have any sketchy software or apps on this particular phone. I have never experienced anything like this with one of these updates.\n\nGoogle can send me a new phone for alerting them to this issue.",
