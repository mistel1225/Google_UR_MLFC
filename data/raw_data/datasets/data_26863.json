    "title": "Pixel 3a XL - no audio will play after car died while Bluetooth was connected",
    "content": "Phone was connected to car stereo via Bluetooth. Turned the engine off but left to car on as to finish listening to the video that was playing via the YouTube app. Noticed some extra lights pop up on the dash and tried to start the car. Either the alternator or battery had died. \n\nHowever, just after that I cannot get my phone to play audio. Literally just after, tried looking video and no sound would play. The alarm app works fine, still get a loud alarm. When making a phone call I can only hear the person if speaker phone is on.\n\nI've restarted, powered down, booted into safe mode, reset the wifi/data/Bluetooth in the reset options, and did a full factory reset. Nothing works. Hulu, Pandora, YouTube, Netflix.... nothing will play sound.\n\nIt's like the phone is still connected to the car via Bluetooth. No sound comes out of the device.\n\nYes, I have checked all sound settings\n\n***Edit***\n\nCharged to 100%, was 55 at posting. Randomly checked again and I have sound now, roughly 2hrs after my problem. I have no idea what was/is wrong.",
