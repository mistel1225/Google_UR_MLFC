    "content": "I purchased and paid for a brand new PAYG Google Pixel 5 from Voxi UK network, a subsidiary of Vodaphone UK. They claim that I must insert their PAYG sim card into the phone, activate it, then use it for a minimum of one month before being able to network unlock it. However, I have decided I wish to sell my Pixel 5 new, sealed in the box, and I wish to simply activate the Voxi sim card in my Samsung Galaxy S8 (and pay for the minimum one month contract with Voxi).\n\nI have been told that all Google Pixel 5 phones are network unlocked. Now, I know that, at a minimum, a buyer would be able to use this phone on the Vodafone network, but will they be able to use it with any network sim card as I believe they would? I've seen some online comments from Voxi UK customers who wrote that their Pixel 5 phones were indeed network unlocked but I don't want any buyer to find out that this isn't actually the case. \n\nCan others please confirm that Voxi UK (or any mobile network company) cannot remotely apply a network lock to a Google Pixel 5 that has been paid off in full at purchase? \n\nThank you.",
