    "content": "No number in the field. Tried editing the entry, won't select. I can make and receive calls and texts fine. I am trying to get this Pixel 2 XL to use the same phone number for both SMS and phone calls. I am not using Fi. Carrier is T-Mobile. I will try the SIM card reinsertion in a moment.\n\nAny thoughts?",
