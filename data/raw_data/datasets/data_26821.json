    "content": "Husband keeps hearing a new notification sound, like a doorbell.  He has no idea why it's doing it, and it does it sometimes several times in a row.  We tried turning off GPS and he restarted his phone, but the sound keeps going off and is getting increasingly agitating.  \n\nAny advice would be appreciated!  thank you!",
