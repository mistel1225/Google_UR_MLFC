    "content": "Hi,\n\nI have a Google Pixel XL that will not connect to LTE or 4G on any mobile network. I have tried it with Android 10 and 9 and still only H+. \n\nAll of the settings are correct and I have tried flight mode, phone options through * code. My sim gets 4g in other phones but not my pixel.\n\nCould my antenna or modem be faulty... I do get data just not LTE/4g\n\nThanks",
