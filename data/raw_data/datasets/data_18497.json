It checks and shows system is up to date and with Google Play system update of may 2020.\n\nMy phone system is up to date with Google July 2020 update.\n\nYour support person Stella is asking me to send for repair which I denied because of below 2 reasons.\n\n1. It's brand new 1 month old device.\n2. I don't have any spare device to use.\n\nIt's some problem related to software and I don't understand the logic of repairs here.\n\nEither you send some software updates to correct this issue or send me a new replacement device.",
