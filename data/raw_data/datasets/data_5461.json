    "content": "I have the Google Pixel 4XL.\nIt has started to only charge up to 50% and will shut off intermittently.\nWhen I plug the charger in it also comes up with a \"?\" on the battery symbol.\nNow it doesn't tell me how much percentage of battery I have at all, just the battery symbol.\nWhen I go to the battery settings it just tells me \"Unknown\".\nHow do I fix this? Can it be fixed with out being sent off to be repaired?",
