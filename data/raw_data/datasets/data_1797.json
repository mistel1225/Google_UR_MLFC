    "content": "My phone crashes while using apps and states that my device is corrupt and needs a factory reset. When I choose \" try again\" it works fine until it doesn't. This just recently started happening with no new or suspicious apps installed. I have a big report generated but it cannot be uploaded here. Hopefully I can get this fixed without a reset.\n\nThank you in advance,\nAndrew",
