    "title": "Face unlock has been broken since I bought this phone (pixel 4)",
    "content": "Face unlock has been broken since day 1. Every day for about 4 or 5 times it just says \"clean your front sensor\" and, for some reason, the swipe up gesture to enter the pin also requires a full-screen length swipe. I paid nearly a thousand bucks for this thing and it has NEVER been fixed. I've owned all previous pixels but this really makes me reconsider whether Google actually gives a flying hoot. Does anybody have any idea? Already tried factory reset and the likes. \n\nThanks guys",
