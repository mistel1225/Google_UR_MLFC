    "content": "I purchased my Pixel 4 XL earlier this year in the States through google store. Today the screen would start turning into green and become unresponsive. Now it won't even startup. When I hold down the power button, it would just create a short vibration as feedback.\n\nIs there anything I can do about it? I tried to hold it down for 30 seconds for a hard reset, but it didn't work. \n\nPlease advise what can be done. \n\nPS I have updated the OS recently, not sure if that matters.",
