    "content": "My pixel is secondhand, it's bootloader was unlocked when I bought. The play store works fine, the updates can be applied normally through play store, but it shows Device is not certified under Play Protect certification.  Now I want to lock the bootloader again, but I'm afraid to brick the phone.  My idea is that if the recovery is official, may it be safely to relock the bootloader.",
