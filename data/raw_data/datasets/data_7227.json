    "content": "I am deaf, I wear cochlear implants - paired with the phone. I want to turn off notifications for the phone app itself but still get notifications for other apps. The phone app notifications are currently grayed out and cannot be changed. Turning on \"Do not disturb\" results in my paired implants still getting notified and muting the phone doesn't stop notifications either. Is there a way to disable the phone app or remove it all together? however, I still need to get notifications for other apps such as Gmail and messages.
