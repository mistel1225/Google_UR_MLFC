    "title": "Pixel 4 keeps freezing and rebooting",
    "content": "Phone can freeze and reboot constantly. Face recognition has failed so always need to use keypad. Doing this, causes a reboot. Listen to a podcast, pick up phone to pause because of screen lock, try to input pin, fails. When I do get the phone unlocked I can click on an app, message or camera and it resets. Sometimes I get a high pitched buzzer like an old motherboard and it fails. Plugging in the phone to charge, clicking a link in an email, taking a picture, phone just freezes and reboots. I have done a factory reset and today upgraded to Android 11 but it still does it",
