    "content": "My father is blind and has no feeling in his hands. He lives alone and need a cell phone for emergencies. But when someone calls the cell, depending on whether or not he accidentally opened something on his phone, the answer/ ignore buttons are either on the bottom (full screen notification), or on top ( ribbon notification). As a result, he misses more than half of his calls because the button isn't where he thinks the button is. So, is there a way to make the answer button constant, or is there a way to set up the phone to be more blind friendly?\nThanks\nSorry if my terminology is incorrect. I'm old to.",
