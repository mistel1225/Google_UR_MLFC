    "content": "Hi There! I travel frequently between another county and the US. I currently have a phone for when I’m there, and another one for when I’m in the US. If I were to get a dual sim phone… I’m thinking of getting the new Google Pixel 4a…. I was thinking that I could use the e-sim for the carrier in the US, and the actual sim for the carrier in the other country. So my question, if I am outside of the US, is it possible to place the e-sim so it only receives calls and messages via wifi calling? That way, it doesn’t charge my US carrier for any international calls, and I am still able to receive US calls and text messages while away when I have wifi available? With that being said... still have the International sim working so I can also continue receiving calls from that country?",
