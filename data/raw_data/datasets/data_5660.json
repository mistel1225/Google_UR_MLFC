    "content": "I replaced my Pixel 3 under extended warranty a few months ago, and on the replaced phone the level in the camera app is consistently off. (On my old Pixel 3 it worked great, any discrepancy was not noticeable.) \n\nWhen the camera is actually horizontal, as verified by an external level, the camera tells me it is 6°. If using the camera verticallsit's a little better, but appears it may still be 2° off. I also downloaded another app, PixelProse Bubble level, which also reproduced the behavior.\n\nIt seems I need to recalibrate the sensor. Is there any way to do that?",
