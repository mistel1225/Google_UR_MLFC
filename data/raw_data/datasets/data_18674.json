    "content": "I went on a kayaking trip the other day and my phone got a little wet before I took it out and left it in our car.  The phone only got mildly wet at most through my pocket on a calm lake while I was out there for 10 minutes before I realized I had it on me still.  The phone was moist at most, but still saw some liquid.\n\nI'm able to get full, un-distorted sound when I select to use my spottily for an Alarm or try to change a notification / ringtone, but cannot get Spotify itself, or any other app to make sound.  I tried Spotify itself, games, YouTube app, chrome websites, anything I could think of that uses the speakers. \n\nI would imagine if it were strictly water hardware damage then I wouldn't get any sound, or at least get distorted sound from the alarms.  But with it giving me the option to have full un-distorted sound from the alarm or ringtone/notification selection app only, I'm not sure where to go.\n\nI saw other issues out there like mine, on the support.google, and have tried about all the troubleshooting that I found in those, listed below.  If you know of something that I don't then please let me know.\n\nCurrent Troubleshooting done:\n\nCheck basic sound levels, they are all ~75%\nRestart the phone\nReset all of the app data.\nRestart and try sound in safe mode, still works well with the Alarm here.\nWhile in safe mode, still unable to get sound from youtube while using chrome. or other app\nA backup and fully restored the phone.\n\n\nOn Android OS 10  All other apps seem to be updated from the play store.",
