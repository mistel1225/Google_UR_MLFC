    "content": "My Pixel 4XL has been having charging issues. Right after I did an Android update, it started acting up. When it's plugged in, it reads \"50%\". When I unplug it, it dies within a minute. I contacted Google online, and they sent me an RMA, mailing label, and packaging to ship it to their repair center. I packaged it and shipped. I received an email today that they received it, and then another email stating that they found the charging issue, but they also say that there is a screen problem, and that the screen is cracked. It was NOT cracked when I shipped it, and the screen worked fine. The email says that I have 10 days to authorize the repair for $299.00, or they will send my phone back. How do I contact the repair center to dispute the damaged screen? If I have them return it, I don't feel  that I'll ever get it fixed. I feel that the charging issue should be under warranty, since I've only had it 8 months.",
