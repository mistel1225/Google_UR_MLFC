    "content": "I use my Pixel 3XL (Android Q beta 5) for live streaming. After about 5 minutes of broadcasting, the cellular speed drops to 0.5 mb/s. When using bonding, traffic through WiFi is transmitted without problems. Perhaps this is some kind of function to save traffic? I checked several sim cards and apps. Problem is the same.",
