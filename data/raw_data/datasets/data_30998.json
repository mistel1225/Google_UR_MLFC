    "content": "Google / Android pushed an update and my Pixel 2 was unable to install it, which resulted in a black BIOS screen. I was forced to do a factory reset after trying to reinstall several times. I had several photos on the device that had not sync'd. I would like to try to recover the files, but every option I have found requires that I Root the device, but I have a Verizon phone and am unable to do so. Are there any options from Google and/or Verizon to recover the pictures?",
