    "content": "In the last two weeks when I use my car Bluetooth interface to make calls it will initiate the call but switch audio from the car speakers to my phone. I have tried deleting each device from the other and looked at every setting I know how to look to see why this happens. It also happens when someone calls me; The phone rings via the car speakers but when I hit the button to answer then it switches to my phone only. I am at a complete loss here",
