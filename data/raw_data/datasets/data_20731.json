    "content": "No matter what I do to try to calibrate the sensors, my compass (tried two apps) indicates north as being about 60 degrees west of where it should be - wildly inaccurate!\nI've tried the figure 8, the rotating three times in each axis, nothing makes a difference.\nAny suggestions?",
