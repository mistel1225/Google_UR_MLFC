    "title": "Camera app gesture shortcut not working",
    "content": "The gesture shortcut (double clicking the power button) for the camera app worked great on my pixel 4a until I updated to Android 11. Now it just vibrates, the screen goes momentarily dark but the camera never opens. I tried restarting the phone and toggling the gesture shortcut on and off in settings. Neither approach made any difference. Camera still does launch when I open the camera directly by tapping the camera app icon.",
