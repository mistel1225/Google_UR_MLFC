    "content": "On my pixel when I am connected to Bluetooth either a speaker or headphones the notification tone seems to be controlled by the media volume rather than the ringtone volume like it is when Bluetooth is not connected. So if I have Bluetooth connected and the media volume is down I don't hear or receive the notification because it's not going through the ringtone volume which is always set at a hundred percent. This needs to be addressed and fixed or a workaround found for it.",
