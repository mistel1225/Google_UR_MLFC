    "title": "Typing lag and inaccuracy",
    "content": "I switched from Samsung Galaxy to Pixel 4a5g last fall, and typing has been a major headache. I have to constantly stop and fix typos, it takes me three times longer to type a simple sentence on the Pixel than it ever did on my previous phones. It's kind of maddening.\n\nThere seems to be a delay of some sort, as if the keyboard is a half second behind what I'm typing, and the response is just awful. I've tried all suggestions I've found online. Clearing Gboard cache, reinstalling, toying with the settings, always restarting after changes, etc. I've adjusted the keyboard so that the size is exactly the same as my previous phone. Something is seriously wrong here, and I've found other people with the same problem on reddit.\n\nI want to love this phone, but 4 months in and sadly I regret the purchase so far. It seems everyone gives the same generic troubleshooting answers, and none of them actually fix the problem. I'm so tired of typing in slow motion to avoid constant mistakes.",
