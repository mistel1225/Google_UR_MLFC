    "content": "This pop up dictionary is annoying and completely redundant. If I've misspelled a word, I have suggestions already at the top of the keyboard that appear when I tap the word.  Now (noticed this new pointless \"feature\" after an update last year) a window pops up that does the exact same thing. I was using Gboard on a Samsung S9 just a few days ago and it does not have this annoying feature. I don't like this. How can I get rid of it?",
