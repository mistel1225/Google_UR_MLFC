    "content": "Got a Pixel 5 about a week ago. The phone seems to lose quite a lot of battery while being idle overnight, and there is no particular app/service that seems to be driving this. Is this defective hardware or can this be fixed by me? For context, the I'd charged to 100% (where the graph below begins), then used the phone a little (which is where the first inflection point is), then slept with no apps running in the background (which is when the battery dropped by a concerning amount), and then you see the inflection point when I woke up and started using the phone again in the morning.",
