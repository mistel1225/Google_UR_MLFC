    "content": "Hello,\nSo my Google Pixel 3a froze for the 1st time ever, so I held down the start button on the side and it shut down the phone...now it won't start up again!\nI've held down the start button for 1 minute and kept it charged by plug and computer (20 mins each)\n\nIs it done for or is there some hope?\n\nThank you,\nStarving Artist",
