    "content": "Looking for feedback from anyone experiencing similar issues - is it the device? Do I have a setting enabled somewhere? \n\nI've noticed that my Pixel 3 seems to manage phone calls horribly when I'm on my home wifi network (having trouble remembering if I've run into this at work). \nDialing out, I experience a long delay connecting, and other times it never appears to make a connection. \nFor both outgoing and inbound calls, I'm able to hear audio from the other party, but they can't hear mine. \nI've already confirmed that wifi calling is not enabled, but when I turn the wifi connection off, it seems to improve.",
