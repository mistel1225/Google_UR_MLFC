    "content": "The phone is too slippery to grab (Nexus 4 had rubery sides and Nexus 5X had rubery back, both not super grippy but better than this). I need to glue a finger holder to the back, (which is extremely useful, especially for big phones) but it seems that the back has some sort of oleophobic coating which makes it difficult to glue anything. Please let me know what type of glue or double sided tape to use.",
