    "content": "I own a Google Pixel XL and a couple of days ago I upgraded to Android 10 OS, unknowingly that it would lead to this problem. Today at one point the screen frooze and after a couple of minutes it started to reboot endlessly. \nWhen I try to enter the Android Boost and select recovery mode, it doesn't take me to the Android lying down with chest opened icon to select Wipe Data/Factory Reset ; instead the Google icon appears again and the phone retakes the looping process of loading and then restart.\n\nCan you please troubleshoot this issue for me?",
