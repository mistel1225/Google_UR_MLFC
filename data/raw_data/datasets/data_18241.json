    "content": "My wife has a pixel 2 and had copied some of her contacts, from the Google contacts app, to the home screen. \nYesterday a couple of contacts disappeared from the home screen. Going into the contacts app they had gone from there too. I managed to restore them but an hour later another one had gone.\n\nYes I can restore the contacts but why is this happening? How do I prevent it from happening again?",
