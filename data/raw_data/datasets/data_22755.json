    "title": "How to get Messages to stop cutting off country and regional codes",
    "content": "Since moving to Australia most, but not all, of my international texts are showing that they go through but do not arrive. After four weeks of working with my carrier at multiple levels they have determined that my phone is cutting off the country codes. I'm assuming the problem is Messages as my phone calls go through when originating from the same contacts. To make it even more fun, last week Messages decided to drop the 04 prefix that indicates a mobile phone and I am no longer able to text my teenager on her Australian cell phone. My version of Messages is well past the update that was supposed to fix this issue.",
