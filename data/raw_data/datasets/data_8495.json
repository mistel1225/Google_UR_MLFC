    "content": "When I am listening to music (specifically when connected to a wireless speaker) and I press volume down to decrease the volume, instead the volume jumps to the half way point which is incredibly loud! I have seen reports of a similar issue with the Pixel 5, that the latest update has apparently fixed. However, my 4a 5g updated yesterday and this issue is still occurring. Anyone else having similar problems? I can't comment on whether the same happens using headphones as I haven't tried that and the issue is sporadic and doesn't occur every time I alter the volume.",
