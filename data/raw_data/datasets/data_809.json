    "content": "My Pixel 4xl motherboard broke 3 months after the manufacturer warranty ended.  I purchased a BestBuy warranty with the phone so they sent me a new one and I would send back the old one.  \n\nThe new phone is also broken.  It does not charge.  It knows it's plugged in, saying 1hour 28 minutes to full but that's apparently a lie.  I have used a functioning wireless charger and the original charger. Less importantly when you restart it it just turns off.  It'll turn back on if you hold the power button for almost 10 seconds",
