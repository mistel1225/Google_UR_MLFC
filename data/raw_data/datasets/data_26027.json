    "content": "How do I view the detailed call history of a contact.  Ever since upgrading to the Pixel 3XL I've lost the ability to see a detailed call log.  When I click a call in the phone app, it used to show recent texts as well as calls between the contact an I, with exact times and dates.   Now all it shows is the last call was x hours ago or x days ago.  When you click the contact it doesn't show any calls or messages.",
