    "content": "Okay so my Google assistant normally sounds like the normal female voice but today I plugged in those USB C earbuds that you get with the phone and when the assistant tells me I have a new notification or reads a text it sounds really strange, like computer modified to sound super deep or something. It sounds totally fine doing other things on the earbuds like telling me the weather and stuff but any function tied to reading notifications or anything like that sounds totally different and wierd. Is there a way to change the voice or the voice pitch or anything?",
