    "content": "I was delivered the faulty phone on the 29th August 2019 and ask google to replace my device on the same day. I returned the product on 2nd September 2019 and today is 19th September 2019. I haven't heard anything from the google and when I call customer care I am kept on hold for hours and provided with incoherent information.\nIf someone can help me out.",
