    "content": "Hey, \nFirst of love the new pixel very smooth as always been a fan since the pixel 2 and finally upgraded.\n\nThe new camera is now integrated in the screen which does not bother me while being on the main screen or scrolling threw the web, but if I open games or netflix there will be suddenly a cut off/nodge just beneath the camera. \n\nIs there an option where I can stop the pixel from doing so or is there something out there that can fix that? \n\nThanks for your help in advance \n\nJonathan Trabold",
