    "content": "I have all the latest updates installed, done a reboot, cleared the cache, tried safe mode to see if it was a 3rd party app. Was told by Google support the only remaining option is a factory reset. Don't use all Google mail, text, etc. therefore not interested in loosing stings and non Google info. Anyone know of other fixes?",
