    "content": "Planning to buy a Pixel 5 and would like to use eSIM in India, have read quite a few posts but till now it's not clear if people got the eSIM feature working in India on Pixel 4 / 4xl as they are also not supported by Indian carriers. \n\nTechnically it shouldn't be any issue but wouldn't like to take a risk. Hope someone can clarify on this.",
