    "content": "Since Google decided to not allow Miracast or anything but Chromecast I have no idea how to get my phone to cast/mirror to my tv without internet. I went and bought a USB C to HDMI cable... Seems that's been axed as well. I don't have home internet just phone data for at least the next 4 months while my area is undergoing upgrade works and I really want to cast to any of my TVs . I have a Chromecast that use to be connected to internet when I had it. A DVD and tv with older smart tv capabilities (Mira cast lg tv from about 3 years ago) and was considering a small smart tv with inbuilt Bluetooth and Chromecast but pretty sure neither will work",
