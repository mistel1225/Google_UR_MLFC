    "content": "Pixel 3a; Android 11\nGreetings.\nAfter the last android update I ran into a very annoying problem with a random notification sound (default one). It happens two to three times per day. I checked the notification log in the settings and its source is not indicated there. I even did a full factory reset  and it didn't help.\nDoes anyone know how to fix it?\nNow I thinking to switching phone because its really frustrating to wake up at night because of random sound.",
