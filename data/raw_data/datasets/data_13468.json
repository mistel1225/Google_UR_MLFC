    "content": "I got a notification few days back saying pixel 4a is back in stock. Since then i am trying to order the phone but it says 'No seller ships to this pincode' even in Delhi, Banglore, Mumbai, which is hard to digest. Who is playing the game here? Google or flipkart? I contacted both of them but you know the usual answers. If you guys dont want to sell the phone or having an issue with the seller then why was the back in stock notification? Already 4a 5G and 5 are not launched in india, you launch as per your wishes, then atleast make one phone you have launched sincerely available? Stop playing with customers. And have some decency to be transparent with customers about the issue so atleast people know how much to wait. Here i am trying since 5 days using every pincode but getting the same answer, now as it is in stock so i have to check manually everyday. Please solve this and escalate this issue whoever is responsible. Otherwise just simply tell the product is not available. Its heights now",
