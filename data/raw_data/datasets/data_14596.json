    "content": "The volume on my Pixel 2XL when using Bluetooth headphones is either far too low (even at max volume) or much too high (even at the lowest volume) the problem oscillates between these two frustrating states each time I restart my phone. This has been going on ever since I updated to Android 11. I have even updated Spotify but the problem persists. Please help me! Thanks",
