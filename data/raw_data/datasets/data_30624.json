    "content": "I have had to since switch phone carriers and buy a new phone even though mine was under warranty! You have accused me of lying.. Hiding things in pictures.. It's been 7 days since you said \"ok we can see you didn't lie (no apology mind you) we will replace.. 7 days filled with one bit of information request at a time... Per day. As if your playing with me further? People need these phones for work.. For life.. And your creating a mockery of of us..

Screenshots starting from the ok you didn't lie... To now with dates... And playing with me ",
