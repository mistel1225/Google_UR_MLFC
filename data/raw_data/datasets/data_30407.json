    "content": "Good day!\n\nMy Google Pixel XL (2016) on on boot loop last night therefore I was force to hard reset it. But this is the result:\n---Wiping data...\nFormatting data...\nE:/sbin/mke2fs_static failed with status 37\nE:format_volume: Failed to make ext4 on /dev/block/platform/soc/624000.ufshc/by-name/userdata: No such file or directory\nData wipe failed.\nE:Failed to clear BCB message: failed to write /dev/block/platform/soc/624000.ufshc/by-name/misc: I/0 error\n\nWhen I proceeded to REBOOT SYSTEM NOW, I'm stuck with white screen with Google on it.\n\nNeed advice. Hope there's still hope.\n\nThank you!",
