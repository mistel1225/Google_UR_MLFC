    "content": "Like many others I have the bad device with microphone issues, but I was not able to receive an updated one because I'm Canadian. Really disappointed about that. My phone worked totally fine until a month after installing android 10. This week I have reflashed it down to 9 again (bootloader unlock, total wipe) and the problems still persist on Android 9. This is different from other users where it seems downgrading actually helps.\n\nEven on 9, my phone freezes constantly, and cannot make or receive calls. Using the video recorder also totally breaks. This phone is essentially useless now, as playing audio sometimes totally breaks as well.\n\nUsing logcat, I can clearly see there is something wrong with kernal/HAL/API level with initiating audio.\n\n10087 06-07 11:20:14.016   904  1212 E AudioService: Audioserver died.\n10088 06-07 11:20:14.059  5668  5668 W ServiceManagement: Waited one second for android.hardware.audio@4.0::IDevicesFactory/d10089 06-07 11:20:14.517   904  1212 E AudioService: Audioserver died.\n10090 06-07 11:20:14.555   904  8464 W ServiceManager: Service media.sound_trigger_hw didn't start.

I only have a month until I have no internet connection and I need this phone 24/7 so I suppose in the month I will try to find a fix. I think I'll try another ROM as well, since obviously the software Google produces doesn't accommodate all their hardware.",
