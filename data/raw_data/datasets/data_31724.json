    "title": "Slow to acquire high-accuracy GPS signal on Pixel 3 unless I restart",
    "content": "Recently, apps that need high-accuracy, real-time GPS (Strava, Wahoo Fitness Tracker, etc.) take a long time (>5 minutes) to acquire a signal when the phone hasn't been restarted lately. \n\nIf I restart, it'll acquire a signal in just a few seconds. This has only been a problem for the last few weeks, possibly since I updated to the Apr 5 Security Patch. \n\nAnyone else seeing this? Any fixes?",
