    "content": "Hi all, my pixel 5 is having constant USB issues. Tried inspecting and cleaning the port, but didn't help.\n\nMy issue: i can't find any way to contact support to file a claim. Tried chatting, but the option never appears. It's 1pm here in Finland, so I'd expect some european team to be online.\n\nFor context: bought the phone in France, but now living in Finland. Still under warranty.\n\nThanks.",
