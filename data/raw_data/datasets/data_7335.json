    "content": "The phone refused to charge at 30%, and the battery icon was flushing when connected to a working charger. A couple of times, it restarted while connecting to the charger.\n\nI did a factory reset, turned on the battery saver, and when I connected the charger, it went black, and now the screen is flushing with a Google logo on it. It neither turns off nor turns on. The hard reset didn't work.\n\nAny idea what is wrong with it and how to fix it?\n\nThank you.",
