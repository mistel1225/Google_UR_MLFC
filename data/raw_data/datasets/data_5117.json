    "content": "I have noticed the problem today but I noticed that yesterday my phone kept asking me to confirm to agree to receive personalized notifications when it sits on the stand, it kept doing that all day, about every hour or 2.\n\nWhen I place my Pixel 5 onto the stand, white light at the base lights up and the phone charges. About 15 seconds later it stops charging and the orange light pops up for about 10 seconds. This cycle happens again one more time and the stand keeps charging and remains in \"charged\" mode. If I take off the phone, charged or not and place the phone back the cycle repeats every time. Had this stand for some time ( at least a year now ) used my pixel 3 on it no problem (well actually it was terribly slow and even exchanged it for a new one after talking with Google support but that still didnt help so I assumed it was a problem with my pixel 3) and since getting the pixel 5 in December it has worked no problem, even charges a bit faster. At first I thought some software bug that kept asking me to punch in my pin for personalized results and today I fought that too. So I decided to power cycle my phone which didnt help, then power cycle the stand which didnt help. I have tried using the pixel 5 charging brick instead of the pixel stand since it looked identical and had the same voltage specs on the brick but that didnt help.\n\nRight now after that orange light of death cycles twice the stand does its job but I fear this wont be the end of trouble, is there anything I can do?",
