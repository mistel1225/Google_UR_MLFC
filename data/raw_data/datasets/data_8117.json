    "content": "If I am taking a picture of a piece of paper with writing, then only a small portion of the paper that I tap on will be in focus, it seems like the rest of the image gets intentionally blurred. This wasn't the case a few months ago when I could take a picture of a piece of paper with everything in focus. This seems like a software issue because I can tap on different parts to make them in focus but just can't get the whole picture in focus.\n\nHere is a link to an example picture: https://ibb.co/grDjvVP",
