    "content": "Good morning Community!\n\nAfter the June update, my Pixel 2xl experienced charging issues: even if plugged in it won't charge. I was able to back up all my data until in reached 1% and shut down. Now, when i try to turn it on, it won't as not enough battery.\n\nI don't think it is a hardware issue, as when i plug the charging cable (the original one) I get the battery icon with the bolt on the screen, which however does not charge!\n\nWhat can i do? Is there an email address to contact Google directly (phone and chat options are not available). I could also mail it for repair, but what is the address, as I cannot find the prepaid label anymore.\n\nThank you for your help,\nPietro",
