    "content": "I recently had to get a new phone. Went from Pixel 2 to Pixel 3a.  I use my phone at work and previously, once my mac address was added to the guest network at the office, it would auto connect.  Now, even though the new mac address has been added (and it has not changed) I have to log in every day.  IT support said it must be something with the phone.  I was referred to a forum post about changing the setting from randomized MAC to use device Mac, but I don't seem to have the as a choice under wifi advance settings.  Only thing I see I can change in Private DNS.  So, do I need to turn that off so my phone will connect every day?  Or, is there something else I am missing (and IT is missing?!)?!",
