    "content": "If I reboot the phone, then the screen will work correctly for a random time (it can be few hours or a minute).\nI tried to remove the sim card to see if it was working better without it. No change observed.\nI have tried to reset the phone to the factory settings, but after 10 minutes the screen stopped being \"touchable\" again.\n\nWhen the screen is working, it works perfectly, and when it fails, it is in the total surface of the screen, not just one area.",
