    "content": "I installed a Ring doorbell Pro a few weeks ago and have had constant audio dropouts and occasional video freezing on live view. Recorded videos play back fine however. I went through all the Ring troubleshooting steps -- fiddled with WiFi channels, router placement, signal strength tests. I upgraded the doorbell transformer. Contacted Ring support and they sent me a replacement doorbell, but the problem remained.\n\nThen I noticed the alarm clock sound on my Google Pixel 3 XL phone started freezing and stuttering when I happened to be watching Ring live view, which made me think maybe the issue is my phone and not the doorbell. So I installed the Ring app on my Fire tablet and...what do you know, it plays the live view fine with no freezing or stuttering, and I can even talk to someone at the door.\n\nSo what's happening with the Pixel 3XL? It's a flagship phone spec'ed way higher than my old $80 Fire 8 tablet but something seems to be bogging down its performance. How do I find out what it is?",
