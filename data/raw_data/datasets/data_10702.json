    "content": "A while ago i made a post about my issue i have with my Pixel 3a . It's about when unlocking a phone there is this screen flickering. Original post here : https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/69968712?hl=en\nSo it hasn't been fixed after  these 3  months. Problem is with navigation buttons . When you use three buttons navigation flickering is there, but with gestures all seems ok . So it's a SOFTWARE issue . Please fix .",
