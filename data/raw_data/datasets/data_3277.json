    "content": "It is very unfortunate to see Google being silent about the whole 4y policy of samsung in supporting its phone.\n\nAs a loyal google phone users since nexus, it is a big punch to my face this new policy while google has been silent nor saying anything about potentially supporting its phones for 4y \n\nAny ideas about that?",
