    "content": "Hello,\nI have been having several performance issues that come and go with my Pixel 3XL for a few weeks.\n1. My Pixel won't recognize the headphones sold with it. I'm pretty sure they are not damaged, I have not tried with other headphones yet.\n2. My phone suddenly won't recognize the Pin I registered and won't unlock. Fortunately, it still recognize my fingerprints. I 100% sure I did not mistake my Pin: I have rebooted the phone and did a factory reset after which I set a very simple PIN. I had no problem using the PIN for a few days and then the problem got back.\n3. The phone will sometimes shut down when the battery shows it is still full. And it won't restart again. It won't charge also when plugged. Then after a few hours, it finally detects the charge and start booting up.\n4. I used the \"Restart\" menu, it shuts down but won't restart and I have to plug it, and wait for some times before it starts again?.\n4. I tried booting it up in Safe mode and got the screen in the attached pictures.\n\nHas anyone some of my problems too?",
