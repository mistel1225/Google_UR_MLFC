    "title": "Cannot get in touch with Google Store/Support for my Pixel 2",
    "content": "The USB-C port of my Pixel 2 is very loose - the charger (or headphones via USB-C adapter) barely connect. I have tried 2 official Google Pixel charges, third-party chargers, and Lenovo laptop chargers, but only 1 charger does work, but only have 10 minutes of fiddling and it's very sensitive: touching it once and the connection is lost. Impact:\nNo charging in the car, or connecting the car (as that is vertical)\nExtremely difficult to charge and only with 1 specific charger\nOnly able to use bluetooth headphones\n\nI have tried multiple chargers and cleaning the port (e.g., used the air spray in a can to try to clean it). Dirt seems not to be the issue - I believe it's a hardware problem thus within warranty.\n\nThe problem lies in contacting Google Support: I purchased the Pixel 2 whilst I was still living in the UK, directly via the UK Google Store. I am living in the Netherlands now where the Pixel 2 is not sold in the Google Store. I don't know how to contact Google, I tried:\nVia my Pixel 2, via Settings > Support. There is only a call back option. I have typed a message 3 times now, but not called back (first try was several weeks ago)\nI looked online to any contact possibilities but found none\nI found a phone number of Google Support in the Netherlands (https://support.google.com/store/answer/6178715#contact=1), but the number is invalid and not working\n\nMy question is: How do I contact Google Support to help me with my Pixel 2 issue?\n\nThank you,\nRemco",
