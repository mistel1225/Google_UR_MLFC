    "content": "my pixel 3xl phone suddenly switched to asking for my pin to unlock, not fingerprint or pattern....they were not options.  \n\n...long story short i had to reset it and when i try to restore from backup in google drive, at the point where I choose the specific \"backup to restore\" in google drive, it should ask me to \"choose what to restore\"  It does not.\n\nit's asking for lock screen pin...which i have tried but must not have anymore....there are no other options to use fingerprint or pattern (which is what i had used for 3-4 years previously) only \"cancel\"\n\nthe pin number does not work.  I have 4 tries before it erases the backup that i have in google drive\n\nTried changing google account pin and using it, did not work.\n\n2 factor is turned off in google account.\n\nIs this possible...........During this initial setup...just to get into the phone without the restored data so that i can get it working, Can I skip the restore on the initial setup that would not add all of my apps, call history, data back to the phone?\n\nThen once the phone is functioning and done with setup, can i restore the backup from my google drive, which will add all of my apps, call history, sms messages, etc?\n\n\nthanks",
