    "content": "When I plug my phone in it starting buzzing every second. I unplugged it and turned the connector the other way and it stopped and just charged regularly.\nMy wife has the same phone so I tried her phone on the charger but it worked correctly both ways.\nI then took my phone to my wife's charger and I get the same thing, buzz buzz buzz one way and when I turn it it charges correctly.\n\nThis is weird.\n\nAny help of understanding would be appreciated.",
