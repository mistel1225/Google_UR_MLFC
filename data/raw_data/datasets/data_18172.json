    "content": "My Pixel 4 keeps toggling ON the \"Connect to open networks\" wifi setting.\n\nI want this off and I want it to remain off. I've turned it off at least 5 times only later to get notified that my phone has connected to some wifi I don't want to be connected to.\n\nHow do turn this off and not have it turn itself back on?",
