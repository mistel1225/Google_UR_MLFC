    "content": "hi. Have a Pixel 3a. Just performed a System update and restarted automatically as per usual. Upon restart, enter the SIM PIN - all good. Asks for screen unlock PIN, i enter the correct pin (6 digits) and it says it's wrong. What now? Some urgent help would be much appreciated, as I am unable to use the Phone at the moment.\nThank you.",
