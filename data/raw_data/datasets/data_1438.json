    "content": "I have been using the phone since 5 months and the battery life was amazing but since the may update, I am seeing a huge idle drain (13% overnight) and there are no Plateaus in the battery graph. I have tried going to safe mode and checking. No improvement. Even factory reset didn't help. Main culprits are \"Android System\" and \"Android OS\". They take away a huge chunk of battery. Gsam Battery stats says that the kernel is making the phone stay awake which is causing battery drain. Attached screenshot also shows that there is 11% battery drain just with 21 minutes SOT and  about 1.5 hrs idle time. Hope the June update fixes this drain. I also found a few people on reddit forums having the same issue since May update.",
