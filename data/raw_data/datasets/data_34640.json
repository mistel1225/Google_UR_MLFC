    "content": "I want to copy text from a hyperlink quickly, for example I got an email with a link which reads Tracking Number: 12345678, there is a hyper link embedded in 12345678, I want to copy the number by pressing and holding the selected text, the only options i get are (open link, sharelink, copy link to clipboard), there is no option to copy the actual text.\nIt is very frustrating that I have manually (carefully) selecting the text without triggering the link to open the url.",
