    "content": "Hello! I have got a new pixel 3a and would like to know how I should charge it for the first time. I understand that I need to fully charge it before using it for the first time. However, one thing I am not sure is that whether I should drain out all the battery before fully charging it or simply charge it to full regardless how much battery life it has when it was delivered to me? \n\nThank you very much for your help!",
