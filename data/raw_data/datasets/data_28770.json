    "content": "Hello, I'm suspecting that my phone was stolen. Unfortunately, I can't trace it with Find My Phone as it has been turned off (I didn't turn it off last I used nor could it have died as there is battery). I would like to know if it's possible for a thief to factory reset my phone? I heard there is a need to key in a previously signed in google account but does that still happen?",
