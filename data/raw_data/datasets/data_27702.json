    "content": "After recently updating to Android 10 I noticed when swiping at the home button to switch between recent apps it no longer snaps between them with haptic feedback. Now it just moves each preview window as much as your finger. Ive tried looking up where, if possible, to change this setting back to how it was before I updated but have had zero luck. Is it possible to change this setting?",
