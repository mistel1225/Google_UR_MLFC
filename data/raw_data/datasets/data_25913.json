    "content": "I found some articles that suggested the the ringtone had to be both in the Pixel 3a/Ringtones folder and the Pixel 3a/Android/media/com.google.android/Ringtones folders.  My phone does not have a com.google.android folder, instead it has a com.google.android.soundpicker folder.  \nWorking off the theory that the underlying issue is the Sounds app is not playing nicely with the native Android setup, I decided to try manually adding a Ringtones folder in the Pixel 3a/Android/media directory, and placing the file both there and in the \"official\" Ringtones folder, then restart the phone, and that got it to work.\n\nI suspect there was a release where someone updated the app but missed updating a folder path in an associated file.  Since I had tried a bunch of other stuff before adding the new folder, I was going to do some regression testing to confirm exactly where all the files needed to be, but got sidetracked.\n\nHope this is helpful.
