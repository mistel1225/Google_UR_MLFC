I have tried several troubleshooting steps from community.\n\nWhen I uninstall and resintall the phone app, I do see the icon for a split second before it disappears. There is no option in the phone app settings to enable or disable visual voicemail. How to I get visual voicemail to work on the pixel 4a?",
