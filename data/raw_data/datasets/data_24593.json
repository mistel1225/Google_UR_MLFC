    "title": "Proximity sensor when answering calls using BT headset",
    "content": "If I answer a call with the phone in my pocket using my BT headset the screen will often awaken (unknowingly) in my pocket and screen presses become possible occasionally resulting in muting the call or ending it (from inside my pocket). Should the proximity sensor not disable this as the phone is covered ? The sensor works fine using the earpiece. I don't think its a hardware issue, more of a software logic problem.",
