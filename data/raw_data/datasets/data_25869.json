    "content": "Pixel 4 and 4 XL does not have the capability of enabling HDR+ and HDR+ Enhanced as seen on previous Pixels.   While I do enjoy \"Live HDR\" with manual HDR controls, Google should still have an \"automatic\" HDR option still such as HDR+.  I don't want to have to worry I used the correct HDR settings each time I take a photo.  HDR+ was perfect.  Please bring it back!",
