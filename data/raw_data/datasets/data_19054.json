    "title": "Face unlock not working (error: Settings Future keeps stopping )",
    "content": "10 days after initial set up,  i got a Can not verify face, try again. message on the lockscreen and the device would only unlock using a secondary unlock method (pattern).  I went into the settings and chose the delete face data option. After that i tried to set up face unlock again. During the set up (before the face capture step) i got a pop up notification (app crash notification) saying Settings Future keeps stopping.  I factory reset the phone and boot up in the phone in safe mode, but the issue persists. Face unlock is unusable on this device.\nI contacted the seller and they cant offer a replacement unit, as its not in stock.\nCan someone help? Is this a software issue?",
