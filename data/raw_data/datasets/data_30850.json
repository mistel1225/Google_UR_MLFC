    "content": "I use Linux on my computer at home and would like to plug it in so I can transfer files or charge at full PD. It takes around five minutes for the phone and computer both to recognize a connection. No power no data until this takes place. Is there some kind of handshaking the USB-C port is doing that I could hurry up?",
