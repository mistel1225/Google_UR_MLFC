    "content": "No simcard / network is detected on my Google 4a. The phone is less than 6 months old and I have tried the following:\n\nResetting the phone. \nRemoving the simcard. \nThe simcard works in another phone.\n\nThis appears to be a very very common issue across the boards. I'm hoping given the frequency of the issue that there is fix or this is covered under warranty",
