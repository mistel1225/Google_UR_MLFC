    "title": "Pixel 3A XL how to take panorama photos and not get fish eye results",
    "content": "I select Panorama get 2 blinking arrows on each side of screen, push button and take photo L->R. The photo has an icon (curved arrow) in the middle. When I click on the icon the photo opens into a distorted fish eye, hour glass or bow tie shaped photo. Internet searching says there should be circles that I put in the center of the view and when it turns blue, move to the next, etc. I don't have this in panorama mode. I have it in the Photo Sphere mode. The Photo Sphere mode gives me a panorama photo. The Panorama mode just gives me odd shaped photos that are blurred around the edges.",
