    "title": "Pixel 2's Keep Displaying Pull-Down Notifications/Options Randomly and Frequently",
    "content": "All the sudden, both of our phone keep displaying the pull-down notifications screen and jumping to all these random screens, especially while texting (and while posting this). Both our phones started this a couple days ago. Was there an update/bug??? I have made more accidental calls and video calls in the last 2 days than in the last 2 years due to this. This is incredibly frustrating.",
