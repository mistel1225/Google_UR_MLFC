    "content": "Today, I updated my Pixel 4XL to Android 11, after receiving a notification.\nAfter the update, my mobile has not network service.\nI am able to connect to wifi.\n\nI have tried the below steps\n1. removing and reinserting the sim\n2. switching on and off from aeroplane mode\n3. reset the Network Settings (Bluetooth, mobile and wifi)\n4. Factory reset: erase all the data.\n5. I switched the sim and my wife sim also did not work, and my sim worked perfectly in her phone. (So, no issues with the sim)\nNeither of these options worked for me.\n\nHow can I fix it?\nWill I have to wait for a patch again?\nMy phone is totally useless right now.",
