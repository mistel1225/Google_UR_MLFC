    "content": "I just got my Pixel 4 XL. \nI noticed it doesn't have a headphone jack \nI bought a USBC to Aux(3.5m?) Adapter for my Aux cord and it doesn't work! I tried connecting my phone to play music through the USB port either! My boyfriend has no issue using his iPhone X through the USB to play music and the aux cord still works.\nWhen plugged in, no sound comes out the speakers. It acts like it's connected but it doesn't play. Help!\nI have a 2011 Chevy Cruze will the original set up if that matters.\nI can't play music via Bluetooth",
