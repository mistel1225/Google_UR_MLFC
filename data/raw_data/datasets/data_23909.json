    "title": "Pixel 4 Rear Camera Not Working (all black)",
    "content": "I installed the security update, and now the camera doesn't work. It's only the rear camera - selfies work fine. It's completely black. Occasionally I can get it to work if I go to night sight and zoom in to 2x - then switch back to the regular mode and make sure I don't zoom back out (keep it 2x or higher). It doesn't work in any 3rd party apps (Instagram, etc.). Clearly it's a software issue and not hardware. I've tried booting in safe mode and it still happens. I've yet to factory reset since it'll happen again if/when I update it again. Also, I've only had the phone for 2 weeks - it's literally brand new.",
