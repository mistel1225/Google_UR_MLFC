    "content": "So, I first noticed this while watching Twitch. I had somehow gone 200MB over my data cap, without data being turned on at all. So I opened my settings, and sure enough Twitch was using background data. I switch off background data. Seems to fix the issue for a moment (this happened last night). Tonight, I am watching Twitch again and now I'm 300MB over my data, even with everything being turned off. I disconnected from wifi accidentally during this time, so my phone must have just switched to data anyways. I don't want to keep being charged for extra data that I am trying to not use, but gets used anyways. Any suggestions?",
