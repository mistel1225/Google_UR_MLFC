    "content": "The Google pixel 3 XL sim card slot couldn't get access through its network. The sim card is already activated and ready for it's network. I have gone through the entire troubleshooting steps and it's not the sim card or the carriers fault. They have mentioned it has nothing to do with my sim card or the carrier itself. It has to do with the sim card slot on the Google pixel 3 XL. I have done safe mode and factory reset and they wouldn't work. After the Google repair center sent the device back to me that's when it started that problem but it out of warranty by the time. If that's the Google repair center problem they should fix this immediately.",
