    "content": "This has been an issue since before ice cream sandwich...... When making or receiving a call from any Bluetooth headset I've ever owned including the pixel buds I got today, the screen of my phone wakes, while not unlocked it's still on the call screen and stays active during the call unless turned off using the power button. This makes not one lick of sense to me at all. How can you have hands free calling if you still have to take out your phone from your pocket to prevent touching the screen and doing this during your call, even if the phone stays locked it's pressing things related to my call. How is this not as big an issue for others? Has nothing to do with proximity sensors and I realize my phone isn't unlocked, the problem is I don't want to take my phone out to make a HANDS FREE CALL just to make sure my call goes uninterrupted my unintentional screen clicking. Saw one thread on this and it was locked after a device expert claimed it wouldn't unlock, completely ignoring the asker's real issue which is the same as mine. How do you keep the screen OFF during a Bluetooth call while your phone is in your pocket and susceptible to touchscreen interference by your leg or pants. This issue is a decade old at least",
