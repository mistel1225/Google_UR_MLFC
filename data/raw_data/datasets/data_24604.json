    "content": "Hello everybody, I am experiencing a weird issue. I have connected a pair of Sennheiser MOMENTUM Free (M2 IE Free) over bluetooth. Everything works fine except for Youtube Music. When I am listening to a playlist, the first song always plays fine. When I go to the next song I can't hear the music anymore despite the headphones being still connected. If I skip more songs then I can encounter some songs that can be listened. This problem only occurs with youtube music, not with spotify for example and ONLY with the bluetooth headphones. I already tried to re-pair the headphones and to delete the cache of the bluetooth system app. Do you have any ideas? Thanks in advance!!",
