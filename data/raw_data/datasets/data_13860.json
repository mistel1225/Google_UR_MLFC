    "content": "Hi All\nRecently got a pixel 5 and the pixel stand setup does not seem to work correctly with it. I have \"Screen off when dark\" turned on. When I put my phone on the stand the greyscale lock screen content will appear (clock and a few notification icons like do not disturb) and they usually fade away to a completely black screen as they should. At some point thought the screen turns back on MUCH brighter than the dimmed notification screen. I think that it is max brightness. Despite it only being the clock it does brighten my room a lot and I can see it through eye lids.\n\nThis is obviously a bug and is very annoying. Anyone else have it? Suggestions for a fix?",
