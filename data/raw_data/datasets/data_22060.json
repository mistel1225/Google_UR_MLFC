    "content": "My 3a just fell in the bath for all of 1 second. Phone seems to be working as normal, except I can't hear the other person during a phone call, unless I turn speaker on. Also no audio is playing when i use YouTube, Spotify or similar.\n\nWhen connected to a Bluetooth device audio works for both phone calls and media.\n\nHave tried loading the phone in safe mode with no luck.\n\nAny help would be much appreciated!",
