    "content": "Hey folks, so my Pixel 2 XL refuses to see my backup while setting the device up. \n\nI was on latest Android preview. I had a backup from 30th of may, which i can confirm on my Google drive. \n\nMy phone got into some weird bootloop overnight, and i had to reset it completely and flash latest OTA update via ADB. When i set up my phone, i was baffled to see it say \"No backup found\" . I know your backup version needs to match the current version your phone is in, or phone be in a later version. And i know that both versions match, since there were no Beta updates since 30th of May or in last week whatsoever. I tried downgrading back into Pie and re-upgraded completely wiping it again. No luck,  straight up says no backup found. I REALLY need that backup. I had authenticator codes saved in, and a lot of other settings. \n\nHoping you folks could help.",
