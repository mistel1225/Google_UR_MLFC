    "title": "\"Security patch and bug fixes\" update post December 2020 for Pixel 2",
    "content": "I recently came to know that the Pixel 2 won't receive monthly security patches post December 2020. Since Android 11 was only recently released and the security patches also bring bug fixes which the Android 11 in its nascent stage will receive a lot, how will bugs be fixed for Pixel 2 users (fixes for which will be released for other Pixel devices post December '20 also)? Ideally, Google should continue to release at least bug fixes (if not security patches) for Pixel 2 users (for Android 11) so that they can use the phone in its complete stability and with a seamless experience. Please advise.",
