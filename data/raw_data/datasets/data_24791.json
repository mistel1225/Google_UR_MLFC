    "content": "From normal operation, my Pixel 3 restarted itself and now is stuck in a bootloop.  Holding Power + Vol Down brings me to the boot menu, but I am unable to make any selection (Vol Down / Up_ to enter recovery mode or reset the device before the phone goes back into the bootloop.  Any ideas would be greatly appreciated.",
