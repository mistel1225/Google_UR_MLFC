    "title": "Pixel 5 - Poor quality portrait shots",
    "content": "I've noticed that the Pixel 5 takes comparatively worse portrait shots of non human subjects than my 4XL. \n\nI know that it is unable to use the wide angle lens to give accurate depth information, and it is really affecting the quality of portrait shots. \n\nSee the pictures below of my dog... One from my new Pixel 5 and one from my old 4XL. I'd really like not to have to send back my new phone in favour of last year's phone ðŸ˜¬. Somebody tell me this can bet fixed with an update? I know I can edit the blur manually, but overall this new phone is really struggling, and the camera is the main reason I stick with the Pixel line!",
