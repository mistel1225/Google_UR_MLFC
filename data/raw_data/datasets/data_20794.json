    "title": "Pixel 2 battery drain after latest update March 2020",
    "content": "I'm having some major issues with my Pixel 2's battery. For the past week, the battery has been abnormally draining really fast and I'm not sure what it could be. I've deleted apps, let the battery drain completely and recharged it, turned off lock display and turned down brightness, rebooted the phone multiple times, made my wallpaper all black, pretty much everything I can think of I've down, and still having trouble with the battery. I've only had the phone since December 2018, so I haven't had it for that long, but I'm not sure what would be causing the issue. It's turned off and rebooted on its own a few times, and tends to also run hot as well. I haven't had the phone for that long, so I don't think I need to replace the battery, but it might be looking that way. Anyone having the same issues and might have a solution? And yes I've also placed it in safe mode and having the same problems.",
