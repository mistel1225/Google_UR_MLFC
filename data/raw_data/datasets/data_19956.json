    "content": "My Pixal 3a XL just died. It has been working fine until this week. Yesterday it shut down on its own and I had to do a hard reset to turn in back on. After a few minutes the phone shut down again but now it's not responding. I have tried everything I found in this forum but the phone won't respond. Hard reset with or without the charger plugged has no effect. No lights or anything. What can I do.",
