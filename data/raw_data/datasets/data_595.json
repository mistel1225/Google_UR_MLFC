    "content": "I am seeing a persistent Android System notification: \n\n\"Charging connected device via USB\" when it is not plugged into anything. \n\n\"USB controlled by\" is set to 'connected device' even when the phone is not plugged into anything, and I cannot change this. \n\nThe notification disappears as I charge the phone (which is also intermittent), but then reappears as soon as it's unplugged. \n\nI have tried charging the device from a different cable and my computer, but the problem continues.",
