    "content": "4 emails but only 1 keeps new email notifs going even after inbox is opened. I hate the blinking. Disabled ALL notifs and still blinking anyway. Would have to open every email in inbox before it stops blinking. None of the other inboxes do this - what do I need to fix? Have tried reinstalling, logging in again, etc.",
