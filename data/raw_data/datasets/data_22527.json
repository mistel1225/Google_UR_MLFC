    "content": "I'm wondering if this is an Android issue or a cell carrier issue. My phone is and was using the \"Use network-provided time zone\" option and when I woke up this morning my phone had adjusted for Daylight Savings Time; however I'm in Arizona and we don't participate.\n\nWhen I went to look and see how to fix it, the screen did say \"Mountain Standard Time +06:00\" which is the correct time zone without daylight savings (although it would say +07:00)I Restarting my phone seems to have fixed it for now, but I'm still interested to see who might be the cause of this.",
