    "content": "Hi there,\n\nI cannot find answer in Google Search (only very old answers saying - not)\n\nI know third party apps support it but I want to use GCam.\n\nI know newer Pixel 4 had same problem with 4K 60FPS but in GCam 8.1 Google resolved that - the reason I ask now.\n\nI have latest GCam 8.1, latest March 2021 updates.\n\nIn GCam Settings I got 1080p 30FPS and....... \"Auto\" which does NOT  say anything is it 15FPS?\n\nI can understand Pixel 3 will not support 4K 60FPS  BUT - is 1080p 60FPS is it such a big big problem?",
