    "title": "2020 Toyota Camry Hybrid, Pixel 4a connects using bluetooth but can't get directions",
    "content": "In my Camry Hybrid, Pixel 4a connects and works as long as I set the radio source to bluetooth.  But then I can't listen to the radio...only the directions.  But if I set it to radio, I can't hear directions from Google Maps.  Neither from the phone, nor the car radio.  I thought it was the Toyota's fault, but my wife's Motorola G7 works like I'd expect--the directions just interrupt the radio on the car speakers.  In every car we've owned with Bluetooth, this is how our phones worked. Though I had a Motorola G6 before I bought the Pixel in August.",
