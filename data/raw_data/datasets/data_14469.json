    "title": "Android 11 Bubbles - Learned behaviour & notification clearing",
    "content": "I understand the notification UI changes of Android 11 are massive and may have some learning curve however, I have some gripes which I feel could greatly improve its functionality.\n\nBubbles:\nThe default for the native notification bubble to apear at the same spot on the left of the screen is rather frustrating and I find myself wanting to disable the feature altogether rather than move it to my desired spot every time. I know the previous messenger chat heads which the bubbles are styled after had an element of machine learning in which the app learnt where you moved the bubble to and made that the new default.\n\nNotification panel:\nRelated to the updated notification UI you are now required to swipe each individual message to dismiss, or click \"clear all\" as opposed to the previous option where you could swipe away all notifications grouped within a specific app. For example Whatsapp where I have several chats which I do not regularly check, every time the app refreshes I have to swipe each chat seperately or click clear all which then clears other app notifications as well. Would be nice if the option to swipe an entire app's notification away again.\n\nJust my 2c",
