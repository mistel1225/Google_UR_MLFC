    "content": "I'm trying to figure out how to see what city I am receiving a call from. I.e. area code 202 is Washington DC. Why doesn't the phone tell me what city the area code is for? This just seems like the absolute most basic information to include with a phone call, so surely I'm just missing this setting. The phone screen has been terrible at detecting spam, so I need to do it myself apparently, and the simplest way to do that is to know what city I am being called from.",
