    "content": "Hello community,\n\nI have a google pixel 1st generation. All of a sudden I woke up to a dead phone. I thought the charge was out and tried to charge with the official charger. However, there was no charging icon nor am I able to start the phone either. I have tried all the usual methods of hard reset (power button for 30 seconds or power and volume down for 30+ seconds both while charging and without charging) to no avail. \n\nI have already read all the posts on this topic and have tried the methods - they don't seem to work.\n\nWhen I tried recovering at least the data from the phone through a USB-C with a laptop, all I hear is the initial sound of USB recognizing in my computer. However, I don't see the phone being recognized in Device Manager or Storage. Hence, I am not able to see any of the data on my phone and not able to recover the data.\n\nAt least I want to recover the data on the phone. Is there any way, please as I have a lot of precious photos over a month stored on it which are not backed up to google photos. Also I am not able to contact Google Service Centre, I am currently in Netherlands but bought the phone in India.\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated.\n\nRegards\nAnand",
