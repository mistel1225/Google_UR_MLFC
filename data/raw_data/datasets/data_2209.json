    "content": "I haved checked the setting for sound. I have checked the settings in messages. I have checked every setting I can think of but I still can't get the phone to provide me any notification for incoming messages or phone calls. The phone will ring for a phone call but not vibrate. I typically get no notification at all for text messages and phone calls. I am very frustrated and annoyed with this phone. Please help!  Thank you!!",
