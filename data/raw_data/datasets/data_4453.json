    "content": "Pixel 5\nAndroid version: 11\nBuild: RQ1C.210205.006\nBought phone today. Processed all updates.\n\nSIM Manager app is crashing repeatedly.  Since I use and eSim, this can't be a good thing.\nThe app crash popup will sometimes flash on the screen but most times stay on the screen until I force close the app.  The app crash popup appears again no more than 2 mins after a force close. \n\nAfter down grading the app to factory, I no longer get the crash popup message.  I can send and receive calls.",
