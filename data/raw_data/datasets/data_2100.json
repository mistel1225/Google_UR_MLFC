    "content": "Just opened up a new pixel 4a and installed all updates. I'm getting some odd behaviour with the mics. When I record a video I get no sound or very scratchy/poppy audio. Also have irregular behaviour with the recorder and video calls. Regular phone calls are fine. After many restarts, and a factory reset, the recorder looks like it's working better but not perfect as well as WhatsApp video calls.
