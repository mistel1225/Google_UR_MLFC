    "content": "My Pixel 3 XL during a call, if you remove the phone from your ear, in SOME SITUATIONS it does not display anything. Just a black screen. Only after the caller completes the call does the screen light appear. The latest version of Android 11 is installed. The proximity sensor works perfectly, AOD shows when it is light, and does not show when to close the sensor with your hand. Also, during a conversation, if you call and put it to your ear, and immediately remove it, the screen will work. However, in some conversations, the screen may not turn on until the other person finishes the conversation. Reboot done! Full reset is done. There IS no case or screen protection. Why is there such a problem?",
