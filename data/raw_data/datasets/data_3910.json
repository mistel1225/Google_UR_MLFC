    "content": "Pixel 3 phone unresponsive to all inputs overnight. Woke up to a completely dead phone.\n1. tried multiple chargers that were confirmed to work with other devices. no response and no screen that shows \"charging\". Also tried plugging into a computer\n2. generic wireless charging light indicates \"connected with no error\" but screen does not show any charging\n3. long hold of power or power and volume down does not do anything. No vibrations or even boot logo\n4. google uploaded photos last night, meaning the phone was charging at least when i plugged it in to go to bed.",
