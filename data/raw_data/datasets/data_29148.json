    "content": "So I have configured a SIP server and I'm not able to call back the numbers because Android automatically adds the SIP server at the end of the number like on the screenshot:\n\nnumber@SIPserver\n\nCan anybody advise how can I hide the @ part and make the numbers callable?\n\nThanks!",
