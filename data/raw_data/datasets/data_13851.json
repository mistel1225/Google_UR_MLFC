    "content": "It would be a remarkable feature improvement to have a form of auto-responder/vacation notification built in to the Google Assistant call screen feature. It could be as simple as: \"Hello, the person you're trying to reach is currently unavailable. Please state the purpose for your call and we will try to reach them.\" Then similar to the spam filtering, the phone indicates it's screening the call and only rings after the call is \"screened\".",
