    "content": "I purchased the Google Pixel 3 XL and applied for the trade-in kit that Google provides. When my phone shipped and I got it, I did not receive a trade-in kit or any information regarding where to send it. The only information I have is the email Google had sent giving me steps on sending my old trade-in phone to them, but it states ship your device after you have received your trade-in kit which I never got. Any ideas on what to do?",
