    "content": "When I had the YouTube app open in Android 9, I would be able to press the home button and it would go picture in picture. Now, Android 10 takes me back to the home screen. \n\nIn settings, I've ensured that picture in picture is allowed on the YouTube app. \n\nI've tried various ways with the video; portrait and landscape, the video minimized to continue scrolling; every way, the home button now takes me to the home page without putting the picture in picture.",
