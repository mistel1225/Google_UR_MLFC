    "content": "I ran the newest update yesterday. My battery life is now decreased. It is losing battery at an alarming rate. To make matters worse, fast charging now takes five times longer. Applications are running like garbage, and my phone actually has felt very hot. What is going on? How and when is Google going to rectify this disaster? This update has essentially turned my pixel 3 XL to garbage. Not acceptable!",
