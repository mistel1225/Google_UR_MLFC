    "content": "I have ordered a Pixel 4XL and initiated a trade-in for my Pixel 3XL. I note on the FAQ for trade-ins that there is a requirement for them to receive the trade-in within 30 days of the initiation of the trade-in ( i.e., Nov 15, a Friday). The new Pixel is currently showing delivery Nov 07-08. Assuming that schedule is accurate, that gives me one week to set up the new phone, mail the 3XL via USPS, and for them to actually receive it. I do not think it is possible.\n\nMy question for someone who has done this, is are they going to rigidly enforce the 30-day trade-in requirement for pre-orders where the estimated delivery of three weeks after order? If there is any risk, I will cancel the trade-in and list the 3XL on Swappa. It's a hassle but I will do it if necessary.",
