    "content": "Before I buy a Pixel 3 I'm trying to determine if the phone will work with Consumer Cellular. I think they have access to use two networks, AT&T and T-Mobile. The consumer cellular rep was pretty sure it would work... but I don't want to buy a new phone and sell my old phone just to find out that he was pretty sure... but he was wrong! \n\nAlso, I have never been able to determine if a Pixel 3 will work with Boost Mobile; I think their network is Sprint?  I talked to somebody at Google and they said they would get back via an email and that was three days ago. That kind of support is not very impressive. Anyway, thanks for any help you can provide.",
