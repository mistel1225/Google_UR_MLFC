    "content": "I am quite the multi tasker. I am normally on a conference call and following up with texts or messages while on that call also using google to check information on line for the call that I am on. Since the update I can no longer message while I am on a call. I also can't do any kind of web search. The keyboard just will not appear. I have to wait till I end the call and then re -boot the phone before the keyboard function will come back again. Anyone else having this issue? I thought the point of this update was to make messaging easier and better so far not so much .",
