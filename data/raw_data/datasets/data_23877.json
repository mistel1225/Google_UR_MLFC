    "content": "The Pixel 1 Has an AMOLED display just like all other pixel phones, in android 9.0 the google pixel had an ambient display (a mostly black screen with only certain pixels turned on after lifting up the phone). The ambient display showed time, notifications, etc. When i updated to android 10 its gone! the pixel 2 and 3 have it but not the 1, even though the screen on all 3 are AMOLED! This is a joke! how do i get it back?",
