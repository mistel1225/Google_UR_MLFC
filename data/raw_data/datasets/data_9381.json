    "content": "Trying to get carrier Video calls working on the Pixel 4A 5G.   No matter what I do, it doesn't seem to be enabled.  I tried deleting Duo, and that doesn't work.\n\nIt works perfectly fine on all other Pixel phones in the family (2XL, 3AXL), but not on this newest phone.  The video icon does not show up on the dialer screen, even if the other person on the other end of the call has the icon and can try to switch over to carrier video.\n\nHave literally zero idea what to do here",
