    "content": "For our Google's MDM solution I need to add the company owned devices in advance with serial number. I thought it was the IMEI number and it was confirmed on several places. After enrolling the device it has been recognised as a user owned device as the MDM didn't connect the phone to the inventory based on the IMEI number. After checking the device's info page in the G Suite admin it turned out that it actually has a serial number different from the IMEI. Google Cloud support couldn't assist as they have considered the issue as a topic for Pixel support. As their line is closed at the moment I thought I will drop a question here maybe someone has a solution.\n\nI would need to figure out the serial number of Pixel 3 phones without actually activating them one by one on our MDM system. Any idea how to solve it?",
