Around 8-12%\nThis should be around 1%\nWhy this is important? First of all, this is a bug in the system, so it should be fixed. Second is that I need to charge the phone in every two days instead of three.\nI come from Samsung Galaxy S7 and after 40 months of use the battery health was 82% (according to AccuBattery) and with the same setup it drained only 1-2%.\n\nAlso I talked to other Pixel 4a users and around 1% is the norm, so maybe this is hardware related?\nI don't have any bloatware on the phone and the battery advisor states that everything is OK. When I observe the battery stats by apps/hardware, I notice nothing out of ordinary which is strange.\n\nScreenshots included: I put it down last night ~8 PM at 85% and in the morning (~6 AM) it was down to 73%.\n\nWhat will I do?\n1. I'll try it this night without Airplane mode\n2. if 1 is OK, then with Airplane mode BUT in safe mode.\nOr maybe do a factory reset before all of that, but it was already done 4 days ago, so...",
