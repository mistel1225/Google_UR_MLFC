    "content": "I've been using the Pixel 3 for a year now and been loving all the customization. But I've noticed over the last few months with Android 11, DND behaves differently. I want it to work that notifications bypassing DND still vibrate, they're set to vibrate, they show up, but don't vibrate. Don't have battery saver or anything on either, so it's a DND thing. Are there any ways to enable their vibrations?",
