    "content": "Really struggling with Android 10 reliability.  Up until the v10 update, when the phone screen was black and I got a phone call, the screen lit up so I knew it was ringing.  This is especially critical when using the phone in silent mode when in either public places, meetings, etc.  Worked fine for years.\n\nNow, when the phone screen goes black after the timeout period, and I get a phone call, the screen stays black.  I literally have ZERO idea I'm getting a call, and I'm missing calls constantly\n\nDo Not Disturb is OFF.   Notifications are set to show up on lockscreen (which I presume means blacked out as well).\n\nI've just done a factory reset and restore to get around this problem, but it didn't fix it.  I've tried literally everything I could find both here and other internet forums.\n\nNothing works.  The \"Notifications\" set up is incredibly convoluted, serpentine, and confusing.  Is it App based?  OS based?  which takes precedence, who controls what?",
