    "content": "About 2 months ago my google pixel 2 (which I’d had for a little over a year) stopped working. My boyfriend and I woke up one morning and my phone screen wouldn’t turn on. When we shook the phone we heard rattling so we immediately knew it was a hardware problem so we managed to get the screen on long enough to reach google pixel support. They said my phone was still under warranty and they would send me a replacement phone if I sent my phone  in. It’s been a good month and a half and I haven’t gotten anything, the first time my phone was delivered to the wrong address and the second time it wasn’t delivered at all before being returned to sender. I’ve sent multiple emails and responded to the survey they sent me very negatively and I haven’t gotten any response. I don’t know what to do, I’m extremely frustrated and I just want my phone. At this point I don’t even want a refurbished phone, I’ve received such bad service I’m considering just switching to iPhone because at least they’re responsive and if worst comes to worse I can fix it myself. Any help would be appreciated bc I really liked my pixel phone... until this",
