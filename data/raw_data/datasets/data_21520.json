    "content": "I updated to April 2020 pixel 3 xl ota image and finger sensor stopped working. I have now factory reset my phone 3 times and it still does not show in the setting options.\nI am wondering if this has happened to anyone else and if there is a fix out there for it.\nThe picture is of my pixel 3 XL and as you can see by the security it does not show fingerprint.\nThe other is a screenshot of my pixel XL with the option shown in security.\nI should mention I do not have a computer or I would try and install a previous update, so please keep that in mind.",
