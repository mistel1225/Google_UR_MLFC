    "content": "I'm using pixel 2 xl. From some few days, when I'm talking through cellular calls, the person from other side can't hear me clearly. Even I'm facing the same issue in safe mode. Another thing, I'm getting cellular data speed very slow. I think, there is a problem in sending & receiving cellular data. When I'm using wifi, messenger calls are clear. So, there is no device problem. I hope you will inform me what to do",
