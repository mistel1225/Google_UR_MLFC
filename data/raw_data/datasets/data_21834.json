    "content": "I have two cities in two time zones showing in my clock, besides where I reside. I do not need one of them, but cannot seem to remove it.  I've tried holding it to see if I get some option, but do not.  Thanks in advance.  [I am in EST; the other two are China and Alaska.  I want to remove only the one for Alaska.]",
