    "content": "Google Pixel 4 XL 64 GB Bluetooth audio is very low on some devices and also be the polar opposite on other bluetooth audio devices. The ones i want to be loud and use often, I cant reach a high enough volume to my liking. Ive tried everything i know: disable absolute volume is dev settings, played around with the equalizer, etc. Is there something I am missing or havemt found to help increase volume via bluetooth? Ive even played around with dev settings bluetooth on terms of frequency, channel, quality, and anything else the dev settings have regarding bluetooth audio output. Any suggestions?",
