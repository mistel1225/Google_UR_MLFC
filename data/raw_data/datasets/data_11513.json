    "title": "After Mexico cruise 2019 cell added 044 prefix 2 random contacts. Deleted & added but still hapening",
    "content": "MOST infuriating issue!!!!!  Texts don't go through because even if # is edited in contacts 044 shows up in messenger than at times even reverts contacts back to 044 prefix.  I've deleted contacts & re-added them, deleted streams of texts & as soon as I start a new text conversation it happens again.  Also, the contacts initial doesn't appear in the text bubble & it creates duplicate conversations that the intended recipient DOESN'T receive ðŸ¤¬  I've deleted contacts & re-added, called & spent HOURS on with tech support & even purchased an entirely new & different phone thinking it was a glitch, NOTHING works ðŸ¤¯ I've been an android user my entire adult life but I'm beyond ready to switch to an iPhone!! GRRRR!!!",
