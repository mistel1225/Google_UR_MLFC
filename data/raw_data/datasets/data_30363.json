    "content": "My Pixel 3a keeps turning off unexpectedly. Each time it does that I have to hard reset it.\n\nSafe mode didn't solve the issue, so it doesn't seem to be app related. \n\nThe only thing left is to factory reset it, but I'm not sure how that would show why is that happening. \n\nA lot of people on Reddit seem to have the same problem, so it might be a hardware problem. \n\nSo, any update on the matter would be nice. Thanks.",
