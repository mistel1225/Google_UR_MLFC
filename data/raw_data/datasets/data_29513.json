    "content": "I paid extra amount for expedited delivery for Pixel 3 and the delivery date was supposed to be 17-Jul-2019 or 18-Jul-2019 and when I track my package it shows ' still not shipped'. I want to cancel my order because I am not available to receive the package after 20-Jul-2019. This is the reason I paid extra amount for fast delivery. I have not expected this poor service from Google!! I requested for a call back from the customer care and no response yet. Please provide your response at the earliest. Thanks.",
