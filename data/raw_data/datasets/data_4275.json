    "content": "My brand new Pixel 5 does something really odd during phone calls.\n\nWhen the other person speaks, the whole phone vibrates.\n\nIt's like the speaker is too powerful for the phone. I can feel the phone buzzing and moving against my face.\n\nNB this happens during normal calls, not when they're on speaker.\n\nAnyone else experienced this, or have any suggestions?",
