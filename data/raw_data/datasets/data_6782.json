    "title": "Sim card is frequently not detected and I want to have my phone repaired. I am in Japan.",
    "content": "Sim card is frequently not detected and shows 'no service'. The sim card works perfectly fine in other phones. Ive had the phone since Oct 2020 and it has been like this for a few weeks already. If I open the sim tray and put it back it sometimes works for awhile but then randomly can't detect it. Sometimes when I reboot it also detects it for awhile but shortly stops detecting it. I feel it is a hardwar issue with the sim tray. \nI live in Tokyo and we have no Google store front here and trying to find someone to contact keeps looping my around different websites to no help and the japanese repair website just links to the main page trying to sell my other products. I bought it online from the Google store. \nPlease advise ",
