    "content": "It's been two weeks that I got the notification to update my phone to Android 11 though it doesn't work. Everytime I go to system update, it loops on the installing message (sorry, my device isn't in English display). I cleared the Play Store cache as suggested in another thread but it doesn't work. Is there any way to force the OS to download the update again and install it?",
