    "content": "Yeah so my Google pixel 3a was working fine til earlier when I try to listen to spotify or music in general it randomly stops for a second or backtracks for a couple of seconds, Now my youtube when watching it stops completely for a couple of seconds and won't let you even go to the home screen like it froze. So I was snooping around and try to restart it, soft reset, deleting apps and so on and I still get the same thing. And it just randomly freeze when using google chrome in general so i have to go back to home screen and wait for a few seconds then come back. What's wrong with this phone?",
