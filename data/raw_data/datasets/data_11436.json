    "content": "My phone had died and so I went to charge it. I definitely don't know what I did. For three days now it has been frozen at 9% and won't change. The battery percentage does not give my an accurate reading of my battery anymore. It definitely has more life then 9%. I have tried restarting, shutting down multiple times and have even preformed a factory reset on my phone which only made things a little worse. I've deleted most of my apps. I don't know how to fix this. Anyone else have this problem? Can it be fixed or should I just get a different phone? Would taking it in and having someone look at it help my problem?",
