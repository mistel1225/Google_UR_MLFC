    "title": "Pixel 3XL, since upgrading to android v10, screen goes blank during phonecalls",
    "content": "Since upgrading my Pixel3xl to android v10 about a month ago, My screen goes blank during phonecalls. It means that I am unable to use my screen during phonecalls and need to use the power button to end call option to finish calls. \n\nI have downloaded the sensor test and found that it reads 0cm in all conditions which means the problem is likely being caused by this. I would like to state that this issue started directly after the update, which makes me unsure if the issue is hardware or software.\n\nI have tried hard reset, safe mode (issue persists) but have not tried factory reset as I don't particularly want to do this.",
