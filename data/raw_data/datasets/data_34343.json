    "content": "Having issues with app actions disappearing from the app drawer constantly. I've had issues since updating to the February patch--app actions will show up for a couple days and then disappear for days after. I've tried factory restoring and the same thing keeps happening, actions are there for a few days and then they disappear for days after. I've tried clearing the storage/cache for Google, Pixel Launcher, and Action Services, and clearing app preferences to no avail. See screenshot attached to see what I mean.. Anything to get my app actions back? ",
