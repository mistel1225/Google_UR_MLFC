    "content": "Hi.\n\nNFC was working on my device and I was able to read/write to NFC stickers without issue.\nSuddenly though it is no longer working. Google Pay continues to work fine however.\n\nWhen I now try to scan an NFC tag I just get no response from my phone and I've tried several apps to try reading the data.\n\nSteps I've tried so far:\n\n- Restarting phone. I have also gone into safe mode which doesn't resolve the issue.\n- Uninstalling all third party NFC apps\n- Turning off Android Beam\n- Checking NFC is enabled in settings\n- Removing the case (though it was scanning with the case on before anyway)\n\nIdeally I don't want to factory reset as this is hassle. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.",
