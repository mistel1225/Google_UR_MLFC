    "content": "Ok so a couple days ago I noticed my phone started having battery issues and not charging fully. With increased attempts to get it charged I noticed it wasn’t charging at all and the battery display was false. After contacting google help I followed their steps did the safe mode, factory reset and other things they recommended. After resetting my phone the issue didn’t resolve itself and has become worse. The phone will no longer turn on and will just flash between the “dead battery” symbol and the google logo when your phone turns on. This back and forth happened all day before it just stops until I attempt to turn the phone back on, I can enter that mode phones have when you hold the volume buttons but it does nothing . I feel it may be a physical issue with the battery itself but I’m not sure.",
