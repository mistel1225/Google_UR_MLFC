    "content": "When I put in a new password for my phone (pattern) I suddenly forgot the password, and i couldn't change it because it asked for the password again. I reset it, but it still didn't work. This is my first time having a phone so I'm very confused on how I can reset it completely. Tried Google Find my Phone and found it (because my email is connected to the gmail on the phone) but it still wouldn't do a thing.",
