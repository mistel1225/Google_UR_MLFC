    "content": "So this was a problem I had with my Google Pixel XL, and now I have it with my 3a XL. For the first few months of using my phone with my 5 GHz wifi, I had absolutely no problems. Now, many apps won't start unless if I turn off my phone wifi. Some apps work without an issue (YouTube, Chrome, Facebook, Reddit). Twitter will load the app but not multimedia. When I reached out to tech support the last time, I was told to switch to 2.4 GHz, which worked, but I would prefer to use 5 GHz if possible. I don't remember the issue arising after an app update, and I've searched endlessly for a similar question, but I haven't found any. Are there steps I can take on my phone to help improve my connectivity?",
