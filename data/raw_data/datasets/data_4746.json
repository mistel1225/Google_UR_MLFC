    "content": "As the title says, they keep crashing, but they don't fully close. It still shows the app open in the app tray. \nThe little window that pops up when an app is not responding pops up extremely briefly. I cannot select anything before it goes away.\n\nI have tried force closing, fully turning off my phone, restarting, clearing cache, clearing storage, uninstalling/disabling, uninstalling updates and the issue continues.",
