    "content": "I am using google pixel 1, I have always update all the software's up to date. My phone today October 1, 2019, crashes suddenly and its starts restarting not switched on itself. Its keep on restarting, that too the restart page only has google logo, no other thing displays. Its really bad experience for me and I never expect from google this kind of problems. I was using it all of my professional access and now I never suggest of another google products. I don't like this from google.",
