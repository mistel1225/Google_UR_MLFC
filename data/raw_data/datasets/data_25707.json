    "content": "For the past month I've been getting notices on my phone that my WiFi connection is poor so it's switching to mobile data. My WiFi at work is fine. This only happens at home. Pretty much as soon as I get home. So it's not been on WiFi at all. Today I tried forcing it to use wifi by turning off my mobile data. After tapping my network name about 50 times if finally connected, or so it says.  It also says signal is excellent. But when I try to go on the internet, it goes no where. So even though it says connected, it's not. We've tried rebooting everything: phone, router, modem... Changed settings multiple times. Went into safe mode, but it doesn't work there either. Tried pretty much everything I've found in these forums.....I can connect to pretty much any open network, ie stores, etc.... But not my home. Any ideas?",
