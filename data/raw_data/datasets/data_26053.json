    "content": "After the February security update, I've had extremely bad battery issues. I charged my phone to 90% and after 7 hours I woke up to having 26%. Even using my phone I loose around 10% per 10-20 minutes. I've reset my phone twice and installed bare minimum apps and still get the drain. I've never had this issue before, it started after the February update.",
