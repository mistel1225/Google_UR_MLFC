    "content": "This is more of a feature request than a question. It would be great if one could control the volume of notifications independently from the ringer volume. I'm someone that prefers notifications to be relatively unobtrusive, but at the same time typically set my ringer volume  quite loud, to make sure I don't accidentally miss a call by not hearing it. As it stands, I either have to run that risk, or have annoyingly loud notifications interrupt me throughout the day. Most other Android phones offer independent notification and ringer volume controls. Why not the Pixel?",
