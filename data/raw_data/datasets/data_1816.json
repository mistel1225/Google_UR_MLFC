    "content": "Girlfriend's Pixel 4a suddenly went to black screen and wouldn't light up, but it was working. No drops, no water, in a case, etc.\n\nDid a soft reset and screen went to green. Still readable, but touchscreen went crazy, so couldn't enter password.\n\nSoft reset again. Now screen flickers green repeatedly for a small fraction of a second.\n\nThoughts?",
