    "content": "Ok I'm now on my 3rd Pixel 2 XL, all with Verizon, and I keep running into the same issue, where they'll just randomly restart. Often I don't even realize it's done this, just when I go to use the phone it'll tell me it had just restarted, so it often is restarting even when not in use. But it will also restart at the worst times, I work in emergency response and it'll drop in the middle of a phone call. This is a personal phone that are kept safe and doesn't have weird programming, I barely even use 3rd party apps, mostly just Outlook and my local credit union.\n\nI've tried replacement phones, factory resets, even while in safe mode it will still crash and restart. I have removed it's case, even though it wasn't like an OtterBox or anything that'd block in heat or anything, just a normal $10 case. And the latest phone also has a weird issue where it keeps resetting Google Assistant so it does the greeting all over again when I go to use it, I only mention in case my \"Google\" account is somehow corrupted and related (doubtful but at this point just tossing out info and speculation as it's all I ever got left). I've cleared the assistant cache a few days ago but that didn't help.\n\nShort of getting a non Google phone I'm not really sure what else I can do at this point. I work in IT and my brother in law works for Verizon, and between the two of us we just can't figure out why this model keeps crashing for me.",
