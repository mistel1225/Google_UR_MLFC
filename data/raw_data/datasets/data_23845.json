    "content": "I purchased a Pixel 3 phone back in November 2018 through the online Google store, but this January its microphone stopped functioning. I contacted Google on how to solve the problem, they first guided me through some software-related checks (resetting the phone, etc.), all to no avail. Hence, I decided that I return the device. I was given a prepaid shipping label with which I mailed my device from ZÃ¼rich to Basel on 17th of February, which was tracked with Swiss post and it arrived on 19th of February. They told me, they mail me a new/refurbished device once they receive the defective one. Well, I exchanged close to 30 emails, initiated countless online chat sessions, and all I'm being told is that they are looking into the issue, but there's absolutely NO progress being made. Now it is the beginning of April, and still nothing.\nWhom should I contact at this point?",
