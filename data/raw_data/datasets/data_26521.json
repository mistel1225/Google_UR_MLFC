    "content": "This started happening recently. When I open my camera and take a picture, it will show the picture in the bottom right as a circle, but when I click on it, it shows a really old picture. (It's always the same one) then I have to click \"all photos\" to open Google photos and wait for the photos to sync in to open it. Yes, I've restarted. No, I have not and will not factory reset, as this problem just shouldn't be there in the first place. It also doesn't have anything to do with HDR+, because I have tried disabling it. It also never shows up in the camera roll of the camera ever since the old one from quite a while ago.",
