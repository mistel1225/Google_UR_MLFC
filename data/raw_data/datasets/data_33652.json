    "content": "I took several motion photos and was able to swipe up and select a shot from the timeline of a dozen or so frames which was great.  But now some hours later the timelines on all pictures have disappeared. I did upload the pictures to the cloud to access them on my pc.  Also how to select from the frames in the google photo's app on google drive on the pc itself?",
