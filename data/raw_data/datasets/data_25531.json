    "content": "Media controls in the notification shade and lockscreen have become unusable. Tapping them does nothing. Sometimes the action will execute long after I've given up. This is happening on both Apple Music and Soundcloud. Eve pausing doesn't work. I now have to unlock my phone and go into each app to change songs.",
