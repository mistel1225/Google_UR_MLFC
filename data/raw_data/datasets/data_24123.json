    "content": "Tech support so far has not helped!\n\nhttps://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/23431137?hl=en\n\nI simply tell my phone \"Hey Google, call Kurt on speakerphone\" and it calls but not on speakerphone. I hear no \"bing or beep\" from the assistant, I just see a message that says \"assistant cannot start when another app is using the microphone\". No other apps are open and I've tried everything including safe mode and factory data reset. Still works perfectly fine right now on my original Google Pixel 2016. Please help. Merry Christmas btw",
