    "content": "I have nest Thermostat installed and it has been working fine for last 2 years. Since yesterday it has started to act funny on Google home app. When I change temperature it snaps back to where it was. I make bigger change to the circle curve and it snaps back to 1-2 degrees towards where it was and nothing happens. At the same time it is working just fine inside Nest App. It's only Google Home app where it does it. Also, on my Pixel 4xl, on the power button smart home menu, it is the same behavior. I tried installing and reinstalling the device, resetup on nest app as well. But that Google home app problem persist. Please help.",
