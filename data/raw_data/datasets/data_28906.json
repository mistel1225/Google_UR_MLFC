    "content": "I'm trying to get my account back to a regular account and I am 48 yrs. old , so why a teenager account but I had a account set up for me under johnlippold1971@gmail.com and I was putting in the back up account and Google play made it my regular email but I am locked out of both now and have no way to get my important documents and photos and I was a guide getting ready to make level 8 and this is how you treat customers. Hope to get a response from a real Google representative!",
