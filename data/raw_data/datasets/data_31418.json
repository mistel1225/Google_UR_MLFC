    "content": "Last night phone was on the table while I watched TV. After watching TV the phone was dead. I know it was half charged, 80% storage used. nothing worked, Power + vol dn didnt work, nothing. plugged it overnight.\n\nkept trying in morning then it finally worked. I arrive at work today and it died again, trying again and again finally I started bootloader. I deleted some apps, photos and was good for an hour. I picked up the phone and it prompted for keypad sign in, like it had restarted itself without me knowing.... then later it has proper died and I'm trying again and again and she isn't waking up this time.\n\nI haven't 'root' the phone or anything of these things, pretty sure developer mode is not enabled. when I go home, what do i do? Can I factory reset from a PC?\n\nIf it's hardware ( which I think it is) what can i do?",
