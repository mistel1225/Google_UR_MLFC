    "content": "Hello,\nI am looking for a way to contact Google other than through https://store.google.com/gb/repair\n\nMy Google Pixel 3 camera has problems fixing focus on anything - autofocus is erratic, which is especially visible when shooting videos. The focus oscillates back and forth, but the objects are never sharp. The same happens when taking photos - my photos are out of focus, no matter what I do (even when touching the viewfinder to tell the phone which objects to focus on). I tried clearing the camera app's cache, but it did not help. I have a strong impression that it's a factory fault.\n\nThis is disappointing considering I bought this device specifically hoping for superior camera experience. I've found there are many other users with the same problem.\n\nWhat makes things worse, Google support is simply non-existent. The site clearly says my device is covered by manufacturer's guarantee (see attached screenshots), but there is no way to send it back to Google - neither call nor chat are available at any time of the day for me.\n\nIronically, the Made By Google Twitter uses the slogan Help Done the Google Way. I even tried to contact them over Twitter, but they are not able to help.",
