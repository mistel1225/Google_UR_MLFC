    "title": "Location Services and Battery Saver Stuck",
    "content": "I cannot turn on location services, or turn my phone off battery saver. Location services is stuck in the off position, every time I try to turn it on, the bar on the top turns blue but the toggle will not move, I have attached a photo of this phenomenon. The battery saver button will not grey out either, I have tried repeatedly going through settings, to no avail. The battery saver issue I can deal with, but not having location services on is disabling features in a lot of the apps I use. Can anyone tell me what is going on, or how to fix it? Thank you. ",
