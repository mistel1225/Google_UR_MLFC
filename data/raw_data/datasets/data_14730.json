    "content": "Had the Pixel 4a for about a month now & coming from a Bold N1 & a Moto G6. The issue I have is about the loudness of the sound in general. Even with the 2 speakers, you have to turn the phone up to the max to be at the same volume the others had at half. Can this be fixed with maybe an update to the sound program?",
