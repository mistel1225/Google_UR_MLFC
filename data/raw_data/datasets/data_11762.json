    "content": "I don't get voicemail notifications on my Pixel 3 in any form. There is no way to know whether I have a voicemail without manually calling in.\n\nPer old posts, I've checked the blocked numbers list, turned various settings like visual voicemail on and off, made sure notifications/alerts are on, contacted Xfinity cell carrier, cleared phone cache, nothing has helped. It's been like this for something like six months since I've had the phone which I purchased new and for retail price. I ended up just putting a message on saying voicemail doesn't work on this phone, because it's such a pain, but I really need voicemail notification now (really, I'd like visual voicemail, which is the only thing I miss from having an iPhone, and it was advertised as a feature of this phone).\n\nDoes this phone actually come with the voicemail notification feature or do I have to buy a new phone? And, honestly, I see other people saying this issue is happening on Pixel 4s too so while I like Pixel I'm not sure I could go Google again when the most important features of a PHONE aren't working.\n\nThanks for advice.",
