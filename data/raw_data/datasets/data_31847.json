    "content": "While waiting for my replacement Pixel 3 (RMA under warranty), my old pixel 3 battery went dead. I recharged it and surprisingly, this seems to have fixed the phone. It no longer hangs when I turn it on. So which phone should I ship back? My old Pixel 3 or the refurbished Pixel 3 sent as a replacement? Both seem to work fine.\nWill I be charged something because the old phone works perfectly now?\nWill this affect my warranty/RMA options if I have a problem in the future?\n\nFYI, before getting the RMA, we tried all the usual stuff - power cycling, Factory Reset, Safe mode - and nothing fixed it. It hung when coming out of sleep or on power up. I am guessing that a completely drained battery 'fixed' it.",
