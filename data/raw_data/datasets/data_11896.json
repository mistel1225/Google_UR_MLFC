    "title": "Google Play Music won't show any audio files downloaded locally on the phone in Recents (Android 10)",
    "content": "I had this problem when I had the Android 10 Beta on my Pixel XL, that audio files that are stored locally on my device don't pop up on GPM like they did in Android 9 and before. I make music, and I put many of my mixes on my phone, and it's just very easy for me to open up GPM and listen to my music (to listen to audio levels and quality through headphones/car speakers/etc.), but now it's annoying again because I had to open up the file manager every time I wanted to listen to a song I'm working on.\n\nI called support and got the repeating record suggestion of \"download google play music manager\" which I already know how to do, but don't want to do since google hasn't updated that since 2013 or so, and it's such a mundane process that I'd rather just have GPM work like it did on Android 9.\n\nIs there any fix or is this FUBAR due to no more support of GPM? I have no idea why this was removed as an option, it's kinda infuriating to me.",
