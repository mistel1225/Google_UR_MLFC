    "title": "Moved from Pixel 2 to Pixel 3, is my disappointment justified?",
    "content": "Pixel 3 can't seem to find itself anywhere, GPS standalone is non-existent as far as I can tell. Airplane mode + location. \n\nPixel 2 screen is more durable, I've had the pixel 3 for less than a month and there are visible scratches using it as my day-to-day. My Pixel 2 looks flawless in comparison. Hell, my Samsung Galaxy S7 work phone, which I've tossed around for what seems like a decade, doesn't have a scratch on the screen. \n\nPixel 3 camera's view finder is unbearably slow. \n\nI'm pretty frustrated. I write this out of anger, I was charging my Pix 3, someone was calling me, and it vibrated off the edge and hit the floor. Cracking the screen. I'm living in the UAE now, I don't know how I can repair my new phones screen here. \n\nUgghhghghghghhghghgh. I'm sorry. Not really a question but a rant.",
