    "content": "Lately I've been having issues where I won't get texts, restart my phone, and I get a flood of text messages. Without restarting the device, I've force closed the app, cleared the cache, and reopened Messages to no avail usually. I thought maybe it's a certain phone number doing it, but that's a stretch because it ends up impacting almost every single notification coming in (some notifications will take 30 minutes to over four hours to come in) but some will come in no issue. This includes voicemail which is why I thought maybe it had something to do with phone calls since I get spam calls that leave VMs. Those are usually the ones that make me realize I am not getting notifications or if someone hasn't texted me in a while. Trying to avoid doing a factory reset as much as possible. All apps are up to date including carrier services.\nNetwork: VZW\nDevice: Pixel 3 XL in Not Pink \nSoftware: November 2019 Security Patch",
