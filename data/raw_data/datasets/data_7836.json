    "content": "I work for a company that has to be my work profile account. I have a g suite account as my personal account. I have a Pixel 5 that I have not been able to use because all g suite accounts are considered \"work\" accounts and you can only have one \"work\" account. Everything works totally fine on my Pixel XL. Is there any way to have two g suite accounts on a Pixel 5? Am I the only person in the world that uses a g suite account as a personal account? Can I turn off the feature that divides the phone into personal and work accounts (ie have it act like my Pixel XL). The battery on my Pixel XL has finally succumb to the problem of having to push on the back of the case to get it to charge so I would really like to move to the Pixel 5 I have purchased.",
