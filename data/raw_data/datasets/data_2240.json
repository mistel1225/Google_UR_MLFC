    "content": "The google Messages app on my pixel has recently begun to display over other apps. This is ridiculously annoying and I would like it to stop. I encountered the same annoyance with facebook's messenger app, but was able to disable \"display over other apps\" in the app's advanced settings. Unfortunately, I cannot find a similar setting within Messages' app info. Is there a way to make this stop?",
