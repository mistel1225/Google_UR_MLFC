    "content": "Hello, i just bought a brand new google pixel 4A 5G. First thing i noticed when turning it on was the screen very warm, the white are not white but more like yellow shade.\nI looked up in settings, try using differents profils, checked if night mode was disable, but nothing change.\nI compared it with the phones of my family members, and you can really see and think night mode is on on mine but it's isn't. The screen is really yellow, it's becoming more and more annoying.\n\nI noticed some people were having the same problem, is there any way to fix it ?",
