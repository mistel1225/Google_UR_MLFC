    "title": "Pixel 2 with Android 10 - Sometimes incoming calls are silent, calling them back stuck on 'Calling'",
    "content": "About a third of the time, when I receive an incoming call and I answer it there is no sound. The phone screen shows I am connected and it starts timing the length of the call, so it looks like it is working fine. There is no sound. I might hang up 10 seconds later after saying Hello many times. If I immediately call them back then my phone gets stuck on Calling for 10-30 seconds, I usually give up and then try again after a minute.\n\nI would say about 1/3 of the calls I receive have this issue. When I call back the other person they say it just kept ringing, they never heard me answer the phone until my voicemail picked up.\n\nI did have the issue with being stuck on Calling immediately after Android 10 was installed (which I did with an OTA update) and removed My Verizon app which solved the issue when that happened with every single call. I have never reinstalled this app, and have verified it is not installed.\n\nMy phone is the Pixel 2 with Android 10, Oct 6 2019 security patch level. I use Prepaid Verizon as my carrier. I did not have this issue until Android 10 was installed. I do have a Google Voice number that forwards calls to my cell, however at least some of the calls were direct to my cell number and had the same issue.\n\nAny thoughts on what could cause this, does anyone else have this issue?",
