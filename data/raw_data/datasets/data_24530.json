    "content": "After the Android 10 update I've noticed when placing my Pixel 3 XL on the Pixel Stand to charge at night the Night Light mode switches on/off randomly every few seconds/minutes.  When this happens the ambient display also switches off for a split second.\n\nI have Night Light mode set to automatically enable at sunset and disable at sunrise.  Also the device is centered on the stand and charges with no issue.",
