    "content": "After the recent update from Android, I can't connect to my University WiFi unless I specify rhe domain. Before that, there was an option of \"unspecified\" for the CA certificate that enabled me to connect without specifiying the domain. I asked the IT service in my university and they mentioned that there is no specific domain needed. We tried several possible domains but none of them worked.",
