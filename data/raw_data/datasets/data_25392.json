    "content": "I have tried restarting into the bootloader, and attempting to get into recovery mode. I was met with nothing, just what appeared to be an error loading it. The phone turns on but gets stuck loading into the OS, this all happened after the recent update. The event happened while I was in a video/voice call on Discord. I have never had any issue with my device or the app in the past.",
