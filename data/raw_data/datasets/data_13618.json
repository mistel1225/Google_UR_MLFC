    "content": "My phone started showing 100% battery instantly and then 0% n powering down within a couple mins off the charger. After maybe 12 hours I now can't get the phone to turn on at all. If possible I would really like to get some of the apps/data off the phone without doing a hard reset. Any advice? Is the phone fixable or do I need to replace the phone?",
