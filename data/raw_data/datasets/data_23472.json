    "content": "In the past few months my pixels battery started getting weird. It started out shutting off at 30% and showing abrupt charge loss in the battery usage chart. Its gotten to the point where the battery drains at 1% a minute with no usage and barely any background app usage and the phone will shut off at any percent less than 80%. If I charge the phone to 100%, turn it off for a few minutes and turn it on with it ubplugged, the battery will be around 2%, but if i turn it off and back on plugged in, itll be back to 70%-90%. Ive tried uninstalling apps and even factory resetting, and I just had the battery replaced by UBreakIFix and its acting exactly the same. Unless they somehow put the original battery back in, what would cause my battery to act so weirdly? Attached is a screenshot directly after my phone shut off at 3% and i plugged it in and turned it back on a minute later for it to show 73%.",
