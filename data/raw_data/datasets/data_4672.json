    "content": "Suddenly when I opened the search bar on my Pixel 3a it would close when I started to input into it. Then I noticed that Flipboard would open stay on screen for a second and then close. I went through all the troubleshooting instructions including rebooting to safe mode. Still happened and Gmail started doing the same thing. I'm managing to type this by opening Chrome. Most of the other apps that I have tried seem to at least stay open. Any ideas would be greatly appreciated.",
