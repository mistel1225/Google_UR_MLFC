    "content": "I have turned off the group notifications (sound, vibration, pop up) in WA, as well as group notifications in phone settings\n\nBut when a group message comes in, the notification still comes up and I look back at the phone settings, it seems like the group notification has been set back to on.\n\nThis only started happening about a week ago.",
