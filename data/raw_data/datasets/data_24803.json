    "content": "I have no original charger for my Google Pixel XL and cord too. \nI bought BlitzWolf fast charger with type-C and PD and cable:\n\nBut when I charging Google Pixel XL I get only additional 72% of battery charge for 2 hours of charging. Why so long?\n\nPerhaps this cable is not fast enought? It's USB 2.0 in description. I need USB 3.0 cable?  The charger is ok?\n\nHow long should be fast charging for Google Pixel XL?",
