    "content": "Hello Guys, \n\nSo another issue I met since the latest update is that my phone doesn't connect at all with the usb dongle that comes with the phone. I am using it to listen to music in my car. I changed the dongle for my new one (still using the first one from my pixel 1 xl), changed the aux cord, did a factory reset, cleaned the usb c port carefully and the dongle. It just stopped working.\n\nOn top of it, half of my chargers won't work or half the time. They are all in great condition and where all working before the update. What is going on??? \n\nThank you for your time!",
