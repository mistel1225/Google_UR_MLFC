    "content": "I have a google 4a Brand new! In the messenger app when I go to open up a conversation to send a message, the entire conversation does not load, instead I get stuck on a white/blank screen. The only way I can move past this is if I restart the phone... for every time I Want to send a message! \n\nThere were messenger tasks happening in the background but I was able to turn those off via another forum post. I also cleared my messages cache. \n\nIs this is a common problem or does my new phone have a bug?",
