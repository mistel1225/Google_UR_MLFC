    "content": "Hi, on my Google Nexus 4, I use an app called LightFlow to show LED Notifications when I have a missed call, missed text message, low battery indicator, no service indicator.  It's now time to upgrade my phone.  I would prefer to stick with Google so I'm looking at the Pixel 3A.  Can someone tell me if I can still do the same notifications on this phone like I'm doing on the Nexus 4.  I don't know too much about how LED notifications work.  I read that it can be controlled by the phone or via an app.  I also heard that there is no LED light on the Pixel 3A so does my question become irrelevant regardless of what apps I'm using (ex: LightFlow).  Thanks for your feedback.",
