    "content": "I restrict permissions, avoid heavy-duty apps, and turn on airplane mode before going to bed.  Up until now the phone has lost 2-3% of its battery level overnight.  But since downloading the August software update, it's losing 10-12% overnight.  Anyone else seeing this?  Any ideas?",
