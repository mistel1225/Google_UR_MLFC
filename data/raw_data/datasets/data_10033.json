    "content": "When I got my Pixel 5 and would go to Settings -> Storage -> Files it would bring up the default file manager but would also ask me if I wanted to try Google Files.  After a couple of times I gave it a try figuring I didn't like it I could switch back however I can't seem to find the \"switch back\" option.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.",
