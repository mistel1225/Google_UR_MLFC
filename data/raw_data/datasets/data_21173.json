    "title": "Pixel 2XL restore is incomplete after reset. Missing messages, home screen layout",
    "content": "I had to perform a factory reset on my phone due to a system malfunction which rendered my phone unusable. This happened a few weeks ago and I was able to restore my phone completely to how it was before.\n   However this time I went through the same process: logged into my account and selected the most recent Google Drive backup from a few days ago to restore. Except this time round there's lot of things missing. My home screen has returned to the default one, all my SMS are gone and a lot of my settings preferences are gone too. \n  This is intensely frustrating as I can see the backup I wanted still saved on the drive but i can't restore it properly. I've already reset it again and tried to go through the process again of restoring it but with the same results. Any help would be appreciated",
