    "title": "My Google Pixel has stopped connecting to GPS",
    "content": "I have been through all of the suggested threads in the help center including managing location settings, restarting the phone, etc. In the settings menu, under \"Use Location,\" the slide button is in the left position, with the menu bar grayed out. When I press it or slide it, it moves to the right and turns blue, but then stays in the left (off) position. I have tweaked every setting I can think of and can't get anywhere. The day this started, I also had some connectivity issues with LTE, but not 3G, though those seem to have worked themselves out.",
