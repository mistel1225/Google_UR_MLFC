    "title": "Pixel 3a needs to be charged every three hours. Sudden, severe battery drain.",
    "content": "My phone is just under two years old. Over the last month it has gone from lasting 14+ hours on a charge to now just lasting 3 hours on a charge. Battery life in the systems screen says 5 hours. I've tried two resets, checking app usage, to now having a battery pack case just to make it through the day. Phone is updated. \n\nAnything else I can try? Is my battery just fried at this point? Would a battery replacement help me out? This phone is still a couple payments away from being paid off through cell phone carrier. I don't want to through too much more money at it I just need to cut my loses and move on.",
