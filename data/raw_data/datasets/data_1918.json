    "content": "After seeing Google I/O today, I cannot get the main screen to look the same as shown (not a huge issue!) Does anyone know where to get the wallpaper and icons from?\nWhen my phone went into sleep mode (blank screen) I had to reboot it as it would not come back on again .. (the upgrade went well, but it still says Android 11)\nThinking that maybe a system firmware reboot might be the next step if things keep messing up??",
