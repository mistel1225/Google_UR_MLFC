    "title": "Pixel restarting randomly during a phone call after latest Android 10 update",
    "content": "After the last Android 10 device update, I can't stay on a call for more than 10-20 minutes. My business involves remote conference calls / meetings etc. and it's extremely frustrating being disconnected while something important is being discussed.\n\nAt some random points during the call, the mute/unmute buttons become \"stuck\" (can't unmute at all), and the call disconnects, the Google logo shows up on a black background for a few seconds, and the phone is back on the launcher / home page within seconds. It's not a complete restart, whatever that is, given how quickly it \"resets\". I'm not sure what's causing this but is there any way to undo the last update? Whatever it is, I can't afford to keep being disconnected from my meetings.\n\nThanks!",
