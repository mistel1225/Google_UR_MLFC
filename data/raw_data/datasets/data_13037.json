    "content": "I took a video earlier today and the video seems to be partially corrupted. When I view the video the first 40 seconds are just one still frame. The last 20 seconds of the video work, but there is no sound. Videos taken before and after have the sound and video working appropriately.\n\nI downloaded MP4Fix but it said nothing was wrong with the video. I also downloaded VLC for Android but the video had the same issue there too.\n\nI also transferred the file to my laptop and tried saving it as an AVI to have VLC fix it, but this didn't work either.\n\nWhen I look at the video in the first screen of Google photos the duration in the corner reflects the length of the video that actually works. When I click into the video, it's longer but the first part doesn't play.\n\nI'd really like to recover the rest of the video and/or sound if possible. It was of some of my baby's first giggles!",
