    "content": "Hello. I have a pixel 3 that continually restarts itself. I have seen this issue online, and followed advice: restarted in safe mode, hard reset the phone, cleared cache. None of these have helped. My phone is just over a year old (Christmas 2018) and of course is off warranty.  I have loved this phone so far, but am disappointed it is reaching the point of being unsusable. The phone has no damages at all. Is there anything to be done?",
