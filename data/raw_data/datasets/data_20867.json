    "content": "The customer support rep i was speaking to lied to me many times during chat. When asked certain questions he avoided answering them and then ended chat when i demanded to know the anwser for the question i asked. Is this how google teaches there customer support to ask??? Something HAS to be done about this rep and his HORRIBLE JOB. Here is the transript if you look towards the end of the chat i make VERY VALID points on why i wanted a replcaement not to get it repaired. Then i asked him a question many times and he refused to answer and then ended chat.  HORRIBLE HORRILE HORRIBLE  EXPERIENCE GOOGLE!!!\ncase number _ 8-01480000830977",
