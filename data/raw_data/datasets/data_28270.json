    "content": "If 3-dot navigation is enabled on android 10, the dots will not disappear like they used to on previous version. This is super annoying because the keyboard will only appear on top of the dots and is further away so typing is really hard for me. Is there a setting that makes the 3-dots fade away again like in the previous version?",
