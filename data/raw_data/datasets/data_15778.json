    "content": "Updated to 11 yesterday on my pixel 2. Have had the screen go completely off twice now, where hard rebooting or rebooting into safe mode doesn't retrigger the screen but the phone does reboot. I was in the process of switching out to an older phone when i popped the sim card out, this was after contacting google support, the screen magically turned back on. The 2nd time the screen went off i popped out the sim again and within 10 seconds it was back. I have an appt at verizon later today but doubt they'll do anything besides tell me to do a factory reset  update: after about doing this the 6th time its no longer working as a work around. Ended up doing a factory reset and it failed twice, only succeeded when i only restored just my contacts. Reinstalled everything and the screen does seem less responsive then waking it up...",
