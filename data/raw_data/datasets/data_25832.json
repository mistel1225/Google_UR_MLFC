    "content": "I try to use Esim and sim together at the same device because it is one of the best opportunity but I discovered that pixel3 is single standby. I just want to know if google plans to give us possibility to have dual standby as it is in pxl 3a and 4. If system updates or something can \"solve\" or update this thing we will be grateful.",
