    "title": "Pixel XL WIFI only works when pressed - how to fix?",
    "content": "My Pixel XL WIFI only works when I press on the upper right corner (edge just before the bezel)) of the screen. If I release the press, the WIFI cuts off right away and just remains dead (doesn't pick up signals/SSIDs). Something is obviously loose in there. Is it the antenna or is it the chip?\nI have identified the problem and location, and have repeatedly re-sample the temporary solution to ensure it works. Funny thing is the harder I press, the stronger, faster the reception. I'm using it temporarily with a plastic clamp. Very awkward and in the way!\nPlease help provide more details on how to approach fixing it. The tear down videos online don't seem to show/indicate what's exactly there, and where the antenna cable is (if that's the likely issue in my case). Thank you!",
