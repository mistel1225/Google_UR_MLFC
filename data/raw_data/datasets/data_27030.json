    "content": "Hey, since the most recent update on my pixel3, my pager apps do not override the silent mode nor do they alert me that a message has come through requesting my attendance at my local coastguard station. This is exceedingly frustrating as I am not attending when I would be free. \nHow can an app now read messages and alert the owner? I was using FireAlert and Emergency Alert successfully until the update. Thanks",
