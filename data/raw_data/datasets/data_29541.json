    "content": "Sorry that this is not a question but more a statement that I hope will resonate with Google.\nI've used the Galaxy Nexus, Nexus 6P, Pixel 1 and now the Pixel 3.  I won't be coming back anytime soon as I feel that I have been ripped off and I find it really sad.\n\n1- The phone was really expensive...so I was expecting very high quality peformances.\n\n2- The phone has slowed down more than any other phones that I have owned and it has not even been a year since I bought it.  It's not incredibly slow by any means but has lost a significant amount of 'buttery smoothness' and I do not overload my phone at all.\n\n3- Battery life is average at best...some days are quite horrendous\n\n4- Network reception seems worse than my S8 that I had before.  I get drop calls, it has a hard time finding LTE when it should not be an issue...wifi calling works only sometimes and I need to reboot the phone to make it work again.\n\n5- The back design is great but not the front and the speakers do not sound really good (as pointed out in many reviews).\n\nFor the first time, I am in a hurry to finish my 2 years contract...and I can't really consider finishing it before as the phone is so damn expensive.\n\nI know that Google has many clients and I'm sure I'll get some hate for posting this but I'm sure I'm not alone and I only hope that futur buyers will have a better experience then my Pixel 3 experience... (with the Pixel 4, etc)",
