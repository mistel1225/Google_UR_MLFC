    "title": "Why won't google give us the option to have unlimited notifications like iphones?",
    "content": "We all know there are notification limits per app, around 25 for most apps. If you haven't tried it, wait for 25 twitter notifications to come in. What happens next is a deal breaker for many. You will not receive any more notifications after the first 25, unless you have cleared it. On iphones, first of all, the limit is 99 notifications. But any further notifications still show. The older ones just get deleted. \n\nWhy won't android introduce this option of displaying new notifications even when the max is reached? If someone spams you with 25 messages, and the next message is an important message from a family member, you won't receive that notification. This is dangerous. If android fixes this issue, lots of iphone users will immediately switch over to pixel. There is a growing community of people who need this issue fixed in order for us to jump ship from apple to google.",
