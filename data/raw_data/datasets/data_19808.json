    "content": "Disappointed. Fireworks photos came out awful. My old Samsung Note took great fireworks pictures. I tried Night Sight, Portrait, and regular camera mode. I don't see a burst mode or any other modes other than Portrait, Panorama, Photo Sphere, Slow Motion, Time Lapse, Playground. Would any of those have worked better? Do I need a third party app, if so, which one would you suggest?",
