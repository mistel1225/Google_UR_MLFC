    "content": "Hi,\nI have a pixel 2 XL and when I plug it to my computer with a usb-c to usb-c cable, the screen turns black like 1 second. The screen does that randomly many times. I tried to restart it in safe mode, I tried an other cable, and I also tried to change my phone (I have a new phone thanks to guarantee)\n\nThere is no problem when the phone isn't pluged\n\nThanks",
