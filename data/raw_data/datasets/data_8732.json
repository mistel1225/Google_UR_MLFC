    "content": "I have a Pixel 5 and every time I connect it to my car, my car's Bluetooth controls die. I can play music from my Pixel 5 over Bluetooth, but the controls on my steering wheel and on my touchscreen don't work. I can't see song details, source info, nothing.\n\nI'm posting this because I don't have that problem with my Pixel 4 XL, 4a, or 3 which all run Android 11. I'm not sure if it's a device thing or what.\n\nAnybody got any suggestions?",
