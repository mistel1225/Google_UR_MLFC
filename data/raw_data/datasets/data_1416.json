    "content": "My Pixel 4 XL has developed an issue where driving mode does not turn on automatically, even when the settings are set to turn on when connected to my vehicle.\n\nFor a while if I had the \"Ask before turning on driving mode\" switch on, it would raise a notification, then go into Android Auto (my choice for driving mode), but now that does not now work either - the screen refreshes and nothing happens.\n\nI have toggled all the toggles trying to get this to happen automatically but it now does not.\n\nIs there anything I can check to get this working?\n\nI do note that if I set driving mode to DND then it works perfectly.",
