    "title": "My pixel 1 is having an issue staying on without being plugged in. shuts down at 60% batt.",
    "content": "Noticed spontaneous shut down even with battery fully charged or at ample percentage. A few months ago it would shut down at around 20%. Now it's random. Today I just took it off the charger from my vehicle to walk into my office and it shut down. it was at 100% and is now at 67% and charging. The other day I had the battery fully charged. then when i took it off. showed 1% but lasted the entire day. feels like the battery saver algo is unreliable and triggers when it doesn't need to, holding my phone hostage.\n\n What's going on?
