    "title": "Multiple apps stopped working this afternoon Pixel 3",
    "content": "Multiple apps including Gmail, Outlook, Waze no longer work as of ~4-5pm ET today. They will open and then immediately crash. Have restarted multiple times, updated all apps, cleared cache... no luck. Some apps still randomly work (including Google Maps) but it's a real mix of native Google and 3rd party apps with no real rhyme or reason",
