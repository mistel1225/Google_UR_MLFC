    "content": "My Brazilian partner's name is Alisson. It's a male name where he's from and is spelled Alisson. When I use voice dictation with Messenger on my Pixel 3XL it spells it using the American female name spelling (Allison). We've thought of just about everywhere we could possibly go to address this problem to no avail. At this point the only place it is still problematic is when I voice dictate in Messenger.",
