    "content": "I know this has been asked elsewhere, but the answers provided don't work. I just want Spotify to be able to override Do Not Disturb (as it used to be able to do very easily). Per the instrux given elsewhere, I've added Spotify as an exception in the Do Not Disturb settings, then gone into the Spotify settings and switched on the ability to override Do Not Disturb. This did not work.\n\nIs there still an actual fix for this, or did Google disable this feature entirely?\n\nCheers for any info.",
