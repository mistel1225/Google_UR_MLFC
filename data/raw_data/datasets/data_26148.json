    "title": "Pixel 2 \"files\" app using 75% of battery in a day",
    "content": "I've never had any battery issues, suddenly my phone is draining rapidly (went from full to dead in about 4 hrs today with typical use, usually it lasts all day and gets charged at night when I sleep). When I search what apps are using the battery, I see that \"files\" is using 75% of my battery. I can't even find \"files\" on my phone. I haven't updated in quite awhile so it's not a new software update. Reboot has no effect. Any ideas?",
