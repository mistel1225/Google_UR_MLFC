    "content": "After updating to Android 10 my mobile network stopped working. I used the SIM in another device and it works. And I also used a known working SIM from another device in the pixel 2 and doesn’t work. So it’s not the SIM card. I also tried ejecting the SIM and installing back in, restarting phone, factory resetting phone and resetting network settings. Nothing worked. Need a fix ASAP Google!!!",
