    "content": "Have cardboard VR headset box.\nNot Google cardboard.\nTried it out with a VR panorama.\nNot quite right, so went to settings, where I chose Daydream, as one of the possible choices.\nPop-up appears, requiring me to install Daydream, or cancel.\nIf I cancel, PHOTOS drops out of VR to ordinary photo thumbnail, not back to SETTINGS within VR.\nI can't get back into VR settings to switch back to a cardboard headset.\nIf I open the VR thumbnail again, the pop-up appears, again, requiring a Daydream install.\nSo, tried installing DAYDREAM, which then said it needed a Daydream Keyboard install.\nUninstalled Daydream, but VR still set expecting a Daydream headset - so the pop-up appears, again.\nCan't get past this pop-up, back to VR settings.\nNew to Android and the Pixel 3, and stuck.\nAny ideas?",
