    "title": "My Pixel died 6 days beyond the warranty",
    "content": "The device couldn't be turned on Aug 9th (Warranty expired on Aug 3rd). I contacted google and dropped the phone to Ubreakifix for 2 days and they cannot even locate the issue. Then I contacted Google again. This time, I was sent a link to send my phone to Google to fix it. But it would charge me $410 prehead to fix it.\n\nI didn't send it. Because it's too expensive (about half of the price of a Pixel 3 XL). For a Google device, I would expect a higher quality not just a dead phone one year after purchase. \n\nNot sure if anyone has similar concerns or issues.",
