    "title": "Hi, I had a microphone problem 4 days ago and it becomes worse. Now I can't hear any sound at all.",
    "content": "At first it had seemed to be a microphone problem, but when I used some apps to talk like duo ,Skype or line, the phone would restart automatically, or shows some errors. Then it became worse and I couldn't hear any sound with any app or website. I even tried to use factory reset, but it only works for hear alarm sound etc. And if I restore my account, it will sound nothing again. Might it be some software issue? I use this phone for 3years and it was fine but happened suddenly this time. Could anyone help? I like this phone but it bothers if there's no sound or can't voice with others with it. Thanks.",
