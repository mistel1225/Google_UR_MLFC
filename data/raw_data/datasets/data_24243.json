    "content": "My first generation Pixel XL needs a battery replacement. Google recommends a specific company in my region (NYC) as its authorized repair center but I want to look at that battery before they install it to make sure they're truly giving me a genuine Pixel battery, not a low-end, third-party replacement.  Who makes the real thing and how can I identify it?",
