    "title": "How do I truly transfer ownership of my Pixel, not make a \"guest account\"?",
    "content": "I got a new 4a recently, but a month later I got the Pixel 5. I was able to easily transfer my account/data/settings from my 4a to my 5  with no issues (What a wonderful and smooth initialization process these phones have!) but now I'm having great difficulty making this old 4a truly belong to my wife. She's coming from a Galaxy 8.\n\nHow do I move her from her Galaxy to this 4a as easily as I went from the 4a to the 5? I do not care about warranty. I just want her to be the root user of this 4a, I want all of my data erased, and I want her data transferred over. I've been Googling for a while and can't find any effective or up-to-date answer.\n\nPlease help!",
