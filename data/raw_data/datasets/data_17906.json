    "content": "So, i just came back from my holiday and i have been using the google USB-C earphones on the beach a lot of the time, but it got to the point that i accidently dropped them in the sand, and now the sand is inside the earphones and the sound quality is really quiet. Does anyone know how i can clean them or are they water proof?",
