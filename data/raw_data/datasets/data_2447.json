    "content": "If I zoom in and take a raw+jpg the dng is not the full image as it should be its a very low quality small res file much like the digital zoom of the jpg. Some apps won't even read these files either. I expect this behaviour of the jpg its a digital crop but not the raw file....it was not like that before and it also does not do this in open camera??  Any thougths anyone??",
