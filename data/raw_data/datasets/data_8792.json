    "content": "I'm trying to connect my Pixel 4a (5G) to my Windows 10 laptop via Bluetooth. Both devices said they paired successfully. However, my laptop says it's connected to my phone, but my phone doesn't say it's connected to my laptop. When I click the connect button from my phone, it gives up and I can click it again almost immediately. \n\nI've restarted both devices and re-paired them several times with no avail. I've run the bluetooth troubleshooter for Windows 10 as well with no luck. Any suggestions?",
