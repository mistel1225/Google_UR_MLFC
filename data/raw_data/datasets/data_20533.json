    "content": "My Pixel 2 trade in kit never arrived. I received an email from Google stating it was on the way back in May. Tracking shows an attempt was made to deliver to an address in another state. Somehow they got the wrong address. The new phone arrived without a problem. Now I cannot contact Google to fix it. Phone says nobody is available. Can't find chat. Any ideas?",
