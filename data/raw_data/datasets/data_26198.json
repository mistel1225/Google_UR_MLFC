    "content": "I recently bought a pixel 3, however on Sunday, the 17th of November, the sensors stopped working. I first noticed it with the proximity sensor during phone calls, on further investigation, the auto rotate nor the squeeze sensor were working anymore.\n\nFinally, worst of all, my phone wasn't charging anymore. Not wirelessly, nor through a direct connection with the original charger. It says \"plugged in, can't charge right now\" \n\nI've been trying to reach Google support as of Sunday but the repair center keeps informing me to wait for business hours, but I've checked every hour for the entire day yesterday and at no point was it available for me to chat or request a call. I couldn't even find an email. Their help center is one big runaround and i cant believe its so frustrating to deal with. \n\nI've been hunting the internet feverishly for some sort of help but really, everyone is saying its grounds for a RMA, but i cant even get into any sort of contact with google because they refuse to become available. Not via phone support, not via chat. So im currently stuck with a dead pixel 3 that i cant even get into to send feedback.\n\nSafe mode doesnt work, switching off and charging doesnt work, resetting doesnt work, forgetting connected devices doesnt work. Really nothing has worked.\n\nHere's to hoping for something new and some sort of reaching out from google.\n\nSo this is my last attempt at finding some solution.",
