    "content": "A few days ago, completely out of the blue, I discovered that my pixel 2 XL will no longer charge via USB-C to USB-C. I have tried the official Google charger, other chargers, multiple cables and power sockets. But the one thing that *does* work is only USB-A to USB-C. I'm able to charge it with the A to C cable in my car, in a Samsung charger, a Nintendo switch charger, etc.\n\nI've found similar discussions on Reddit from 2018, where they thought it was due to the Android 8.1 upgrade. They suggested trying a hard reset, factory reset, downgrading to Android 8.0. But for most people this did not fix it. I have not recently updated Android (it would've been done quite a while ago) so that wouldn't be the issue. I have done a hard reset and no difference.\n\nIs there any known fix for this, so that I don't have to unnecessarily factory reset? Has this happened to anyone else recently? I have not done anything to cause it... This problem is completely random. It is under warranty still, so I can send it to Kogan to assess it. But if I can avoid the hassle I'd prefer that.",
