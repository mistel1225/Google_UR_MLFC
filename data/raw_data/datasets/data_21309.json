    "content": "The device is actually Pixel 1 XL, but that was not on the list.\nIt is running Android 10 with the 6 October 19 update (latest available).\n\nThere used to be an option to have the (torch) flashlight on all the time when in the Camera app.\nNow when I turn it and then go to the camera app it turns the flashlight off, I cannot see option in the Camera app to turn the light permanently back on which used to be there.\n\nI use the phone to inspect things that I cant get my eye to but I can hold the phone at and some of these places are dark so I want to turn the torch on.  Often I am not interested in taking an actual picture.  Most of the time when I take a picture using the flash in these situations the results are of no use.\n\nHow do I keep the light on with the camera app open?",
