    "content": " So I've been using the pixel 3 for quite a long time since launch. Though I was super excited at first, it didn't last long even as much as 5 months. From the start, I've been facing heating issue while using the phone. Not a very long duration call, but even a 15 mins video call would heat it up very much, uploading photos does the same. Though a flagship phone, hasn't met it's expectations with the charge hold time. Charge doesn't last for a full day usage. It drains quickly giving quirky notifications about battery usage.I was waiting for software updates for patch fixes, none worked after a couple of updates.\nIs there any thing can be done i am really tired of trying all the things from websites nothing really helped me",
