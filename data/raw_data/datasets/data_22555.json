    "content": "I have my wallpaper set to change daily. It would always change overnight, maybe around 2 or 3 in the morning. Now all of a sudden it changes twice daily. Once overnight and a second time in the early afternoon. It has been happening since March 3. Is there a solution to this?. I only want it to change once a day, overnight, like it used to. Thank you.",
