    "content": "Not pink is pink all over the screen. Bought it brand new but can't return it. I bought two of them. A black one for me and the not pink for my wife. Well my wife has the black one and I suffer through having to turn brightness all the way up because the entire screen is pink. I see it's a not an uncommon problem as I googled to see if there is a way to fix it. Any chance Google stood by there product and had a recall or a fix for the problem? Loved all of my xl's but this pink screen is a constant nuisance.\n\nThank you for any help,\nChad LaDuke",
