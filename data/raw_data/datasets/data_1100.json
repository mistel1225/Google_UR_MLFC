    "content": "I reset my phone with a new password and forget about the new password. Now the phone is locked for all features and data. Is there any way to retrieve the password?  I use Google Fi service.\n\nThe last option will be a factory reset but will lose a lot of data.\n\nThank you!\nJZ",
