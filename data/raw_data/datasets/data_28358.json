    "content": "Hi all\n\nThis could be a little hard to explain, but I'll give it a shot. If I'm using the Android Messages app, in the main menu/conversation list, then receive a new sms/messages notification, the app will become unresponsive until the little \"messages\" notification animation is finished on the notification bar. The app will then function as usual until I receive another notification, at which point it will become unresponsive until the animation is finished.\n\nHas anyone else experienced this issue? and if so, does anyone know of a fix? Very frustrating!\n\nSorry if the explanation is a little rough...\n\nThanks in advance.",
