    "title": "Why I am getting problem with speaker in new Pixel 3A (it happened twice till now)?",
    "content": "I got new pixel 3A on Jan 2020 and the speaker stopped working from March 2020. I bought the phone from saturn.de on online. Anyways due to Covid Saturn was closed till May. Once they opened the servie desk, I submitted my phone for repair and they gave me back a new pixel 3A in one week. They told me I should be happy that I am receiving a new phone instead of getting the old one repaired. I started using the phone and in the next two weeks, the front speaker started creating disturbing sounds. I again went to service seek and submitted it. Now I am waiting for the last two weeks. \nIf there is problem with phones why they are not checking it properly. \nIts really hell lot of work to change phone so frequently :( \nReally very bad experience with pixel.",
