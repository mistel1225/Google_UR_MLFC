    "content": "I've been trying to download some bank statements from my banking app, which are in pdf files. I did have an Adobe app installed so I could view them, but that didn't seem to allow me to save/download the files. So, I uninstalled the app, in the hope that I would be able to download the files. Unfortunately, now I can only 'share' the files with other apps. I thought I might be able to download a file if I shared it with another app first, but the same happens when I attempt to download the file from that app.\n\nAny ideas what is happening, and how to fix it?",
