    "content": "There is a thread about a crackling top speaker on the Pixel 4a, I have it on the 4a 5g and I noticed it the first time after the latest December update. My phone suddenly sounds like a Geiger counter on some videos or even on feedback sounds.\n\nIn the other thread it says \"We have identified a fix for this issue and it will be rolling out with an upcoming Android software update\" but like I said it looks like I got the problem with the update.",
