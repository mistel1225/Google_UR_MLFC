    "content": "I have a Pixel 1, and a Samsung Note 9, so I assume this has more to do with Android 9 (Pie) moreso than the hardware. But I used to use an OTG adapter to plug in a camera (similar to FLIR), but since the update my phones no longer recognize the camera. I have looked up the problem and see that I am not alone with people having issues with the new Android 9 update and USB Host or USB OTG support. Is there a fix coming out for this? I have several clients who rely on the use of these specialized USB cameras.\n\nThank you",
