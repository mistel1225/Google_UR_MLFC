    "content": "I have had my Pixel 3a XL for a few months now. I have never dropped my device or have had any accidents. Just the regular daily wear and tear of putting in pocket. But, today my bottom speakers went out. No audio of some sort. I've tried everything, from playing music to streaming videos. You can only hear audio from the top speaker. \n\nThen I noticed, when I receive a phone call or text message, my notification sound or ringtone is muted on both speaker. Putting someone on Speakerphone during a call, cuts the audio. I've also went to the sound settings and checked the ringtone and notification sounds. Normally when you select a sound or tone, you would hear a preview of the selected sound. No sound either. \n\nSo I went onto the next step and factory reset my device. I figured it could be some software issues. After factory reset, bottom speaker is still not outputting any audio. Anyone else have this issue? What can I do to fix this problem. Thanks!",
