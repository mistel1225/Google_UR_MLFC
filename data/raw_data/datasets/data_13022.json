    "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nSo, idiot of the year, I somehow (I don't want to go into details) managed to put my phone in the microwave and turn it on without realizing my phone was there. IT was only for a few seconds, after which I got the phone out ASAP. It restarted and although 4G and bluetooth don't work it is still working on wifi.\n\nMy question regards safety. I am concerned that I released some kind of harmful gases or something with the phone (I'm a bit fixated on mercury for example). Can anyone tell me if I'm worrying too much?\n\nThanks, and again, I do accept how stupid I was!",
