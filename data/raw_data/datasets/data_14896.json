    "title": "Pixel 2 XL touch screen randomly stopped working, any way to fix?",
    "content": "A couple days ago I picket up my phone to put in my passcode and it said it was wrong.  Then soon after, incorrect numbers would be selected from what I was touching on the screen, then a bit later I could only scroll up and down, and then now nothing responds when I touch it.\n\nI tried restarting, swapped the sim card, and a factory reset and still not working.\n\nThere's a few other threads on this here and they all go to contact google for support, but all they do is tell me to pay them or one of their authorized dealers to get it fixed.  I shouldn't have to pay to fix what must be a software issue that could be fixed myself with the right support, so looking for some help on that here.",
