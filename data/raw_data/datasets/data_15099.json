    "title": "When I shake Pixel 3 up and down something inside moves and the phone reboots or turns off",
    "content": "Whatever is moving inside kinda feels like electronic vibration, but it is hard to tell. It definitely feels like something is moving up and down within the device. I took off the case and it still does it. And if I shake it hard enough, it reboots or shuts down completely. I haven't dropped it or anything like that, but I do use it for jogging and that's when it first occurred.",
