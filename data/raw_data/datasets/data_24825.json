    "content": "I am trying to use ScreenCast to cast to a Chromecast Dongle on my TV. \n(The dongle works fine with screen-casting from an iPad, where it shows as “Office TV”).\n\nWhen I tap on the Screen Cast button, Screen to Device” button on my Pixel phone, it just shows a heading saying “Cast screen to device” and a “Searching for devices...” with a blue circling “arrow” that never finds the Chromecast dongle.",
