    "content": "Recently I had done hard reset for my pixel 2 XL, after that I am able to view my photos from google photos app, Everytime it's downloading the photos from drive I mean my device is not saving the photos locally. If I want to access my photos either I need to have mobile data or WiFi.\nReally I am worrying about this device becoz to access my photos it needs internet connection and I am having restricted 5 GB data plan for monthly.\nPreviously I had apple device and never I faced these kind of issue.\n\nCan any one tell me how to disable this option and how can I keep my photos in my pixel XL 2.",
