    "content": "I am using a new pixel 4a5g that I just got this week\nWhile setting up today I started having problems with the google search. \nEvery time I open the search it crashes after a few seconds.\nI tried all the fixes I could find including clearing the cache and storage all the way to safe mode and deleting apps, but nothing seems to work\nAny help fixing this would be appreciated as this is very frustrating for a new phone",
