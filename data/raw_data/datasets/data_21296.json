    "content": "Major oversight. Face unlock in no way compares to fingerprint.\n\nI bought a pixel 4, but doubt I'll be able to use any biometrics on it. My employer blocks any facial recognition system wide already in favor of fingerprints. I don't think that is uncommon.\n\nMany banking or other secure apps, like password mangers, use fingerprint. No support for face unlock on any I've used.\n\nYou can unlock with a fingerprint in the dark with your face buried in a pillow. Try that with facial recognition.\n\nI just don't get it. Seriously, it's more than a few steps backwards. The only rationale can be that Google (and Apple) is trying to force implementation and adoption against consumer will.",
