    "content": "My Pixel 5's touch sounds, including locking and unlocking sounds, are barely audible now after the January update. I literally have to put my ear up to the bottom speakers to hear anything. FYI, my device had no previous sound issues before the update. I've tried troubleshooting with tech support several times with no solution found. Please advise.",
