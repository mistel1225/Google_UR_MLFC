    "content": "Issue with a brand new Pixel 4a. The speaker sounds bad, muffled, for phone calls on speakerphone but also for notification sounds, pretty much every sound. Is it just poor quality speaker (worst than a Pixel 3a or a Galaxy S7, previous phones used) or is the phone potentially defective? There is also a strange message popping up on duo about \"the microphone is not working\", even though it is working. Not sure if both issues are linked.\nI would not enjoy sending the phone back for repairs, so I'd like opinions first.\n\nThanks.",
