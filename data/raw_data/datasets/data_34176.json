    "content": "Unnecessary stuff and mistakes they made rushing this half finished os =\nHuge redundant headers in systems(the first time i clicked my txt msgs i was greeted by a huge header of \"messages\" that took 40% of screen) smh it also does this in nearly every menu...\nUgly white =obviously they tryin to hard\nVolume control = can no longer use touch screen to quickly adjust or navigate to volume(by tappin volume key and tappin screen or using drop down to adjust others)\nSpeaking of sound setting = another proof os only half finished, cannot adjust all sounds the phone makes(lock and charging noises) are ugly sounds and universal now no customization\nClock = specifically alarm settings...i cant make alarm loud from the start, it only sounds out gradually which for me makes it wholly ineffective\nLandscape home screen = i have this turned off(set to always vertical) but it still doesnt work properly when exiting or using recent apps from a landscape app it shifts from landscape to vertical erraticalky and also will mostly stay landscape this means unecessary slips and clicks making navigation a bich\nCan no longer turn off bing button completely(double tap is new setting instead of off, effective but my guess more unreliable settings)\nEssentially they made alot of good stuff into something worthless and/or cumbersome all to rush out an unfinished OS.. more proof that google is unconcerned with users and only wants the money",
