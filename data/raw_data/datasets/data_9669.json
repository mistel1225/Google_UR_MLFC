    "content": "While plugged in, my Pixel stops then starts charging multiple times. This is noticeable as you can feel/hear the vibration everytime it starts charging as if I just plugged in the device. If I'm lucky, I notice the battery icon not showing the charging symbol for a few seconds before it resumes charging again. I'm using the stock charger that it came with and tried other outlets with no help. I've charged other phones with the same charger and they don't have this problem.",
