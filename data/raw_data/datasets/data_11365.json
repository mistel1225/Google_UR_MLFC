    "content": "I have the tiktok app downloaded and this has an extension which allows me to set live photos/videos as wallpapers. I have this currently on as I want a live photo set for my lockscreen but when I set the live photo for my lockscreen, it makes it that I have to either put it for both my home screen and lockscreen or just the homescreen.\n\nSo I selected set both and then tried to change my home screen to a different photo but when I try to set a different photo for my home screen, the only options are either home screen and lockscreen or just lockscreen. \n\nWhat I want is the live photo on my lockscreen and a still photo on my home screen. Please help me.",
