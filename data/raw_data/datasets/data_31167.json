    "content": "I've been using gboard voice typing for Cantonese for the past 4 years\n\nBut something wierd happened last week. Voice dictation just stopped writing Chinese\n\nI Tried Chinese / Cantonese and Japanese\n\nTried re-starting, clearing cache on gboard app \n\nSame issue with another same exact phone (Pixel - Android version 9)\n\nIt seems whatever language I speak into, the system just recognizes it in English\n\nHas anyone experienced something similar?\n\nthanks",
