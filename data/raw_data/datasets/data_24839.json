    "content": "I have a pixel 3a xl. My only problem with it is my calling feature. Sometimes when I go to make a call It just goes silent and I don’t hear anything but my own echo. When I am in a call and another call comes in it will just freeze causing me to have to restart it, or it will hang up both calls or just the original call. I’ve taken it to the Verizon store in which they put a new SIM card in it, which did not fix it. They even tried resetting my network which also didn’t fix it. Verizon customer support has made me factory reset it 2 times the first time I reinstalled everything before I tested it out in which I was then instructed not to because it maybe apps causing my issue. The  Second time I didn’t reinstall anything not even my google account. However neither factor reset fix my issue. There’s no particular pattern when it does it, it just happens at random with different people calling me. I really believe that it’s an internal issue. Has this happened to anybody else. Is there anything I can do about this?",
