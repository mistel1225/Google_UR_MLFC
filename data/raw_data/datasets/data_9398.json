    "content": "Starting last night pictures taken on my Pixel 2 are not saved on the phone anymore. If I try to click the thumbnail image on the right after taking the picture it closes the camera app and opens the Google Photos app.\n\nI already tried booting in safe mode, deleting cache for both camera app and Google Photos app, restoring camera app to original version, etc. Nothing works. \n\nVideo is also broken - i can start recording but as soon as I press stop the Camera app crashes and I'm taken to the homescreen\n\nThe camera itself works, I managed to take a picture in Whatsapp  and send it in the app.\n\nAny help much appreciated, as you can guess this is a huhe problem for me...",
