    "content": "Hello! I have two original pixel phones. They both were on Android Q b4 and they went bricked tomorrow night :( \nThe fist one has a bootloop. I can got to fastboot but can not flash it with factory image because bootloader wasn't unlocked also I can not got to recovery mode (it just reboots all the time).\nThe second one is completely dead :( I can not turn it on. I got only short vibration and nothing happens. In windows device manager it detects as Qualcomm 9008. I haven't found any repair solution over the Internet. Maybe there are some software which can repair my phones? \nI live in Ukraine and as I see there are no official service centers for RMA or something :(\nHow can I get my phones to work?\nThank you!",
