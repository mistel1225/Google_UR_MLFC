    "content": "Hello,\n\nI am having Bluetooth connection issues with my Pixel 3 XL after the Android 10 update. Google Music will not play in my car (Camry 2017) after the Android 10 update via Bluetooth. It used to run fine before, but now it will not connect. Phone calls work, but no music. \n\nI have forgotten the device in my car and deleted it in my phone and tried to diagnose it by reconnecting and repairing a device, I've turned my phone on in safe mode to connect and no luck.\n\nAny advice would be appreciated. \n\nThanks you,",
