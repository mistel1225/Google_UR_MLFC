    "content": "The device worked fine until a few months ago. The UI started freezing at random to the point that I could not even receive calls. Have updated everything and even done a factory reset. Problem persists now freezing at different times. Now phone also randomly shuts off. I have seen several posts on this but none seem to have been answered satisfactorily. Really hope fix is coming soon as the devise is currently entirely useless.",
