    "content": "I recently ordered a pixel 4a from the google store on the 26th Oct. On the delivery tracking page, it says estimated delivery time is 11 - 12 November however, my father decided to order another one for himself today and I saw the checkout page and it stated that the estimated delivery time is 5 - 6 November (we live together btw so the delivery is to the same location) so which estimated delivery day is correct I'm really confused right now ?",
