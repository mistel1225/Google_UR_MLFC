    "content": "I have tried ordering Pixel 4A at 8 pin codes in Delhi NCR. I thought I was the only one facing the issue. When I reported the same on Flipkart, the seller did not respond to my message. They deleted my review regarding order stating that it is spam. I don't know if I should buy the substandard Nord. Does anyone know how long should we expect to wait till we can order?",
