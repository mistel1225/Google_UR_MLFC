    "content": "Hi,\n\nI recently noticed that my Pixel 2 xl is not getting recognized or detected on connecting to a Computer and a Android Auto device. Previously it was working fine in both cases.\nI even tried changing the usb cable and connecting to multiple devices. But charging is working fine and earphones are also working through the usb port.\nI also did a factory reset, but the issue still persists. Can anyone help me with this issue.",
