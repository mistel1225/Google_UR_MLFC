    "content": "I am having a routine issue with my Pixel 3XL not responding to my voice anymore. This happens to me on a regular (as in, once per day), and the only thing that works is to turn the phone off and back on. I've gone to customer service a couple of times on it. They run me through the same process over and over again (like deleting everything and re-installing). However, it keeps happening. In fact, it is becoming more frequent. It doesn't appear to be a settings issue. Any suggestions?",
