    "content": "I've tried manually rebooting. Fixes the issue for a couple minutes before the whole cycle begins again. \n\n I've tried a factory reset. Same problem. \n\nScreen is not cracked, broken, scratched, blemished in any way. Removed my screen protector. Nothing wrong with my fingers. Still have normal, human fingers. \n\nIf I leave the phone plugged in to a power source it seems to solve the issue temporarily. \n\nWill test if something like USB-C headphones also works and update when I know.",
