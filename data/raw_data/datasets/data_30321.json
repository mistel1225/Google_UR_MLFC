    "content": "So at the moment I am trying to add new topics to my discovery page and I am currently unable to. I have done this before and even been able to search what I wanted to have shown but now I can't find it anywhere! And when I go into the customise section they only give me selections rather the option to search. Wether this is a new to the phone I don't know but it's just pretty annoying if anything.\n\nThanks heaps!\n- James",
