    "content": "Hello,\n\nI have a Pixel 2 phone which worked perfectly before the last system update.\nRight after the update both front and back cameras stopped working. I'm saying it's after the system update because I've tried rolling back the camera software without any result. Phone was not rooted or modified in any way, did not suffer falls or anything like that. All in all, right after the system update the cameras stopped working.\n\nIt seems I have similar issues with a lot of other people on the support forum. \nI have tried:\n- cleaning lens & laser (no effect, duh)\n- restarting the phone\n- clearing the app's cache\n- updating the apps\n- uninstalling / rolling back the apps and reinstalling\n- started the phone in safe mode\n- sacrificing a lamb (didn't help, but it staved my hunger)\n\nHow should I proceed?\n\nThanks and Regards,\n\nBrad",
