    "content": "So I have a portable projector that runs on battery power. It has Miracast and Airplay built in but good old Google don't allow Pixel's to use Miracast any more. I get that a Chromecast is required, however as I want to use the projector as a portable device I am unsure if this will work due to lack of power / wifi etc. Does anyone know of any workarounds / apps that solve this issue???",
