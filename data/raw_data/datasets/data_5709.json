    "content": "My pixel 3a's battery is swollen right after completion of warranty period. When I contacted google support, all they offered was a paid service from b2x. I do not understand how am I responsible for swollen battery on a phone, for which I had to spend a lot. That too, I'm not a heavy user of the phone. I'm really disappointed with the kind of support from google, being a big fan of its cameras. I really don't know whether I want to proceed with paid support and I'm gonna rethink about recommending google phones to anyone in future.",
