    "content": "Recently I notice some kind of defect on my Pixel 3 screen. I see some dark pixels near the top right rounded corner, right around the rounded corner. The top right corner doesnt look like the other 3 rounded corners, and has some dead pixels which form like a crescent shape that encroach into the home screen. It's subtle and I haven't seen it before, and it doesn't go away.  I am also not referring to the screen clipping/rounding that I observe when I switch on the phone. This is observed when I am at the home screen and doesn't go away.",
