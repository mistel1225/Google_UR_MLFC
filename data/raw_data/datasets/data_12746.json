    "content": "I did not receive a Pixel 5 phone I ordered that was supposed to arrive \"Oct 29-30\". Tracking info through Canada Post is invalid and shows \"Multiple Pin\". I tried to chat with Google support to know where the package is (or to get a delivery estimate), and they hung up on me twice (once I didn't even get to say \"hi\"). Very rude. I tried calling but cannot talk to a human \"because of COVID\". Overall a terrible buying experience.\n\nHow do you get support from Google?",
