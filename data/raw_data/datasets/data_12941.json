    "title": "Sound Issue: Repetitive popping/tapping sound in audio of video and voice recordings",
    "content": "Whenever I record anything with audio, either video recording or just voice recording there is a repetitive clicking/ tapping noise that comes up.  The noise repeats itself in 4 or 5 times and then stops. It's really annoying and has ruined all of my recordings.\n\nI have tested in safe mode,  done a factory reset and the noise still appears.  Please help. I was starting to enjoy this phone until this issue came up.\n\nUPDATE: After going through all the troubleshooting steps, the support team decided to send a replacement phone. I have received replacement phone but it is also experiencing the same sound issue.\n\nExample of sounds here",
