    "content": "This notification's sound can't be turned off, and even if I turn on the DND, it will still make noises and very loud.\nCan you separate the sound volume for Ring & notification?\nI don't even have audible notification, but why the sound will be turned on automatically when you are on a phone call? it's very loud and distractive!!! pls fix this, at least give us option to mute it!",
