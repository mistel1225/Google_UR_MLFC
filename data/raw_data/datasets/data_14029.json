    "content": "I first noticed this issue when my Samsung gear S3 smartwatch kept randomly disconnecting from my pixel 4 xl. It happens so much, that I ended up purchasing a fossil q watch. After about a day of using the watch, it started disconnecting as well. I was so confused, but then one time, I swipe down the notification bar to see the quick settings, and I saw the Bluetooth illuminated button, turn off, then turn on about a second later. I have since seen it a few times with my eyes. I have factory resetted and even tried deleting apps that I thought could create the issue, but it has not been solved period is very frustrating, when my devices just randomly disconnect and I don't get notifications or it interrupts my music for a short time. Has anyone had this issue or have a fixed to it? Thank you.",
