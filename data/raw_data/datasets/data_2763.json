    "content": "I downloaded the google fit app on my phone because I got an email saying I can measure my heart rate using the camera. When I looked up how to do it online, all I found was I had to hit the add button under heart rate. I don't have the add button. Why can't I measure my heart rate on my pixel 5?",
