    "content": "In the last day or two my Beats will connect to the phone, and I can listen to audio, but won't work when I try to make or answer calls. The phone isn't even giving me the option to allow calls with this, or any other, Bluetooth device. Thoughts? Everything was working fine until a couple days ago.",
