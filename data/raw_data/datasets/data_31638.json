    "content": "in the last few days my phone has stopped texting certain contacts (i know of two contacts so far). i haven't changed anything to their profile. it doesn't even say failed to send, just nothing happens. \nI have tried deleting contacts and re-entering them. i have tried their numbers without country codes, and i have cleared my messages cache.",
