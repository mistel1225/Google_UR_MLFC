    "content": " I rode a Megabus in April 2019 and used the onboard wifi. Ever since, whenever I try to login to a wifi network on my phone, instead of redirecting to, e.g. Starbucks or Hampton Inn or whatever for login, it redirects to Megabus and I cannot then log in to the other wifi. It's extremely annoying, and I've tried everything I can think of (or Google) to fix it. Any advice?",
