    "title": "How do I reduce the size of the system files?",
    "content": "My google pixel 3a has always had a large system file size, never less than 10GB (which is ridiculous but I've come to accept it :/ ) but recently it ballooned to 20GB. Look, there is no excuse for a third of the devices storage being unusable, they advertise 64GB, not 40GB. I've already seen plenty of people say it's not possible to reduce the size of the system files. So I'm not looking for a way to do that (unless somethings changed and it's now possible). I'm wandering if there's a way to load a smaller version of android onto the device, and if so, has anyone had success with this?\n\nI really don't know how this is not a bigger issue, frankly something needs to change here, but that's up to Google. As for me, i just need to be able to download more than a few apps and a movie or two on netflix.",
