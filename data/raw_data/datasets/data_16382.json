    "content": "Hi - I've had my Google Pixel 3a for about 3 weeks now. When left standing. it shows the time, date and battery percentage (still 53%) clearly on a black screen but as soon as I try to unlock with my fingerprint, it vibrates then nothing happens or it lets me enter my pass code only to return to a black screen. \n\nOccasionally the screen flashes green/white and comes up with what appears to be an error code message but it disappears too quickly to be able to read.... so confused as it was working fine and this happened suddenly - has had no water damage or other damage of any kind! \n\nHave tried re-starting the phone both generally and in safe mode (I think, although it's hard to tell with no working screen). Really grateful for your thoughts/suggestions!",
