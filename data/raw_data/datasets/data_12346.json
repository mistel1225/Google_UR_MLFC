    "content": "Hello,\nMy Android language is Ukrainian, which is not supported in Assistant.\nHow can I start using the Assistant in English, without switching the Android language?\nI added English to language settings of Assistant, but the Voice Match option is disabled and grayed out, because my phone language is Ukrainian.\nIf switching the phone to English is my only option, I will do that for now, but please tell me, when this bug is going to be fixed.\nThank you, looking forward for your answer.",
