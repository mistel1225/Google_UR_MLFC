    "content": "I recently got the new Pixel 5 & copied all my data from my old Pixel 2XL. However, when I opened my messages app to see if an archived text string was still available it was not. I would like to have this conversation I had on my previous Pixel 2XL copied onto my new Pixel 5. I have tried the transferring apps but have had no luck.",
