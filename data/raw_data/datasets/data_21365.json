    "title": "Insane battery drain on google pixel 3",
    "content": "My google pixel 3 is brand new (3.5 months) and was working perfectly until this morning. After I left home for work on 100% it drained to 0% within 3 hours of limited use. At the current rate it is draining 1% battery every 2 minutes of not touching the phone at all. The phone is extremely hot and overheats within seconds of use. It only seems to charge when I turn off the phone, otherwise the battery continues to drain while charging the phone.\n\nThe circled blue parts are the crazy battery drain within a few hours. It doesn't seem like the apps are using up much of the battery. One day ago my battery life was extremely good and completely normal, please help!\nI have tried restarting my phone in safe mode, checking the app updates but nothing seems to work.\n\nThank you!",
