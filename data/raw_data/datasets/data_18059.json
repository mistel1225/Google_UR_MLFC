    "content": "Hello, \n\nI leave my phone charging overnight wirelessly (using the 10W Xiaomi wireless charger) just to find the next day that it has less battery than I left it with, one day I even got my phone at 67%.\n\nThe thing is, once it reaches 100% he starts discharging, but won't fuel back up. In the battery settings I can see the message \"Not charging\" after it reaches the full battery. \n\nThat's frustrating since this was one of the main reason why I picked this phone.\n\nDo you know why this happens? Is there any way to fix it?",
