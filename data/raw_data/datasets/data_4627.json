    "title": "Fingerprint sensor is not working properly",
    "content": "After having issues unlocking with a fingerprint and trying obvious solutions like cleaning the sensor and my fingers, I deleted the existing fingerprint  to add a new entry. \n\nBut I couldn't finish the process because it fails to register my fingerprint most of the time and the process gets cancelled.\n\nI think this might be a hardware issue as the fingerprint was not working optimally from the start and now it's not usable at all.\n\nAny help would be appreciated.\n\nThanks,\nTemesgen",
