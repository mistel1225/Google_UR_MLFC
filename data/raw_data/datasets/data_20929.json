    "content": "Hello. I recently moved to Google Pixel 3a and have found that when I use the search function within the Contacts App I am not able to open the contact and see details. If I scroll through contacts I can press a contact and view the entry. When using search however pressing the contact only offers the options to voice call, video call, message and history. Long pressing the contact brings up a menu to either copy number or edit number before calling. \n\nEssentially it seems that the only way to edit or view contacts is to scroll through to the entry you want. Using search only allows you to contact the contact, not view the entry. \n\nAm I missing something?",
