    "content": "This is increasingly discouraging. It just blares in my ear every time I use it and impinges on other people in the room.\n\nI used to be able to turn the sound off by turning down Media Volume, though that was also frustrating since then I had to turn it back up whenever I wanted to listen to music or podcasts.\n\nNow it is even worse. I can only turn it off when I press Do Not Disturb. If I forget to turn it back on after using voice to text, I miss phone calls, texts, everything. I use voice to text throughout the day so whenever I'm writing something, my phone is effectively off.\n\nPlease, please can't we just turn down this sound?!\n\n(This was addressed on an earlier post. The answer was to turn off Switch Access. I never had Switch Access on in the first place, so this hasn't helped:  \n\"How do I mute the ding ding sound when you hit the voice to text button at the top right\" https://support.google.com/assistant/thread/31523011/how-do-i-mute-the-ding-ding-sound-when-you-hit-the-voice-to-text-button-at-the-top-right?hl=en )\n(This issue has also been addressed on other websites and on Reddit. Android Stack Exchange shows a way but it involves gaining root access to the phone, which would be nice to avoid: https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/128588/how-do-i-disable-the-google-voice-typing-voice-search-ding-sound#:~:text=on%20the%20Activity%20Bar%20you,%22Mute%20audio%22%20check%20it. )",
