    "content": "Because my phone stopped working i called straight talk. I was informed that after their new update January 2021 to VoLTE my pixel 3xl will no longer work. I contacted google and was told the phone was VoLTE ready and should work just fine. After 1 more discussion with each party Google told me to get into the testing screen. There is a greyed out VoLTE provision line with on/off button. Does anyone know what I can do to prevent this phone being a paperweight? Thanks in advance",
