    "content": "All\nI broke the screen on my phone ~10th of August 2020. I finally figured out a way to get some help from google and a representative from the company came over and took my phone to get it repaired on the 16th of August. I understand these are the Covid times and resources in the office are scarce. Because of this I really did not follow up and my phone was finally delivered to be on the 12 of September (new phone). However, when I was setting up the phone, I realised that they have given me a 64GB variant, where as I owned the 128GB variant. I brought this to the notice of their support team on Monday, 14th September and all also supported all the supporting docs that they requested from me. 4 days on, i am being kept in the dark and no one is able to give me a concrete date on when I will get my actual phone back. I have written several emails, but I end up getting a standard response saying that it is being looked into and that they will get back to me if they need more information. I am honestly sick of the wait.\nCan any  one here please help me with an escalation contact so I can have this issue resolved at the earliest? This is really not the kind of service I expected from Google, especially after I moved from Apple. where such issues are very easily resolved.\n\nThanks,\nAkhil Baliga",
