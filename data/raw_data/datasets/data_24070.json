    "title": "Pixel 2 keeps overheating and freezing. Will not work unless I cool it down. Now it freezes without it being hot.",
    "content": "I have done the safe mode thing, tried checking through apps to see which one might be giving issues, i have plenty of space on my phone, i don't leave my screen bright at all, I don't want to do the factory reset on it because i have done it before on a previous phone and not everything was backed up and i lost important stuff. But it overheats quick and the screen freezes and I can't touch anything on the screen. So I would have to cool it down by putting it in the fridge or leaving in front of the AC and then I have to force reset it and then it will go back to normal for about 20 minutes and then it's the same thing again.",
