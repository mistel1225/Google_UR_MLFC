    "content": "My Android auto is no longer working on My Chevy Link.  I've tried rebooting in safe mode, doing a factory restart on my car stereo system, I've tried different cords, uninstalling and reinstalling the Android auto app, unpairing and repairing my phone to the car.  My wife's samsung and my daughter's iPhone both sync up immediately with no problems.",
