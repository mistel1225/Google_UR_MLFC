    "title": "Pixel 4 XL \"Google Stopped Working\" message",
    "content": "Certain apps are working fine: Maps, Instagram, FB, Snapchat, Fitbit... all fine.\nHOWEVER: Gmail, Google search, Google Assistant, UA Map My Walk... don't open at all, and GOOGLE STOPPED WORKING message appears.  When my phone is idle, the message just randomly appears.\nI have: restarted the phone; powered off and waited an hour; gone through settings > Google (cannot go further than this); gone through Google Play > Google > Uninstall > Reinstall (same message appears, can't go further); removed SIM card and reinstalled (nothing changed).  I would rather not do a factory reset, as I'm unsure that would even fix my issue.\n\nThis phone was purchased in Nov 2019, it's only 5 months old, in excellent condition.\nNot sure what the next steps are.  Any help is greatly appreciated.",
