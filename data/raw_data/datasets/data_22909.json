    "content": "When my phone alarm went off, instead of the normal alarm, it was a shrill noise that can only be described as screeching, like some sort of horrible dial up tone. Before I had gone to bed, my speakers were working fine, and all my phone had done was sit on a table for 9 hours. I tried opening Spotify and playing music, and all that played was staticy crackling noises. It was super weird, so I turned on my Bluetooth headphones. The music played fine. I disconnected my Bluetooth headphones. My phone speakers started to work fine. Why did this happen? How can I ensure it won't happen again? I don't appreciate being woken up to the sound of a machine being murdered.",
