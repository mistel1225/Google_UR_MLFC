    "title": "Pixel 4XL selfie photos are distorted, by some lens correction or not other processing of the photo.",
    "content": "While taking Pixel 4XL selfie photos using front camera, the final picture is significantly distorted or processed resulting in unnatural face distortions. Looks like some squashed fisheyes lense.\nThere is visible difference between live picture preview on camera display and final photo after processing.\n\nHow to turn this processing off, there is no such switch available. This does not happen when using the back end higher resolution camera.",
