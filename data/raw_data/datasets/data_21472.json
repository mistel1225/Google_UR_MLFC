    "content": "Does anybody recognize this icon in my status bar, between the WiFi and battery? It just started appearing and disappearing occasionally. It's where the cell data icon usually is, so is it some kind of cell network or SIM card problem?\n\nI've checked all the lists of status bar icons I can find. I can't even tell what it's supposed to be depicting.",
