    "content": "The update was working fine. It was showing when my messages were sent delivered or read. It would show the three dots when someone was typing.\nBut now it doesn't show the three dots and it doesn't say anything about it being sent delivered or read, it just shows SMS.\nI uninstalled the updates and reinstalled them, restarted my phone and It work for like 5 minutes before going back to SMS again.\n\n\nYes, the people I'm messaging have the update on their phones and their phone is working correctly and everything's fine on their end with the update.",
