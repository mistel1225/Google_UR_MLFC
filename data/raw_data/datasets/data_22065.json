    "content": "So I recently had my phone screen fixed,\n\nAfter getting it back it appears to work okay, I can use everything, make/take calls, etc.\n\nHowever, upon turning the screen off and turning it on again, the screen doesn't work correctly every time I touch the screen it registers it as if I'm swiping down on the screen and I have to power it off completely for it to work correctly again.",
