    "content": "Now two months in a row, my provider phone company registers 4 tot 8gb of data usage in one night, giving me very high bills. \nI barely use my data anymore, except for when I am at work where the wifi connection is bad, and that is four hours a week. Besides that, I always have my data switched off and wifi connection on. When I called my provider to tell them hat I cannot find any evidence of large data usage on my phone and that my data roaming was switched off as soon as I got  the message that I almost used up all of my data, they tell me this is just the usage that my phone registers and that they cannot see what caused it. According to them my phone is the problem and I should send it back to the phone company for a reset. \nThen I thought that maybe I have some sort of malware on my phone but when I scanned for this, the scanner couldn't find anything unusual.\nMy question for you is if anyone knows where the problem lays, is the phone company at fault or is this an issue of my phone and do I just need to reset my phone?",
