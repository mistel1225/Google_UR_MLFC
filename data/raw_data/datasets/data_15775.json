    "content": "I have Nova Launcher, and Android 11 keeps forgetting which launcher to use (about every 20-30 minutes). After that time, it brings up a menu asking which launcher to use the next two I use the Home button. I select Nova Launcher and the \"Always\" setting, but it does it again after 20-30 minutes of use.\n\nAndroid 11 on a Pixel 4a\nSeptember security update",
