    "title": "Many times, caller is not able to hear me (on a normal call )",
    "content": "Many times, when I make or receive a call, the other person is not able to hear me and sometimes it is the way round as well. I try calling again, and in 3rd or sometimes in 4th attempt, it works fine. Throughout the day, I face this issue with 70% of calls. Strange thing is, this issue is faced only while making a normal call (i.e. over a cellular network carrier) and no such issue has ever been faced while talking over whatsapp call. \nPlease help in solving my problem.",
