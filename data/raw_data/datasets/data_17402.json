    "content": "I am trying to import a single Google Pixel 3XL into Peru. The Peruvian telecommunications agency needs a \"broadcast\" declaration related to the models' channels for the emergency broadcast system. I have attached a similar statement that I found for a different model, when it was made by HTC. I need something similar from Foxconn or Google related to the 3XL. Does anyone know how to obtain this?",
