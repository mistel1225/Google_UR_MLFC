    "content": "My front camera has been buzzing and static when I use it, on any app. It's as if something is vibrating inside. I notice this is a common hardware failure in the Google Pixel 3, unfortunately I didn't know before purchasing it end of 2019. I've tried contacting Google and sending them feedback on Twitter etc but no response. My Tips & Support section in my phone does not have any \"Phone Chat\" option. I've tried everything and the issue seems to be getting worse. I bought this phone via Amazon UK when I was there but I'm in Malaysia now, and the nearest Google office is in Singapore. I'm worried to send the phone back to the UK retailer because of the current COVID situation.\n\nPlease tell me how to solve this issue!",
