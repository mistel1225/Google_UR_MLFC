    "content": "Just like the Pixel 5 users out there, my Pixel 4 XL has been stuck on Widevine L3 for the longest time now.  How is this still not fixed yet, what's going on?  Are there other P4 users with the same issue?  I don't understand enough about the DRM to understand if it is affecting other apps, but it certainly affects Netflix.  What's the point of the high res screen on this phone if I'm stuck on SD-only content quality?",
