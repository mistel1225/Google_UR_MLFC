    "content": "Spent many hours with support.  Phone won't charge, spoke to support twice - they still want to send me a refurbished phone.  This phone is a little over a month old, I want a new phone, not a refurbished.  Is this really how Google stands behind their devices and their customers??  Google - please tell me this is not how you stand behind what you make, and your customers that invest in your products.",
