    "content": "Have a Google Pixel first gen (Sailfish 5\"; serial no. starting with FA722â€¦) purchased back in April 2017. \nWarranty expired, got the latest A10 ugrade in late December and since a week, the device started to act \"funny\": phone not ringing, deaf calls, no sounds, mic not working and the phone freezes and crashes when a call gets in. \nA phone restart seems to sometimes make things right again, but only for a very short time. \nAlso, a \"battery drain\" problem has suddendly appeared. I tried factory reset, but to no avail. \nReading a number of articles in the Community Support gave me the impression \"it could be\" a hardware problem, but need some hard evidence to corroborate that impression. \nAny help will be welcome: would love to fix the little guy and keep it. \nCheers.",
