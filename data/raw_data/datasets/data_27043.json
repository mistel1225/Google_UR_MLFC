    "title": "Pixel 3 XL Assistant Permissions Not Saving",
    "content": "So when I attempt to do the \"ok Google, set a reminder to X\" it says \"ok let me get some more information\" and pops up the thing saying it needs more permissions. I click \"Turn On\" the necessary permissions, try again, and it immediately does the same thing over. Have tried rebooting, turning assistant off and on, and no joy. Any assistance is much appreciated.",
