    "title": "Over the last 3 weeks my pixel has factory resetted twice. I turn my phone on and then it happens",
    "content": "I turn my phone on and an error message appears, the options I have is try again or factory reset. I click try again and it boots in safe mode, and have no choice to factory reset anyway because my apps won't work. It's happened twice in the last 3 weeks. I wouldn't mind if it was restarting, but factory reset means I have to link up to my car, home, headphones, WiFi all over again. And then I have to load up all my apps again too. My apps aren't even saved on my playstore in the library, I've been using Google for 5 years now. It's ridiculous!!!",
