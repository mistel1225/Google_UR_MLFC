    "content": "Hi there!\n\nA coworker in my company as the following issue: while using bluetooth to connect with his car, the phone just suddenly restarts by itself into recovery mode. That's not something that happens automatically or just after connecting, and doesn't happen all the time. Some days it's while driving to work, some while driving back home... Some days he has no issues at all. \nIt's more of a bother than a real problem, as he mostly just listens music, but sometimes in Spotify, but sometimes it happens while on a call, too. And driving on the Autobahn is really not the time to be exiting recovery mode and entering your PIN again xD \nI literally found nothing like this on Google, has any of you had something like that? \n\nBest regards,\nCarlos \n\nP.S.: He really doesn't want to go through all the trouble of reseting his phone and, having that issue, I'm not sure either whether just copying it to a new one or backing it up and restoring it afterwards would solve it.",
