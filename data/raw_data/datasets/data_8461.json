    "content": "There is a very annoying bug while playing games (different games). This issue appeared in Android 11. The status bar (where the clock, battery and network indications are) overrides the game. I can't get rid of it and it takes space of my screen. I can't click anything behind this bar. It goes away when I restart the game. See the grey bar in the screenshot. It really affects the game and I hate it big time. I can't play normally anymore.",
