    "title": "Pixel 3 XL back panel side cracking open",
    "content": "My phone's back cover seems to be coming loose on one side (the side with the power and volume buttons). While the corners and other 3 sides are still nice and tight, the center of this one side keeps cracking open by 1mm. \n\nI have tried pushing it together again and while it is possible to close it with pressure, it will just crack open again slowly in a minute. I guess it might be just a mechanical issue but it is really strange that it cannot be closed up. I suspect the battery might be bulged in there or something as I have seen this back cover issue with some Samsung phones when the battery went bad.\n\nI have no other issues with the phone. While the battery does not last well, it does not seem to be in too bad a shape from the usability standpoint yet. The phone has not had any major drops, there are no cracks or dents or anything on it really. \n\nIs it possible to get this fixed under warranty and is this the best course of action? Please advise.\n\nI bought the Pixel 3 XL in 2018 November from a UK online store and got it delivered to an EU country where Google does not sell Pixel phones online directly. I do not think there are any companies here which offer warranty services for Google Pixel phones, so it looks like sending it to Google directly is my only choice.\n\nSo again, do you have any advice in this situation?\nThank you.",
