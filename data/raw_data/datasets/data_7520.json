    "title": "Taking screenshots isn't allowed by the app or your organization after upgrading to Android 11",
    "content": "Since updating to Android 11, I cannot take screenshots anymore. The screenshot is taken but then the notification appears stating that \"Taking screenshots isn't allowed by the app or your organization.\"\n\nThis happens all the time no matter where I try to screenshot, even when screenshoting the desktop. There is no G Suite account set up in the phone, so there is no organization that could prevent screenshotting. Also the new feature of screen recoding works without issues.\n\nI've tried restarting the phone several times, it didn't help.",
