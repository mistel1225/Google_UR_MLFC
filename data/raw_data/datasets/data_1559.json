    "content": "Several times per day, my Pixel 4a suddenly says I have no sim card and can only make emergency calls. A few months ago, I addressed this with TMobile and they provided me with a new sim card. However, the issue keeps happening and is now also happening on my husband's Pixel. I've seen several people post on this forum about this issue, but those threads seem to be closed with no answer. \n\nHas anyone had any luck with a permanent fix for this? Restarting my phone only works temporarily.",
