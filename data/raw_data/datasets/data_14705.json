    "content": "Hi,\n\nI've had issues with my Pixel 3a and after almost 12 hours of non-stop calls with support, I reached a supervisor who promised to send me a new device since I am beyond frustrated with the Pixel phones. I want to note that this is my 16th replacement between the original Pixel, Pixel 2 and the 3a. \nI just got an email saying a refurbished was being sent. \nAt this point my case is assigned to some Shawn and he is responding to emails every 2 days and is giving me the same story about how good a refurbished device is. I sent multiple emails to him asking him to call me or reassign the case to someone else or drop it if he cant, but he just keeps asking more questions.\nThe refurbished replacement that was sent 3 weeks ago, is not even starting up and I am running on the original pixel whose battery lasts 2 hours since full charge.  I tried calling support but after placing me on hold for an hour they tell me to reach out to Shawn who again is bluntly ignoring my requests to reassign the case or take this over a phone call. \n\nI need to know how I can get this escalated to someone OTHER THAN SHAWN. \n\nVery frustrated customer,\n\nPavani.",
