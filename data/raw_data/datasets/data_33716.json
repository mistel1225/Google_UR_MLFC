    "content": "Hi.\nI was chatiting through my pixel and all of a sudden it did a shut down like battery would have ended. Phone  had just been charged full night and it said it had full battery. \nTried to restart it, but all it does is vibrate, gives me a full battery icon, usually flashes a strip of light through the screen and goes dark. All outside accessories have been removed doing this.\n\nIt's about a year old Pixel 1, 128 gb, every offered update has been downloaded and it is still fully intact.",
