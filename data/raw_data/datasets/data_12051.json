    "content": "My proximity sensor has never worked up until I got the android 11 update, then it started working for a couple of weeks, now it's stopped again, and now my auto rotate doesn't work anymore either. Or the double tap or squeeze.\n\nIs there a simple way to fix it? I love my pixel 3 but this is extremely annoying.",
