    "content": "The battery is running hotter the past few days before it died. I've been in contact with the default google pixel support for a few weeks up to this Sunday, but since they claim to be based in the US and my phone is bought in Australia, they couldn't help me more.\n\nWhen I contacted pixel support on Friday, I was told to wait around 24-48 hours for an email from the Australian support, but I have yet to receive any.\n\nAs for the physical phone itself, it doesn't lit up at all when plugged in, nor does it show a low battery icon when I tried to turn it on.",
