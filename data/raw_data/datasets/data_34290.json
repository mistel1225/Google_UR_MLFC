    "title": "Is there a way to activate LTE Band 8 on the Pixel XL?",
    "content": "I'm using my Pixel XL in South Korea with a Korean SIM card. The phone works flawlessly when accessing the internet or calling but some places here indoors are another issue. At my job in a building, my phone can show full LTE service but when I do receive a call or try dialing out; calls drop and phone shows \"H\" service. However, I can access the internet or stream just fine with the LTE service indoors. Other people carry on conversations sitting right next to me so this is a little frustrating. I've been told it's because my phone is not operating on certain LTE bands. I've done some research and found that I may not have the LTE B8 (900) activated, is this the potential cause?",
