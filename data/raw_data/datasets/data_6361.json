    "title": "My adaptor doesn't work because the power went off",
    "content": "When the power went off in our home, my charger was plugged in and i didn't remove it. And all the phone chargers in our house were plugged in too: 3 iphone adaptors and my ipad's adaptor. I'm the only one who has a pixel phone.\nWhen the power came back i heard a sound coming from my charger. When i tried to charge my phone, the power brick didn't work but the cable and the converter socket do work normally.\nAlso, all the other apple chargers work normally unlike mine.\nI live in Tunisia we have 220V and my phone is from Canada and all the other phones are from Canada too, that's why i use a converter because our outlets are the European ones.",
