    "content": "So yesterday my phone just went blank. It hadn't dropped or chipped. Some time after the phone got this pink hue on it and it has been like that since. The screen is still on in the sense I can hear notifications and buttons. But there's no way I can do things on it or restart it.  Since the chat and service lines are shut down. Not sure what I should do.",
