    "title": "Pixel 2XL keeps displaying message saying \"Your Device is Corrupt\"",
    "content": "My Pixel 2XL just randomly started freezing and turning off every now and then for a couple of weeks. Then for the past 24 hours my phone keeps restarting to a screen displaying the text \"Your device is corrupt. It can't be trusted and may not work properly\" It happens more often when I plug in my phone to charge. When I unplug the phone from charge it usually boots back to normal for a couple of hours before returning to this screen. I tried to initiate a factory reset but when attempted it took me right back to the error page. When attempted to be booted into recovery it keeps displaying the error message. What is my best course of action? Thanks in advance",
