    "content": "Hello,\nI bought a new Pixel 2 on Aliexpress.\n\nThere was a problem with the screen, periodically it does not work correctly. It appears in the following:\n\n1. Random clicks.\nI need to enter a numeric code on my unlock screen. And always, when the phone is charging, for example, when entering the code to unlock, you press a number, and it is squeezed twice or with it, another 1-2 random numbers are pressed. It is always observed when the phone is charging and occasionally when not on charge.\n\n2. Spontaneous swipes in different directions.\nThe problem is clearly visible on the deviceâ€™s unlock screen. Earlier I had a graphic code. And now you call the unlock screen, you still do not start to draw the code, and the lines are already randomly drawn. If by some miracle it is possible to unlock the phone, then you see a twitchy screen. Like if you hold the screen and swipe it up and down very quickly. If you are on the main screen, some application may spontaneously open.\nIt lasts about 5 minutes, then the phone returns to normal.\n\nAny ideas how to diagnose and fix this? Thanks in advance.",
