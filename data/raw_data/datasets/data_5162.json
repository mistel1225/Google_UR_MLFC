    "title": "Horizontal level detector is off by 19 degrees",
    "content": "When taking a picture in landscape mode, the horizontal level indicator is out of level by 8-10 degrees.  I believe that the internal detector needs to be recalibrated or reset, but I can't find any setting to do this.\n\nNote, this is not just the camera setting.  Other apps that use the sensor misreport \"level\" as well.",
