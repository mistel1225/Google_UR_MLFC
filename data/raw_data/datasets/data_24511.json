    "content": "Since the April update for Pie, tapping a notification for any app (Facebook, Amazon, Weather, etc.) is supposed to open the associated app within seconds but it is taking a whole minute or even longer sometimes, if it ever opens. Sometimes, they never open. Reboot makes no difference and, as I said, it has only been since the April update.",
