    "content": "I'm experiencing the same battery problems that are being reported far and wide. I've gone as far as performing the factory reset and spent half the day getting my apps reconfigured. It worked for a while but the battery drain issue came back.\n\nYesterday I had a Mophie mobile charger with me to try and make it through the day. The Mophie is rated at 14 hours. The Pixel 3 XL drained the Mophie dead in 3 hours. \n\nModerators... please don't give me a list of common things to check. This is clearly a problem with Android 10 and Pixel devices. As people accept the upgrade more and more reports flow in. \n\nAs a constant traveler that relies on this device for business, this is a horrible situation. We need communication from Google that this is being addressed",
