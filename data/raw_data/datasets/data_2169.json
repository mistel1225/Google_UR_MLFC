    "content": "I want to add an eSIM to my Pixel 5, but I don't have the '+' button next to the 'Mobile network' tab in 'Network and Internet' that all the tutorials show. Did anyone see this and was able to resolve it? I bought the phone directly from Google, so it shouldn't be locked.\n\nEdit: this was solved on reddit. I needed to turn the developer settings on, which is strange since adding an eSIM is advertised as a feature of the phone. Leaving this up incase anyone else has the same issue.",
