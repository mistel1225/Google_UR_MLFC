    "title": "Microphone in text messenger not working properly?",
    "content": "About 3 days ago I began to have trouble using the microphone in the test messenger to talk instead of typing a text.  When I click on the microphone there is a long delay before it says its listening, and then once it is its typing words that I am not saying.  I tried to use it in Textra and the default messenger with the same trouble.  I have rebooted my phone several times  cleared the cache in the messenger apps along with the cache in the gboard.  Nothing is making any difference.  The microphone works fine in the Google assistant.   I am hoping someone has a suggestion to fix this.   Thanks in advance.    Jill",
