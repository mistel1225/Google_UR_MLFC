    "content": "I've been having issues with NFC for a while. Half a year ago it simply stopped working. I can't use Google Pay, and can't use any other services which require NFC. I followed all instructions on the Help Center. The issue is definitely with the hardware.\n\nI bought the phone in Poland, and I am based in Poland. The shop where I bought it went bankrupt during the Covid pandemic, so I can't contact them anymore.\n\nI tried finding info on how to file a claim, but all links redirect to general articles or the home page. There's no even info on the authorized services in Poland. I can't find any phone number to call. The only option is to write here.\n\nHow can I fix my phone?",
