    "content": "I upgraded to 11 and Face Unlock stopped working and I was being promoted to clean the upper bar. A factory reset only fixed the problem for a few minutes. \nSupport sent me a new refurbished phone. I did not copy my old settings to the new phone. I allowed it to upgrade to 11. \nThis phone is actually behaving worse. It reboots regularly throughout the day and night. If I leave it plugged in whole charging at night, in the morning it is frozen on a white screen with the Google logo.\n\nI just did a test where I rebooted into Safe Mode, and the phone crashed whole I was reading an article in Chrome. Note - Safe Mode starts up in Airplane Mode, which I had turned off, so I'm not sure if that had an impact.\n\nThe last thread I saw on this topic has been removed, not sure why.\n\nI'd be willing to downgrade to 4a if that would result in a stable phone. \n\nThoughts?\n\nThanks.",
