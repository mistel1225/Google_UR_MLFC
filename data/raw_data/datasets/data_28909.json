    "title": "Pixel 2 battery drama- drained extra quickly when plugged in and now dead and unable to charge",
    "content": "In a nutshell, my phone said it was charging when it wasn't actually plugged in. Then when I plugged it in it started losing 1% of battery every 30 seconds or so. Now it's totally dead and I when I plug in a charger it doesn't work. \n\nHere's the long version... \n- I plugged it in to charge when it was at 16% battery\n- I came back about 15 minutes later and it was down to 13%, even though it was plugged in and the lightning bolt symbol in the battery icon indicated that it was receiving a charge\n- I unplugged it & plugged it back in a few times, and even when it wasn't plugged in the lightning bolt symbol remained. At some point while I was doing this, the battery display started going backwards even faster, losing 1% every 30 seconds or so\n- I've tried 2 different cables and 2 different wall plugs and also 3 different wall outlets with no luck, also have tried with both cables into my laptop. There is no external battery case. \n- Now it is totally dead. When I press the power button the battery & lightning bolt symbol come on, and the red light is always on. This is whether it's plugged in or not. \n\nI've read the articles and looked at the forums, and haven't been able to find anything that applies to me. Help!?",
