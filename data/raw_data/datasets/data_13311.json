    "content": "I contacted Googles support team 10 days ago as the new Pixel 5 phone doesn't have an option of \"None\" in the phase 2 authentication when connecting to work WIFI. I have confirmed with my work IT team that this needs to be on to connect. I told Google this and 10 days later nothing. They keep emailing me saying they're looking into the issue but I don't get what there is to look into. I have told them the issue and they know how to resolve it. If they just said they are sorry and it requires an android update which will talk time I'd be happier because at least I know then but they're not. Has anyone had any similar issues? Its so frustrating.",
