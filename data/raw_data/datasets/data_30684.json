    "content": "Can't make or receive phone calls over wifi, with or without airplane mode enabled.  Wifi calling is enabled under advanced calling options.  I have Verizon and they support it. My phone simply refuses to use it.  See attached screenshot of message I see when trying to make a call with airplane mode on but still connected to my wifi network.",
