    "content": "Hi,\n\nLast night, I think that my phone was updating (but I didn't realise), and I forced a reboot by holding down the power button. Since then when I plug in the charger, the phone constantly starts up and shows the Google logo, and then goes black. I left the phone plugged in overnight hoping this may resolve itself, but alas this is still happening.\n\nWhen I try to turn on the phone without the charger plugged in, nothing happens and it does not turn on.",
