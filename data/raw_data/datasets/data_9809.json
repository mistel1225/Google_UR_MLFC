    "content": "I am from sri lanka and i bought a pixel 2xl from a dealer on 2018 and used if for nearly a year and there were no any issues with the phone and then on 2019 December my pixels display got damaged  but it worked well and then i disassembled my display and the battery,  i ordered some news parts (OEM display + OEM battery) from ebay and my original battery was mistakenly damaged by me after disassembled but then due to the COVID the shipment was delayed for like 7 months and now i got them all parts needed to recover my phone but unfortunately at the first when I fixed the display with the new battery and cleaned all the ports too and kept on charging for hours and it won’t even get charged no any red notification indication even but with my old battery it works but suddenly it gets shutdown and i know that the old battery doesn’t hold the charge and also i m not sure whether the newly ordered battery is an oem one or else a fake one and so i ordered another one with the same seller and received that one too but the same problem and (it won’t indicate any red notification light) but the seller says that all batteries are tested and works well, but with the old battery my phones turns on but gets shutting down so quickly.
