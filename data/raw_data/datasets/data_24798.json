    "content": "Is it possible to save photos directly to google pixel 3a device and not use Google Photos?  Ie Is there phone storage for photos that can be accessed offline like 'gallery'? I know you can disable sync in google photos but I want to be able to access my photos without necessarily being online. \nThank you",
