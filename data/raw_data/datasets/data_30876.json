    "content": "USB port on my Pixel 2 has became 'loose'. I can still charge it, but I think it is only matter of time until it will not charge any more. There is a tiny amount of 'movement' within the USB port when you plugin cable.\n\nI tried and failed miserably to find information on how and where to fix this.\n\nI am in the Netherlands and have bought phone from local store. They told me I need to contact Google.\n\nBut there is no option, what-so-ever to get in contact with Google for this matter.\n\nHow to proceed?",
