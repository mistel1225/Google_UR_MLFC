    "content": "Hi, my phone is clogged up with old photos that I want to move to my pc. How do I quickly move them all and delete them off the phone? When I plug a usb cable into it and my pc, I don't get any messages inviting me to do anything. If they would speak to each other I'm sure I could drag them across. I want to avoid having to use google photos, ticking the corner of each photo is very laborious and downloading, and then ticking them all again and deleting them. Got to be a quick way",
