    "content": "I have recently upgraded to a pixel4a from my pixel 3 and since doing that I cannot cast music from Spotify to my Google Chromecast. I have tried it on my wife's pixel 3 as well as my work phone which is an iPhone 8 and they both work fine. On my pixel 4a, my Chromecast is greyed out when I select cast and says \"Spotify not installed\". See attached screenshot. Thank-you for your help on this matter.",
