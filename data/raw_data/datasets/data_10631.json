    "content": "Cannot change notifications on the phone app, they are all selected on. Switched to Pixel 4a from iPhone7 on the Red Pocket network and the issue was immediately there. Tried uninstalling, clearing cache, updating, safe mode and factory reset. I have been reassured that submitting it for feedback will get it fixed but wanted to see who else might have the issue or any suggestions. I tried going to the Phone App support page but there was no Community option.",
