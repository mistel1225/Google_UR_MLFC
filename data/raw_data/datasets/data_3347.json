    "content": "Google assistant is set to screen calls.  If it screens a call and it is someone I do want/need to speak to, but I can't take the call right now, how can I send the call to voicemail so the person can leave a complete message and call back details.  I can only see the options to answer the call or reject which disconnects the call with no way for the caller to leave a message.",
