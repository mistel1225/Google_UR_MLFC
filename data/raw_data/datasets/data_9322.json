    "content": "Such discrepancies in my app lists are concerning. 58 apps listed as installed Play store 63 noted on my devices list as the number, but there are only 62 actually listed. I cannot see why they don't match and why my device would note a number of apps and one not show. Is this normal? I just moved to this phone from a pixel 2.  I did think I might have been hacked and did factory reset and restore. I left a lot off restore, but maybe I did it incorrectly? I'm concerned",
