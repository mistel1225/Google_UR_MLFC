    "title": "Can't view thumbnail when plugged into PC",
    "content": "I can't see thumbnails of photos on my Pixel when viewed through a computer, via USB. If I copy them over from phone to computer, I can see image thumbnails when they are then on my computer but not when they're on my device. This is a problem because I need to be able to see image thumbnails in order to discern which pictures I need to copy over!\n\nI have been through all the PC view fixes and my computer ain't the problem. I have tried trawling YouTube for solutions in reference to this phone (as I have just got it a few weeks ago and have not had this issue with my last few phones) but to no avail.\n\nAny advice would be valued,\nAdam",
