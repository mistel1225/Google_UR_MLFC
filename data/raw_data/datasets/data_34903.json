    "title": "My Pixel 3 suddenly decided to stop using volume in alarms, and during speaker phone.",
    "content": "My phone randomly stopped playing sound for alarms, and for speaker phone there is no sound. I have made sure that it wasn't accidentally muted, or the volume set low. I have restarted it numerous times. Even did a hard reset to see if that would work. I rebooted into safe mode, and it still doesn't work. But I can play music, watch YouTube etc. just fine. So I don't understand why some things the speakers work for and others don't. Anyone with any insight would be greatly appreciated. \n\nI hope it's something simple that I somehow am over looking.",
