    "content": "My Google Pixel 3XL Does not allow me to put the correct English US version of the voice speaking onto the device. When I use my voice speaking for a text or an email I spend most of my time doing corrections which I never had any problem with my Samsungs or LG phones before. It will not allow me to download the correct version It says it needs, any help on this issue?\nI spend so much time doing corrections It doesn't even pay to do voice-speaking, Not to mention the other problem that I wrote about half of my screen is beige on top and the bottom half is white and you can see the keyboard behind the white screen which is totally ridiculous. My husband who notices nothing did notice that and asked me why my phone is like that. Does anyone else have that problem with their screen and it seemed it occurred after an update and there are so many updates on this phone, It's ridiculous.",
