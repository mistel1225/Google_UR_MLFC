I've noticed since the last update that the phone has been freezing when you double-click the power button to open up the camera or to open up the phone in general it's been hanging up why is this? Is there going to be another security patch to fix this problem. also are they going to do about the screenshot feature kind of takes away the one hand use having to go old school to hold down the power buttons and the down key to take a screenshot quite annoying.",
