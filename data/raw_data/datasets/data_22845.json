    "content": "I've recently cracked my screen. I live in Bulgaria and we don't have any authorised repairment shops, so I want to send my phone in for an out of warranty repair. Is this possible as I've found it mentioned as a possibility in the help center but I cannot find any form to fill in order to do so. Please assist.",
