    "title": "Earphones not yet replaced. Its been 45 days. Customer Support doesn't have a timeline yet",
    "content": "I bought new Pixel-C earbuds for my Pixel 3 device as I lost the ones which came with the device. The earphones went faulty in the right earpiece after 3 months approx. I contacted the customer support team who asked me to share the invoice copy. Unfortunately, there has been no update since then. I keep getting those same template responses. The issue was logged on Aug 2, 2019 and after 45 days I am forced to bring it to the community to see if there could be solution to it.\n\nMy patience ran out today when the support executive asked me to wait for \"SOME\" more time. Upon asking him to define \"SOME\", he went mute, only to say, it may get resolved in 24 hours or might take a month too...!!! God Bless Google ...!!!\n\nI wonder and would like to know if the services are pathetic to such levels only in India or is it the case around the world too. If that be the case, at least it would give us a clarity on the quality of services and help our future decision making better. \n\nHelp me out Peeps, if you have any viable solution.\n\nJust in case the Google team is looking at this post and might want to help, refer to Case ID [7-4893000027658]",
