    "content": "I have a Pixel 3 XL and it was fine before but, recently, I restarted my phone and the background changed to the default background, some settings don't show up or can't be toggled (multiple users, security updates, etc.), app drawer says \"no recent apps\" even after I went into quite a few, my phone no longer checks for updates, apps don't download, gesture control doesn't work except for swiping from the left of the screen to go back, notifications don't show up (i only hear a ding), the notification menu doesn't pull all the way (only the top six buttons), can't double click power button to pull up the camera, Google assistant doesn't pop up even when I squeeze, fingerprint sensor doesn't pull down notification menu etc. I have tried restarting my phone. Didn't work. I deleted digital wellbeing. Didn't work. I can't check for any updates. I don't want to do a complete reset because I have quite a bit of important information on my phone that I don't want to lose. I have contacted help the  centre but I'm not so sure how I'll receive updates because the phone lost half of its functions and I can't receive notifications. It's very frustrating since I use my phone for school as well and it's only a week untill the semester starts. What do I do?",
