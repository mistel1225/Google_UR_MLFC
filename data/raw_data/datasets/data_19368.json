    "content": "Hello,\nI bought a pixel 3 from Amazon last July.\nIt has been used for less than a year, and there is currently a problem of battery drain.\nI have made a warranty request to Google before,\nbut Google only responds, the warranty period is until 07/31 of this year, and the rest of the warranty needs must be submitted to Amazon.\nHowever, Amazon customer service said that,\n\" Amazon will accept any return within 30 days of the date it was delivered. In this case, I would suggest that you contact the manufacturer. You still have a couple of weeks within the warranty date they provided you. \"\n\" I believe that other companies are not aware of Amazon≈õ policy so they just say that. However, Google should not give you any issues exchanging, fixing, or providing you with replacement pieces within the year warranty. \"\nSo I want to know,\ncould you help me for the warranty?\nThank you.",
