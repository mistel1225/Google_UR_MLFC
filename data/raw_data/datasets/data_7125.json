    "content": "My pixel is only displaying notifications for certain apps (example: gmail) when I plug it in to charge. This started happening recently and I can't seem to find any settings to prevent this. I have seem some forums online that it happened to people with older versions of the Pixel but there weren't any resolutions. Any help is appreciated.",
