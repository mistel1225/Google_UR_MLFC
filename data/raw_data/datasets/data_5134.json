    "content": "I told it to wait for two hours earlier in the day on the march security update. I got home from an emergency call sometime around 9:30, and I checked my messages and put it on the desk.About an hour later, I got a call and the screen did not turn on. The screen is and stays entirely black through all attempts to reset it, although it is responsive to touch- I was able to turn the flashlight on blindly. It does not make any noise nor ring out loud, vibrations only. even when I am able to blindly unlock it, it does not respond to verbal commands like \"hey google\"\nI tried powering it off and on. I tried the hard boot- power and volume down for 30 seconds. I fully charged it.\n\nI would strongly prefer not to wipe the device until all other avenues have been exhausted.",
