    "content": "Out of nowhere my Pixel 3A quit connecting to my Chevy MyLink via USB. It also will not connect to any of my PCs. I have tested the cables using my wife's identical Pixel 3A to confirm it wasn't a cable issue. The weird thing is that it connects to my wife's Pixel 3A using the USB-C to USB-C cable that came with the phones when we purchased them. I have tried matching all of my wife's phone settings and also every solution on this site and other blogs with no luck. Ideas?",
