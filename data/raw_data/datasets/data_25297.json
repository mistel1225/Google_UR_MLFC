    "title": "Pixel 2 XL: Gesture Navigation broken after December update",
    "content": "With the most recent OTA system update (12/19) for my Pixel 2 XL, the gesture navigation in Pixel Launcher is broken. The problem presents itself as a persistent and prohibitive \"pixel launcher keeps stopping\" message. I am also using an app called \"digilux\" to use my fingerprint scanner as a secondary navigation input. I did try uninstalling it to alleviate the problem, but; like clearing PL's app cache and storage, it was to no avail.",
