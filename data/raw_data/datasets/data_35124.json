    "content": "So, I saw that Google Discover was able to be put in dark mode. Mine wasn't so I tried uninstalling the Google App and reinstalling it. Now, Discover doesnt work anymore, I can't access its options either. I've tired removing and re-adding my Google account, reinstalling the app, clearing the cache, all mine yards but my discover feed is still empty and options greyed out. Alsoeven though I'm on the latest update, the menus are from 5 or 6 updates ago, maybe more. Any ideas?",
