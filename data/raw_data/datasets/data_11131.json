    "content": "hello. support has refused to help with my issue and i am having trouble finding out how to report an issue with Android - the issue is the same on my old ZTE phone and my current Pixel phone made by Google. \nI copy video clips to my phone memory - the Movies folder - to watch later. \neach night one or more files in that folder disappear.\nGoogle recommended that i backup the folder with Google Photos - did that - no change - still lose random files overnight. \nSince it is affecting multiple phones it must be a software issue or Android related.\nPLEASE tell me how to fix this major security issue - files should ne be disappearing from my phones storage area.\ni need to work with someone on monitoring the folder for changes so we can determine why those files are disappearing with no warning.\nia have the following case numbers: 3-9766000030922 3-6290000030547\nthanks\nbrad",
