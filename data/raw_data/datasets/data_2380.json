    "content": "I was using my phone regularly and I saw a message pop up that stated \"clean the top of your screen, including the black bar\". Shortly after, the phone began artifacting. It flashes black and the screen shown in the image attached in few second intervals. Have attempted to factory reset to no avail. The phone was nowhere near water and I wasn't using any unfamiliar apps. Would appreciate any help - thanks. ",
