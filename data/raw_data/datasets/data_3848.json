    "content": "Hi,\n\nI want to start using an eSIM that I have with a carrier that has wider network coverage.  In this scenario I would like to use my default SIM when it has coverage and switch to the eSIM when the default SIM drops out.\n\nWill this switch be transparent from a data perspective or will I need to take manual action to allow the eSIM to be used for data.\n\nRegards",
