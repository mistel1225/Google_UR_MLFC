    "content": "I have been using Google Pixel XL 1 from last 2 years.\n\nFrom past week or so the phone has gone into boot loop and restarting. The phone needs to be switched to bootloader mode to switch off else it will be stuck at Google brand logo 'G' and restarts.\n\nI went into recovery mode and did factory reset. Still the problem persist. \n\n\nWhat would be the issue and how to resolve it? \n\nCan  software flashing help solve it ?",
