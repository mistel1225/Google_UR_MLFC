    "content": "Hello, \nI recieved my pixel 4a today and have a doubt about my fingerprint scanner, I have tried other phones with rear-fingerprint scanners and on those I would just touch the sensor and it would work, with my 4a it does not recognize a fingerprint unless I push into the sensor, but even then sometimes I am having to press on the sensor relatively hard for it to recognize the attempt, this doesn't feel right. Is this intended? or is my sensor faulty?",
