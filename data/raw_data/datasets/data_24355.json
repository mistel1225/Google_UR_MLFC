    "content": "I'm a US resident with a US phone number, and I purchased the google Pixel 4XL that my friend brought down to Grenada, which is where I currently go to school temporarily. My mobile service is also through a US provider. I thought the SOLI motion system restriction was based on the phone number's location, which mine is located in the United States. I was wondering if you could somehow fix this issue or help me enable this feature on my phone.\n\nP.S. or add Grenada to the approved list of countries for the motion sensor like some of the other caribbean islands!",
