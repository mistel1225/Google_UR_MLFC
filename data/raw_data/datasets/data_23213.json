    "content": "When I perform a search for businesses (restaurants near me, grocery store... etc) I receive a listing.  When I click on anything in the list I receive an error \"Can't Load this page.  Check your internet connection and try again\".  This error just started yesterday.  I contacted Google support which was a joke.  After one hour and being transferred three times, I wound up with sales support who abruptly disconnected our chat.  Uninstalled and reinstalled maps, google assistant, and project fi.  Rebooted multiple times and performed a factory reset.  Nothing has helped.  The error occurs whether on WiFi or using data.  Please help.",
