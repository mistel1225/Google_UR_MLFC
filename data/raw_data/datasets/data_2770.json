    "content": "Can the April '21 OTA update (RQ2A.210405.005) for Verizon locked Pixel 5 phones be uploaded to https://developers.google.com/android/ota? I'm not sure if the general one works as it hasn't for my purposes. I woke up this morning and the phone is now stuck in a bootloop. I have vital files on the phone that I haven't backed up (yes, I know) and am hoping I can get back in. I can't use the last Verizon specific update from Feb '21 because it won't allow me to downgrade.",
