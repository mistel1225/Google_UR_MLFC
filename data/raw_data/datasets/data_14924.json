    "content": "After the Android 11 update , there is no gallery, third party apps can't access gallery as well.  Google photos app crashes because of the same problem. Audio via headphones sounds pathetic now. Cleared app cache etc. etc. Now only thing left to do is to reset the device. I bought the pixel 3a in the first place for the software , despite of better hardware specs. available from other brands at similar price. Now this feels like a very irresponsible and lazy update rolled by google.  All the support was able to do is to instruct me to clear the app cache, then login to safe mode, both of which didn't work.  Now I have to go through  the pain of ensuring my data  gets backed up and resetting my phone,  for some sloppy update rolled out by google???",
