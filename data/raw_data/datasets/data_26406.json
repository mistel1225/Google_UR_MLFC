    "title": "Upgrade to Android 10 disables instant hot swap between e-SIM and physical SIM",
    "content": "I have Pixel 2 XL. Prior to upgrade to Android 10, I was able to easily swap between Google Fi on e-SIM and Verizon MNVO on my physical SIM from Carrier settings under Network & internet. Since upgrade to Android 10, whenever I switch back to Google Fi, the phone stops seeing physical SIM.\n\nThe only option to re-enable physical SIM now is to either re-insert SIM card try or click on + next to Mobile network option and simulate \"downloading\" a virtual SIM which will fail but in the process re-enable the physical SIM installed in your phone. That is a major bug preventing seamless switch between Google Fi e-sim and physical SIM. When physical SIM is activated, it can see two SIMs -  inactive downloaded SIM for Google Fi and active physical SIM. Once I enable in options SIM for Google Fi and confirm switch, it no longer sees the physical SIM.",
