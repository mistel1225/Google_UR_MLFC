    "content": "Phone has latest android updates according to settings (updated today). My phone is at 75% of storage, running only one or two apps at a time. Many of my apps freeze. (Amazon music. Carb Manager for example). Wi-fi is fine, also have unlimited data. \n(I don't think I want to do factory reset, wouldn't I lose everything? Also, I got this phone in October, and reset it then.)\nWhat should I do, keeping in mind I am a Luddite.",
