    "content": "I was refreshing the Google store, waiting for the Pixel 4 XL launch.  When it popped up, I immediately used my Pixel 3 XL to add an Orange 128 GB Pixel 4 XL to my order and proceeded to check out.  At the trade-in option screen, however, Pixel 3 XL (or Pixel 3) was not listed as an option (I have a time-stamped photo of this).  I backed out and tried multiple times - nothing.  I tried on a computer (Pixelbook) to see if it was a mobile glitch, nothing.  Then - briefly, it showed 3 XL as a trade-in, so I selected it -- but received a message saying it was not eligible.  I backed out to try again, and 3 XL was gone as an option to even select again.  So, I placed my order, to preserve my place in line.\n\nAbout ten minutes later, I checked again, and Pixel 3 XL was now a trade-in option, and it was allowing it to be added to the order.  The problem now was that the orange 128 GB Pixel 4 XL was waitlisted.  I spoke with Google chat, and during that session the orange 4 Pixel XL 128 GB became available again - but, with a 4-5 week wait time when my current wait time is estimated in under a week.  I was told this was my only option (to replace the order) to tie the trade-in to the order.  \n\nI found the resolution unacceptable given the circumstances and chose to maintain my original order.  I find it odd that they can't modify an order with such a simple option, or create a trade-in separately, or any sort of resolution.  \n\nAnyone else experience this or similar?",
