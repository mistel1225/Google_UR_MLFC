    "content": "Hello. I left my Pixel 4 for charging overnight, and the phone turned off by itself and rebooted. However, the booting was stopped in the Google animation and didn't proceed afterward.\nThe phone didn't boot with several force reboot attempts.\nI tried to reset my phone in recovery mode. Though the formatting was done correctly, the phone still stuck in the same animation while booting.\nIs there any possible solution for the problem?",
