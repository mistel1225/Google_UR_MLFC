    "content": "My google pixel 3 suddenly died out of nowhere. I put it on charge last night. Was working perfectly fine this morning, an hour ago, with almost full battery. Suddenly I try to open my phone and it gives no response. I tried rebooting but again no response, I started charging the phone but charge icon won't show up and phone remains unresponsive and won't open. I had previously dropped the phone a month ago and cracked the screen, took it to uBreakiFix and had no issues since they repaired my screen. But suddenly phone is dead I can't open it I can't use it. And the google help center options have had nothing helpful about it.",
