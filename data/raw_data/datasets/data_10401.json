    "content": "Now that Google has stopped the updates after Oct 2020 security updates and now we'll not be getting any updates, the pixel drop and many other benefits where developer team can work upon like e sim in India .\nOther big companies doesn't do it.\nIf google wants to build it's market in India then it has to stand with old phone as well. \nI never heard apple does something like that.\nThey even opened an apple store and google not even make the availability of accesories for the old device . Like my pixel bud , the issue was pending for an year which is still not resolved, \nIf this is how google wants to work here in India phone market, then I'm sorry to say it is going to be very difficult for them in future.",
