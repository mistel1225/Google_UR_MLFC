    "content": "starting in recovery mode solve the problem for approxmatly one hour. after that, calling is unpossible . sometimes its not possible to record or hear a voicemessage and sometimes its even not possible to hear any music. then the launcher gets slower. changing from one app to the other has a delay from 1 second to a minute.  it feels like a touchscreen problem, but if you are inside the app (whatsapp or evernote for example) everything works fine and fast. actions with fingerprintsensor and buttons work okay",
