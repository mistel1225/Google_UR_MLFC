    "title": "\"Couldn't finish restoring the backup\" - Can't restore Pixel backup from GSuite Google Drive",
    "content": "I'm the GSuite Admin of my organisation and I recently backed my Pixel 4 XL up to my Google Drive.\nAfter a factory reset I've attempted to restore the backup but get the pop-up \"Couldn't finish restoring the backup\" and then no additional information.\n\nThis is incredibly frustrating as it just fails then acts like nothing happened. I have 3+ years worth of backed up texts in a 3mb backup file that I desperately need and I have no way to access them.\n\nThe problem lies between GSuite and Pixel. I've spoken to 6+ Support people and none of them could help me.\n\nHOW DO I RESTORE MY TEXT MESSAGES FROM MY GSUITE GOOGLE DRIVE?!",
