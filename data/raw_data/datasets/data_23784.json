    "content": "Last night I turned off my phone.  When I went to turn it back on, it got stuck in 'boot/start' mode (after the 'Google' screen, then the colored 'G' with an active gray loading bar under.  It stays in this mode now - if I turn it off (takes full 15 second hold on power to turn off) it restarts right back up after a few seconds.  If I turn off in recovery mode, it turns off for good but then restart it just gets stuck in the 'G' screen again.  I tried via recovery mode to do a reboot but it went back to same issue after that.  I chatted with google help and they said nothing to do now except factory reset.  Problem is that my pictures from the last 9 months are not saved (I know, really bad, long story, please don't ask).  Is there any way AT ALL to get those pictures before I factory reset?  I care about nothing except my pics & videos of my kids.  The rest I can trash - the whole phone really, as I hate it.  But the pictures kill me.  I called our local fixit shop and they said they could 'try a few things' but if they can't get it to turn on properly then there is no way to access the pictures due to security of the phone itself.  Before I take it in and see ...does anyone have other ideas, tricks, tips, anything?  Is it worth taking it in ...can they do anything different than I already tried?  Thanks.",
