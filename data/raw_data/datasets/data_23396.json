    "content": "This is my second Google pixel 4 now with the same issue. I did not drop this phone, same as my other one, I didn't even use it until I had a case and screen protector. For this amount of money this is a rubbish phone! Who wants a phone that can't ring!!! Lost a lot of respect for Google. Absolute rob dogs!  Don't buy this phone, get your money back and look elsewhere for a new one! Waste of time and will only bring disappointment!",
