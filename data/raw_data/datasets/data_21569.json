    "content": "Since many of us are working from home now, being on a conference call is a daily routine.  Often times, I'm on a call, and cannot recall if I have muted myself.  I'm aware to see that when the screen is unlocked, but I'd like to see this status on the lock screen as well (or always on display).  hoping this can be a simple feature request.  thanks!",
