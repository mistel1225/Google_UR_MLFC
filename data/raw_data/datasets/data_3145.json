    "title": "Vertical line of white pixels on pixel 4a.",
    "content": "Three weeks ago a single vertical line of white pixels appeared on my pixel 4a, though I managed to fix it through shutting apps and restating, and waiting. If I close all apps eventually the display fixes itself though it is inconsistent and may be getting more stubborn. The line returns within hours everytime I manage to remove it.\n\nI haven't been able to identify which app may be causing it though for a while I thought it was MS Outlook. I don't use many apps though so hope it's not an incompatibility.\n\nIt doesn't act like dead pixels, rather it acts like a white line superimposed on the screen. It appears to scroll up and down with the images on screen.\n\nAny help is appreciated. Cheers",
