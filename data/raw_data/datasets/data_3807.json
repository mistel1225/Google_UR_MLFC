    "content": "Hello, my question revolves around my current phone number. I have a pixel 3 with metro by T-Mobile. I bought the phone separately from the google store and linked it to Metro and I was thinking of getting the new pixel 5 with the google Fi phone service. I wanted to know if its possible to keep the current number from metro when I switch to Google Fi? Thank you.",
