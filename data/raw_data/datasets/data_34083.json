    "content": "Hi,\nI have a Pixel 3 w/ Google Fi Service and I am having issues with WiFi calling and DataSaver. When DataSaver is on the other person on the phone cannot hear me but I can hear them fine. When searching I found this post (https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/7odvgg/wifi_calling_issueresolved/dsa4dvu/) saying it is a known issue.\nIs there any way to keep data saver on and also use Wifi calling?\nI made sure that the phone application is allowed to use background data and also unrestricted data usage. I'm not sure what else I can do.\nAny suggestions would be greatly appreciated.\n\n**Note as soon as I disabled Wi-Fi Calling the phone is working normally.\n\nThanks",
