    "content": "My wife's phone today stopped working on cellular network.  After 3 different support sessions, supported ended the chat saying a specialist would contact me in 24-72 hours for a specialist to reach out. \n\nI know theres a lot of things going on in the world today, so a pixel3a issue is not top of mind, however I am paying full price for my service and not getting support.  All other carriers have increased their support availability, but for some strange reason Google has decided to decrease it during a time of crisis.  That's opposite of how they should respond.  \n\nI'm not looking for help because this phone is obviously broken, I want to scream into the void.  That's all.  Looking forward to ATT/Verizon.",
