    "content": "I have a Google pixel that's about 2 years from original purchase. I've recently had my WiFi become unable to connect to any of the available networks I've tried. \n\nI tried:\nFactory reset on my router\nFactory reset on my phone\nSetting and reserving a static IP address (this worked for a few hours)\nConnecting to WiFi hotspots and mobile hotspots\nBooting into safe mode\n\nNone of this has had a lasting effect on my connectivity. Bluetooth is still functioning normally and I'm still able to see local wireless networks and their signal strengths.\n\nI spoke with customer service and they told me to take it to a ubreakifix a few miles away which wouldn't be terrible if I didn't have to pay out of pocket for the repair which was estimated to be anywhere from $20-$200 by the phone technician. Not extremely helpful.\n\nI understand that this phone is 2+ years old but it's more the servicing my needs and I have no interest in replacing it.",
