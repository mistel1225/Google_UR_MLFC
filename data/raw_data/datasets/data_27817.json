    "content": "I took thousands of pix on my old pixel 2. They are all backed up in Google photos.  I got a new pixel 3xl but the photos didn't transfer into the phones internal memory - they are only accessible in Google photos which uses data.  I have 128gb on the 3xl and want my pics stored there but I can't seem to transfer them back onto the new phone. Help!",
