    "content": "I have done a soft reset and checked all settings. Nothing will work. Volume up button will not work. Have to press down button each time so that volume adjuster pops up on screen and use it that way. Auto rotate also just recently stopped working and I have tried everything. It doesn't matter what app I'm in, it will not work. Is there anything I am missing?",
