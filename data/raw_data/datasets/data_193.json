    "content": "Just upgraded to a Pixel 4a from a Pixel 3 and I have noticed a drastic downgrade in the quality using the front facing camera. The background looks sharp but my face looks blurry even with the minimal 18 in distance recommended & tap-to-focus.\n\nI also did all the troubleshooting possible with Google specialists but nothing worked. Is this normal or should I get a replacement since I have been offered one? I just want to make sure it's not the new quality to expect from the best camera on a smartphone...\n\nAnyone else with this issue?",
