    "content": "I would like to move the time/date from the centre of my lock screen up a bit but still centered. At the moment it covers my lock screen wallpaper and I just want to move it up so it doesn't cover/hide my lock screen wallpaper. So far I have tried to play around with all the possible settings that could be relevant buy have been unsuccessful. If anyone knows how I can change it, please help me out! I would like to appreciate my wallpaper every time I pick up my phone!",
