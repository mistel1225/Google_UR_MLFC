    "content": "I went into the settings to change my security from PIN to pattern. I also enabled smart lock. Some time after doing so, I tried unlocking the phone with my pattern, and it said incorrect pattern. I have tried so many combinations and none work after 30 tries. It does not let me use my fingerprint to unlock either. What the hell is going on, is this a bug? I have read other pixel owners encountered the same issue with older Pixel phones and had to factory reset. I am willing to factory reset, but would like to make sure all my data will be transferred. My Google Drive backup shows SMS at 240KB which is worrying. Why is it so small? I am sure my messages make up a few hundred megabytes. Is there a way to copy data from Pixel to Windows?",
