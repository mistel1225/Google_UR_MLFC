    "title": "Pixel 3 XL power on lag",
    "content": "Since the last system update, my pixel 3 XL has been lagging an extreme amount when powering on. It doesn't seem to matter if I use the fingerprint unlock or the power button. It functions normally once on, but it can take 15-30 seconds for the screen to come on once the button has been pressed. A double press will immediately bring up the camera about half the time, half the time it will also lag. The first few times this happened, a reboot solved it. But it seems to be getting worse, and the reboot no longer does anything. Other people seem to have had similar problems on the past, but I don't see forum posts once this update. Any ideas?",
