    "content": "I got a replacement device from Google. After 2 months it got issues with hardware. Google created the ticket, phone was shipped to the service factory. I received that phone after approx. 20 days. When I opened it, it was inside a polythene bag, backpannel was scratched with blue and red ballpen marks. I knew the service of Google so I started the video from the beginning (the link of the video - https://twitter.com/i/status/1293892089743175680). I call support was closed because of COVID-19 so straight away I contacted Google Support, they escalated the case on 2nd August. \nOn 13 August they claimed that scratched were already there by sharing some OUTWARD IMAGES (post-repair)\n\nYou can clearly see the scratch above the sim card tray.\n\nI contacted Google the again escalated the issue.\nOn 31st August they email me with the same content, \"scratched were already there when they received the phone\" and the image was share I'm attaching the image\nthey claimed that the above image is pre-repair image i.e take before the repair when they received the phone.\n\nThe the main thing I'm here, just compare both the images, are they identical? Just see in both the image above the phone, there is a laptop. In both the images the rubber band, the sim card and the green paper are on the EXACT  same place. How? when Google is calming that on is pre-repair and other is post-repair. \n\nTHE ANSWER IS both the images were taken on the same day and Google is lying.\nI'm attached the images I clicked before giving it to the factory.\n\nsorry can't attach more than 3 images.",
