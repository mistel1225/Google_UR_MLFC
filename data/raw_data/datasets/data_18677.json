    "content": "This is a problem with either the display software, hardware, or a combination of both. I don't believe this is end user fixable. It can be duplicated in Safe Mode and other users (just one example). I have facotry reset as well. \n\nPosting for others who may be experiencing this problem (as I couldn't find it on here). My issue is best detailed in this video with additional information in the description!",
