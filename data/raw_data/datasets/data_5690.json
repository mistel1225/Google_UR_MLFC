    "content": "Since Feb 2021 update, Google Assistant (Hey Google) hears me and even writes out correctly what I've said...e.g. set alarm etc...but then the rainbow bars to show it's listening stay active and nothing happens...no action is forthcoming. Worked fine before now totally unresponsive. \n\nI've tried retraining/rebooting/reenabling and all the other common solution I've seen on here...new Pixel 4a only a few months old...not really acceptable for such a major feature to just break. Please advise...thanks.",
