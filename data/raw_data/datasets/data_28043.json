    "content": "I think a recent update changed this issue as it was fine for a long time.\nThe issue I'm having is in relation to not being able to see recommendations or search history from within the pixel search widget. Hopefully the screenshots will show you better.\n\nIn the below example I started to type \"peak\" and as you can see the first 4 results are impossible to read ( this is search history) the peaky blinders is not history, as I've never visited that page.\n\nSo my question is, how do I make the history query's visible again?\n\nThey never used to be this hard to read.\n\nMany thanks",
