    "title": "Lots of Technical Issues with my new Pixel 4a",
    "content": "I just got a new Pixel 4a as a replacement for my 3a.  So far, there are several major issues that are severely impacting my productivity:\n\n1.) When I have it connected to my car via Bluetooth, phone calls are extremely staticy to the point of being unable to hear anything.\n\n2.) Most of my apps that are set up for notifications (banking, Kickstarter, etc), do not push notifications to me.  This wasn't an issue for my 3a.\n\n3.) I was on my first Google Duo call today, and while on wifi, the call was very low-res and the sound was very metallic.  \n\nThese are just a few of the issues.  I've troubleshooted as best as I can, but nothing seems to solve this problem and I'm wondering if I have a defective phone.",
