    "content": "My Google Pixel 3 is overheating on just about everything I do - really disappointing. I've gone over and over the recommendations from forums and posts but this thing is basically a microwave in my pocket.\n\nIt even heats up when charging! Can you imagine?\n\nOn top of that, the battery life is extremely underwhelming. I've had to purchase a power bank just to make sure I'm not stranded (I'm travelling). And yes, I've read the forums, I've even enabled the Battery Saver and have looked across ALL of my apps to see who's using the most power. \n\nI'm really unsure what do at this point since I'm backpacking through South East Asia and I'm unsure of the turnaround time on a replacement device.\n\nI'm sorry if this feels like a rant but it's really frustrating as this is my first Pixel purchase.\n\nLooking for all recommendations.\n\nCheers,",
