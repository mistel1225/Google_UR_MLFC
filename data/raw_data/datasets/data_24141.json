    "content": "I mostly have my phone set to vibrate, and whenever I listen to music in my headset I've noticed that my phone doesn't interrupt the music when it's ringing. I would like it to stop the music so that I actually get notified that I have an incoming call. I can't hear the vibration if I have headphones on and I'm missing a lot of calls because of it.\n\nI've looked through all the settings I can think might solve this issue but I haven't found anything. Does anyone know how to solve this issue?",
