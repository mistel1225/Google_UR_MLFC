    "title": "Google Pixel 3a will not connect to my Ring 2 Doorbell on 4g.",
    "content": "I recently purchased a Ring 2 Doorbell and internal security camera. I can view live mode on both devices using WIFI. I cannot view live mode on 4g. My network carrier is EE. My partner has the same type of phone and is experiencing these issues also.\n\nI have looked at several forums which detail potential fixes. I have tried turning 'data saver' off and checked my router channel is set to automatic. I have also turned off Ads and still no access to live mode on 4g.\nAre there any other settings on the pixel 3a which could be preventing live mode view on 4g? Could this be an issue with EE?\nAll assistance is welcome.. I have spent so many hours trying to fix this issue, I will have to return the products if there is no way to resolve.",
