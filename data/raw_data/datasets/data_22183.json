    "content": "Hello! My Pixel 3 XL is completely unresponsive. Not turning on, no notifications, sound, and no startup screen.\n\nI've tried all steps here: https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/7167687\nPressed power button for a minute\nChecked cable, charger, and socket\nCharged overnight\nTried to call Pixel using another phone and using Find My Device - neither could connect\nTroubleshoot steps by connecting to computer*\nPressed volume down and power buttons together for 30+ seconds\n\n*The computer could recognize that a device was connected, but was unable to interact with it in any way. Pixel remained completely unresponsive for all steps.\n\nI'm honestly not sure what caused this; it was working fine the last time I opened it and I hadn't recently installed any updates just prior to it becoming unresponsive. Pixel is <1 yr old (still covered by warranty) and given directly by Google as a contest prize (no exact place of purchase).\n\nI'm currently in another country where the Pixel line is unavailable and I'm unable to leave or go to a country w Pixel support/repair centers anytime soon due to a country-wide lockdown. The NCov situation means the lockdown will remain for several months, but the warranty will also expire in a few months. Are there any other steps I can take to recover my Pixel? :(",
