    "content": "Since about 4PM today I've been trying to get Messages for Web to sync with my phone, but every time I click on the link in my QR Code Reader, I get a \"Dynamic Link Not Found.\" I've tried clearing the Messages cache and reinstalling the Messages app, but nothing has changed.\n\nIs Google's Firebase redirector hosed or am I missing something?\n\n\nThanks,\n-MB",
