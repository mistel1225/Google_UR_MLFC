    "content": "Pixel 5. 3 days of use. \n\nSpeakers crackle when the phone rings - really audible crackling noise. The ringtone actually slows down from time to time, like the phone is really labouring. \n\nProximity sensor appears to be malfunctioning. Sometimes the display turns off when I'm on a call, other times never. Flip to shh, once enabled has never worked. \n\nLaggy performance. When scrolling through pics or Instagram the display lags horrendously. \n\nRaised a ticket today with Google and opted for advanced exchange option - but to be honest I'm having second thoughts & considering refund. \n\nAny users with similar experience?",
