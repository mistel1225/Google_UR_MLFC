    "content": "When using the Google assistant, you can enable \"Squeeze for your Assistant\" in the Active Edge settings. However, that setting vanishes once you select a different assistant.\n\nCan somebody confirm that Active Edge exclusively works with Google Assistant only? Because I don't see any way to use Active Edge with a different assistant.\n\nDevice is Pixel 3 with Android 10 January 2020 patch.\n\nThanks",
