    "content": "Hi there,\n\nI am returning a broken Pixel 4a for a faulty charging port. While I'm waiting to get a new one I have tried to return my old device as instructed by Google support team. However the local DHL service point informed me that they need a pro forma invoice in order to be able to ship the parcel, since the UK is not part of the EU anymore. \n\nUnfortunately Google support email only provides the shipping label and the doc with the item details and RMA/IMEI number. Has anyone had the same issue? I didn't even know what a pro forma invoice was until today and Google support hasn't been of any help so far. \n\nThanks for your help!",
