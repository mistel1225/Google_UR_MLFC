    "title": "Can I fix screen display burn in and fading?",
    "content": "My Google Pixel 2XL screen has burn in where latent old home screen icons appear like watermarks in the background of any display that is lighter in color or tone. The active display is faded as well so that the true color of images and text is not shown, but a faded, pastel-like tone instead. The phone display is absolutely unreadable in sunlight and barely discernabl when I move into the shade. Between the burned in home screen icons and the faded active display, I cannot use any app that doesn't have a dark backgound with bold white text  or if the app displays a light backgound, I can't read any text unless it is pure black. My pictures in the gallery are all faded when viewed on the phone to the point it is hard to tell what they are. I have to transfer the files to PC in order to view them or edit them because the display is so faded and untrue and the latent old home screen icons appearing like watermarks interfere with what is actively being displayed by the phone. Anybody have this problem and if so, how did you fix it? My wife and I bought the same model phones at the same time and she's constantly using hers, much like me, but her display is still sharp and crisp with no burn in or fading at all. Please help...",
