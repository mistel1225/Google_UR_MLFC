    "content": "I would like to ask you one question regarding the SIM activation of a Google PIxel 3a. I'm from Slovenia (EU) and my girlfriend who is currently in UK just bought me the SIM Free Pixel 3a at Currys PC world. One of the assistants at the store suggested her to activate the phone with a SIM card from a British carrier. I would like to know if this is truly necessary or I can just active the phone in my home country. \nI appreciate your help.",
