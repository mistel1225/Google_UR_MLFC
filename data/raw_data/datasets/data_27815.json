    "content": "Recently i check and found out that my pixel 2 camera laser focus is not working, i tried using other camera to detect the blue light but there wasn't any. \n\nThere is no issue with focusing or taking pictures.\n\nBut previously i could see it when i point it at a mirror or black surface, but now i couldn't.\n\nIs there any way to fix this or anyone else having this issue,\nTried uninstalling the camera app didn't work.\n\nAndroid 10.",
