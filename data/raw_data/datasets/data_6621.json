    "title": "Unable to set volume level for Wireless Charging and Screen Locking sounds - they are too quiet",
    "content": "Since Google update the volume level for Screen Locking and Wireless Charging sounds are now way too low - I can only just hear them if I put the phone right to my ear. Previously the sound levels were maximum (which I actually quite liked).\n\nThere is no way to adjust the volume level for Screen Locking and Wireless Charging sounds - we really need this.\n\nI really liked being able to \"hear\" when my Pixel was charging on wireless charger in my car for example, I would not need to look at the phone, I could \"hear\" that it had started charging. Also I used to really like the \"clunk\" screen locking sound, now its gone :-( \n\nPlease give us the ability to set these volume levels independent of every other setting like Notification and Ringtone.\n\nRegards,\n\nJulian",
