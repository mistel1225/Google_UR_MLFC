    "title": "Has anyone else dropped their Pixel 3a with the Google case on? Was the phone fine after?",
    "content": "I dropped my new Pixel 3a with its case on a tiled floor from waist height and a significant portion of my bottom screen cracked. Has any other owners also dropped their phone with the case on? What was the result?\n\nWhat about Pixel 3 users who dropped their phone with the case on?\n\nUnfortunately, Google won't help with anything (besides providing me with their repair partner to purchase repair services) as they said I didn't purchase their extended warranty, and I was sad to hear that even though their case was on the phone it makes no difference.\n\nAdmittedly, this is a post as I'm curious to see what user feedback there is from Pixel 3 and Pixel 3a users from dropping their phone.",
