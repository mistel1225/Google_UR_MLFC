    "title": "Pixel suddenly unable to call in Korea",
    "content": "I have a Pixel 3A XL purchased in the US. I now live in South Korea, so I bought a SIM card from KT. For the last 5 months it has worked perfectly as I wanted it to. I can do SMS messaging, I can do regular calls to local numbers, I can browse the internet with LTE, connects to Wi-Fi fine, etc. Now suddenly I can't call. I cannot receive or make any phone calls. Sometimes the icon at the top of the phone shows that there is no network available (little x) sometimes it shows there is a network. I can still send and receive SMS messages, and use data through LTE normally. I just can't call.\n\nI of course have tried restarting multiple times. I took the SIM card out and put it back in. I went to the KT desk and they said that \"pixel phones are not compatible with Korean networks so you can't call\". But that can't be true, I've been using it for 5 months. I haven't seen this problem on the internet yet. I've been reading about the LTE data issue, but my data works fine.",
