    "content": "Pixel 4 XL, Screen is clean, fresh install of Android 11,  no screen protector. When I pull down notification drawer, use Swype typing, or do scrolling on apps, I get a violent shaking effect as if my finger were moving really quickly around a small area. It makes typing very inaccurate and is very annoying to look at when scrolling apps reading.",
