    "content": "I was using Pixel 3a Previously and now got my Pixel 4a. When I compare images between both I see that the pictures taken from Pixel 4a is darker, little blurred and colour reproduction is. unnatural. \nIts not an issue with the display. I played around with the settings. Doesnt seems like its an issue with settings as well. I have the same settings as my Pixel 3a. Any taughts?",
