    "content": "I recently bought a new Pixel 4a phone from the Google Store with Preferred Care (provided through Assurant) and unfortunately I damaged it very quickly.  I replaced it through the insurance plan and received my new Pixel 4a very promptly.\n\nBut, I never received a shipping confirmation email for the new device, which should have included the shipping label to return the broken device.  Also, the replacement device did not include a physical copy of the return shipping label for the broken device.\n\nI've contacted Google support multiple times, and they always claim that Assurant needs to provide this shipping label.  I've contact Assurant support multiple times, and they always claim that Google needs to provide this shipping label.  I am stuck in an endless loop without making any progress to resolve this issue.\n\nI see other forum posts with this exact same issue, and I don't see any resolutions, except a form to escalate the issue.  I'm posting here to to raise the visibility of this systemic problem further, and to have a reference for when I escalate my own issue.\n\nOther people with this same problem:\nhttps://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/70591406?hl=en\nhttps://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/73535675?hl=en\nhttps://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/49541260?hl=en",
