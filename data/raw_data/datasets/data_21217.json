    "content": "Pixel XL crashes out of nowhere. Enters bootloop, not even able to get to Restore Mode at first. But eventually able to, and phone restarts.. only to freeze again after a couple minutes and enters bootloop again\n\nWondering if there's a fix for this, it is probably a software glitch..\n\nAnd if no fix.. I could do a factory reset, but would like to be able to backup phone content/files/message history first. Would appreciate any tips on how to do this with the phone in its current shape...\n\nThanks in advance!",
