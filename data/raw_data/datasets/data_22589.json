    "content": "I am trying to get the new Google assistant UI. I have two accounts signed into my phone, a personal non gsuite account, and a gsuite account. On the personal account, I have the old Google assistant UI, however, on the gsuite account, I have the new UI. I would like to use the new assistant on my personal account, seeing as I can't add my gsuite account to my home without restarting from scratch.",
