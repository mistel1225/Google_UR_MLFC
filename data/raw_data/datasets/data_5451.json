    "content": "My first Pixel2XL was bought with excitement to finally break out of Apple and other restrictive os's to native Android. Used it faithfully until it was stolen last summer. Replaced it with Pixel4XL and what a mistake that is turning into. As Google becomes more the devil that Apple and Microsoft have been, is there any workaround for allowing my phone to cast to either FireTVCube or Roku? Any help is appreciated and for you loyalists, sorry about the rant, just so disappointed in the direction Google goes. Will be my last Pixel, that's for sure. :-(",
