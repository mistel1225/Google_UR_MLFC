    "content": "I've recently noticed that the volume rocker isn't straight: there is a dent on it. I hear a click when I press the up volume. To turn the volume down, I have to press much harder, at the bottom tip of the rocker and there is no sound. I rarely use the volume control and the phone has been in a Spigen case so I only recently noticed the defect.",
