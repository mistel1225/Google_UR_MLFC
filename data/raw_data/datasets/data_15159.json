    "content": "For the past couple of months, the down volume button has been finicky. It occasionally doesn't press down. Looking at the phone sideways, I noticed that the center of the phone's screen is a slightly raised in the center compared to the corners. Over the past few months, the gap has grown wider. I have looked into the issue and it seems to be a \"swollen\" battery from a Google Pixel 3 thread. In the thread, there were mentions that the battery must be replaced or it may be unsafe. Is this the case with the Google Pixel 2XL as well and can I quickly get a repair or replacement from Google?\n2 photos are attached. One is the phone with the screen being pressed down. The other is the phone without the screen being pressed, showing the gap and distortion.",
