    "content": "Over the last 3 days I've had damaged pixels appear in the middle left of my screen, and they have very slowly been spreading, there's no obvious cause to this as the device has not suffered from water damage nor did the dead pixels appear due to dropping the phone, simply happened whilst I was in my car, any help appreciated.",
