    "content": "Transfered my apps, music, photos etc from Xperia to Pixel4a yesterday.\nAll audio files worked using Music Folder Player on previous device.\nThe Pixel skips all my M4A music and plays the few MP3's in there. \n\nAnyone having problems playing M4A's?\n\nDid a quick test, converting an (M4A) album to FLAC and that one WILL play.\nIt's encoded at 16/48.  \nMy library has a mix of different rates and bit depths, and I'm not sure if there's a specific combination Pixel dislikes or requires to play M4A.",
