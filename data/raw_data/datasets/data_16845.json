    "content": "I dropped my pixel 4xl in the water while I was fishing and it took about 2-3 mins to get it and then the screen went black but it still works when you hold the power button it vibrates like you are starting it up but it stays back. And I was wonder why it would do that when the phone is a water-resistant phone. And I look it up and got this (The Pixel 4 XL is lightweight compared with other phones its size. The phones are rated IP68 for water resistance) And then I looked up for how long and how far because it was maybe under less than a 1ft of water. And I got this(When it comes to swimming or getting caught in a monsoon, the second number is the focal point. In the case of the 8 for the Pixel 4 lineup, this means that you can take the smartphone underwater up to one meter (3-feet) deep for up to 30 minutes.) So why did my phone screen stop working??",
