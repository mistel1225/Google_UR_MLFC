    "title": "Can't charge Pixel 2. \"Analog Audio Accessory Detected\" shows up when charging cable is connected.",
    "content": "Since the fourth of January I've been having this issue of not being able to charge my phone properly. When I tried to charge the phone the \"Analog Audio Accessory Detected\" notification shows up and it is not until several minutes later and taking the cable in and out several times that the device starts charging. I disabled the USB Audio Routing and I'm still getting the notification. When the cable is not plugged in the phone has a constant 'Charging connected device via USB' notification that doesn't go away.\n\nI restarted the phone in safe mode and I'm still having the same issues.\n\nHas anyone fix this or what should be my next step?",
