    "content": "I would like to use an eSIM data plan, but I do not have the Carrier/Operator menu item necessary to scan the barcode (in Settings, Network & Internet, Mobile Network, Advanced). I have the most recent versions of Android and eSIM Manager.\n\nI see similar posts from other users, and the reason is that eSIM has been disabled in their country (for example, Australia).\n\nI bought my Pixel 3 online from the Google Store in France. Their French product page still claims to support eSIM, whereas the same page in the UK omits eSIM, implying that is not available in the UK.\n\nSo, can someone confirm that eSIM is available in France, or is the product page wrong?",
