    "content": "Pixel 3 XL, battery drains very quick and wont charge on any of my wireless chargers(including 2 different pixel stands). Started doing this after the April security update. This is actually the second pixel its done it on, the other one was warrantied because it was doing the same thing, and then got to where it would not even stay on. I didnt know it was the update that caused it until this one started doing the same.",
