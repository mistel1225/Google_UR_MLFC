Put in my SIm and verified functionality ( connected to my carrier/WiFi Working)and was happy and  so purchased it and phone was turned OFF for next one week. on next  day I noticed that the phone WON'T connect to my carrier.  in the settings IMEI is blank and baseband is  showing as UNKNOWN.  phone dialer app keep crashing  so I can't verify IMEI.
