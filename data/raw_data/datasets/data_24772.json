    "content": "As soon as I'd finished keying in a phone number, the phone's screen went completely black and could not be resuscitated, not even with power button.\nKeypad disappeared, but audio was still apparent.\nWhen call was finished, I regained the phone's display, but problem recurs every time I finish using the keypad.\nI have tried the following:\nRestart.\nPower off and on again.\nChanged display options - turned off always on display.",
