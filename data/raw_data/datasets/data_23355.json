    "content": "Ever since the most recent update, the phone app badge icon displays a 1 counter, even though I have checked my full call history and voicemails. I've tried clearing the cache and force stopping phone, but doesn't go away. I've tried rebooting and shutting down, but no change. How can I make counter reset itself?",
