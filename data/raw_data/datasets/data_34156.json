    "content": "My Pixel 2 XL Wifi slider won't even turn on! Plus it says \"No Service\" and sometimes \"No Sim\" after the latest update (December 2018), sometimes the wifi works \"sometimes\", ðŸ¤¨ the settings app freezes every time this happens! I tried taking my sim card out and even did a factory reset BUT didn't work!  I only had my phone for 3 weeks, I didn't buy it directly from Google so I returned it to the Store and after almost 3 Months, they say its a hardware fault, and since I only have paid for the Software warranty when i purchased it and NOT for the Hardware.. I have to pay $300 to replace the Motherboard. \n\nI don't know what to say, why should I pay for a manufacturing defect, and whats with the additional charge for Hardware warranty, I trusted Google's quality control, and now i have to pay $300 for the Motherboard or i''ll lose $700!! Please guys, let me know if there's something i could do.. Thanks for reading.",
