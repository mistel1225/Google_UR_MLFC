    "content": "All of a sudden yesterday, my pixel 3 is draining pretty fast. It took less than 40 min to go from 100% to 1%. When I charged through computer USB, it reached 100% within 20 min. I tried all the setting suggested, restarted several times, and finally reset to factory setting. Still, no change in behaviour. Contacted Google support and they requested me to submit the bug report. I have to wait for their response.\nDoes anyone has similar issues? Any suggestions?",
