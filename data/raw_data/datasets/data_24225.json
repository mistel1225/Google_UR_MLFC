    "content": "I followed the instructions to find the Photobooth and 2D and 3D sticker options, by going to Camera > More > Playground. But there's no Playground category under More - only sphere, lens, slow motion, and settings. I just bought the phone, and updated the software to the most current. Thanks!",
