    "content": "I used to be able to touch-hold-drag events in my Google calendar app to move events to different dates/times. \n\nAbout two months ago this feature mysteriously stopped working. I just finished a long diagnostic session with Google Support and they concluded that this feature is not supported in the standard Google calendar app on my Pixel (Pixel 2, Android 9 Build PQ3A.190705.001, Google Calendar App version 6.0.42).\n\n My colleague uses a Pixel-3 and this event-drag feature still works fine on their phone.\n\nI used this feature ALL THE TIME. it was so useful... are others noticing that it is no longer supported on Pixel-2?",
