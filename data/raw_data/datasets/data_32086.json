    "content": "My Google Pixel 3 went out of battery last night so i let it charging while i sleep. This morning while i tried to turn it on, it turned out that my phone has died. It was unresponsive. So i started to search what was going on. I read you page and tried that thing of connecting te phone, if the screen wasnt working. I was hopping that it will fix by holding the \"on\" key end the\" lower volum\" but every single option i tried in that menu the phone went back off. I can not change my phone as i bought it while i was on hollydays in Spain and i live in Argentina.\nSearching the web i found out that this has happened to several other people with Google Pixel, https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/aadshm/pixel_3_xl_died_and_wont_turn_on_again_fastboot/\n Please i have bought this phone last month after a lot of searching, please help me.
