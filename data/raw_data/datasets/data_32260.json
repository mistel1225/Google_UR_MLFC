    "content": " Hello everyone, hello Google!\nFirst of all, I want to thank you and congratulate for the amazing phone that you made.\n\nPhone of my wife was stolen yesterday (UK-London)...Today I both another one because nobody can't find it...Also, Find my phone is really useless.(Same on apple)\n\nI just want to ask about protection....As we know Google is a big company and is a pioneer in a lot amazing innovation...But I'm still surprised that you didn't provide the user some simple options on the phone...That  MUST exist on you're phones! Can we expect in any update of amazing softer something that will protect us more?\n\nAll we need is to get the question before we turnOFF phone,3g,wifi or set Airplane mode, to provide a password or touch with the fingerprint to prove your self. Or even all those drop menu options (will be available just if it's phone unlock)That will help the user to track phone or just give more time before the battery died\n\nIt's really simple to keep customers and more important customers money in their pockets and save it for some google gadgets, instead of buying phones, again,again and after that switch to cheaper brand.... \n\nIf you're alou'reready disscuss about that,can you please tell me when we can expect something like that?\n\nThat's something that will make google different. BETTER THAN OTHER!\n\nThank you,\nDjordje",
