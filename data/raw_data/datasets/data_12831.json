    "title": "Will White Balance Control Come Back for Pixel 5?",
    "content": "My pixel 3 has grown a little long in the tooth and I am thinking of upgrading to the 5. However, as many have noted previously, several years ago the camera app was severely crippled by the removal of white balance control. For a phone that takes fantastic photos it is very annoying to have them often ruined by bad white balance AI.\n\nApart from that I love my pixel, but as someone who uses my phone to list items to sell I cannot upgrade to a 5 knowing that I'm going to be running into the same problem. I am wondering if google is planning to return white balance control in the 5 or if I should look for a different phone line.",
