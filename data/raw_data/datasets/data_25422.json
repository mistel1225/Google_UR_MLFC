    "content": "Recently since an update, I cannot view anyone's contact info when I select their name in the Contacts app. All it shows is a blank space. When I go to Edit Contacts I can see all their information. At first I thought it was an issue with Dark Mode since it started around that update but it has the same issue in Light Mode. Anyone else have this problem? Screenshot below.",
