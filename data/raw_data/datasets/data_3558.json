    "content": "In the last 3 years, I have had either my Google Pixel 2 or 4, both XL, replaced 13 times. In every single instance the replacement phone I have received was refurbished. This to begin with is unfair as I purchased a brand new phone. It is through no fault of my own that these phones have been broken. The last phone sent to me was cracked upon delivery with absolutely zero damage to the box. This latest phone that is currently in the mail won't be delivered until a day after I am deployed (I live alone) so the agent explained she doesn't know what will happen to the phone since it will be undeliverable. In addition since I am being deployed for longer then the 90 days, the warranty will be expired prior to me even receiving the phone. I have contacted Google multiple times in the last 24 hours to have them call UPS to expedite the package but they refuse to do that. Has anyone else had issues like these with their Google pixels?",
