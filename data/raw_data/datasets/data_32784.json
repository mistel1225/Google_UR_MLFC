    "content": "A few weeks ago, I used my Pixel 2 to film a hard-drive shredder in action.  About 10 minutes of video.\n\nYesterday, I was looking at it and noticed a cloud icon near the top of the screen.  I tapped it and it started uploading.  Problem is, I HAVE NO IDEA HOW TO ACCESS IT.  I need to copy it to my desktop, but can't figure out where it uploaded to.  Please help.\n\nV/r,\n\nI N",
