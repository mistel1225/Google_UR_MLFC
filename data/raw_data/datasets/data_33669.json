    "content": "My Pixel 3 does not react to NFC Tags most of the time. Sometimes, it can read them after putting the Tag on for more than 30 seconds. Also pairing with my Bluetooth Headset via NFC doesn't work anymore. It worked pretty well... With Tags I don't know.\nGoogle Pay works perfectly.\n\nIs it a difference between active and passive usage of NFC?\n\nI really would like to use NFC Tags for some automated tasks.\nI also can't find any contact details for the support to ask them if i need to go to the store and get the phone changed/fixed.\n\nThanks for your help in advance.\n\nPS: Yes, I did turn the phone off and on again, NFC is on, Android Beam aswell.\nI have this issue for at least over a month now. (didn't try it before, except the headphone connection and Google Pay)\n\nAndroid Version 9, no Updates available",
