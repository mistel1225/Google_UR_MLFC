    "content": "Since the last update of the camera app about 3 weeks ago the HDR+ processing keeps hanging and never finishes. The photos are lost this way and the only way to get it working again for a couple of photos is to kill the camera app.\n\nClearing the camera app storage does not solve it, neither does rebooting or anything else i tried.",
