    "content": "Had the phone for 6 months first phone I ordered straight from Google store broke, kept freezing, glitching, speaker went, they sent me a \"refurbished\" phone which I was not pleased about since I paid extra for warranty. Now another 5 months later this phone is blacking the screen, freezes when I open to the home page, cancels call in the middle of conversation , making a call outward it won't dial, app close out randomly  , loses service randomly when service area is great, much much more issues. The phone has been in a case since sent to me with a glass screen protector. There is not a scratch or crack on the phone. Would like to send the phone back and get a refund on the purchase.",
