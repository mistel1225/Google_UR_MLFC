    "content": "My new Google pixel 4A won't read web pages that I have displayed in Chrome on the phone. I use Google assistant and say read aloud or read screen, but it replies that I don't have a web page displayed. I just moved to a pixel for a from a Moto g 7, and this feature works fine on the Moto. Am I doing something wrong, or do Google Assistant features not work on Google phones for some reason?",
