    "content": "I'm adjusting to my new Pix 3a XL having used a Galaxy S5 for some years. Specifically, I'm missing the equivalent of the S5's notification light that shows I've received a mail or an SMS. To compensate for this missing light (!), I'm trying to set a more strident notification sound on the Pix. The standard sounds, through plentiful, are not quite right, so I am trying to add my own notification sounds in the form of small mp3 files.\n\nIf I connect via USB, I can add the mp3 files to the Ringtones folder, but this folder's contents are only visible for phone (number) settings.\n\nCan anyone offer guidance to help me move my mp3's into the notifications folder, please? I have to ask because I can't locate functional suggestions using the world's best search engine :-)",
