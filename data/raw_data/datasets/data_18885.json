    "content": "When Pixel 2 is locked I can still pull down the top-line menu (where you can enable/disable Bluetooth, wifi, batter saver, etc.). I would prefer that this not be available when locked. When locked my phone can disable wifi, turn on the flashlight, enable airplane mode all by itself, just due to bouncing around in my pocket. Thanks!",
