    "content": "I at times leave my pixel 1(2016) on over-charge but it was working fine until now. Now, I removed it from full charge and after 2 minutes, it blacked out/switched off. Tried all the listed troubleshooting methods, but it won't switch on. Tried calling on my number, it says, number is out of coverage area.\nWill it switch on or it's completely gone? Does it need to be given to a service center?",
