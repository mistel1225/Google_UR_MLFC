    "content": "My Pixel 4 (that I got on Black Friday) does this weird fade out for my ringtone and Alarm. I have the volume way up, it'll start the tone loud, then fade to not even half volume after the first few seconds. I can't figure out how to change this! Please note: I'm using phone supplied ringtones for my alerts.",
