    "content": "Hello, my mother's Google Pixel isn't working properly today (Sunday 8th March). The phone isn't responding and I can't touch the left side of the screen. When I touch ?123, Shift, a, q & w nothing happens. If I open an app use it, it can jump to another app without any interaction, I tap on the screen and it registers somewhere else, pull down notifications can come down randomly. \n\nI've factory reset & booted in safe mode but nothing works, the problem still happens. \n\nHow could I fix this issue or can I get it repaired through Google? The phone is 3 years old but it just stopped working.",
