    "content": "Hello,\n\nI just purchased my Google Pixel 3 XL and i am in the process of setting up my phone. I have already moved my most used apps onto my home screen. \n\nBut i'd like to organise my app drawer by customising the order. I would like to sort my apps by colour,  not alphabetical order, it is driving me nuts atm looking at how messy it is.\n\nPlease help/advise.",
