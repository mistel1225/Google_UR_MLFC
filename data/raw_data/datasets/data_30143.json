    "content": "I'm having several power related issue on my new (less than 2 months old) Pixel 3. Here's what is happening\nBattery life is plummeting -- phone won't even last 12 hours now with ordinary usage\nI noticed the phone is running very warm for no particular reason\nPhone will not turn on if disconnected from power, regardless of power level when it turned off. If you go to charge it, it displays the dead battery icon\nPhone will not charge through the wall adapter that came with the Pixel. However, the adapter works because I can use it with over devices still\nWhen I pluck the phone into my laptop through a USB it will charge, but I get  \"power surge\" warning saying the phone is drawing more power than a USB port can supply\n\nEverything is up to date, and no apps seems to be using an unusual amount of power. I'm wondering if this could be a circuitry issue that needs a hardware fix?",
