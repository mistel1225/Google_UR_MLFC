    "content": "Hello, ever since the update to Android 11, my 3a has become more or less unusable. Way too many issues and new ways of doing things that seem a downgrade. Factory reset has not helped. I would seriously consider Google giving a way to go back to Android 10 till they fix these issues because this seems like a Beta release.  Or give an option to take my phone back and give me a used/certified/pre-owned 3a with Android 10 on it. Anything but Android 11. \n\nList of issues since the update on September 9:\n\n- Wi-Fi signal keeps dropping every 5-10 minutes\n- BT keeps dropping randomly for a few seconds (tried in car, headphones and BT speaker)\n- Battery drains a lot faster now (barely lasting a day with light to moderate use)\n- Calls drop more frequently \n- Android Auto no longer working\n- Weird flickering in screen when unlocking\n- Copy-paste does not work properly (copy text and there is nothing to paste from clipboard)\n- 2-3 second delay in camera app when you click to take a picture and when it actually takes the picture\n- Wallpaper image is not sized properly (zoomed in compared to Android 10)\n- Taking screenshots is not intuitive\n- Gesture for open apps is no longer intuitive (why do we have to learn new gestures with every release???)",
