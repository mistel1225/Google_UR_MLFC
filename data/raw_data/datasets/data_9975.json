    "content": "The November 24, 2020 update broke the Recorder app. I am using a Pixel 5 and it  doesn't record anymore. \n\nIt has microphone permissions, and I cleared data but when I try to record there's no input at all. It looks like it's recording and will save the file but there's nothing recorded. \n\nTo fix, I uninstalled the app from the Play Store, which put back the original version, and recording works fine again.",
