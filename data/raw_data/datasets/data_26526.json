    "content": "I have just fixed my Pixel charging port. Got a small paper clip and flicked the dust from the inner side of the bit in the middle. A bit of dust came out, which made all the difference. It's not the dust on the bottom and the outer sides, its the dust in the inner sides that causes the problem. Just be careful not to flick outwards to hard as you'll damage the port, however its quite strong. I just brought one of these too to stop more crap getting in there! : NEWDERY Google Pixel 3 Battery Case\n\nHope this helps.",
