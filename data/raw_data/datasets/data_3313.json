    "content": "Hey, thanks for reading this. My pixel 3a does not make any notification sound or vibration when texts come in, ring when there's a call, etc. I know that it's not on do not disturb, bedtime mode, etc. I have my notification volume all the way up, and I haven't changed any associated settings. (sounds, vibrate, etc.) It's been happening for a while, and did not change when I reset my phone a while back. Sometimes it will work, usually not. Any suggestions? I purchased it in June 2020, so I believe it's still under warranty",
