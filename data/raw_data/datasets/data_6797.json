    "content": "As I was trying to take off the phone case to change it to a new one, I guess the case was pressing on the power botton the screen turned black and it wouldn't turn off or do anything else and a message poped up on the screen saying \"Your device is corrupt. It can't be trusted and may not work properly. Visit this link on another device: g.co/ABH\". Please advise on what we can do, I just got this phone in December of 2020.",
