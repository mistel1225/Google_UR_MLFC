    "content": "I've got a strange issue with my Pixel 2. When I call anyone and their phone is connected to Bluetooth in their car, they really struggle to hear me. This happens with multiple people. If they then call me back they hear me no problem. it's only when I make the outgoing call.\n\n\nIf i call them back off another phone they hear me fine so the issue is with my Pixel.\n\nI don't have any issues with my microphone volume when calling people on land lines or mobiles directly, it only happens when they're on Bluetooth...\n\nAny ideas?",
