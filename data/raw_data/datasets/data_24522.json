    "content": "Updated latest for my Pixel 4XL. A day later my phone would randomly turn off and reboot. Last night, my phone turned off completely. When trying to turn it on, a battery icon with a red bar shows up. I plug in my charger to charge the phone thinking it's discharged. When plugged in, I can get to the google launch screen but only if I have my finger still on the Power button. As soon as I take the finger off the power button, the phone shuts off. I can't even use the bootloader, as the same results happen. Take finger off power button and phone shuts off.\n\nNow after letting it charge overnight, I can't even turn on the phone. A battery icon with a question mark shows up and that's as far as it gets before it attempts to reboot.\n\nAny ideas?",
