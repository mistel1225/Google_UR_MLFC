    "content": "Hello All,\n\nBought a Pixel 3a off ebay.\nThe device came with Android Q Beta. \nI tried to enable developers mode in order to Flash an recent build of Q OTA.\n\nRebooted the device now it doesn't boot.\n\nError is it cant find OS.\n\nI cant get into recovery mode.  But i can get into fastboot. \nIs there anything else i can try to do to restore the device?\n\nUnfortunately Fastboot command are very limited since the boot loader is locked.",
