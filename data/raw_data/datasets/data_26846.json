    "content": "I just got myself a Pixel 3 that freezes while taking pictures. Additionally, it takes many hours (or even days) for pictures to be populated in photos. \nI started a support chat, where after some very basic troubleshooting, they asked me to factory reset the phone. \nI escalated as I did not think sufficient troubleshooting was done before the ask. I was told a supervisor would get back to me. The supervisor got back to me after 1 FULL day and parroted the exact same line - just saying that they absolutely needed me to do a factory reset. If that did not fix it, they would look into what else could be done. \n\nBeing an engineer, I asked as to what other troubleshooting were they looking for. 12 hours later, he responds saying that they are trying to understand if it is a HW or SW issue. If the issue persisted, he vaguely said he would look into talking about warranty options.\n\nI have now done a factory reset and the issue still exists. I reached out via chat and was told that support cannot help as it is with a specialist. The specialist will get back to me within 24-48 hours! \n\nThere is absolutely no way to get a faster response.\n\nI am stunned that a company the size of google has such limited staff that they take 24-48 hours to respond, and they have such a poor support structure that no one deviates from a very set script - repeating and parroting the same lines again and again.\n\nAt this point, I am just frustrated with the Pixel support experience and wanted to share these experiences with the broader audience so people know what to expect!",
