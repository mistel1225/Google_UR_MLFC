    "content": "I can pair my phone to my 2016 mini Cooper but there is no audio on calls. The phone seems to pair. I can place and receive calls but audio does not come through. There is just an occasional crackle in the speakers but no audio of the call. We paired it with other brands of phones and it worked fine in both cases. It only seems the pixel won't work. I took it to the dealership and they were unable to make it work either and finally stated it must be a problem with the phone and not the car as all other phones seem to work.",
