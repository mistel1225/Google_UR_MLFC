    "content": "Ever since downloading and updating my system to Android 11 I've had nothing but problems. Including getting locked out of an app I frequently use and have a paid subscription for. Now if I were to have and iPhone or Samsung I could simply revert back to Android 10 until the bugs have been fixed. Instead I have no option to and I have to bear with the issues until they eventually sometime in the future get patched. I don't think that's fair to the customer and I'd love to have an option to uninstall an update, especially if it's causing issues on my device.",
