    "content": "Okay, all of sudden I cant cast to my none of my Chromecast in my home. I think this started after the April update. My wife pixel 2 has no issue casting to the units. I have 2 chromecast, one in the living room and other one in bedroom. I even try reformatting but it won't let me finish the setup with my phone. I can do everything okay with my wife phone. \n\nIs anyone having this issue and what was the fix for it??\n\nThanks in advance.",
