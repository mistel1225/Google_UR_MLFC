    "content": "I've upgraded from an older android which had a separate button for the apps draw rather than swipe up. I find the swipe up to get apps open hard to use, as sometimes it won't do anything, sometimes it will open recent, and sometimes it triggers the assistant. I'd like a button in the middle of the tray.",
