    "content": "The phone will not connect to the network. The phone was dropped and the LCD screen broke. We went to ufixit place and they fixed the screen but they noticed it wasn't connecting to the network. We called Verizon and they said everything was ok on there end. And ufixit checked the SIM card and it was good. They recommended we get in contact with you to find out what to do.",
