    "content": "Hello, I have a problem with my Pixel 3a.\n\nIn the overview for data usage, google play services (7.4mb), Android OS (622kb) and Google Play Store (512kb) are shown as the largest consumer.\n\nUnfortunately, it is not displayed exactly which function used the data volume, I only have 50mb a month and 7mb of that was wasted now in one day ... out of suspicion, I initially deactivated the google app on the start screen &  the mobile background data for the Play Store, is there anything else to consider?",
