    "content": "Hi, Mark! First of all I wanted to say a huge thank you for all the hard and tremendous work you've done! Especially considering that there aren't too many people at your Pixel photo team (there are around 12...18 people if I am not mistaken and I thought there were like 100 to 200 people who made this Hdr+ mode come true). There is an issue, however, related with current pixel processing. I remember you once said in your interview that pixel's processing is very tolerate to noise reduction process. I do not know whether you are aware of that or no, but pixels' noise suppression has been becoming more and more intense and now has become one of the strongest in the industry. I'm using the Pixel 1st gen by myself and recently discovered a modded app which allowed adjust the NR processing for one's liking. I was shocked. Photos became like 3 times better with only colour NR turned on. Altogether I understand that there can be some problems with the marketing department which very well may insist on making this NR process that heavy. But still. Maybe there will be a way to add a hidden toggle, like the one with the raw feature somewhere deep in the menu. Because this noise adds professionally edited look to the photos (photos taken in RAW with ,,adited to taste,, label on DPreview often has the similar look as the ones I got with this modded cam app) Thanks for your time and thank you one more time. Just so you know. You and your team inspire people! I believe in you! #teampixel!",
