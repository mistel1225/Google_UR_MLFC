    "title": "Duplicate contact after out of country travel. Not receiving messages.",
    "content": "I travel to Mexico several times a year. Now, even when I'm in the US, with some of my contacts when we are texting sometimes their texts come from their regular US phone number and sometimes their texts come from the same number but with the 044 at the beginning. When I'm in the US and I respond to the ones with the 044 they do not get those messages. There seems to be no rhyme or reason to when it comes from which phone number. \n\nAny ideas on how to fix this?",
