    "content": "Hi Google community,\n\nI just bought the Pixel 4a 5g and I've noticed that all my apps that should have access to pictures can only access my local storage. I can't find a way to default it to Google photo instead. And, honestly, I though it would be the default option since it's a Google phone.\n\nOn my previous LG G7 One (with pure android) Google Photo was the default options.\n\nIt's kind of annoying if I want to share a photo. I have to open google photo, select the picture, share it (with the good app) and go back to my app after.\n\nAny suggestions?\n\nBest regards",
