    "content": "Camera on my pixel 2xl is not working after i have updated to April security update, the camera app keeps stopping and crashing, both the front and rear cameras are not working. Its been 4 months without the camera on my phone. I have tried every troubleshooting steps including factory reset and hard reset but my issue has not been fixed! Its very disappointing from a brand like google, i think its a hardware issue, i didn't expected this from a brand like google. I always use to praise google for how good their phones are but now its over! I have contacted the google service team they said their B2X team services are not operating due to this covid situation. Google also needs to open more service centers in india.",
