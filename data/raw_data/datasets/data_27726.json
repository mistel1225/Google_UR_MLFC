    "content": "My Pixel 3 was acting weird after the Android 10 update. It seems like the phone will only charge at slower speeds. When I plugged in my phone the night before, it was at 40% and also said 1 hour and 30 minutes till full. The morning after, the phone was at 20% and also said that it will be 4 days to fully charge the phone. Never seen this before.",
