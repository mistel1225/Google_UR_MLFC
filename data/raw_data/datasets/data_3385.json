    "title": "I have purchased three pixel 4a since November of 2020 and each of them broke even with an Otterbox.",
    "content": "I don't believe that this can possibly be due to simply user negligence as each time that my phone has broken it's been wearing an Otterbox. I have had a google phone for 5 years and this is the first version that I've had issues with. I have only been able to return one to the third party retailer that I bought it from and I am getting frustrated with the options that I have to resolve my issue. I have PDF's of my receipts and I'd love to contact someone in customer service that could potentially help me, or even explain to me why I can't be helped. I now have two broken 4a's that sit on my bookshelf as a $700 paperweight and it irks me considerably.",
