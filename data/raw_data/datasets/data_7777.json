    "title": "How to prevent gesture navigation bar from blocking buttons",
    "content": "In fullscreen landscape apps, when you switch to another app and back again the gesture bar becomes permenantly \"out\" meaning it doesn't recede back into the bottom. In this position it blocks all touches at the edge of the screen. Frustrating in games where there are buttons at the edge of the screen. This completely prevents me from hitting them.",
