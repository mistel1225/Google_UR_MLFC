    "content": "My device won't stay connected to Wifi. I lose connection and lose all available networks. I have to restart the device and it will connect back to wifi but then lose it again within 10 minutes. \n\nBluetooth I am having a similar issue where bluetooth just won't turn on. I restart the device sometimes 5 times before it works. And then after a while the bluetooth will turn itself off and then I have to go through the restart process another few times in hopes it works. I have just done a factory reset and it hasn't resolved either issue.",
