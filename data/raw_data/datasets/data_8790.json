    "content": "So every time I say my son's name and call or text to my assistant it can't find him because we do not use the traditional spelling why do I have to constantly fix this I didn't have to in my last phones and also I've changed it in the dictionary my phone a hundred times and it keeps deleting it so also with voice to text when you say it it misspells it every time and it makes my kid mad because I don't catch it always and then he thinks I don't know how to spell his name fix this",
