    "content": "I have issue with my bluetooth headphones (OnePlus Wireless, AirPods, Sony MDR-ZX770BT - this one can't even connect to my Pixel 3)\n\nAll these BT headphones worked properly on my previous Samsung Galaxy S7.\n\nBT keeps dropping sometimes when WiFi changes to LTE network and when WiFi sometimes lags.\nBy the way, BT drops when there is issue with WiFi and sometimes randomly, I don't know...\n\nAnd I had that issues from the very beginning with my Pixel 3, means that firmware was initial, that comes with P3. It continues already about 3-4 months with every update came.\n\nI've even flashed ROM yesterday through fastboot, but there is no good.\n\nWhat to do?",
