    "content": "I was using my Google Pixel 3 XL to navigate and play music yesterday when it rebooted. Then it would go through the reboot phase, and before the home screen appears, it reboots again. It has been doing it since yesterday around 4pm EST. I let the battery drain itself and let it cool down. I attempted to charge it to full last night, but once it gets a slight bit of power, it continues the bootloop. Anybody have this issue or know of any solutions?",
