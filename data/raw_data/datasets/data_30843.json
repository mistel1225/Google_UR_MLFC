    "content": "My Pixel 3 XL charging port is not working anymore, I cannot charge it properly the chargers connects on one side of usb-c cable and even on that side it keeps on disconnecting and handsfree is not working at all. I tested it with a 3rd party connector and it charges just fine and doesn't keep on disconnecting.\n\nHow can I ask for Warranty Claim? I bought the Phone from Saturn in Saarbr√ºcken, Germany.\n\nPlease let me know its extremely annoying.",
