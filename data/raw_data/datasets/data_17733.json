    "content": "3 weeks ago, my rear facing camera stopped working. I read posts where it said to just download another camera app to see if It would just magically start working. It didn't. I also tried booting my phone in safe mode to see if it was another app, and it would magically start working. It didn't. I also did a factory reset on my phone, which has now caused a whole slew of other problems, and thought that might magically fix the issue. It did not. What is going on? As you can see, none of the fixes recommended by these boards has helped. Now I'm stuck not being able to use my rear camera.",
