    "content": "I have a Google Pixel 3a and still I don't receive the Android 11 update (I am in Italy region). I have colleagues with Pixel 2 that received Android 11 but my device still have Android 10. The last security update is from 5 August. I know that I can install manually the update, but i prefer to do it automatically.\nIt's normal or maybe there is a problem? Thanks",
