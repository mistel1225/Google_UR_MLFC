    "content": "How do I get rid of the ' recently used apps' or 'app suggestions' or whatever they are called. They showed up after I got Android 10 and I can't find the option to remove them. There used to be a setting to turn off app suggestions but searching through settings yields no results. How do I get rid of the 5 apps appearing at the top of this picture? Also they show up when I hit the home button to close an app which is very annoying as well.",
