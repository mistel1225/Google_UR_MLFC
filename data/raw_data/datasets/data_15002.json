    "content": "Among all the other issues with Android update. Every since I updated to 11bim having issues charging my phone. Before you give me the spill about trying different cords, I've already done that. As a matter of fact the charger I'm using for my phone is currently charging my nintendo switch. My girlfriend has the same phone however she didn't update yet. My cords work on her phone as well. Sometimes if I restart my phone it will charge. Key word being sometimes. I know it's not a hardware issue because if I turn my device off and put it on the charger it will charge. It automatically stops when I turn it on. I also get this random message on start up which I believe has something to do with it. ",
