    "content": "I have just got a Google Pixel 3 and I am really confused my the photo system.\nI like to send memes; my whole phone is full of different memes for different reactions (400 pics). On my old phone, I could create folders to organise my memes, so I didn't have to go through all of them to find the one I want to send. \nI was wondering if there is anything similar I can do for Pixel 3, so I can sort my memes into groups to send them easier on FB messager and via text, without having to go through all my photos.\nThanks",
