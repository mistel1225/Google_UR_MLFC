    "content": "I have restarted my phone several times and uninstalled updates to Chrome. I recently updated to Android 11.\nI still can't search for GIFs within Messages, and while I can get to websites, the websites don't have proper functionality (I am unable to access information within them by clicking on links embedded within websites).\nThe ability to take a screenshot is also gone now.\nI am also unable to download podcasts (using Castbox app).\nIssue just started a couple of hours ago.",
