    "content": "When I check the battery usage at, lets say 50% remaining battery level I would expect that all apps listed in the \"Battery usage\" sum up to a 50%, so that together its 100%.\n\nPercentages on my phone never sum up to 100% (usage of all apps is only about 20% at 50% of battery level), suggesting that some usage is unregistered by the app.\nIt's it correct and the system is actually not recorded as battery usage?",
