    "content": "Does Google offer a means of easily rolling back Android 11 to 10 without a clean install? \n\nAndroid 11 has ruined what was otherwise the best phone ive ever owned. \n\nAndroid Auto completely does not work now, the app will open but my car doesn't even register the phone now (worked flawlessly on 10 last week) \n\nBattery Life is horrendous, roughly 2/3 of the performance it was on Android 10 \n\nAlso not sure who decided to change the screenshot button bit that was also very unwelcomed. \n\nThe phone was purchased last year, its under warranty, Google have an obligation to fix this, the device is now defective.",
