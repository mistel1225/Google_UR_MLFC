    "content": "Hi, so I purchased a Google pixel 3 second hand online and when I received it, the bootloader was unlocked and when I went into recovery it says that it's a dev debug unit apparently.. I have tried to factory rest, install official it's and official firmware install through adb, but absolutely nothing works. I just want a stock experience with stock Android. I cannot even update/use some Google apps and I cannot update the phone as it's stuck on Android 10 with June Security patch. Can anyone help me?",
