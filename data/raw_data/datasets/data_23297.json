    "title": "Pixel 4 - Face Unlock No Longer Works After January Security Patch",
    "content": "It appears that after the January security patch that the Face Unlock feature no longer works.  Attempts to unlock with my face result in a \"Can't verify face\" message at the bottom of the lockscreen.  \n\nI've tried deleting face data and setting it up from scratch but that does not fix it.  I was hopeful the February patch would include a fix for it but no luck.  It's been an issue for over a month now.  \n\nAnyone have any advice on how to resolve this?",
