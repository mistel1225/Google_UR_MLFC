    "content": "My Pixel2 doesn't connect to wifi suddenly. It detects the wifi signal, but won't connect at all. Everytime I try to connect, it just says fail to connect to network. It also seems to have forgotten stored wifi network, as I need to input my home wifi password every time. I checked my Bluetooth and it's functioning.",
