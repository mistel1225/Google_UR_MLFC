    "content": "Often times when I am typing on chrome the prior window or another tab just appears over the window I am on. So I will tap a text field and no longer be able to see until I edit the text. It is incredibly frustrating and the issue happened both on my pixel 4xl and now a pixel 5. How do I fix this?",
