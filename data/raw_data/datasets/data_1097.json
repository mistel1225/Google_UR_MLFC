    "content": "I have read many complaints here concerning this problem. None seem to have been resolved. I have had this complaint about my Pixel 4a phone since shortly after I purchased it. \n\nThe problem is people will leave me messages but I do not receive any notification until I navigate to the voicemail page of the phone app or sometimes when I reboot the phone. This is usually well after what would be considered a reasonable period of time to return a call. \n\nThis is such a basic function of a telephone I am stunned that Google hasn't resolved the problem. Currently I am forced to regularly check the voicemail app. \n\nI have read and tried all of the recommended \"fixes\" to no avail. Installing the T-Mobile visual voicemail app only seems to make the problem worse.",
