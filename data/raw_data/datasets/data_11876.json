    "title": "Audio constantly skipping when Assistant is turned on (Android 11 on Pixel 3a)",
    "content": "As an answer to my support ticket, and as a common response to my previous thread on the subject, I was told to deactivate Assistant to remove the constant audio skipping when the screen is locked. This problem occurred with all audio apps. \n\nOnce deactivating Assistant, the problem ceased, and after a few weeks I re-enabled Assistant and the problem reappeared. Having to choose between Assistant and frequent audio skipping is extremely infuriating and must be addressed by the Google Support team.\n\nAre there any solutions you've found?",
