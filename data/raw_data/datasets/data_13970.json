    "content": "I have just upgraded from my pixel 3xl to the pixel 5. I cannot believe how the front camera (also back) photos look on Snapchat, Instagram and WhatsApp. \n\nIt's shocking and really bad. For a flagship phone that cannot do basic social media in 2020 it's terrible.  The photos look completely different and morphed after you click the shutter button (not in a good way at all, nothing like my pixel 3xl). The photos for the most part come out looking soft and very noisy. \n\nI know people may say it's down to the app developer, but I don't understand how it can be so much worse than my Pixel 3XL. Will be returning and switching to an S20 (which I tested and is fineish).",
