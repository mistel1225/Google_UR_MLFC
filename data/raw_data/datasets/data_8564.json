    "content": "Dear All!\n\njust recently I bought a brand new Pixel 4a which is now distributed with Android 11.\nWhen I was at home I was able to connected to any Wi-Fi network but I have just came to work now offshore and trying to connect to our vessel Wi-Fi.\n\nI have only Login and Password to connected to the Wi-Fi. There is no Domain or it is Unknown as far as I know and as I can see from the terminal on my laptop.\n\nThe system (Android 11) keeps requesting Domain from me and since I cannot provide it refusing connecting. \n\nI need to get Wi-Fi up and running on my Pixel to be able to stay online in some messengers.\n\nI would appreciate you help.\n\nAlex",
