    "content": "I turn off my phone every night before I go to sleep and it's been 3 or 4 times that in the morning when I turn on the phone it goes into a loop. I keep seeing the Google logo on and on until I restart the phone by pressing power and volume down buttons and only then the phone actually turns on. I don't understand why it suddenly started to act this way ðŸ˜­",
