    "content": "As like many of us, I have various Folders on my P5 homescreen.  To be precise, one named Forums, for some reason, today the whole folder is gone completely, just a gap where it was.\n\nNot sure if it's coincidence or not, but this happened after I done a OTA security update.\n\nAnyway, I do replicate everything that's on my P5 on my Samsung Galaxy Tab S7+, so I just sent a email to myself with a link to each Forum website and then saved them again on my P5 and now have my Forum Folder on my homescreen with all the various Forums I frequent.\n\nIs there a way that I cannot accidently delete this or any Folder on my homescreen again with it asking me something like \" Are You sure\" ?  \n\nI must have long pressed this by mistake and dragged it to the Remove option that pops up at the top of the screen....hard to do by mistake, I think, but its happened.  What has also happened in the past, is that a Folder on my homescreen moves to the next screen, again, must be me doing it by mistake.  So a option to prevent both these scenarios from happening again would be great.\n\nHope you get what I'm on about, any suggestions ?\n\nThanks",
