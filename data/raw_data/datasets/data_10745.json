    "content": "Droid \"Smart Text\" has disappeared from my Pixel2, possibly due to an update? This is the feature that when you select text on the screen, it smartly interprets whether you want to dial that number (dialer pops up) , or look up that address (map pops up) or go to a particular website (chrome opens). Any ideas on how to get it activated again. There is no setting I can find called Smart Text.",
