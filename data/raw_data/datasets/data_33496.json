    "content": "I am trying to turn on location services in order to pair my phone with my TV.\n\nCurrently, my Location is turned off. When I go to the Location settings, either via the Google setting tab or the Security tab (I have tried both), the bar which says \"Use location\" is grey, and the little switch that indicates whether it is off or on is to the left, meaning it's off. However, when I tap the switch to turn location on, it doesn't work. The bar changes to blue, but the switch stays to the left, so it's still off (see screenshots). Tapping it again does nothing, it cannot be turned on. If I back out of the settings and go back in, location is still off, the bar is grey again, and the switch is still to the left.\nI've tried repeatedly to change it, and have tried turning my phone off and on then trying again, no difference.\n\nScreenshots provided show before and after trying to turn it on.\n\n\n\nI'm in no particular rush to resolve this, but if someone can provide some assistance, it would be much appreciated. Thanks!",
