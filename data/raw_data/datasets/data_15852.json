    "content": "Where to begin. First a for most part my phone is basically bricked when I'm not connected to wifi. Mobile Data doesn't work since the update so no apps load unless on wifi. It says I have data but will not connect with LTE, so I cannot send or anything unless connected to Wi-Fi. Recent apps are automatically cleared. Notifications are auto cleared. Notification icons don't appear in the status bar. The only way to know if I've received a notification is if the app has the notification dot next to it. Bluetooth doesn't work. The drop-down settings bar will not drop all the way.\n\nSo basically when I'm not on WiFi I don't have a Smart Phone, I have a very nice camera.",
