    "content": "Since I updated my phone to android 11 the battery has been dying faster I only used my phone for about an 1 hour 30 mins and it's already at 10%. it's also been glitching really bad. bubbles is also not working for me even though I've done all the necessary steps to turn it on. I'm not sure if this is just my phone or if it's a problem other people are having.",
