    "content": "Hey guys, I'm currently waiting on my Iphone lease from Sprint to end so I can buy the phone and trade it in for a new phone. I've been looking around, and while the Note 9 is a nice option, I was also eyeing the Pixel 3XL. I would like to hear from Pixel 3/3XL owners to see how has the device aged, and has a lot of the major issues (memory issues, camera bugs) been resolved, or should I look elsewhere for a phone? \n\n Thanks!",
