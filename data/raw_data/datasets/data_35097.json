    "content": "Playing podcasts on my iphone 6s to my car (Chev Equinox) shows podcast name, episode number, date, and time played/time left bar. With my new Pixel 3 xl none of that information is shown; it just says \"bluetooth audio\" on the car display while the podcast is playing. I have tried 4 different podcast apps and it's the same with all of them.",
