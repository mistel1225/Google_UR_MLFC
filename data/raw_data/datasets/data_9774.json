    "title": "can I use wireless headpnes with mic for phone calls",
    "content": "I have a friend who calls me for about 2 hours quite regularly. I don't want the phone in my hands for that amount of time, so I'm getting some headphones with a mic. Then It occurred to me, could these be wireless? For phonecalls, not listening to music. So the bluetooth needs to send and receive messages - my voice to the phone through the mic as well as sending his voice to my headphones from the phone, so we can hold a conversation. The phone can hopefully be on the side table while I do the washing up, tidy up, ironing etc. Is this possible, how do I do it and do I need special battery powered headphones and / or different phone? Thanks!",
