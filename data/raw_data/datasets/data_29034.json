    "title": "Audio and recording not working since Android 9",
    "content": "Hello,\n\nSince updating to Android Pie I have been having audio issues with my phone.  Using the speakers, or headsets do not produce any audio, I've tried 6 different headsets.  I also have an issue with recording any audio, and when I answer or use anything with mic functions it causes my phone or the app to crash (phone app included).\n\nI purchased a Bluetooth headset as I noticed audio could be produced via a Bluetooth device, however recording from that device still results in a crashed app or phone.\n\nI have tried a factory reset, as well as reflashing the OTA recovery for Sailfish.\n\nI am using a 32gb Google Pixel purchased under Telus, in Sept of the inaugural launch year in Canada.\n\nI am now located and living in Auckland, New Zealand and there are no designated repair services out here.\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated.\n\nJason",
