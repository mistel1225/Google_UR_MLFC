    "content": "A few days ago I noticed that the screen was turning itself on randomly without touching it. I did the security update after the issue started hoping that it would fix the problem. I have looked through all of the settings trying to find something that was causing the issue. I leave my phone sitting next to me on my desk throughout the day and the screen lights up at random intervals wasting battery power. This is not caused by new notifications, its random. Anyone having the same issue or know of a fix?",
