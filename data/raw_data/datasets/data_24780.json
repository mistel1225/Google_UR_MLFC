    "content": "Hello, I bought a Pixel 3A. The front facing camera is blurry, when taking a selfie, it won't autofocus. When taking a selfie, my face is blurry and the background is usually sharp. I guess it shouldn't be like this. I tried everything, cleaning the lens didn't help, also tried some camera apps from play store with manual focus to see if it may help, but manual focus wasn't available. What can I do? I live in Poland, so I can't just return the phone (we don't have official Google Store), my sister bought it for me in Germany",
