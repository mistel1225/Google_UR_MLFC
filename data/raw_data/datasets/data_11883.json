    "content": "My fingerprint sensor on my Pixel 3XL hasn't been functioning properly. It's weird, I have the setting on where if you swipe down on the fingerprint sensor it will show the notifications (just as if you swiped down from the top of the screen) and that works flawlessly. However, when I try to set up my fingerprint, the device will say the sensor is dirty or sometimes it won't read my fingerprint at all. Does someone know if this could be a hardware, software or some other type of issue.",
