    "title": "Different vibration patterns for different contacts",
    "content": "When I receive text notifications while my phone is on vibrate, the vibration pattern differs depending on which contact is texting me.  One of the vibration patterns is two very long vibrations in a row, and I want to change all contacts to use the other pattern (two shorter vibrations).  I don't want different patterns.  But I cannot figure out how to change it, or how the longer pattern even got created and assigned to a few specific contacts only.",
