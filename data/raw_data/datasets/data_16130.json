    "content": "My phone volume is 100. Yet when I call somebody, the first few seconds I can't hear what the other side is saying and then gradually sound goes up. Same with the video, I can't listen to first 10 seconds of the video and then the sound gradually increases. My volume for all is full. Not sure what is causing this issue. I recently updated to Android 11",
