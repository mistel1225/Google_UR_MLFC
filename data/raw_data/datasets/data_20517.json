    "title": "AUDIO LOW WHEN SWITCHING ON EQ SETTINGS",
    "content": "Hi,\n\nHas anyone come across a problem when using the audio player via Bluetooth headphones?\n\nI'm currently using the Play Music App and thought I'd adjust the bass, mid range and treble to my liking.\n\nHowever, as soon as I switch on the EQ, the sound dramatically changes.  The volume decreases and sounds terrible.\n\nSo I go to the 'user' setting and increase the graphics higher to increase sound levels.  It does the total opposite and makes the volume even quieter as if there's a major limiter on the EQ's\n\nNow in my experience when adjusting EQ's, like the Bass, Mid & Trebles, they get louder, just like on DJ Decks. \n\nWhy does the EQ on the phone decrease sound quality and make it sound appalling?\n\nI even downloaded another App and used the EQ settings on that App (had the option to use the app EQ or the phones EQ) and still had the same issue when using both.\n\nAnd I've turned off Absolute Volume which has done sweet F.A. so that's re-enabled. \n\nAny reason why I cannot enjoy music how I want it.  And I'd also like to try and increase the volume too but that sounds limited too. \n\nI can only assume devices now have limiters for health and safety reasons (not like the old days where an MP3 player was actually deafening)\n\nAny idea's how I this can be improved.\n\nI'm also getting the same issue when using Bluetooth in the car with the EQ on and on Soundbars.  Basically anything that connects Bluetooth.\n\nI can't check it out with a jack cable as I don't have the adapter any more as it broke after 5 days of using it.\n\nThank you",
