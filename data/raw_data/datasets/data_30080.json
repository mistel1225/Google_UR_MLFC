    "content": "My pixel 3a which is less than 10 days old keeps restarting on its own. I got to know this when it asked for pin instead of fingerprint if I try to unlock the device. Not sure, why this is happening with all upto date software & apps installed.  My batter is completely charged & no issue with the case that i have on it. \n\nanyone else facing same problem?",
