    "content": "I have the dark theme set on my pixel phone. I use my calendar widget. Currently the widget has bad color choices when displaying different events from different email accounts. I have an exchange and a gmail set and colors are so bad I couldn't read it. It is specifically bad for dark mode. \n\nI have attached a picture to show the problem. The background and the text are dark and so the contrast is less. Because of this it is hard to read. Especially when the brightness is reduced it becomes very hard to read on the phone.\n\nAny way I can change the color schemes ?\n\n ",
