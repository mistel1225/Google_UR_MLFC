    "title": "How do you go back multiple pages on chrome, or go forward? Pixel 5",
    "content": "I know you can go back by swiping either left or right, but that only takes you back one page. Some sites are crap and if you look at a few photos they count as separate pages so I have to swipe ten times to get back to the original site or Google search. Just switched from IPhone where you held down the back button and your history popped up so you could quickly get back to where you want. Also, I don't know if there is a way to go forward? Sometimes I like to flip back and forth while reading articles",
