    "content": " I was wondering if this is in any way normal for the pixel phone screen. I've only had it for like a day and haven't even used it. \nThere seems to be this faint white shade in the center of the screen. \nAt max brightness / using the phone in a bright place or when using a multicolored wallpaper it's barely noticeable but at night / when the brightness it lowered down, one can easily detect it. Thanks in advance!\n\nFirst Photo = Max Brightness\nSecond = Low Brightness\nThird = Pointing out the issue. ",
