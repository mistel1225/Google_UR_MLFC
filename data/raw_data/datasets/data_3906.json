    "content": "Hi, I woke up this morning and my phone battery was at 20%, which is strange because I left it plugged charging all night as usual (Using original cable/charger and the outlet is working). I tried cleaning the USB-C port, rebooting it, using a different charger, connecting it to my PC with a USB-A cable, and nothing worked. it will not charge period.    Afraid that i will run out of battery I turn it off and surprisingly it charges while it is off (It even charges fast, its not slow). I did noticed that initially while it is off and plugged to the charger the screen will show the charging logo then it will go to another screen that show the percentage of charge and cycle repeat that for like a minute or 2, then the screen will turn off and I would check the battery level by connecting and disconnecting the charger. it does charge all the way to 100% but once I turn it on and try to connect the charger it does not charge. like it doesn't recognize the charger. plugin it to the computer doesnt work ether, the PC would not recognize the device.",
