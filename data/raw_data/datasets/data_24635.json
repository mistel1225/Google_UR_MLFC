    "content": "I just accidentally dropped my Pixel 4 from about 50 cm distance to the ground. The phone worked just fine after the drop but suddenly a thin pink vertical line came out from no where. Does the vertical line appeared because of my Pixel 4 is a defected unit or because of the drop? \n\nIs there any warranty that i could claim?",
