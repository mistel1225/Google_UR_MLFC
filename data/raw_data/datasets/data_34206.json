    "content": "Hi there. My Google Pixel 2 has suddenly started to have issues with the lock screen. Every so often, it will allow me to put in my pin but then freeze when I go to press the tick to enter it. Today I had this issue for over an hour where it was either not letting me in or saying 'wrong pin' even though the pin was correct. Obviously this rendered the phone completely useless. Over an hour later and it miraculously let me in again! I have now adjusted the settings so that there is no security on my phone but I wouldn't want to leave it like this. Any ideas on what I should do?",
