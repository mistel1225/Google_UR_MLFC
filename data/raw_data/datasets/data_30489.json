    "content": "I have restarted my phone. I have made sure that my cell data and Wi-Fi data are on and accessible. I can send texts and receive texts as long as there are no pictures. If there is a picture sending or receiving it just keeps spinning and saying sending. I was able to send and receive pictures in my text messages before the most recent update.",
