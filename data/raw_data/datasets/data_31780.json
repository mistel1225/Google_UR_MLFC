    "content": "I have a slave router set up in my home on a different SSID to my main router. Has been fine for about 6 months. Started having issues when my partner changed from a Iphone to a Pixel. (May be completely unrelated as the Iphone, Sky box and laptops still work on the slave network!) Now every time we try to connect to the slave all we get its this. I have reset the entire network and it still comes up with the same error. Have tried a lot of forums online but still can't get back onto it!\n\nAny ideas??",
