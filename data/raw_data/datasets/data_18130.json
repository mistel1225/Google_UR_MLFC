    "title": "Camera - Sequence Composition using 4K video",
    "content": "Some Panasonic Lumix cameras allow you to shoot a 4K clip, and then build an image they call a Sequence Composition.  Sequence Composition selects multiple frames from a video clip and stacks that into a single image (for obvious reasons the camera needs to be stationary).\n\nI've seen Google Photos do this a few times with a burst of photos. \n\nI think it would be a cool feature to add to the neato capabilities the Pixel has.",
