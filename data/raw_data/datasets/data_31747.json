    "content": "If I record video with Pixel 3 and Filmic Pro the audio track plays too fast when viewed on an iPad Pro. This is regardless of any change in audio resolution or frame rate settings in the FP and it is making it impossible to use the Filmic pro app.  I’ve replicated the same issue on 3 Different Pixel 3 phones. My old Hauwei p10 does not have the problem. Filmic Pro say they are aware of the problem and the issue is with Google but despite much searching, I’ve not come across other people reporting a similar issue. Can anyone shed any light on what might be happening. I really want to use the Filmic Pro App but it clearly isn’t compatible with the Pixel 3.",
