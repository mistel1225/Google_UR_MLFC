    "content": "On my new Pixel 5 the speaker sound varies wildly. From muffled and barely heard, to loud and clear, to everything in between. It does this regardless of whether It's a voice phone call, music playing, or an alarm. Is this a hardware or software issue and how do I fix it? This doesn't happen when I use earbuds only from the speakers from the device itself.",
