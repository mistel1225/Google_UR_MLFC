    "content": "When I try to browse for local images on my phone from an app (i have tried with 3 so far and it happens with all of them) I get taken to the image browse screen (RECENT, ordered by MODIFIED) but nothing appears. If I then try to change from RECENT to IMAGES the app freezes as soon as I tap IMAGES. I then get the option to wait or close the app and waiting does nothing so my only option to exit the app. This happens every time I try to browse for images.",
