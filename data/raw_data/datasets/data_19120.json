    "content": "This question has been asked before but wondering if there are extra steps I can take.  I have a pixel 4 stuck on the google G loop boot up screen.  I pressed the factory reset buttons but as soon as i release my fingers to press again for a selection, the device attempts to reboot again.  Is there a trick in the factory reset process to make a selection.  I plan on calling customer service tomorrow when they are open but hoping for a simple fix as I use my phone for work.",
