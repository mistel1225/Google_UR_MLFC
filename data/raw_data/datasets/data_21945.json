    "content": "Hello,\nI noticed differences in the Data usage (both WiFi and mobile) report if checking it through WiFi settings or App settings: Google Play Services, in the last month, consumed:\n- through App Settings: 34MB\n- through WiFi Settings: 12,86GB\n  Is it normal such a difference?\nMay it be responsible of the battery drain I notice while casting Netflix, YouTube, Spotify etc to my chromecast (correctly detected by Google Home)?\n\nI attached the screenshots containing the data I cited (, WiFi Settings, WiFi Settings)\n Thanks for any suggestion.\nFlavio\n\nApp Settings:\n\nWiFi Settings:",
