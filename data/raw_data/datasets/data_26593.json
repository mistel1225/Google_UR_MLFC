    "content": "Android Q Beta 6 can add eSIM (I guess), but Android 10 official does not have to add eSIM. I suspect that Google Pixel 2 can use eSIM ? (non-Google Fi ) because some people say that his pixel 2 can scan the QR code to use eSIM ( he uses Android 10 official)\n\nPixel 3 can use eSIM network in Thailand but Pixel 2... I'm not sure.",
