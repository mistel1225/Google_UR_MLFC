    "content": "My phone started dying around 40% after almost one and a half year of normal usage. Never played any games or watched many videos or stuff. Just photos and normal chat apps. From 40% it suddenly drops to 14%, then in a matter of seconds to 5, 3 ,1 and 0%.\nI have tried to reset it to factory settings, it didnt't work. There's also no app that eats too much battery.\n\nWhat can I do?",
