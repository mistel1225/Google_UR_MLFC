    "content": "For some reason, I do not have an option to turn on Sunrise Alarm when my 3 XL is docked on my Stand. I just don't have the option in the settings menu. I have tried to forget the Stand and reconnect. No luck. I think it has something to do with a setting somewhere but I can't find it. See picture to see what I see when I go into the Stand settings. Any help is appreciated. Thanks. ",
