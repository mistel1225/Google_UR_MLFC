    "content": "I keep picking up my phone to find that it has shut down, I have only had the phone for 4 days and have had to turn it back on eight times already. I'm not sure if somehow I'm accidentally turning off the phone or if this is an issue with the pixel five.  It doesn't seem to be overheating, though it does get warmer than I anticipated with regular use.",
