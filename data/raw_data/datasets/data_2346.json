    "content": "I was videocalling someone on snapchat then suddenly my phone shuts down. After switching on I got a notification that my phone was shutdown due to heat and now it is working fine. Then I quickly removed the cover to let it cool. I felt a bulge at the back of my phone then I looked at the side and the display is off of the body slightly bulging. I think maybe the battery is swollen. What should I do? Please help anyone.",
