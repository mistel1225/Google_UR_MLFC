    "content": "My phone suddenly lost its ability to load Google AMP pages. When I click on a link from Google search, the page would come up and at the bottom, it will say signed in as xxxxx@gmail.com and the Google circle will keep turning and turning. After sometime, the page freezes and I can't continue scrolling to read the article. Any suggestions?",
