    "title": "How to get \"Pop\" option back on photos my Pixel treats as portraits?",
    "content": "It appears Photos tries to figure out whether the photo I'm editing is a portrait or not a portrait.\n\nWhen a photo is a portrait, I get three options to play with when editing the photo in Photos: Light, Color, and Blur.\nWhen a photo isn't a portrait, I get three options: Light, Color, and Pop.\n\nSometimes, however, I have a \"portrait\" photo that isn't really just a portrait. In these cases, Blur destroys anything in the photo that isn't a face, which is bad. And sometimes, Pop would be useful to have for these images (or any images, really).\n\nHow do I take a photo that has already been captured, and which Photos thinks is a portrait, and force Photos to let me edit with the Pop slider instead of the Blur slider?",
