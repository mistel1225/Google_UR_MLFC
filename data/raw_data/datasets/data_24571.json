    "content": "I dropped my pixel 3a in some water for 2/3 seconds - after turning it off for a few hours, it works as normal apart from the sound. I can use headphones to listen to music (not tried phoning yet) but normal sound without headphones does not work. \n\nIs it a case of leave it somewhere warm and hope for the best? Thank you!",
