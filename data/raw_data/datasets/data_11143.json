    "content": "I was running out of room on my pixel 3 64 GB, so I cleared out 10 gig of photos and a whole bunch of apps I no longer use at the end of it all I had around 20 GB free space. about a half hour later I go to use my phone and see that it is 90% full. I look to see where all my free space has went and notice my \"system\" folder is at 38 GB which seems high, when I started to clear space I believe it was at 17 GB. can anyone tell me how to look and see what is going on and clear some free space. do I need to do a factory reset to bring things back to normal.\n\nThanks",
