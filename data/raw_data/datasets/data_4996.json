    "content": "On most phones for the history of phones. Moving your phone to silent or vibrate meant calls and notifications were silenced or set to vibrate without sound. I just upgraded from a Pixel 3a to 4a and find that, what, this is no longer the case. Instead I find all manner of cheery support articles talking about how I can simply go-to messages, settings, advanced and turn of message notifications back there?! Why would I do that?! When setting my phone to silent should make the DAMN THING SILENT.\nCan you tell I'm quitting nicotine? This is genuinely ruining my week and I know that's stupid but still!",
