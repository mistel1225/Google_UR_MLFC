    "content": "Sometimes when I'm on a call and connected to WiFi, audio stops working on my side of the connection.\n1. When on WiFI, even though it doesn't seem like the WiFi connection is dead, I will not be able to hear the other person when I'm on a call.\n2. The other person can still hear me. \n3.
