    "content": "I've become aware of the issue over the past 4 days.  Notified Fi support multiple times with detailed logs, but follow-up has been very poor.  Support teams (all outside the US) continue to be courteous, but completely uninformed and unhelpful.  Have been assured that it's a known issue that has been \"escalated\", but no further clarity on fix date.  Second time in 3 months that my Fi service has encountered serious service problems.  Disappointing that Google is unable to provide reliable basic service to receive incoming calls.\nDoes anyone know of a fix?",
