    "content": "My pixel 4 XL has.a rather annoying issue that has been happening for about two months now.  Whenever I switch apps or scroll the screen will go black for a split second and then turn back on.  It's almost like I'm locking/unlocking the phone using the power button really quickly.  \n\n I can not reliably reproduce the problem and it doesn't happen all the time but it does happen many times each day.  I have tried forcing 90hz all the time but that does not solve the problem so I don't think the problem is related to switching from 60/90hz refresh.\n\nI do have the display size set to \"small\" so I can fit more on the screen.  Any ideas what the cause of this is?  Any guidance is much appreciated.",
