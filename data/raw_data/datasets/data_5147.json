    "content": "Hi. When I plug a charging cable in to my pixel 3 nothing happens on screen to suggest it is charging. It is charging but very very slowly - takes all night to get to 100%. I've updated system, all apps, have tried various soft resets and have restored factory settings with no change to the charging issue. Any ideas?",
