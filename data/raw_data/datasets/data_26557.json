    "content": "My new Pixel 3 does not work on our Panasonic Bluetooth connect-to-cell home phone system (No voice or ringing through to hand set). Other cell phones, including Nexus 5x, Moto x4, Android one, work fine. Has anyone successfully connected their Pixel 3 to one of these systems (specific make and model please) or know why Pixel 3 doesnâ€™t work with these systems? Any workarounds?",
