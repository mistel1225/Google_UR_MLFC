    "content": "Hello forum,\nJust purchased a pixel 3a xl a week ago, have been pleased with my choice until it temporary froze this morning,  I looked up pixel forum and was told to hold power button for about 30 secs, and it worked after about 10 secs of hold , prior to that when I connected original charging cable to device,  wasn't any response til the holdimg part, all's fine now, my concern is what caused the glitch whilst it's Stil a new phone, and in the help site it said could be apps that was downloaded, haven't downloaded much as I want to keep it clean and smooth, could it be Kaspersky ? a security app that I have downloaded, does pixel need another app like this ? Or is it sufficiently protected, or any other possible cause  ? Thank You,  wil look out for replys",
