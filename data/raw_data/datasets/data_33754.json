    "content": "I sent my device back to Google in September, the courier lost the replacement and around 8 weeks later google finally shipped me an alternative replacement but this one was blacklisted and so unusable, I sent it back and Google attempted to send me another one but the tracking got stuck once I attempted to get it delivered on a specific date so this too went back to Google. I finally found a depot number for the courier (something google couldn’t provide me with and UKmail don’t believe in human call centres or replying to customer queries) so when device was shipped again I called but it never made it to the depot (google assured me it had) but they’d shipped it to the wrong address (I gave them a temporary address for when I was on holiday when they were trying to send a replacement for the blacklist device but asked them to remove it). I’ve asked them how I get access to my personal file to ensure they have removed the address this time and I’ve asked them when they will resend me a device but they just ignore me now. I’ve offered to take compensation instead of a device (£200 - £150 device plus 5 months of device repayment costs) but they’ve refused. What can I do? I just want a working device and google won’t send me one. It’s been nearly 6 months, I move soon and I’m worried they will automatically send it to my current address without checking or the temporary address which is even worse because it was my father in laws and he’s recently died!",
