    "content": "I just changed my phone from Samsung Note 10 to Google Pixel 4a. The 4G Internet does not run smoothly on this device. I did not experience this problem on my previous phone. I got a new Sim card issued and then, then the same problem persists. Internet works but it is choppy. It disappears and then I have to switch off data and switch it back on. Have to do this back and forth every few minutes until I connect to WiFi. Banking applications also do not run with 4G. Not sure what needs to be done.",
