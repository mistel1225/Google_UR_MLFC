    "content": "To be clear, I am NOT trying to connect to the internet. I have an app that remotely controls something at my work, but I have to be connected to a particular wifi network to use it. That wifi network is not connected to the internet, nor should it be. \n\nCurrently, when I connect to the network in question, my Pixel 3 will continuously disconnect and reconnect to the network (obviously trying to find internet) for more than a full minute before giving up. Only then, can I actually use the network, if I also disable cell network connectivity. \n\nI just want to know how I can force my Pixel 3 to just stay connected in the first place and not keep resetting its connection to being with. \n\nThank you.",
