    "content": "Incoming calls are going straight to voicemail, and do not show up in my call history.\nI have checked the network settings, restarted phone, cleared the app cache, and made sure do not disturb was not on. Monkeyed with all of the phone settings (turn on/off spam and call screening etc.) The SIM card is new, I have tried changing the network setting from Global to LTE/CDMA. \nI also checked for updates.\nNothing works.  I have never had coverage or call issues with any of my previous phones.  Outgoing calls work fine.",
