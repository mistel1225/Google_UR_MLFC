    "content": "A previous Phone App version killed my 'Call Screening'.  Then a later app restored that function.\n\nNow it has disappeared again.  I can't even add the phone app version number as it only shows up on recent updates. \n\nThe Android operating system is a joke.  In theory with a Pixel 3a fully patched, I should have no issues, and I can't even use it as a phone.",
