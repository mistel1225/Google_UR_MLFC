    "content": "I have a Pixel 3 XL that will not complete an update. \n\nThe phone was joined in the android beta program and then I changed my mind and left it. I am thinking maybe this is why the update is failing? \n\nI tried signing back up for the beta program and checking for updates and that update fails as well. \n\nI have not tried wiping the device. I don't want to lose all of my settings and everything if I don't have to.\n\nUnfortunately Android does not give me any kind of helpful insight into what is happening so I can properly ask for help.",
