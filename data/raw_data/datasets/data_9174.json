    "content": "I have a Pixel 2. After a recent software update, the camera app is crashing and I cannot use my camera in any app. The camera app opens, freezes, and closes. I have done everything. Cleared cache and storage, reset phone to factory settings, went into developer mode to submit a bug report, chatted and passed around 8 different Google people, unselected all the camera permissions, turned on airplane mode, etc. The camera will still not work. Does anybody have any other fix? Google denies a massive issue and only states that I should take the phone to a repair store. The problem started immediately after a software update, so I do not understand how this is a hardware issue. Any ideas or magic fixes? Or, is this simply Google's way to brick my camera to push me to buying a new phone? The last agent told me they had several great deals going on (sarcasm I hope)...",
