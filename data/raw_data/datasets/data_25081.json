    "content": "A few weeks ago i noticed on snapchat when taking photos there is a random spot. The spot also shows up on all applications for the rear camera. This spot isnt like other posts ive found when searching, as this isnt a dark shade spot, it can be zoomed in on when taking a video or picture and has separation. I cant see anything from the outside so unsure if this is dust stuck inside or sensor damage somehow.\nhere are some examples, any help would be appreciated\nhttps://imgur.com/a/kwx80nQ",
