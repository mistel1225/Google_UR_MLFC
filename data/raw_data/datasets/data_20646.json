    "content": "When I tried to unlock my Pixel 2 today I couldn't! The screen had gone black. I did a reset holding in the power button and I could unlock again but if I left the phone locked for any length of time it just froze again. \n\nI tried various things. It will lock and unlock if charging or connected to Bluetooth headphones. I tried wiping my phone and a factory reset but I am still having the same issue. Could this be a software glitch?",
