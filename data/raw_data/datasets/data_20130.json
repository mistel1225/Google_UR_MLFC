    "content": "Hello. I am not able to change the video resolution on google pixel 2 to 720p hd. I think 1080p is too high and I dont need it. In the past it was possible to shoot in 720p but I cant find the option. Is it ever coming back or is there a way to change it in the new google camera? I cant uninstall the updates from the camera app.",
