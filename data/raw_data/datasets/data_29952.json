    "content": "I'm having problems with time-based Do Not Disturb rules not activating.\n\nThe rule is:\n\nDays: Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri\nStart Time: 10:59PM\nEnd Time: 8:30AM next day\nAlarm can override end time: Enabled\n\nDuring initial creation at night, the rule works but then it doesn't automatically enable the next day. Even if I toggle the rule from on to off and then back to on, it doesn't enable. I have to delete and create a new rule to make it work.\n\nDevice is a Pixel 3XL running stock Android with latest patches.\n\nAny ideas? Thanks!",
