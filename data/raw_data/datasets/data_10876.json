    "content": "I've tried cleaning the lens, restarting phone and clearing camera cache but nothing works. The front camera pictures come out better in comparson to the rear camera. The rear camera photos come out very foggy and it disrupts portrait mode as well. Would be very grateful if someone could help.",
