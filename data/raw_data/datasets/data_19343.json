    "content": "I have a Google 3a. Roughly once or twice a day, the lower third of my screen will go haywire; partly unresponsive, partly oversensitive, so sometimes you press it and nothing happens, other times you try to write \"Hi\" and you get \"Hhhhhi\". Restarting the phone fixes the issue, but I don't want to have to keep doing that.",
