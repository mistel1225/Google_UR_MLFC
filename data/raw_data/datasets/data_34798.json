    "content": "Pixel 3 took an auto update yesterday. Now all videos on all browsers stop every one second. (YouTube, Facebook, chrome, reddit, etc.)\n\nRestarted multiple times and cleared cache of multiple apps. Happens for portrait and landscape orientations and on mobile data and on wifi.\n\nOccasionally happens on downloaded content as well, but always streaming content.",
