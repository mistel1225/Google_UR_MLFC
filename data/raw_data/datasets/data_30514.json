    "title": "Pixel 3a XL sound distortion",
    "content": "From the internal speakers on the phone, notifications and any audio that's 70% or higher is noticably distorted. Is this a problem across all the 3a's or is it just mine? And most importantly is there a fix. (Context, phone is 3 days old at this point and has been doing this since it came out of the box.)",
