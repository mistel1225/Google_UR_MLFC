    "content": "I have a folder of my Google icons in the lower right corner of my screen.  I keep losing that folder. I know its something I'm doing from opening or moving my thumb across the home screen but don't know exactly what I'm doing and more importantly I don't know where I'm moving or \"deleting\" the folder to.  It's not sliding over to a new home screen page. They aren't actually being deleted, its like I'm just sliding them off the screen to the ozone layer. I'm not using and add-on (or none that I know of) icons or home screen apps or (launcher?) pretty much stock phone.  This has happened a dozen or so times. I re-create the folder by dragging all the icons back out and its good till I lose the folder again.",
