    "content": "  The bottom speaker of my Pixel 3a stopped working. Apparently it's a common hardware issue that no one wants to bother fixing.\n  But is there a workaround? For example, when there is incoming call, the phone could use the earpiece speaker to ring? This should be possible via software. Is there any setting for this?",
