    "content": "I listen to podcasts on my hearing aids.  In the past I would install a mono audio player app for this purpose as my hearing aids do not use the A2DP format.  After the latest Android 11 update these aps do not seem to work.  They connect to my hearing aids but do not redirect the audio stream away from the phone speaker.  Any suggestions?",
