    "content": "Every day once I take my pixel 3 off the charger it consistently freezes in my pocket on the lock screen. The only way to unfreeze it, from what I've experimented is to plug it in for a second. I've done factory reset completely, I've even tried safe mode. But nothing works. I can always recreate the freezing, meaning that it hasn't fixed.",
