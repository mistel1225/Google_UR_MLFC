    "title": "Absolutely need to silence the voice to text sound. Mic button top right of keyboard",
    "content": "The ringer sound for engaging voice to text needs to be turned off. There's absolutely no reason for it to be on. It's super loud and way louder than any system sound. It makes for a really annoying voice typing experience because it really ruins everything. This is super trivial to implement. It's just a mute button. Or system mute for the entire keyboard. Keyboards don't need to make sound. And I know when I'm voice typing because I pressed on the button I don't need a ringing indicator.\n\nI really don't know how else to describe it. It's like a ding ding sound. If you can tell me what the proper term for it is it would be easier for me to give feedback to Google.If you can tell me what the proper term for it is it would be easier for me to give feedback to Google.",
