    "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nGot my new Pixel 5 less than a month ago. Transferred all the data from Pixel 3. Couple weeks ago I encountered the following problem: I can't hear any sound when on the call except when I turn the speaker on. My counterpart can hear me fine. The same issue seems to be happening with any other messenger (e.g. WhatsApp).\n\n- Boot in safe mode, this helps so the problem should be in one of the apps. I uninstalled all the recent apps, doesn't help\n- Removed permissions to access \"Phone\" from all the apps (except for the system ones from which I cannot remove it). Didn't help.\n- Reboot helps but just for some time. Several hours later the problem is back. So the \"internal speaker\" itself seems to be ok.\n- Not related to bedtime / do not disturb as I turned it off.\n\nSo far very disappointed. All the same apps were working fine on my Pixel 3.\n\nHas anyone experienced anything similar?",
