    "title": "Find My Phone - Customize Icons",
    "content": "The \"Find My Phone\" app needs to allow users to customize the icons (or select phones by menu). We have five Pixel 2 phones in the family. Everyone has the same special family google account on every phone (in addition to each user's personal / individual google account) which allows everyone in the family to use Find My Phone to find (and \"phone bomb\") every phone in the family. This is handy, but because the icons are all the same (and here is no menu to select phones), it's just random trying to determine which icon to tap to find which phone. \n\nGoogle, you can do better.",
