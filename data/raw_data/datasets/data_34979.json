    "content": "It seems like spam calls are crashing my phone. My pixel seemingly randomly shuts off, usually when I'm using the camera. I thought it was my battery, but it's always 30-60% when I turn it back on. I started noticing that when I turn it back on, I have a missed call from right about when the phone shut down (notification shows ~1-2 minutes ago), and its always marked as a blocked spam call. Is this a known bug or is it some setting? Or is it a total coincidence?",
