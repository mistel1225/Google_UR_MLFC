    "content": "Since my phone last updated, there is no longer an in-app option to back up my audio and transcripts from Pixel Voice Recorder to my Google drive. I saw somewhere that they were upgrading it so that it would be able to be automatically backed up, but I can't seem to find where to turn that on and without a manual option, I don't know what to do. I know I can go into Google drive and upload from there but that's way more complicated - the manual option simply allowed me to back up both audio and transcript immediately after the recording. I've searched online and can't seem to find anyone else who has had this problem. Thank you for your feedback, community!",
