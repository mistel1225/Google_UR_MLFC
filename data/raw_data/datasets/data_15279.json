    "content": "I updated to android 11 and am now realising that half of my photos have... gone. they're still there when I actively search for them in the photos app, but if I want to use one in app, say as a profile picture or uploading it somewhere, they're gone. for example I had a folder of a few hundred photos I had taken at work that are very precious to me, and now the folder only has 56 photos in. I'm not sure what's happened since they're there in Google photos, but not in my on device storage, even though they ARE on the device (no 'save to device' option that there would be in Google photos if they weren't on there)\nhas anyone else had this issue? anyone know how to fix? they're not in my 'files' app either",
