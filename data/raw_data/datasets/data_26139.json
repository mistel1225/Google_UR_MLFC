    "content": "So I just had my pixel stop responding to my power button (it was on and unlocked). I decided to hold the button for 30 seconds to see if it would shut off. It reacted and turned the screen black, however now it remains black with a blue line flickering once every few seconds. Holding the power button again for 30s only causes it to vibrate once and then nothing else happens. Anyone know what this is and how to solve this?",
