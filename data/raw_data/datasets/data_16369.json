    "content": "Two main issues:\n\nWhenever I'm playing music through Bluetooth, and then disconnect the Bluetooth device, the music continues playing. Even when I have paused Spotify and cleared all of my apps, I have to restart my phone to get it to stop.\n\nAs well as this, the Bluetooth notification says it is connected/on even when I've turned it off, tapping it replays the 'turning off' animation and it finally turns off.",
