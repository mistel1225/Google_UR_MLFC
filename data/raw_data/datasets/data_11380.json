    "content": "Earlier whenever I tap on volume up or volume down on my Pixel USB-C Buds the Assistant used to update about the time and my notifications even when the phone is locked or when 'Always-On' is off but since a month it is not responding when the 'Always-On' display turns off because I put my Pixel 3 inside my pocket so the 'Always-On' display goes off due to the sensor therefore it doesn't update on my time and notifications",
