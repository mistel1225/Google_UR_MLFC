    "title": "Brand New Google Pixel 3a Screen Faulty",
    "content": "Just purchased a pixel 3a at carphone warehouse earlier today, set it all up fine then came to use it tonight and the screen is stuck on the absolutely most insanely bright setting with all the colours washed out and weird, loads of screen flickering and green flashing going on.\n\nLiterally impossible to use it's that bright, even setting screen brightness to 0% and playing with all other display settings. No amount of rebooting helps. Even factory reset and it's the same. Definitely have a faulty unit, extremely disappointing, can't be the only one with this problem? \n\nObviously it's going straight back tomorrow, not sure I want to accept a replacement if offered, doesn't bode well for the longetivity for the model. Seems it's impossible to contact Google directly, do they fancy contacting me before I post on Reddit and their Twitter??",
