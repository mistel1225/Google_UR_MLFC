    "content": "A few days ago, (right after this last security update) my phone stopped charging via cable unless I either changed the USB connection controller setting (which was also new and only sometimes worked) or if I shut down my phone entirely and plugged it in.  Today, I couldn't get it to stay turned off!  Every time I Shut Down, it powered back on by itself, whether or not I touched it or had it plugged in.  Eventually let the battery drain itself naturally and powered it on Safe Mode.  Now it's charging, but why is this happening?",
