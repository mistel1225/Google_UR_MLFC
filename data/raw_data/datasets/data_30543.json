    "content": "There is no animation of the \"home\" button, even despite the update on June 5th.  As it was my classic and remained, how to fix it?\n When you call the google assistant through the \"ok google\", a voice search page pops up, but the assistant itself does not start.\n I am in Russia, I used a similar pixel, these problems were not there.  How to be and how to fix it?",
