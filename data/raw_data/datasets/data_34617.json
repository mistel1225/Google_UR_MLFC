    "content": "My Google Podcast is updated to the latest version, my Android has been updated to the latest version also. For the past 2 weeks or so, the Google Podcast app will not download most episodes if I view another podcast episode while the download is happening. It will stop downloading and revert back to the down arrow symbol (instead of showing percentage downloaded). After this happens, if I press the down arrow again to download, nothing will happen.",
