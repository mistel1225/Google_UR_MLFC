    "title": "How to Backup and Reset my phone, which has a cracked screen, in order to repair it?",
    "content": "I need to backup and reset my phone before i take it to be repaired. The screen broke and I can only see a small portion of the upper right corner. Functionality has not been impaired it seems, as the screen still registers my touch and voice. I am not sure of the settings I have selected in regards to auto backup, and I dont know when the last time I did a manual backup was. I've thought of downloading an app to access the screen from a computer, but as far as I can tell I need to be able to make the connection on my phone first.  thanks for any help.",
