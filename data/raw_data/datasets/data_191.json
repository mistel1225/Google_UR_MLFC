    "content": "My IP connection speed is 940/880. When I use NordVPN I'm only getting 10 to 15 percent of 940/880. I've made many combinations NordVPN. But the connection is still slow. When not using NordVPN my connections are 600/600 or better. My daughters IPhone has no issue while using NordVPN speeds are 550/550 or better. Why is the Iphone able to produce higher speeds while using NordVPN. What protocols does Iphone use when accessing the internet?",
