    "content": "I can confirm that the April patch does not address the screen flashing and green distortion problem. \n\nPROBLEM:\nThus far, all four Pixel 3 devices have consistently flickered like a strobe light and/or the screen would turn green green like an old TV trying to get a signal. \n\nWHEN DOES IT OCCUR (consistent in all devices so far):\n---This occurs in an environment that is usually in a low light setting. \n---The phone brightness is set between 10 to 80 percent. \n---It does in both night light and non night light setting.\n---The flashing/green can start at the login screen (but not all the time).\n---The flashing/green can start after you've logged in and are using the device.\n---This also occurs in safe mode.\n---Manufacture reset does not fix the problem. \n\n\nWHEN SCREEN FLASHING DOES NOT OCCUR (THOUGH NOT SOLUTIONS):\n---Generally putting the phones in gray scale and setting brightness to 100 percent has reduced the frequency but is not a solution. \n---In bright daylight the flashing rarely happens.\n\n\nI attached two pictures that show the screen flashing/green after the April update. And another screenshot of the OS. ",
