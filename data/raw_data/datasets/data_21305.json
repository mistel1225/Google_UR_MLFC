    "content": "In the last week or so, after a full charge (usually overnight), I've noticed that the phone doesn't display the clock or battery (basically the top info has disappeared), and if I try to swipe down to show the notification bar, the screen goes black. \nI then have to press the power button several times to get it to unlock (the unlock screen never shows).\nOnce unlocked, the same problem. I can swipe up, open apps, side swipe etc. Just swiping down seems to break it.\n\nThe only way to fix it is to restart the phone.\nHopefully I'm not the only one?",
