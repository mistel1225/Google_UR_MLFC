    "title": "Why is Google's design language for app icons so lazy?",
    "content": "Why can't Google design thoughtful icons that don't utilize a white border on their own native launcher? \n\nI'm not talking about the 'adaptive' part. I'm talking about, Why do many of Google's own icons require adapting in the first place? That's just flat lazy.\n\nAt least give us the choice to ditch the white border for a 'frosted filling', wherein our wallpaper bleeds through. \n\nTop circled row? Fugly. Boring. (Sorry for dragging you into this, Philips Hue)\n\nBottom? Fine! Good! Thoughtful, even.ï¿¼\n\nSurrounding an icon with glaring white to make it circular isn't a design language. It's just...adequate.",
