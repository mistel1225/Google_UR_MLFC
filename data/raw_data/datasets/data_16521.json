    "content": "On WhatsApp notifications in the conversation section (as of android 11), the profile picture shown in the notification bar and on the notification list when I swipe down isn't the same as the person's avatar. It's what their avatar used to be.\n\nHow do I update the notification profile picture to the current one? It's very confusing",
