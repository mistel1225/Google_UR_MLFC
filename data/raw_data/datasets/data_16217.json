I want to is it common? does it means that If I don't browse my phone it still reduce battery life to 80%? But I have other smartphone Huwaei y6 2019. without browsing  it still shows that I have 98% at 12 pm afternoon. Does everyone facing the same issue? my phone is updated to android version 11, using dark theme and also stop some other feature that could reduce battery life.",
