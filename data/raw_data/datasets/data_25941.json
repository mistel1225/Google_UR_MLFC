    "content": "While using my Pixel 3XL my phone suddenly turned black with no warning, my phone charging at the time. I tried to turn it on and nothing happened, so I tried holding down the power button for 30 seconds and it is still unresponsive. There was no vibration or anything to signify that my phone died, though it was charging. When I tried to connect my device to find my phone to check if it would ring, it said \"could not connect with device\".",
