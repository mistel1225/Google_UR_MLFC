    "content": "Started a few day ago and i've noticed that a lot of pixel 4 users are having the same issue and google should recall all pixel 4 phone and be replaced by the pixel 5 this issue is really bad. and like everyone else has said we can be replicated by covering the Sony sensor and twisting it slightly and the phone switches off clearly a hardware issue which Google needs to address immediately it's been over two years now this is disgusting. a billion dollar company cant even make a phone right. this is a class action lawsuit waiting to happen....... again to google",
