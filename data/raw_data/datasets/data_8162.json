    "content": "I have tried holding down the power button for 5-7 seconds and 30 seconds and the screen never turns on. When I put my finger on the fingerprint scanner, it still vibrates and my alarms are still going off but the screen never turns on.\nBecause I dropped it and it broke a bit of the screen I'm not sure whether I can get it fixed on warranty.\nNot sure what to do and no phone repair shops understand what's wrong with it or can fix it.\nThanks",
