    "content": "I used to get 4.5hrs Screen ON Time on Android Pie on the Pixel. After the Android 10 update, my battery life had literally halved. Contacted CC and they asked me to go into Safe Mode and check whether that helps the battery. It didn't and I came back to normal mode. Now the battery is draining even faster and I am barely getting 2hrs SOT. Is there a fix coming or should I just throw away this phone? Not gonna buy a Pixel ever again. Google can't be trusted. Its been more than a month.",
