    "content": "My phone has randomly died and has lost 2 months worth of photos with it. I was on Google Photos (on my pc) a couple of days ago and ALL of my pics were there, now nothing- only 3 photos from the last two months. Where and how could they disappear? How can I retrieve them when my phone does not work anymore?",
