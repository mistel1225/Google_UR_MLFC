    "content": "Even on silent, my phone is still making sounds. I have restarted my phone a couple times and even gone into specific all settings to change sounds to no avail. The notification sounds are also at full volume! The only way I seen to be able to prevent notification sounds is to put it on do not disturb. What is up with my phone!?",
