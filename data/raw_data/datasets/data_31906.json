    "content": "After every call is ended I find the network signal drops and reconnects. I have tried Vodafone Airtel and this seems to be not a service provider issue but a problem with the device. The device is nearly 1.5 years old. I have tried all sorts device resets but this is not getting fixed. Does anyone replicate the issue? Any possible fixes?",
