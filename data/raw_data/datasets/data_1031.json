    "title": "Crackling audio with Vivaldi web browser on Pixel 4a 5G",
    "content": "I start up the phone and watch a video inside the Vivaldi web browser app e.g. YouTube. There is distorted crackly audio. This happens at any volume level through speaker or headphones. If I then dismiss the app and run it again the problem goes away. and doesn't appear until I restart the phone. This also happens more rarely with the Chrome web browser. I have not seen this issue with Firefox or the YouTube app or VLC yet, but happens all the time with Vivaldi. Thanks for viewing.",
