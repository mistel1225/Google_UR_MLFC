Factory reset 3 times.\n2. Used other network provider sim card on google pixel which works fine. ( Only jio sim cards are not working well)\n3. Also tried other jio sim card number with pixel still problem persist.\n4. The jio sim cards at same location works fine with other cell phones. ( Means there is no problem from network provider side)\n5. Its came into observation that there could be bug or software side issue which does not allows only jio sim to work well.\n\nKindly help regarding same.",
