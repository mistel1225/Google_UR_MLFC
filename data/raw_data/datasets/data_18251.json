    "content": "Since the update, my phone has had problems with apps crashing.  It's not isolated to any one app.  Sometimes I'll unlock the phone and it'll say that \"Google has stopped working\" and give me the option to wait or close the app.  I've rebooted the phone.  Before I go and wipe it, any other thoughts?  I didn't see any other complaints so this is likely isolated to me and not a widespread issue.",
