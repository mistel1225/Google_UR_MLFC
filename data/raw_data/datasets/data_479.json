    "content": "Is it just me or Pixel 4a 5g screen cracks easily. Not happy with it.\n\nGot a phone for my partner, just few days old. This is the new stock that was shipped recently to Australia as I have been waiting to get one for more than a month. Had google back cover and Shield screen protector on. With just one drop (probably from 3 inch height) the screen has a long crack and all I can see now is the screen liquid light creating crazy pattern. Phone is unusable. Nothing happened to screen protector. Have been using Samsung phones and dropping them but never had this issue.\n\nHave been reading community post and google says its not covered under warrenty, but number of other users have reported this same issue.\n\nI am a google fan, but I think the hardware is not upto the mark. I was planning to getting Pixel 5 for myself. But dropped that idea. Would be interested to know if same screen glass material is used.\n\nPlease let me know if the screen is so weak for 4a 5g that should I be bothered to get it reparied.",
