    "content": "Hello. I cannot get an external microphone to work with my Google Pixel 3. I am using a Rode Smartlav+ Lavalier Microphone which has a TRRS Connector and connecting it to the Google Pixel using Google's official USB-C converter. \n\nI have tested this with more than one Smartlav+ microphone so it is unlikely to be the mics that are faulty. I have tried using the new 'Recorder' app which is now native on the phone, as well as the native camera app and OpenCamera with the audio setting set to \"External Mic (If Present)\".\n\nCan anyone assist. It seems crazy that such a simple feature is unavailable on what is otherwise a brilliant phone.",
