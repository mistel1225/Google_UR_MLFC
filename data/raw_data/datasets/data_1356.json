    "content": "I've downloaded a PDF file, I navigate to the Google Files app, locate the PDF file and when clicking to \"open with\" or directly on the the file it says \"none of your apps an open this file\". So I'm unable to open the file. \n\nMy workaround is opening the file from the notification drop down once it's completed downloading and it then opens no problem. But I can only do this once so it's not a long term solution.",
