    "content": "My husband and I both just switched over from samsung to the pixel 4a. He has started using his already, and I am waiting for my phone case to arrive in the mail before using it. I did set mine up with my sim card, then (after I realized I would rather wait until I had a case to use it) removed my sim card and put it back in my old phone. \n\nNow, for some reason, any texts my husband sends me go straight to my pixel, instead of to my phone that has a sim card. Why is that? How can we change it so I receive texts on my current phone? \n\nThank you!",
