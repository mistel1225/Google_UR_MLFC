    "content": "The front facing speakers on my 3 XL have been great so far, but I've noticed a weird problem very recently. Whenever I play a video or some music, audio only plays from the bottom speaker and little to no audio plays from the top speaker. Quickly pausing and replaying the music or video fixes the issue, but I don't want to have to do that every time I want to play something. This has only happened very recently, there has been no major damage to the phone so I have no idea as to the cause of the problem and if it is a matter of hardware or software. I just want to know if there is a fix for this. Thanks.",
