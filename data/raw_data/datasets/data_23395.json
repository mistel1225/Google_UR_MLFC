    "content": "I tried adding my work Gmail to my new phone and it requires Google Apps Device Policy. The app downloaded on my phone and I get to the first screen where it begins, \"This application allows administrators to enforce policies...\" and I need to press \"Next\" at the bottom to continue. I press the button and nothing happens, so I can't finish the email set up. I've tried restarting the phone, deleting the email login info/google apps device policy and re-downloading and nothing helps. I always get stuck on this screen. \n\nAny ideas on how to get the Next button to work?",
