    "title": "Screen Flashing On Phone Wake",
    "content": "The lock screen will flash once very quickly almost every time I wake the phone up. I've rebooted in safe mode and it still persists. The phone is less than a month old and it started a few days after I got it. Enabling \"Remove Animations\" or using \"Gesture Navigation\" instead of \"3 Button Navigation\" fixes the issue. Heres a short gif showing the flashing: https://imgur.com/KnOLhTg\n\nI believe the issue is related to using 3 button navigation. I'm posting this to get more infomation to the devs so they can fix it. If there is a better place to post this for them to see let me know!",
