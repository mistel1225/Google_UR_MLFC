    "content": "No matter how many times I've tried to calibrate the compass on my pixel 3, I can't get it to point true at all. It's often the complete opposite of the actual direction. I've tried the Google Maps calibration a dozen times. Moved the phone in every direction. It keeps saying calibration is high. Makes a few apps totally useless.",
