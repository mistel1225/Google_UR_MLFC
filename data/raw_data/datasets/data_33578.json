    "content": "I have had two Google USB-C to headphone adapters fail on me in as many weeks. These things are not put under any extra strain of any kind, just in my jacket pocket connected to my phone and headphones. But literally I have them for about a week and they just stop functioning. \n\nThe first one stopped gradually (this was also the second one I had used as the one that came with my Pixel 2 failed pretty quickly too) and I noticed the connection was loose so I initially just thought it was coming loose in my pocket. But sure enough it failed entirely after a few days. And the next one I bought just stopped dead after a few days of use. \n\nThings to note: PLEASE READ THIS!\n\nThere is no debris or anything compacted in the port. I have had this problem before with other phones and this was one of the first things I checked. I check and clean this port as necessary fairly regularly.\nThe pair of headphones being connected are just a pair of ear-buds with a mic that I bought from Amazon. I've had them since I owned my last phone and had no issues with them before this. \nI have not used any other USB-C adapters other than the Google ones\nNothing else that connects via the USB-C port fails this quickly. Ive been using the cable that came with the phone since I got it and a couple of other USB-C cables and none of them just fail like this.\n\nWhat can I do about this? I cant afford to keep buying these adapters or a pair of bluetooth headphones at this time.",
