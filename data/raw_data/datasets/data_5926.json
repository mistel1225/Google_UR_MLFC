    "title": "Pixel 4XL Stuck on Google Boot Screen after Yesterday's Update (12+ hours)",
    "content": "I downloaded the most recent Android update on my Pixel 4XL last night around 9p. Upon restarting, it has been stuck on the boot screen with the colorful \"G\" logo for about 12 hours now. I can't imagine this is going to resolve itself.\n\nAny suggestions on how to fix? I'd prefer not to do a factory reset if it can be avoided.\n\nThanks,\nJohn",
