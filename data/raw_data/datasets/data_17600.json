    "content": "I just got a new Pixel 4a to replace my Moto X4. The power/lock screen button broke on it in February; but, as long as I kept it charged, I was able to keep using it by using he fingerprint sensor to unlock it. However, eventually it lost a charge and it has been off for months.\n\nI am able to get to the Bootloader screen; but, without a functioning power button I cannot select any of the options.\n\nI tried to connect it to my 4a through the USB-C cord; however it defaults to having the USB controlled by the Moto X4 and will not let me switch that to attempt a data transfer. I've tried disconnecting and reconnecting them but nothing changes.\n\nFor some reason nothing was backed up (which doesn't make sense to me since that is how I transferred my data to that phone in the first place); so my data from that phone is lost. Is there anyway I can initiate a data transfer to recover it?",
