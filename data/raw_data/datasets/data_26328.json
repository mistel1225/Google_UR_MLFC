    "content": "The audio cuts out for long periods of time and returns on its own just as randomly as it cut out. It will stop making any sound mid song even as Spotify thinks the song is still playing. It affects alarms as well so that's definitely going to cause me to miss work someday. This began with the latest security update and this bug needs to be fixed. ",
