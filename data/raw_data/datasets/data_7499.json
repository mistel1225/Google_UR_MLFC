    "content": "Phone is not receiving texts or any app push notifications on time. Texts are taking days to get. Notifications will all show up at once hours later. Also, new apps won't download or install. Sometimes when I restart or do a soft reboot, texts will come and phone seems to function better for a while but reverts back. Happens on wifi and data in different locations.",
