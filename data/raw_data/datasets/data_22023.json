    "content": "My almost new google pixel 3a XL just will not charge. I like the phone, but this is just outrageous . I mean, how can you guys possibly ship phones that will stop charging after a few weeks?!?\n\nContacted customer support, the best they can do is replace it with a refurbished device?!? Are they for real??? I expect a brand new phone as replacement, or if - like they seem to don't trust their own product to function properly, I want a refund. I'm pretty sure i'm not being unreasonable here. The phone cost me Â£400, is only a few weeks old, and will not charge, which I will argue is a pretty vital function to any new, or old phone.\n\nThis is the worse customer service experience I have ever had. There is a reason I will barely shop outside of Amazon these days!!!\n\nAny help very much appreciated!",
