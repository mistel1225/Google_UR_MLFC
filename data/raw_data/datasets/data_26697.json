    "content": "Why does google support lie about what a prestine replacement is? I have evidence on numerous occasions of misinformation and everytime I ask for satisfaction I get double talked to. I have emails and phone conversations where I was told I would be sent a new device first before I send my old on in and now being told otherwise. Ive tried to be nice but now think it maybe better to put the information out here and maybe the embarrassement will bring someone to call me.",
