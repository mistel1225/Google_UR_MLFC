    "title": "Assistant not working over car Bluetooth but music and calls ok.",
    "content": "Previously in my BMW I would say \"hey Google\" and music would pause when being played over Bluetooth, assistant would respond over car speakers and carry out the instruction. I've changed to a Pixel 5 from 3xl and this no longer works. The handset picks up the command and carries it out silently on the phone only. The music does pause but nothing over car speakers.\n\nI have played around with settings and the closest I've managed to get is by turning driving mode on (which I'd never had to do before) and squeezing the phone to launch assistant (i have a third party app installed to return this feature) and assistant responds but you can't hear properly because the music doesn't pause! To make things worse, I can't seem to get \"hey Google\" to launch verbally when in driving mode.\n\nSimilarly, my phone used to play the audio from any other videos such as you tube, sky go, Facebook but nothing now.\n\nIt's driving me instane. I could literally say \"hey Google\" before and it would do anything i needed it to without me touching or looking at the phone in any way. \n\nAny ideas?",
