    "title": "How to make voice assistant play an mp3 via my chosen music player?",
    "content": "When I activate the voice assistant and say \"Listen to [name of mp3 song downloaded to my phone]\", my Pixel 3a would always only launch YouTube Music. I didn't want that, so I uninstalled YouTube Music. Then when I tried the same thing again, it launched YouTube. WHY DOES THE PIXEL THINK MUSIC SHOULD BE PLAYED THROUGH YOUTUBE?? This makes no sense.\n\nI have 2 music apps: Google Play Music and Musicolet. I would be fine with either. When I ask voice assistant to play an mp3 song, I want it to launch Musicolet or Google Play Music and begin playing my chosen mp3. How can I make it do this?\n\nThanks in advance.",
