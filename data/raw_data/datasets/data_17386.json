    "content": "Received my Pixel 4a a couple days ago and have spent a good amount time getting it set up and getting familiar with it.  So far I've noticed two issues:\n\nScreen has a yellow/warm tint compared to my previous phone (Night Mode is confirmed off).  I read an article that the Pixel 4 was designed to have a warmer/yellowish tone.  SO I'm wondering if they kept this same design preference for the 4a to reduce blue light?\nWhile typing with Gboard, the keyboard will randomly switch to the number pad while typing.  It's not numbers being typed due to long press, but the entire number pad appears as if I tapped the \"?123\" key on the bottom left.  This gets VERY annoying while trying to type messages.  \n\nI will get used to #1 as I use the phone more, but I was just more curious than anything if Google chose to keep the yellowish screen for the 4a after receiving feedback from users of the Pixel 4 about not liking this feature.  But if there's any kind of troubleshooting tips to help fix #2 that would be wonderful!",
