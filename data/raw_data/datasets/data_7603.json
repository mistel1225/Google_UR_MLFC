    "content": "Everything's been great with device. I'm using pixel 4a for 3 months now in india, there are some minor glitches that can be fixed with the software update. Whenever there are more then 2 calls aid 2 calls comes at the same time(incoming or outgoing) the whole device just froze and have to be restarted to use again. Same goes for the internet connectivity. But the major one is with the calls, it happens almost everyday as I get a lot of calls due to work. \nHope you fix this issue in the next update, cause restating the device again and again is really frustrating and puts a strain on the device too.",
