    "content": "My phone started acting terrible while traveling abroad. Totally malfunctioning. It wouldn't hold a charge, then when plugged in it would just continually go through the powering on cycle while never completely powering on. Except a couple times it would actually fully turn on and work somewhat oddly for a brief amount of time then start doing funny things again. See below.\n\nI had the battery replaced from a Google certified shop when I got home.\n\nThe phone charges and holds a charge now, but the phone is still not acting right. Among other things, the power button is having issues. I press it once normal pressure/duration and it seems to randomly choose one it's various functions (turn on/off screen, go to camera, offer to power off/restart/screenshot). Or it will pick one, then switch to the next after a couple seconds, and then switch to the next. \n\nThe screen has flashed between night mode and day mode light a strobe light a couple times too. Lasts a few seconds.\n\nPlease help me figure this out. Or at least who I should take it to next. Thank you",
