    "content": "After upgrading to Android 10 on my Pixel 3 XL, every time I make or receive a phone call, the screen goes black and is COMPLETELY UNRESPONSIVE.  I can't do anything - not even end the call.  There are a lot of of other Pixel owners with the same issue.  My question is: will upgrading to Android 11 fix this issue or make it worse?",
