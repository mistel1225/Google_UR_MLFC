    "content": "After restarting or powering off and back on, I have to reset the wifi, bluetooth, etc., to again get phone calls. Otherwise, they go directly to voicemail after the above. Once reset, phone calls work as they should. U.S. Cellular phones, my wife has 4a, I have Pixel 5. Have consulted all U.S. Cellular techs several times. Thoughts?",
