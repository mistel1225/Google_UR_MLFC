    "content": "My work group will often record meetings via SoundCloud and the post the audio.  I'd been using my Pixel 2 with no issues but in recent weeks it seems the mic goes to sleep after about 3 minutes so the recording only captures the first few minutes of audio and the remainder is dead air.  Is there a setting to keep the mic active and engaged for the entire recording (30 minutes)",
