    "title": "Do not disturb mode exceptions don´t work on Pixel 2XL",
    "content": "I have do not disturb mode turned on. In the settings i´ve selected that certain apps are allowed to go through do not disturb mode and vibrate, including the messaging app from google. The problem that I have is that I get no vibration at all. So I might get a text from someone and dont get a vibration or a ringtone or anything. \nThis wasn´t the case before I downloaded the Android 11 update. I have updated my device to the latest update, including the security patch from october. The problem is still there. I did try to adjust it in the settings and have configuered everything in the right way. I allowed certain apps and conversations to go through do not disturb mode, but it just doesnt do that at all. \n\nAnyone still have that problem or is there any hope for a fix for this problem? It´s almost impossible to contact google so I don´t really have anyone that I can go to.",
