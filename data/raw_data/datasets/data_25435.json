    "content": "Hi everyone, so I have a completely broken pixel 3. It's demolished pretty much so I can't turn it on or anything like that. I also do not have the box for it nor does it get recognized by a computer. I am wondering if there is any way to figure out if it is a Google Pixel 3 or a Verizon Pixel 3? My end goal is to know whether I can unlock the bootloader or not before I spend a couple hundred dollars replacing just about everything on this phone",
