    "content": "I tried to turn on the phone. The google symbol appears and spins normally. Then the screen appears for about 10 seconds and goes BLACK AGAIN. I tried chat but the person only talked terms I couldn't understand. She told me to take the sim out. I have no knowledge of how you even start to remove the sim?",
