    "content": "The power button on my Pixel 2XL is super sketchy, usually requiring multiple presses for the desired effect. When the screen is on, not in the lock screen, pressing the power button sometimes turns the screen off and other times just puts it on the lock screen. When the screen is completely off, pressing the power button sometimes works as expected, other times it'll flicker the screen on and then back off. And when it is in the lock screen, it regularly requires 2 or more presses to get the screen to turn off (and I can safely put the phone in my pocket!).\n\nI can't make any sense as to the logic of it, have even tried booting into safe mode, but the problem persists there as well. Is it safe to say the power button *shouldn't* be acting so defiantly??? This just seems ridiculous for a flagship phone. :( I honestly don't recall when this started happening. I've just been dealing with it for quite a while...finally trying to figure it out.",
