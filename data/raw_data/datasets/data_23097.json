    "content": "Are we not able to change the photo resolution with the camera on pixel 3a? I only have 2 options, either high resolution or medium resolution. There are no options to change aspect ratio. There are also no options to change the front camera resolution. My front camera is poor quality. My friend has a pixel 3a XL and has the other aspect ratio options (16:9), and his front camera is way better quality than mine. ",
