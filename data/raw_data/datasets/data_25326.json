    "content": "My Google Pixel has been stolen recently, about a week now. I had to log into my Gmail to be able to locate my Google Pixel, but Google cannot be able to reach the device, but the map on the right side brought me to North Africa, which isn't accurate - I don't know what this could mean. Please see the photo below. Unfortunately, I don't have the password on my Google Pixel 2, which means that the thief could access to it, BUT the last time the phone has been used was when I last used the device. I have some private stuff on there, but cannot seem to access it through my Gmail account. I tried to see if Google can be able to lock in and add a message onto the screen, but it won't be able to connect to my device. I have informed both the police and the network provider and they are working on my case. The network provider has blacklisted the device, which hopes that the person will realise that they cannot do much with the device. I need help with this case, as I am being ignored by @madebygoogle on Twitter & I don't know who to go for help. If I do purchase a second hand Google Pixel 2, will I be able to get all my photos - as I have noticed that the photos are being saved but it is not showing > what does this mean too ? ",
