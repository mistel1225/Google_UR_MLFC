    "content": "My Google PIxel3a is charging intermittently.  It goes charges for a few seconds, then not charging, then charging, then not etc. on an infinite loop.  I had to disable the sound on charging because it was driving me insane.  I have restarted.  Didn't fix it.  I have cleaned the port.  Didn't fix it.  I have changed charging cables and charging bricks.  Didn't fix it.  I have restarted in safe mode.  Didn't fix it.\n\nThe only thing that works a little bit is to plug in a USB-C to USB-A cable into my laptop.  At that point the phone is \"charging slowly.\"  So slowly, in fact, if I use the phone during that time, I am losing charge.  I really don't think the factory reset is the solution either. \n\nHelp would be appreciated.",
