    "title": "Some Pixel 3a sms notifications not passing via BT",
    "content": "My wife and I have Pixel 3a phones with Google Fi as carrier. She connects her phone via BT to a 2016 Nissan Rogue and also has a fitness watch that displays phone notifications. This works fine most of the time - for instance if someone texts her, then her phone displays the notification and it also shows up on the watch and car display. However, if I send her a text, it only displays on her phone - it doesn't carry through to either the watch or car screen.\n\nThese are brand new phones and we have been through most of the menus looking for anything that would cause this, but can't find anything. We are looking for someone else with a Pixel to rule out Google Fi or someone with Google Fi to rule out a Pixel problem, but still working on that.\n\nAny thoughts on what could cause this?",
