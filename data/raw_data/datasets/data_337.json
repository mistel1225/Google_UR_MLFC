    "content": "I often set Alarms on my phone.  On my J3, I was able to set an alarm for a date in the future.   However, with my new Pixel 4a, I am unable to set an Alarm for a future date.  Using Reminders and Calendar Events as Alarms just doesn't have the same effectiveness--partially because I usually have my phone in DND mode because of frequent robo calls.  Has anyone had the same problem?  Any suggestions?  Might Google enhance their Alarm app to allow future dates?",
