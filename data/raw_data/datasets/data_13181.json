    "content": "Setting up new phone.  Transfer data from old android phone.  I get to the \"Your phone is almost ready\" screen and hit DONE.  The phone goes to the \"Adding finishing touches\" screen, then \"\"Just a sec\", then quickly switches to what looks like a \"checking for updates\" screen and then immediately switches back to the \"Your phone is almost ready\" screen.  \n\nThere is no way to exit this screen.  I'm stuck in an endless loop.  I've tried re-starting the device.  Same problem.\n\nHelp!",
