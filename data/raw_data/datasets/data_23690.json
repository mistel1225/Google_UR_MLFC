    "content": "My phone will not turn on and the screen is always black.\n\nI have tried:\n 1) Charging the phone with the provided charger for an hour\n 2) Holding the power button - after 1-2 seconds, I get a haptic feedback vibration. There's no effect from holding the button longer up to a minute.\n 3) Holding the power button and volume down - no effect\n 4) Connecting the phone to a PC - the PC sees that a Pixel 3a device is connected\n 5) Calling the phone after attempting to turn it on - it does not ring\n\nIs this a hardware failure? Is there a process for me to get a replacement while I'm travelling?",
