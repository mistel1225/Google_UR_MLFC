    "content": "Using the default messages app. If I don't read a text message, every time I open the app to read or send a different text, I get another notification for that unread one, phone will vibrate and make a sound about the unread messages I received hours ago. It will just keep going, giving me another notification every time I open messages until I finally open/read the text. Is there a way to shut this off?!",
