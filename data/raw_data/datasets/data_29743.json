    "title": "Android Messages: How to view/download photos from laptop's app?",
    "content": "I have a Pixel 3 and a Acer Spin 13 Chromebook running their respective most updated versions of OS.\n  I am currently out-of-country and connected to the same WIFI network on both devices.\nPhotos will not download to my phone, however I can get texts.\nI have the messenger app connected to my Chromebook, and I cannot seem to get the photos to load there either.  When I try to \"Save-As\" it comes up as an mhtml file. When I open that file it just loops back into the messenger, but displays as empty.\nIs there a way to get my photos view-able?\nIs there a way to change the file type from my end to be able to download?\n   Thanks for your help :)",
