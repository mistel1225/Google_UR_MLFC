    "content": "Before my device was stolen I had taken some pictures and had assumed they were uploaded directly to google photos. Once I realized it was stolen I immediately erased all data from my phone from someone else's phone. When I got home and checked my Chromebook to see if the photos were there, they weren't... I was hoping there was some way to recover those photos?? Although I loved the Pixel 3a, I care more about my photos and memories... anything helps!",
