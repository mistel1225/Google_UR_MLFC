    "content": "Device won’t turn on. It’ll show Google logo and turn black. \nPhone is 100% charged. Unable to boot the phone using Fastboot/Recovery mode or any other menu options. \nDevice port is intact. No physical damage.  Purchased in Feb2020. \nHad sent it to service centre last month (Aug), it was okay for a while. They said the updates weren’t installed properly so they did again it seems. But now (Sep) again the same problem. \nBeen facing on and off issue like this ever since the purchase. Really horrible purchase experience.",
