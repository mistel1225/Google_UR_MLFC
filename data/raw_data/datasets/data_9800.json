    "content": "I got the phone from Carphone Warehouse as birthday gift from a relative. I couldnt be able to claim warranty due to that. There is a line of dead pixels from top right to the bottom right like a ruler been held. I tried to contact google services for 1:1 support but couldn't find a way to do so. How can dead pixel be fixed when there is no damage on screen?",
