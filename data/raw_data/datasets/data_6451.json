    "content": "Hi guys,\nI have my Pixel 4a 5G for a week now and I own an Amazfit BIP Lite smart watch which I have been using forever with the \"Mi Bandage\" app.\nI have installed the app and paired watch and restored settings+data from backup.\nEverything worked for 2 days then it started dropping BT connection , on and off.\nNo matter what I do the phone loses BT connection with watch and keeps disconnecting and re-connecting.   I have done a factory reset on the watch, I have re-installed the APP but nothing helps.\nIt seems to be OK for 1-2 days then suddenly it starts the whole mess again.\nVery frustrating from a brand new phone , Pixel 4a 5G.\n\nWhat do you recommend ? How can this be fixed ?",
