    "content": "Hello everyone, \nSo I live in Turkey. It’s a country with a very limited market. Here, we have all of your everyday Korean/Chinese OEM androids and a limit portfolio of AOSP devices which are usually Android One series. What I would like to use as my next daily driver is any Pixel XL model from Pixel family. I’m curious to know if Google is planning on entering Turkish market now that premium segment is totally open for competition here? We would love to see Pixel devices. We previously had many members of the Nexus family on board, my favourite being Galaxy Nexus. It saddens me because I can’t order one online and use it here, I have to buy it from retailers and that’s where the problem begins since there’s no units to sell in the first place. Please Google, enter Turkish market or  help me find a way so I can order a pixel device at the very least. \n\nThanks.",
