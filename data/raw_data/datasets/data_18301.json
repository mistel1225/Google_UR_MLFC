    "content": "I am soon in the market for a new phone. The most important feature of my current phone (Moto Z Play) is that it auto detects when I'm driving based on movement, and goes 'hands free' (reads texts, allows me to voice-dictate my text response) - I don't even have to take the phone out of my pocket.\n\nI don't have bluetooth in my car, so cannot have it detect car via bluetooth connection. I've read that some Pixel's can have driving mode automatically engage without bluetooth (motion/speed detection?). Which models currently support this feature? \n\nAnd more importantly; does the Pixel 4a support this? That's the phone I'm looking at buying ;)\n\nThanks!",
