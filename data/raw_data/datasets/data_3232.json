    "content": "My pixel 4xl started having battery issues after the last update. It is still under warranty so i contacted google and they sent me a shipping label, the box to ship it to them in and started a $0.00 warranty repair order for me. When they received it they sent me a new repair order saying it has a cracked screen and now will cost me $274 to repair the screen before they can repair the battery issue. So they sent my phone back to me unrepaired and when i got my phone it is still in perfect condition. The screen is NOT cracked nor is my phone repaired. I am in disbelief that google let this happen. I also just read that the same exact thing happened to another gentlemen. What can i do about this issue?",
