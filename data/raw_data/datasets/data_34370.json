    "title": "Driving Mode randomly turns on",
    "content": "Although Driving Mode turns on whenever I get in my car (which I like), it has randomly started activating when I'm at home, at work, at the grocery store, Etc. Is there a reason this may be happening? most of the random times it activates I'm no where near my car. I thought it may have been because I could be near a Blue Tooth device but that was ruled out since Blue Tooth devices are not allowed at the place I work and Driving Mode activates there as well.",
