    "content": "Hi, \n\nI bought a Verizon Pixel 4 XL, who is supposed to be unlocked, but when i put my sim card it doesn't work and i get the message: SIM Card isn't supported..\n\nI talked to Verizon support and they told me that the phone is in fact unlocked and it should work. I tried with 4 different SIM Cards, three from different dominican networks and one from spain(mobistar) and they didn't work.\n\nWhat can i do?",
