    "title": "What causes the apps on my Pixel 2 phone to be slow only on WiFi?",
    "content": "I have had the phone for about 15 months.  Problem started two months ago.  Plenty of memory.  Running Pie.  I have deleted a bunch of infrequently used apps, cleared app cache.  Chrome is fast on wifi or cellular network.  But many of the apps that I used frequently including Reddit, ESPN, Yahoo Finance, YouTube, can take up to 20 seconds to load.  If I turn off wifi, they load in 3-4 seconds.  This issue is seen with at least three different wifi locations including at work, and I can be two feet from the router without any improvement.  I have Xfinity internet at home, 200 Mbps at 5 gHz.  Oddly, I ran into this same issue with the phone I had four years ago (LG G2), did factory reset with that one, was never able to resolve the issue (happened after OS update) and I had to replace the phone.",
