    "content": "Using a Pixel 4A  I use google apps for business (gsuite?) and all my info is set up on my work profile. However, phone and texts are on personal profile. I have installed \"phone\" on the business profile to recognize contacts and make calls, but that is interfering with inbound call history and texting as they show up on personal profile. I don't need a personal profile, can I get the phone and text to be recognized on my work profile only? Please help.",
