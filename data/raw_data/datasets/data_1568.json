    "content": "Hi..\nI have pixel 5 and I've noticed that I cannot get out of an incoming phone call when I receive it while the screen is locked. \nI can't swipe back or go to home screen, I have to wait for it to finish then I can open my phone.\n\nIs there any way to solve this issue?\n\nThere's a way to get around it  by going to taskbar then to settings, a choice to unlock the screen will popup taking you to settings and from then the call can be bubbled, But there has to be another way as I don't think this is an intended way to open the phone.\n\nThank you",
