    "content": "I've had this problem for almost 2 months now. Tried everything there is, been reading all the answers in here but still f***ed. The worst part of it all is that I've been trying to contact Google about this EVERY day. I've tried calling, chat, emails, Facebook. How the hell did some of you actually get in touch with them? And how did you get them to fix it/send a replacement? The closest I've been is Google asking for my case ID number (from the first time I contacted them) and then nothing, dead silence.. This has to be the worst customer service I've ever experienced (and the lack of it). My phone is still under warranty but it seems to me as if they're just stalling, hoping it will eventually expire. I do love my pixel 4 XL, but google is really pissing me off!",
