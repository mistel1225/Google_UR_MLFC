    "content": "I really enjoyed having a pixel 3a, it was a quality phone which was very affordable. Never had an issue with it until the new  update (Android 11). Now my phone freezes every time, when I take screenshots it displays previous screenshots, most apps won't run properly and if I play games I can't go full screen because  bar will appear. I don't know if this is an attempt to cash grab by Google by making us want to buy the new phone, but all I have to say is that it has been horrible since the update, really shocking, if it remains like this I will never buy a Pixel phone again.",
