    "content": "My phone works perfectly fine when I'm not plugged in, but it reboots as soon as I charge it. As soon as it displays the lock screen, it just reboots again. I had the same issue a couple of months ago and I contacted the support team and they resolved my issue by replacing the chip. However, the same issue still persists and the phone is not getting charged while the charger is connected. Please rectify and resolve this issue permanently otherwise I won't encourage the google phone anymore",
