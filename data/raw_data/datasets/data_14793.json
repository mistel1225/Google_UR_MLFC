    "content": "I loved the Call Screening feature on my phone ( a big reason I got it), but recently it just disappeared. I no longer see the option to use the assistant to screen a call, it does not happen automatically and the option to activate it in the app is gone. Anyone has the same issue? I've done everything but factory resetting.",
