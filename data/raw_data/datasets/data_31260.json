    "content": "Hi,\n\nDear Sir or Madam,\n\nRecently I have purchased a Google Pixel 2 on eBay and after one month phone got locked as boot-loader locked. The phone was advertised on eBay as BNIB, but for some kind of reason got locked. I have succesfully escalated this case with paypal and was told to send phone back to seller. \n\nHowever, I've a concern about how my personal data (photos, phone contacts, google passwords etc.) will be handled. I would be happy to do factory reboot, unfortunately phone is not functioning at all and in this case I cannot deleted these data. Could you please advice if there is a chance somehow wipe off all these data from the phone. That happens with all information on phone, after Google \"reset\" and unlocked boot-loader.\n\nMany thanks",
