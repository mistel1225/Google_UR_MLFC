    "content": "Before buying the Pixel 4a I've had many Sony phones, and before that a Galaxy S2, but I never had this problem with any of those.\n\nIt seems just with daily use the 4a accumulates small scratches on the screen very quickly. I have been absolutely BABYING this phone, I've never put it screen down on anything, and the screen has never come in contact with anything that should scratch it.\n\nI've only had this phone for about a month, but the screen is covered in little scratches! Anytime I see the screen in sunlight its very obvious. My screen has only ever touched two things, my fingers, and the inside of my pocket... So how is this possible? Why is this the only phone I've had this issue with?",
