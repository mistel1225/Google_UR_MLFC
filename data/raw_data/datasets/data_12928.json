    "content": "On my Pixel 4a phone, once I reboot proximity stands on 2.0 but as soon as I get my hand close to the sensor it goes to 0 until I restart phone again. What that means is that every time I call someone or get call the screen goes black immediately and I can't hang up or press any button on the screen. As I noticed it started after android 11. Is that a software bug?",
