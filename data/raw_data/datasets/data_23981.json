    "title": "Please add a setting in a future Android 10 update to allow screenshot alert noise to be disabled",
    "content": "Please can you add the ability to turn-off screenshot sound in a future Android 10 release.\n\nI expect to have a toggle under Settings > Sound > Advanced > Other Sounds and Vibrations called \"Screenshots\". Many other phones have this, not sure why Google have to be different.\n\n\n\nOnly workaround is to turn your \"Phone\" volume slider down to vibrate only, as the volume for the screenshots is controlled by this setting, meaning you could miss calls if you forget to turn this back on.\n\nI understand it's a legal requirement in some countries to not allow camera sounds to be disabled, but I've never heard of anything around taking screenshots, so this seems like a bug to me, given plenty of other phones let you do this.\n\nThanks",
