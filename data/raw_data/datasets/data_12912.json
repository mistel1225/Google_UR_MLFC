    "content": "Hello.\nI have my Pixel 4a three days now. I noticed, that the screen have inconsistent color tint. I can see it when it displays dark colors, especially grey, which is in the majority of Google apps, when you use dark mode (I use dark mode all the time). The issue is that the screen have green tint in top and right parts and red tint in left and bottom parts. It's like it is divided diagonally, when we consider diagonal from top left to bottom right. It is noticeable in almost all brightness levels. At top brightness level it is minimal.\nHave you also notice something similar?\nDo I have defective unit?\nCan it be fixed with software or maybe some update?\nI really love this phone, but I am not sure, if it is all right.\n\nThank you in advance.",
