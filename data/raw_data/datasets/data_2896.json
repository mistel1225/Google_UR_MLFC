    "content": "On my Pixel 5, when listening to music via headphones for about an hour, the volume is reduced by the system with a warning telling me the that the volume was automatically adjusted to protect my hearing. This is extremely jarring to the point that it makes me consider getting another phone. Is there any possibility to turn this off? Is this feature exclusive to the Pixel series or do all new Android versions have this?\nThanks for your help!",
