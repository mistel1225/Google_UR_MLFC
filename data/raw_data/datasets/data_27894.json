    "content": "I am unable to accurately track my runs using apps like Strava or Nike Run because whenever I lock my phone it stops tracking me, so whenever I then unlock my phone the apps show that I have done a straight line from wherever my phone was last unlocked. I am unable to run with my phone constantly unlocked for obvious reasons. Can anyone help?",
