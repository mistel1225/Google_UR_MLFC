    "content": "I've seen multiple posts relating to this same issue in the past, but have not seen a resolution. Randomly I will not receive a text (SMS or MMS doesn't matter) from others and have to check the AT&T logs to see it didn't receive. I had a Pixel 1 and never had this issue, but have had this issue randomly for 8 months on my Pixel 2. So far I've tried:\n-Factory Reset twice\n-Reset network settings\n -New Sim \n-Uninstall and update messages \n-Installed Textra to see if that helps -Installed all the latest updates\n\nIve opened multiple tickets with Google for them to only give me the run around and it is simply not acceptable to miss around 2-3% of texts.",
