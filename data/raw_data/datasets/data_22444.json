    "content": "I travel across the border (Russia -> Finland) several times per week. To avoid international data roaming charges, I have the data roaming option set to OFF always. If I don't, I get charged ~$5/day.\n\nBut I still get charged the $5/day. I get an SMS from my home carrier saying \"You started using data abroad, we've charged you $5\". And I didn't! When I check the bill, it's 2Kb or 4Kb. Someone on Reddit suggested that I need to disable \"Unlimited access\" for Carrier Services and Google Play Store.\n\nData Roaming Off should mean OFF! Why is my phone still leaking data?",
