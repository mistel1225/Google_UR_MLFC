    "content": "Hi\n\nMy assistant, both on my phone (Galaxy s8+) and Google Home's (and mini) suddenly started speaking in UK English instead of US English. Also, and I think this is related, my routines stopped working (both basic and self made routines). I haven't changed anything in the settings. I tried to reset one of my Home's, without result. Hope anyone can help me?\n\nRegards\nChristophe",
