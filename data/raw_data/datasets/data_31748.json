    "content": "i am a repair technician at CPR cellphone repair, and i have a google pixel 2 here that ive replaced the back camera on the device and since doing so the original screen(not broken) and any other screen that i place on the device is only green, the picture shows nothing but a dark seaweed green covering the entire display making working the device impossible. The touchscreen functions still and when booting into recovery mode the screen acts like it should no color distortion. when powering on the device the screen functions breifly as normal but then proceeds to go completely green . i have tried another rear camera as well and the issue persists.",
