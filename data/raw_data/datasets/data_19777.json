    "content": "on a pixel 2 , regular phone calls ,\nthe other side of the conversation is hearing themselfs with a 0.8 second delay , and only the low frequencys , sounds very mumble and noisy.\nthey can hear me perfectly , i can hear them perfectly , but there is a constant echo only they can hear , i cant hear it on my side.\nit only happens with regular calls , only when using the phone without a speaker,\nwith bluetooth headphones thers not a problem.\n\nAll is updated to latest version ,\ni did try all the tweaks i could find related to audio, \nand eventually did a factory reset , \nand it didnt solve it.\n\nI also try without a protective case , without a glass cover and it didnt help.\ndid try to cover the suround mix for maybe they do noise canceling and the problem is maybe on that area of the phone , but that didnt help it completely so its hard to know if thats the case.\n\ni think i should just completely disable any active noise canceling during calls , but there is no option to do so.\n\nthank you",
