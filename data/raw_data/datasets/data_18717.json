    "title": "Alarm Won't Shuffle Spotify",
    "content": "My Clock app (just the plain Google one) used to shuffle one of my playlists as an alarm in the morning. It was great, not getting sick of the same thing every time and such. However, ever since the Clock update for Android 10 it doesn't function properly anymore. It just plays the same first song in the playlist every time, no matter what.\n\nI've tried changing which playlist it selects from, opening Spotify through the alarm selection screen and shuffling within Spotify itself, and attempting Google searches. Nothing has helped. If anyone has any advice it would be greatly appreciated!",
