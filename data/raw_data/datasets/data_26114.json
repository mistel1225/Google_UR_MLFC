    "content": "My Pixel 3 (about eight months old) worked great until last week. But now...\n\n--- Mysteriously, the phone would no longer take a charge from a USB-C to USB-C cable, though a USB-A to USB-C cable still works.\n--- The battery lifespan evaporated: I previously needed to charge the phone every 36 hours or so, but now a full charge with little/no activity only lasts about eight hours if I'm lucky. \n--- The phone will not stay powered off. About 10 seconds after shutting down, the phone turns itself back on unless it is plugged into a USB-A to USB-C charger. Normally this wouldn't be a problem, but given that the phone can't hold a charge, it's a big deal.\n\nI went through the forums and tried every fix I could find. I restarted the phone in recovery mode, saw the little green robot with the red triangle and the \"no command\" text at the bottom of the screen, rebooted into recovery mode...and nothing changed. I did a factory reset, restarting the phone \"as new\" as seen elsewhere on these forums...and nothing changed. If anything, the functionality of the phone slowed down a bit. Basically I went through this thread (https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/12851151?hl=en) and got nowhere.\n\nI'm at a loss at this point. These issues came out of nowhere on a night where the phone was resting on my nightstand. The phone has worn a protective case from the day I got it, It has never been dropped in water, and it has never fallen from more than a foot or so above the ground. I'm blindsided.\n\nAny help would be very much appreciated!",
