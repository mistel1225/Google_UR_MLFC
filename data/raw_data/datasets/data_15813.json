    "content": "Every time I touch my screen anywhere, the Google Assistant pops up on my Pixel 3XL since the 11 update.  It happens when I want to open an app, open settings, or touch anywhere.  I have restarted my phone a couple of times.  I turned off Google Assistant but then I just got a notification to turn it on every time I touched the screen.  Any suggestions?",
