    "title": "Pixel 3 XL - battery drain / lag / google not working / deleted bluetooth devices / slow charge",
    "content": "For the last few months my battery has been draining around 10% an hour. I've checked on the apps and none are using very much power. Chrome was at the top of the list at 5%\n\nLast week I woke up in the morning and the google assistant wasn't working along with any bluetooth devices. Turns out all of my devices had been cleared from the phone so I had the re-pair all of them. I cleared the chase and storage on google but that didn't fix the assistant problem. I resetup my voice and that did the trick. But once I connected my pixel buds Google crashed again. Now every time I connect my pixel buds I get a message saying \"Google keeps stopping.\" I am unable to activate the assistant by saying, \"OK Google,\" but squeezing the phone still works. I can't do anything with the assistant on my pixel buds.\n\nMy phone has become painfully slow. Switching between apps takes at lest 5 seconds and I barely have any installed.\n\nAlso, my quick charge isn't so quick anymore. it takes 2 hours to charge from 20% to 80%. And yes, I am using the charger that came with the phone.\n\nI'm on Android 9. I haven't done the most recent update because I've read a lot of people are having issues with it. \n\nSo, to sum it up, my phone dies way faster than it should, it's runs like a snail, and I can't use the voice activated assistant.",
