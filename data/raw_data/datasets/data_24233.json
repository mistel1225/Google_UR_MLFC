    "content": "I have a notification for the March update, it says \"system update paused. To continue, connect to WiFi\". However, the phone has no SIM card, so it's continually connected to WiFi.\n\nIf I click on it, same thing - \"Download paused, waiting for WiFi.\" The phone is in airplane mode, with only WiFi on. \n\nI've been able to download updates before, so this is new.",
