    "content": "Hi!\n\nSince about 2 weeks now my Pixel 3 started going into random bootloops which last randomly - some last a few minutes, the longest one about 2 hours. Then, all of the sudden, the phone boots normally.\n\nI've only used original Google images.\n\nThe bad thing is that I can't even send it to warranty as most probably the bootloop will be over by then.\n\nAny idea if this is a hardware issue or a software one?",
