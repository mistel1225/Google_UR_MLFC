    "content": "Whenever signal is lost when signal is regained it only returns for phone calls and texts. Data does not return. I have spoken with the carrier who believe it is a device issue.\n\nIf I restart my phone or turn airplane mode on / off then data returns.\n\nI've noticed it goes from H+ to 4g if this is affecting anything.\n\nI've deleted all apps relating to WiFi, have reset APN settings and checked for updates.\n\nI'm also continuing to liaise with my network who is Voxi (run by Vodafone).\n\nNo matter what I do data will not automatically reconnect. Not likely a location issue as this has happened both in England and Northern Ireland.\n\nAnyone any ideas?",
