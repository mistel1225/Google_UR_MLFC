    "content": "While recording today, my storage ran out and my phone stopped recording and deleted the entire video. This is the second time it's happened in two days. I've had this phone several months and when it runs out of storage, it just stops recording and saves what had been recorded up until that point. Now yesterday and today it's deleting everything permanently. I have no idea why or how to get it back. After yesterday's event, I cleared storage entirely to record for today's hoping it was a fluke. It still deleted mid video anyways. Now afterwards it's showing storage is low but it's still recording and taking photos with no problem. What's going on?",
