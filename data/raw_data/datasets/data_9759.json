    "content": "Since Google Play is going away, I just exported my music library through Google Takeout.  Once I unzip these music files, is there any way (or anywhere) I can save my library on my actual device?  Or do I have to have some sort of music player/streaming app to even play the songs I've already purchased??\n\nSide note - I previously had to transfer Google Play music files to the ringtones folder on my phone (to get them to upload to my Fitbit Versa...which is SUPER dumb if you ask me.  I had to figure that one out myself. \n\nI just want my music, no cloud, no streaming - I want to listen to my music offline. It used to be simple and now its not.  Any advice is appreciated.\n\nThank you!",
