    "content": "My phone is stuck in reboot mode or something. I took a picture and my phone shut off after by itself. Now it is just constantly trying to start. I tried holding down the power and volume down buttons. the screen switches to fastboot mode and gives me the option of using the power button to start or using the volume buttons to select a different menu. Any button press just sends back to trying to restart.",
