    "content": "I know a good amount of people are having this problem but has there been any solution to the rear camera on pixels crashing and not working. Mine stopped working out of nowhere flashlight and camera will crash only front camera works I've tried safe mode resetting it and even clearing the cache and memory from the app but nothing. What's worse is I hear they don't address this. It's sad because I've always liked pixels for the UI and camera but look at mines now a phone from the early 2000s that's only good for texting and calling.",
