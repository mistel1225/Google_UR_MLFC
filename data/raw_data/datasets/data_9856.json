    "content": "Once accidentally choose Always for launching email on Outlook Account from icon in Google News Feed. Want to change settings to Always Ask, but can't find settings.\n\nIn earlier post Diamond Product Expert Scott posted a solution and another expert marked the answer Recommended, but b the solution did not work.\n\nScott then posted another answer then closed the thread but the other answer didn't work either. Here's the second answer from Scott:\n\n\"Sorry left out a step. Go to apps and notification, show apps. Then tap the three dots on the top right and show system. Then you should see Google news.\"\n\nBut neither Google News nor News appears in the list. Very frustrating. Thanks in advance for any other help.",
