    "content": "While I haven't changed any settings, my contacts and phone app on pixel 3XL are now permanently on dark mode.\nOn each app, the display setting says \"Dark mode in device settings is on\" I cannot do anything to this line.\nThe device display setting is set to \"automatic\". changing this to light, dark mode, or automatic has no incidence on the contact or phone, which remain in dark mode.\nI changed the wall paper, this also had no effect.",
