    "title": "Refurb OG pixel. The battery seems to be bad - dies when taking pictures and suddenly, drains fast.",
    "content": "Battery seems to die/drain rapidly, especially when taking pictures.\nI attempted to update, but the phone died (at 70%!) mid attempt, and restarted showing only 5%.\nI attempted a factory reset, but the problem persisted. \nAny idea what I can do? I suspect this to be a case of poor battery. I would prefer having the problem fixed to having to return and replace the phone - I have no complaints about the rest of it, it seems like a good product.",
