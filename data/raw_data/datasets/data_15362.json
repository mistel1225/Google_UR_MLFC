    "content": "Im on Android 10 with my old Pixel 2, in hopes of improving the battery life, I performed a factory reset. Before I did this, I checked my back up settings and it stated that everything was currently backed up properly.\n\nUpon logging into my account I received a notification of \"back up not found.\" I checked Google Drive which also, had nothing in the storage section.\n\nTo add insult to injury, my phone is now also experiencing the dreaded \"waiting to back up\" bug for the first time in 3 years.\n\nWhat in the freaking hell happened here?",
