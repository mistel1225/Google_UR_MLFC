Then I tried receiving a call from an other cell phone but it still didn't get accepted.\nStrange, y can't the executive directly call and talk rather than asking for options which doesn't go through? Very difficult to function without phone. Kindly call and resolve. Google pixel 2 xl is giving me a hard time. My alternate contact no. is 8356955756. Kindly assist",
