    "content": "Frequent battery drain issue post the last two security updates that I had trouble in downloading over WiFi. I was advised to Factory Reset for this simple case. However, I was able to download over Mobile Hotpot. Google Support team need to be trained with quick resolutions like this.\n\nNow to the battery issue - I plug my phone to charge at 25% and all of a sudden the battery is 98%. And after finishing a call the battery was down to 30%. And now while I was writing this, I put my phone on charge at 32% within 5mins the charge is 45%. Something is really wrong with all this rapid charge and drain.\n\nCan someone help me here to address this? I really expect Google's attention in this case and mere bit of responsibility has to come from the company. I am a 3 generation Pixel user, at least for that I feel I shall be considered for a priority resolution.",
