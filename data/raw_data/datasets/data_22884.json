    "title": "Refurbished replacement phone with no signal?",
    "content": "Due to software updating issues (process system error whenever I tried to update to Android 10, resulting in soft reboot loop) I was sent a replacement refurbished Pixel 2. The new phone was not able to receive signal (empty bar with a cross). I have contacted support earlier and went through the list of methods (restart device, reset network, clear Fi cache/data, update system, check data permissions, dialed FIXME, changed provider using dial.\nUsing FIINFO it showed the sim operator is T-Mobile and the network operator is Unknown.\nCase ID: 2-7782000029675\nFor some odd reason when I ate out at a restaurant the data turned on for a bit. I thought the problem was resolved but when I checked it 15 minutes later it went back to the empty bar with crosses.",
