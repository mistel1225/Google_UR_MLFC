    "content": "I have a google pixel 3 phone where the battery kept running hot even when off and eventually would not charge and turn off randomly, put it in for warranty claim though service provider and has been declined saying liquid damage even though the phone has never been wet.  Also the phone is in as new condition and confirmed by whoever inspected the phone. Service provider says to contact Google but every number I try refers you to Google supoort. Maybe I should contact ACCC. There seems to be no after support. Any help would be appreciated",
