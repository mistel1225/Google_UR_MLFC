    "content": "If possible, I want to create a folder on my phone that is never backed up. Is there a setting that can do that natively?\n\nMy reason: I sometimes have a need to temporarily save documents to transfer, and I'd love to keep using my phone. I transfer them to a secure device within a day and after which I neither need, nor want, nor am allowed, to have a personal electronic copy anywhere after I'm able to save the files.\n\nI've tried: I've looked for folder settings in the \"Files\" app and I've started using the Hidden Cabinet feature of Asus's File Manager app but I can see the folder and it's contents from the \"Files\" app and so am not sure it is not being backed up. \n\nAlso, thanks for your patience in case I've missed an already existing article on this. Any mention of backup in a general web search or on forums only brings up hundreds of posts telling how to back up information. \n\nThanks,\nCal",
