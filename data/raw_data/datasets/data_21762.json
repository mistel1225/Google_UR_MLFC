    "content": "I've been using pixel 3XL for over a year and it's ok, until today when I unlocked it, the screen seemed to be covered with a glossy film. It made my screen look mat, the screen was no longer flaming as bright/ colorful as it used to be (I used dark mode, but black has changed to gray) it's too bad.  \n\n**My screen is normally, not cracked, not dropped, not dead pixels.  And I also tried to fix by apps, turn off develop mode, even factory reset but it all failed. \nAnyone who knows about this error please help me.\nTHANKS.",
