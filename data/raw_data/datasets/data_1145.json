    "title": "My pixel buds gen 2 keeps on shifting audio loudness to right or left depending on battery level.",
    "content": "I have noticed that the Pixel Buds Gen 2 usually shifts audio loudness from one side to the other. At first I thought it was just balancing both sides, then I noticed that every time it did this it was because one side had more battery. I think I saw somewhere that said pixel buds will balance processing to balance battery usage, but I didn't think it would physically change the volume to decrease battery usage. Whenever one side of pixel buds have more than around 25% battery, that side starts to play at a louder volume. I am sure it isn't because of the buds shifting in my ear because I have felt the volume change while I have been just sitting down not moving. Maybe software update or feature to turn off this battery balancing feature?",
