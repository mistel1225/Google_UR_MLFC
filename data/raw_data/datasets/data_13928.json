    "content": "Does the Pixel 5 support n40 (5G @ 2300Mhz TDD)?\n\nIt's not listed on the spec sheet, but the EU regulatory information lists n40 support. \nhttps://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/9910799?hl=en&ref_topic=7083615\n\nFurther, Optus (Australia's second carrier) lists it as supported on its website (under specifications):\nhttps://www.optus.com.au/mobile/phones/google/pixel-5\n\nI note the Optus website provides a LOT more detail about the LTE capabilities of the Pixel 5, including which bands are 2x2 and which are 4x4 MIMO.  Not sure how accurate that is.",
