    "content": "I've got every setting right. Ringtone is selected, volume is enabled. I've always used 'do not disturb' without letting any calls through, except for the repeated calls within 15 min. But when someone calls me twice within 15 minutes, i still get no ringtone. \nThis was all working correctly until the latest update. \nCan someone help me out? \nI could add screenshots of the settings menu, but the would be in the Dutch language.",
