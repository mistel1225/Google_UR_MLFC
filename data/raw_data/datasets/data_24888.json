    "content": "Hi,\n\nI bought a first Pixel in US in December 2016. Due to the bug with constant restarting I had to replace it and I got a new device in January 2018. Since then it was working perfectly well until recently when it stopped connecting to WiFi (no matter it is opened public one, private at home or tethering from other mobile).\n\nI've tried all the solutions found in HC and on the web (changing WEP to WPA, frequency of wifi's, etc.) up to factory reset. I've done all the updates up to android 10, but nothing helped. Whenever I try to connect I receive either \"password is incorrect\" or \"wifi is saved, but can't connect\" meanwhile my Pixel 2 and 3 works fine with those networks.\n\nWhen I reached to support over the chat I was redirected to send it to US/UK for repairing and this would cost me the same as a new phone (I'm based in Poland).\n\nQuestion: Is there any way to fix it at lower cost or myself? \n\nI'm quite annoyed with this situation that I have a phone in perfect condition, that could be used for another 4-5 years, but can't do it due to hardware/production issues, not even my fault. And it's the second time that happens...\n\nThanks for your help.\nd.",
