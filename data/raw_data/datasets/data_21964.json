    "content": "Hi, for several weeks now I haven't been getting most text messages on my Pixel 2XL. I can send messages just fine to everyone. I can't receive them at all from most people; from some people, I get a few messages but not the majority of the ones they send. The carrier, Boom Mobile (thru Verizon's network), has supposedly reset the line several times with no result, or maybe temporary improvement then relapse (because I get some messages anyway, it's hard to tell whether temporary improvement is related to anything!). I've cleared the cache of the basic messages app on my phone, tried using Textra instead, and reset APN settings. Boom now wants me to do a factory reset on the whole phone, which I really don't want to do!! I haven't yet tried ''clear storage'' on the Messages app, because am not sure if it would delete all messages?? Also really don't want to do that...\n\nAny suggestions would be much appreciated, bearing in mind I'm not super tech savvy, so might need specific instructions. ;-) Thanks!",
