    "content": "I recently got a Pixel 3 and transferred my Whatsapp chats and media from my old phone. However, all of this media and new media (i.e. photos, videos) received from chats in Whatsapp do not save to my Google Photos app, despite having auto download selected in my Whatsapp settings. Anyone else encountered this and know a solution? I've tried deleting and reinstalling both Whatsapp and Google Photos but no luck. Cheers",
