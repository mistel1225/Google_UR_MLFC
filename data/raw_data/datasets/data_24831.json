    "title": "Pixel 3 Unresponsive Game Pad",
    "content": "I have been unable to use a game pad with my Google pixel 3 (running most recent android version (05/06/19)). I have tried both an Xbox 360 and ps4 controller, via blue tooth and otg USB. In all instances the game pad is connected and recognised by the phone and appears in connected devices, however the game pad will not work.\n\nI have tried using it in game, with an emulator button mapper, a separate button mapping app and on the home screen to no avail.\n\nTo all appearances it seems as if the relevant drivers are not installed, however I cannot check this without rooting (something I'd prefer to avoid). \n\nThe only suggestion I have found on the community so far is to flash the device back to android 9.0 (again would like to avoid this).\n\nAny help would be appreciated!",
