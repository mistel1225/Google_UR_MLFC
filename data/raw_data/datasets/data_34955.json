    "content": "The only punctuation marks that gboard recognises in the voice to text mode are: comma, period, exclamation and question mark. All other punctuation marks are spelled out. This is unacceptable. I have the latest version of Gboard, 7.9.10.232095665-beta-arm64-v8a.\n\nGoogle Pixel, Android Pie, February security patch,\nUS English selected (but all words are spelt with the British variant !! Another bug....)",
