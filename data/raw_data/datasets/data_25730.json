    "content": "Disabling Smart Lock On-body Detection reliably stops the issue from happening, however I would like to be able to turn it back on. Can someone please investigate this bug?\n\nGoogle Support has already had me clear data and cache from the Pixel Launcher and System UI and reset app preferences. I don't want to go through the hassle of doing a factory reset since I'm able to fix the issue by disabling On-body Detection.",
