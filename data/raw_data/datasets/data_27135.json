    "content": "I wanted to upgrade to the P4XL from my P2XL things I do not like... No unlimited storage it was the reason I migrated away from the Samsung. Not impressed with the camera they should have put in a wide angle camera to go with the standard, that is a disappointment. I do not want a phone with face unlock, bring back the fingerprint sensor please. Please create a phone with 1TB of storage I am not always in cell or wifi range and I like to have more of my files with me.",
