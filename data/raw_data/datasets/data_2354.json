    "content": "My phone is constantly in the white startup screen. It just has the \"G\" icon and slowly overheats. \n\nI can't do a factory reset. When  I hold  the power + sound bottom buttons it sends me into the boot page. As soon as I let the buttons go, it goes back to the startup screen. No chance to select different options. I already took the  case off. My phone has no scratches or screen cracks.\n\nAny ideas other than just waiting for the battery to die and bringing it into a Verizon store?",
