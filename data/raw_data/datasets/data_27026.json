    "content": "Just a list of things I've discovered so far for those of you contemplating an upgrade but wondering which features won't be available to you.\n\nCar crash detection - \"Car crash detection is available in the United States and in English only\" (see \"Turn on car crash detection\" section on linked page)\nGoogle One Pro sessions - US and Canada only (see screenshot at base of post taken from Pixel tips app on the phone). \nCall Screening - \"You can screen calls in English, in the United States and Canada, on all Pixel phones and on some other Android phones.\" (reference). I think this arrived with the Pixel 3, so a bit concerning that it's still not available in the UK. Does the feature need some sort of carrier integration which might explain the absence?",
