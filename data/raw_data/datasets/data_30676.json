    "content": "I noticed that my two phones have different times. The Pixel XL is keeping the correct time, but the Pixel 3 drifts. Right now it's over 2 minutes off from the correct time (running fast). \n\nAfter a reset, the time is in sync but then it begins to drift over the next few days.\n\nhttps://photos.app.goo.gl/ae8PdrSCmmYfURBY7\n\nBoth phones are on T-Mobile.\n\nNot sure if it's related to any battery-saving feature which is enabled on only the Pixel 3.\n\nAny thoughts on the reason?",
