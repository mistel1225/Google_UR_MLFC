    "content": "Just got a new Pixel 4. Whether I am in chrome, or an app, many images are loading very slowly, or essentially time out. My wifi signal is strong, and a Pixel 2xl that is connected to the same wifi has none of these issues. \n\nI've restarted the phone and some of the previous image loading attempts in chrome or app, are better but still very laggy.\n\nFrustrating.",
