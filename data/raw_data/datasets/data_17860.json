    "content": "Initially I thought my phone was just slow. Then anything I went into would give me system ui not responding. I have reset the phone, done recovery mode and still can’t get in my phone. I can enter my security to unlock but then I can’t do anything else. Somewhere along the way the phone got into airplane mode and the date says June 10 on the screen. How can I do a factory reset if I can’t get in the phone past unlocking it?",
