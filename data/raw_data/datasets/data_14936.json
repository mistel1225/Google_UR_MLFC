    "content": "After a week of Android 11 my Pixel 3 XL is stuck in a boot loop. \n\nNo major issues with 11 until this point, minor bugs were noticed. But randomly the phone restarted in my pocket and that was the end. Never turned back on. Of course my Pixel is just out of warranty. \n\nI have tired letting the phone die.\nRecovery mode does not work. If I press volume buttons at all it instantly restarts. It stays on the recovery menu for 10 seconds max before restarting, so not able to connect to a computer. \nI have let it sit for a couple days before trying again. \nI contacted google, they told me to take to an authorized repair shop, which is UBreakiFix by me. They said there's nothing I can do. Further, they said they have seen this problem multiple times now all after installing android 11. \n\nI am shocked that a stable system update has bricked my phone and many others as well. Hoping this is a minority of cases and not the norm for most 3 XL users. Any others? If there is anyway to flash a rom to it or any other suggestions I am happy to try. Really cannot afford an upgrade right now.",
