    "title": "Headphone, Battery and Phone Call issues since update in early April 2019",
    "content": "I'm on Android 9 with the last security patch on April 5. This last update royally messed up my phone.\n\nI can't receive or make phone calls without rebooting my phone first. The phone rings and vibrates but the button to answer won't show up, or it shows up and I answer and it's silent and the other person can't hear me.\n\nMy headphones won't work unless I reboot. I've tried 3 sets of headphones with different apps and it's the same. I also tried deleting my bluetooth paired devices to no effect.\n\nThe day after the update my battery suddenly dropped to 3% from 52% as I was looking at my phone trying to answer a phone call.\n\nReally hoping I don't have to do a factory reset but thinking it might be my only option at this point. I'm rebooting my phone 5x a day.\n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated!",
