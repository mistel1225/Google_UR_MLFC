    "content": "Ever since I updated to android 11, Amazon links don't open in the Amazon app anymore. I have tried absolutely everything to force them to open in the app and nothing works, they always open in chrome now. \n\nI uninstalled and reinstalled the Amazon app and even uninstalled Chrome updates to see if I could bypass Chrome and I couldn't. I have the proper defaults set and everything and Amazon links still won't open in app. \n\nThis wasn't happening before the update so I don't understand why it's happening now or how to fix it or what to do.",
