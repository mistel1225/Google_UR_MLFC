    "content": "About once every few weeks my Pixel XL 1 will both go into Airplane Mode and the Flashlight will turn on.  It only seems to happen when the device is in my pocket and I've been walking around.  It's always those two specific things that occur and they're always together, so I don't believe that this is just from leaving the display active when I put it in my pocket.",
