    "content": "Have just recently started to get a green colored pop up the says phone temperature high and indicates too many apps may be running. I am not doing anything different than I have in the past. Have used the Pixel 3XL for over 2 years.  No information is given on how to correct the problem.   I can either X it closed click the 3 dots in upper left corner and only option is disable. ",
