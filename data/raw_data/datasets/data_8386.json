    "content": "Google Keep Android app does not update when notes are added from web app from windows desktop platform. Conversely, notes entered on the Android app do not sync back to the web app. I have checked, under accounts, to verify that the sync box has been checked. I have cleared cache, cleared storage and uninstalled and reinstalled the app with no success. I have been having this issue for a number of months now and experienced it on my Pixel 4 XL as well as this Pixel 5. It's worth noting that even when I force a sync through the account settings it does not update either..... Any help with be greatly appreciated!!",
