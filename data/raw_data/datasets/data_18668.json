    "content": "I have taken the phone to the authorized repair center Google directed me to. They have verified the device is defective and cannot be repaired. How long will it take to receive the new one? \n\nThe reason I ask is that depending on the time frame, I may not choose this route. It's already been a week and I've been screwed around really badly by the service provider and am considering just canceling my service and getting new service entirely at this point.",
