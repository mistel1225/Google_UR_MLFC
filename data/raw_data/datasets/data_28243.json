    "content": "Since upgrading to a Pixel 3XL and switching to Fi, useful call blocking has become increasingly difficult and now is effectively impossible.  I wish to block calls that are not in my Contacts.  This used to be simple.\nIt appears that API and/or permission/policy changes have made it difficult or impossible for 3rd party devs to implement call blocking features.  \nAndroid's stock black listing feature is worthless.  Yes, I've heard word of contact list based blocking being in beta for Google Phone, but that's missing the point.\nI've noticed increasing numbers of complaints in the play store against the various call blocking apps with words to the effect of \"this used to work and now it doesn't\". \n I'm sick to death of being interrupted by spam calls just so goog can showcase its Call Screening feature.  I don't want to hear these calls AT ALL.  This used to be possible and, I'm pretty sure thx to goog, now it isn't.\nSo..., IS there a call blocking app, that works, that is known to actually block calls not in the Contact list, on an up to date Pixel 3 XL?",
