    "title": "Severe issues when talking to someone on speaker. There's a constant echo. Suggestions? April 2021",
    "content": "Anytime I speak with someone on speakerphone, they have to wait 3 to 5 seconds to hear me, and even when they do they can't understand me because it keeps breaking up. I can usually hear them just fine. \n\nI have tried everything that the internet suggests to fix it, but I'm not going to factory reset my phone. I don't understand why every two years there's an issue with new phones. I had hoped Google Pixel would be different.",
