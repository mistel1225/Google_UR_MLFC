    "content": "My Pixel 2 XL turns off when plugged into charge. This happens with official charger and cable and is not software related. I've tried factory resets & updates and the issue also occurs before the phone/Android starts. I am unable to request a callback from Google support as it keeps telling me my phone number is wrong. Can someone please contact me or give me a way to contact Google support in order to get this matter resolved? Thank you",
