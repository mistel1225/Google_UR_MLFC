    "content": "I want to use Helium as a backup, as it backs up apps also. I can't get phone to show a screen as being connected. It shows in Device Manager, where safe to remove devices, it's listed. Just no screen to allow actions. I have put it min data transfer mode, to no avail. It seems to connect to computer. Using the original charge/sync cable. Any help would be appreciated.",
