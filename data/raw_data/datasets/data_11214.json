    "content": "Hello, I have the pixel 5 and although mostly working good, I have started to notice issue with calls. \n\nI have discovered over last few days that when I am on the phone call, mostly happens after at least 5mins on call that my phone will cut out/hang up without warning. This isn't isolated to one caller, as had happened to few of my contacts while on the phone to them. Has anyone else experienced similar issues, as still only recently found this issue so unsure if pixel 5 or Vodafone who I am with.\n\nThanks, any advice would be appreciated on this",
