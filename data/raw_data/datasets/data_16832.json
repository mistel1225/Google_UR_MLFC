    "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nI wanted to know if Pixel phones - have the \"Scheduled Power on/off\" feature that was available on Android 8. Android 11 just came out and I've been looking to see if this feature has made a comeback. I know Pixel phones have the \"Bedtime Schedule\" feature, but the Grayscale + Do Not Disturb features alone aren't really what I'm looking for. I thought it would have an option to automate shutdown, but I couldn't find it. Does anyone know if the \"scheduled power on/off\" is back - or a way I can enable it? \n\nI have a Pixel 3aXL right now, but my previous phone (not a pixel) ran on Android 8 and had this feature.",
