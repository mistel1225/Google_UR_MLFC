    "content": "When I use Pixel1 it was not possible to disable internet access (mobile data) from the lockscreen.\nIn Pixel4 with Android 10 this is possible. \nI think this is a security risk since anybody could easily cut off the internet access so no tracking of a lost phone would be possible. \n\nHow do I change this setting?",
