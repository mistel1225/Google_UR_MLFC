    "title": "Bluetooth connection with Samsung Gear S2 won't allow switching phone's audio output to speakerphone",
    "content": "When in a call on my phone and connected to my Samsung Gear S2, it shows that the audio output is coming from my watch, but it's actually coming from the phone's earpiece. When I try to change it to speakerphone, it will let me click it, but it won't change. I have done a factory reset on my watch, which didn't work. I also deleted and then re-downloaded the phone app on Google, with the help from another person on your support team. There was one instance where I turned on a Bluetooth speaker, while simultaneously on the phone and it connected to my watch. That switched the call's audio output to my speaker, and then I was able to change it to speakerphone. Also, today I was clicking & un-clicking the mute button while on a call. On the phone, it would show that it was changing back and forth from the phone earpiece to speakerphone, but it never actually switched from the phone's earpiece. Just a few minutes ago, I filled out a form to get a call from Google for support. They called back immediately and were in the process of connecting me with someone on the Pixel team to help. After waiting about 2 minutes, the call suddenly dropped. I really want to like this phone, but it has been a beyond frustrating experience.",
