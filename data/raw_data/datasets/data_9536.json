    "content": "I just noticed now that the top speaker is a lot quieter than before. I can no longer enjoy the stereo sound that the speakers once had. I tried the left-right stereo sound test and when the left channel is playing, the right (bottom) speaker is the one making the sound instead of the top speaker. I don't know if this is a hardware issue or because of the recent Android 11 update. Any help will do! Thanks!",
