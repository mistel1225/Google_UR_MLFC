    "content": "I have a Pixel 3 and the Back-up Now button is greyed out and App Data, Call History, Device Settings and SMS Text Messages say \"Waiting to backup\". I contacted Google support and they had me do everything on their support tips page which included clearing the cache for play services, removing my Google account from the phone and putting it back on, dialing *#*#checkin#*#* into the keypad, turning the sync off and back on for my Google account and the Back Up, and none of that has work. I did get the button to come back on and everything said it synched up when I disabled the security (finger print and pattern) on my phone. Once I disabled it everything worked just fine, but then I reenabled it and it went back to how it was.",
