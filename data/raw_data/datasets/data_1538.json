    "content": "I have been having issues with my pixel screen for a while now and last week my phone dropped and the screen hasn't been responsive since then but today when I  took off the old screen protector the phone seemed to be working which is good but it requires me to use my phone without a protector which is so dangerous and risky so i was wondering what to do as i cant use my phone without a screen protector",
