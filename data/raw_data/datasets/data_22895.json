    "title": "Pixel 3a Screen not responding to unpit, taps things on its own.",
    "content": "I have had my pixel 3a since December, yesterday the pixel still functioned except that it did not react to my input (touching the screen), instead it 'touches' things on its own, it looks like a haunted phone when I wake the screen, the best way I can describe it is that it spasms. I have never dropped it, nor has it ever come in contact with water. I have had a screen protector on but I have removed it, no progress. I then factory reset the phone through recovery mode, same issue but now in the setup screen (https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/6010316?hl=en). I presume this is a hardware issue. I live in the Netherlands and there is no repair option within the country, I also cannot come in to contact with google employees to assist me with a repair. I came here looking for your guidance. Any help would be greatly appreciated.\n\nKindest, Kaan",
