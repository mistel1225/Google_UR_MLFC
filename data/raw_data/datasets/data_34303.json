    "content": "I noticed a few days ago that my media (music, podcasts, videos, etc) was inexplicably pausing and/or playing through the speakers when I had headphones plugged in. After some variable elimination, I've determined that it occurs when pressure is applied to the headphones into the USB port. I've also determined that it is not specific to the headphones that come in the box, but seems to occur with any headphones I plug in. I'm worried that my USB port has been damaged (seems unlikely - I'm very gentle with my phone), but I'd like to know if any one else has experienced this before I make a service request.",
