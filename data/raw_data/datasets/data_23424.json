    "content": "The NFC on my phone stopped working altogether, so I thought it was no longer able to read the travel cards through the OtterBox case I am using. I removed the case and had the same issue. I searched for \"NFC\" in the settings and it was still switched on.\n\nHowever, when I switched the NFC off and back on again, it connected to my travel card instantly. I tried a different card, and back to not working again. I went back to the first card and it too was not working again. It turns out, when i switch NFC off and on, it only reads the first card and then stops working.\n\nThe workaround is to switch it on/off every time I need to use it, but that's a pain in the ***, really.\n\nAnyone encountered similar issues before?",
