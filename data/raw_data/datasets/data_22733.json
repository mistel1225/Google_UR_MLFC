    "content": "Hello, my Pixel 3 just bricked. I've followed steps to attempt a recovery without losing personal data via these guides, using 9.0.0 (PD1A.180720.030, Sep 2018):\n\nhttps://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/17930356?hl=en\nhttps://medium.com/@glebovgin/how-to-fix-cant-load-android-system-issue-8a5b0ead5a15\n\nI made it almost all the way through, but when trying to use the adb sideload command in Terminal (Mac), I get the following error:\n\nE:Failed to verify package compatibility (result 1): runtime info and framework compatibility matrix are incompatible: Missing config CONFIG_NETFILTER_XT_MATCH_QTAGUID\n\nInstall from ADB completed with status 2.\nInstallation aborted\n\nIs there any way I can avoid doing a hard factory reset? Thank you!",
