    "content": "So I have had my Pixel 3 for a couple of weeks, and after a few days I noticed a loud and distracting buzzing noise coming from the bottom speaker whenever I played audio. I've heard this is a problem with several Pixels, but today I was listening to some music and it stopped. I wondered if it had fixed itself, so I put my ear to the bottom speaker, only to discover that no sound at all was coming out. I tried listening on videos and other pieces of music, but no sound comes out the bottom speaker except from the occasional very loud buzzy crackle which suddenly cuts out again. I tried running it in safe mode but the problem persisted. Does anyone know a fix for this?",
