    "content": "We recently purchased two 4A5G pixels. When in voice calls and using the speaker on either phone, caller's report that periodically our voices become muffled. Sometimes, when two of us are on the call, it's only one person's voice and simply changing physical positions seems to help. It happens on both of our phones.  Also leaning the phone against something upside down seems to help. Has anyone else experienced this?",
