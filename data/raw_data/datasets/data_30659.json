    "content": "My laptop will tether via WiFi and USB but shows limited or no internet. When I trouble shoot on the laptop it states it's a problem with the DNS. I've checked my network settings on the laptop and they look ok. I tried all the tips in other posts to adjust my phone ( app cache clearing, resetting network on phone, swtuchu g AP to 5, etc) with no luck. I haven't had the phone too long but the tether worked a few days ago. These troubles  might coincide with a system update but not sure. Running Android 9. I saw the latest update fixed a tether issue for pixel 2, but have pixel had troubles too? Thanks",
