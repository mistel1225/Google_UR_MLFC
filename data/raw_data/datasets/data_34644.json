    "title": "play music skips through songs without playing them",
    "content": "Started when using as my phone. Had to get a new device but I want my daughter to use it. Trying to have video chats will lock up the device. Trying to play music through Google play music when you plug in headphones it will skip through tracks rather than play them. Sometimes I can connect Bluetooth to play on external speakers. Sometimes the internal speakers work, sometimes they don't. Sometimes restarting the device temporarily fixes the problem.",
