    "title": "Play Store freezing after June Android Update",
    "content": "Hello All\n\nI was wondering if anyone has noticed this with their phones. Directly after the June update was applied y Google Play store application freezing my phone. Sometimes it works fine but I would say it freezes the phone about 80% of the time. Works if I force close the app but then if I go out and back in it might happen again.\n\nI have rebooted, cleared cace, data and disabled/re-enabled the google play store app and updated to latest play store version. Nothing seems to work.\n\nIt was no issue what so ever up to the exact day the June update was applied. \n\nAny ideas? \n\nAnd no, I'm not doing a reset of the phone, that's the lazy mans way of fixing something. Like people who recommend formatting and reinstalling windows because of an issue.",
