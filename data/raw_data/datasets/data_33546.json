    "content": "I've had my Google Pixel 2 XL for less than a year as I purchased it in June of 2018. I play mobile games on it for about 6 hours a week but it's mostly used for email and social media apps. I'm playing the same mobile game I've been playing for months, and the performance lag is just getting worse and worse. I have to reboot the phone every 30 minutes otherwise the game gets choppy now. It's a popular game and I don't see any other users complaining about the sudden increase in performance issues. \n\nIn doing some research, I heard it might be a hardware issue... what would the next steps be? \n\nI ran a benchmark test using the Geekbench 4 app. My phone scored 1786 vs the AVERAGE of 1868.  So that doesn't' sound good given it's less than a year old and already below average in performance.",
