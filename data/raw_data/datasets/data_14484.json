    "content": "It is connected to WiFi, but many apps will say that I am not connected to the internet. I have done a factory reset, reset the network, turned the phone off and back on, I have checked the network accesability on the apps, and all are normal and able to use Wifi. My other devices all connect fine and work great on my wifi.",
