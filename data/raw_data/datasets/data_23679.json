    "content": "I have my screen timeout set for 2 minutes but the screen turns off after 10 to 15 seconds, meaning the screen goes black and I have to unlock it again. It's very annoying when I'm trying to read something. I have tried restarting my phone a couple times but that does not work. Any suggestions?\n\nRecently got a system update and still doesn't work*",
