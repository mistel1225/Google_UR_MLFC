    "title": "Google Assistant's Weather results stopped working at home.",
    "content": "Whenever I ask my Assistant on my (and also on my gf's) Pixel 2 for a weather-related query, I always get an irrelevant result (see screenshot below) in a form of an external link (youtube or otherwise) . But it only happens when I'm at home or nearby â€“ at work usually I get results I should. It's happening both on mobile and on wifi. The only thing that I can imagine is something with GPS shielding but my maps & compass works just fine while at home.\n\nIt's pretty frustrating as it just suddenly stopped working (had a morning routine since I own the phone and I haven't moved since to a different place)",
