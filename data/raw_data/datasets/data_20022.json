    "content": "Internet stops working multiple times a day. Requires restart, works for some time and then stops working again. Have been facing problems with incoming/outgoing calls as well.\n\nThe fact that it starts working after restart tells me that the issue is with the phone and not my Sim card/service provider.\n\nMultiple restarts a day for such basic feature to work is very frustrating. Please look into this.",
