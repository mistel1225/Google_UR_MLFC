    "content": "I have a Pixel 3 with Android 10 (Build QP1A.191105.003) \n\nI have the Adaptive Brightness enabled. After a couple of days I will notice that it's no longer working. I'll go into the setting and it will be disabled. I re-enable it and after a couple of days it's turned itself off again. Rinse repeat. \n\nIs anyone else having this problem?",
