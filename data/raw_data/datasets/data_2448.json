    "content": "My Pixel 2 was working fine, battery level at around 30%.  Suddenly the screen went blank.  When I plug it in, the red light turns on, then off, followed by the charging symbol appearing on the screen for a moment, then disappearing.  Red light again, then charging symbol again.  This goes on continuously.  When trying to turn it on while plugged in, the white google page appears for a second, then back to the black screen and red light/charging screen dance.  When unplugged, no response to any buttons.\nTried holding the power and volume down button, managed to get the Android menu to stay on the screen a few times and attempted every option it had to no avail.  \nTried different chargers and plugging it into a computer. No change.\nWhat happened??  Is it kaput??",
