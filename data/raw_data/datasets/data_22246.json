    "content": "My Pixel 2 xl recently stopped working through the USB C port with the dongle. I've tested the dongle and my pair of headphones on other devices and I can confirm that they are working perfectly. One day the music was playing perfectly through the USB C port and then the next day it wouldn't play music through the USB C port at all and a notification saying 'charging Connected device via usb' will now always pop up whenever I try to play audio. Is there a fix for this?",
