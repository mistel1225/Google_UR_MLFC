    "content": "Taken many pictures every one of em has had this issue, black blobs lines dots, if you zoom in you can see they are made up of more dots, it's really noticable if I'm using this camera for photography, they can be different colours too, zoom in each pic and you can see them much more clearly, my lens are very clean btw.",
