    "title": "My Pixel(2016) microphone and sound stopped working after the Android 10 update.",
    "content": "Before I had Android 10 installed I was doing fine, but my phone started getting sluggish due to apps, cache, storage, etc... So I wanted to start fresh again, and thought I'd do a factory reset. So I did a factory reset and everything was going dandy and was surprised there was Android 10, I hadn't kept up with the releases. Anywho, I started noticing I couldn't make calls and the recipients couldn't hear me and then my sound went off. I decided to factory reset again to see if it worked. It worked and then as it updated apps it just got worse. I factory resetted at least 5 times still same outcome. I don't know what to do. Google support ghosts me so I'm lost here.",
