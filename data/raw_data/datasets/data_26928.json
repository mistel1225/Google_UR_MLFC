    "title": "My Pixel 2 XL restarts within 5 minutes of connecting to most wifi networks",
    "content": "I have tried many different wifi networks and only 2 did not make my phone restart. That being my home network and Harvey's guest.\n\nMy phone doesn't \"restart\" like it would from the power menu. Instead, the screen goes black for about 4 seconds, then shows the lockscreen. I enter my password because it says \"password required after device restarts.\" Then, once it loads, all of my previously open apps are now closed.",
