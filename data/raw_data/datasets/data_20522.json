    "content": "I'm on my third Pixel 2xl and staying on Android 9 because both previous phones, immediately after updating to Android 10, lost wifi connection consistency.  In December, Google admitted a problem and said they'd have a fix in \"a couple of months\", but I've seen nothing since then.  Is it fixed or not?",
