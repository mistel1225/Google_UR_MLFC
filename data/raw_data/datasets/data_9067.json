    "title": "Audio skipping and stuttering when screen locked",
    "content": "Since the most recent update, the audio on the Pixel 3a will intermittently stutter and randomly pause. This is most often when the screen is locked. I have tried to reinstall the audio software (Spotify, Poweramp, YouTube, etc. ) And no change has occurred. The audio volume will sometimes skip (up in volume) which has the potential to be very dangerous. \n\nThis started only with the most recent update to Android 11.\n\nEdit: The most recent update which came out 3 days ago to the Pixel 3a did not solve the problem. It is occurring when using Spotify and other audio apps. I have been using my Jaybird Tarah earbuds, but it also happens when casting to my Chromecast. \n\nThis is extremely frustrating and completely unacceptable.",
