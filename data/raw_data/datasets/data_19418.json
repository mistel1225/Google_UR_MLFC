    "content": "I recently purchased a Google Pixel 4. I’m running into some dead-ends with connecting my Rode WirelessGo microphone to record audio while shooting video.\n\nI purchased the following two adaptors that should fix the connection problem. \n\nGoogle USB Type C to 3.5mm Headphone Adapter Pixel USB Type-C (For Pixel 4)\n\nKingtop 3.5mm Combo Audio Adapter Cable for New Version Laptop\nhttps://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01I3A47I4/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o02_s04?ie=UTF8&psc=1\n\nThe phone says it recognizes the external microphone, yet it doesn’t record any audio when they are connected.\n\nAny Suggestions? Are they just not compatible?",
