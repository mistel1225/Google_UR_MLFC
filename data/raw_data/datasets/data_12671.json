    "content": "Before my issue, I had created groupings of Games(& others) &  HAD the apps on the screen.  Some apps I need to make my Display smaller from largest. When changing back to largest, all my old groupings or single apps return & I keep Removing them. I believe it happened after the last update to 11. I don't want to Factory reset & not ready to upgrade. TY",
