    "content": "Sporadically, my phone will receive Bluetooth has stopped error messages every 3 to 5 seconds.  It used to be remedied by a quick restart and it would be good to go for a few days. Now it happens almost no matter what I do. \nI have tried the following\n*Factory Reset\n*Reset network settings dozens of times\n*Clearing the Google play cache\n* Updating Google play system ( for some reason my phone will download the Feb 1st 2020 update but it will not install after restart. I will make a separate post for that issue)\n\nThis is beyond frustrating my phone is essentially bricked. If it is not resolved as I know 1000s of other people have had this issue. I will be sure to spread far and wide how terrible Google's product support is and will be sure it is clear to everyone I know that Google pixels are not worth the hassle after purchase.",
