    "content": "I was watching YouTube when the phone was frozen. He didn't start so I decided to restart him. And after this he didn't turn on. I can't even turn off it as phone turns on, after Google logo (\"G\") stops, turns off and again turns on. Do not even know what to do. Please, help\n\nUPDATE: after a lot of tries phone turned on, I only had time to enter the password and open app menu. After this it turned off again and repeat turn on-off now.\n\nUPDATE 2: it turned on and I was able to close all apps, but it turned off anyway; after few attempts pixel turned on and even worked until I tried to open Play Market (the first app I've openned after start). So, now it's doing \"turn on-off\" again.",
