    "title": "My Pixel 2 XL becomes unresponsive after power off after update to Android 11",
    "content": "Whenever my phone turns off from reboots or the battery dying, etc. it becomes completely unresponsive for roughly 5 minutes to attempts to turn it back on or charge the device. I'm worried that eventually that 5 minutes will turn into permanently. It's extremely inconvenient when I don't realize the battery dies while I'm listening to a podcast or something similar and I have to wait for the phone to decide its time to work again. This never happened before I updated to Android 11 yesterday afternoon and has happened three times between then and now, twice from the battery dying, once from a manual restart that resulted in the phone not restarting but me manually having to turn it on after it started working again. A fix for this would be much appreciated.",
