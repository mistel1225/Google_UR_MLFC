    "content": "Rebooted my phone this morning and was surprised to be locked out and my pin code was not working.  I subsequently tried to erase my phone through the web and that failed.  I then tried to do a hard reset but even that is not working.  What is the correct procedure to hard reset a Pixel4a, none of the instructions I have found on the web are working?",
