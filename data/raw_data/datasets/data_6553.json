    "content": "Recently restarted my Pixel 3a after YouTube wasn't working well. Now that it has started up, the lock screen will show, but once I swipe up, it just shows a \"Pixel is starting\" loading screen. \nI've tried restarting it again, but it just gets to the same loading screen. I saw a different post say that I could factory reset it, but I'd like that to be the last option and I also wouldn't know how to since I can't access settings.",
