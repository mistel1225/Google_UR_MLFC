    "content": "My pixel screen is partially black-help! Worked one minute, then suddenly didn't. Touch screen, apps, Google assistant, phone seem to work but can't see anything. I didn't drop or get the device wet. Screen glass is intact and not cracks or lifting. Tried hard power down, charging, no touching and nothing is working. Seems like a component/hardware problem. Is this fixable? Can anyone give insight here? I appreciate any help!",
