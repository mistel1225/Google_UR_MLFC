    "content": "My Pixels battery has been draining pretty rapidly. I put it into safe mode and it didn't really help. I also restricted apps that would drain the battery like Snapchat and Instagram which didn't really make a difference either so I don't think an app is causing the problem. My brightness isn't high at all and I enable battery mode sometimes but even then it only helps a tiny bit. I've restarted my phone many times but it doesn't do anything. Is there any other solution for the issue or will I have to replace the battery? \nThanks in advance",
