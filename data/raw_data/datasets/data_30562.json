    "content": "I receive the following message from Google Home when trying to connect the JBL Link 10 to a Pixel 3a XL.\n  “we couldn't authenticate your jbl link 10”\n  Google Home finds the JBL Link 10 but cannot then connect to it.\n  I’ve tried many iterations including resetting the Link 10 multiple times.\n\nMy Pixel 3a XL effectively connects to Bluetooth devices like my Car so at least that works.\n  I've also reported this issue to JBL/Harmon.\n\nIdeas anyone?",
