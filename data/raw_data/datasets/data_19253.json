    "content": "After the most recent security update to the Pixel 4 a few days ago, I have connectivity issues with Android Auto in my 2016 Honda Civic.\n\n\nFrom the main screen, it says the phone isn't connected and I can't use the music controls on my steering wheel.  \n\nHowever, if I use google assistant it'll switch back to Android Auto Maps/current music player on the car screen.\n\nAnyone have a solution? It's not the cable, literally started happening after the security update.",
