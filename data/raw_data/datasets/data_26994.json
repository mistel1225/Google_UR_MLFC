    "title": "Pixel 4 XL: Do Not Disturb - Whitelisted Incoming Calls",
    "content": "When in Do Not Disturb mode, whitelisted incoming calls (\"Allow Calls From....\") will only have an audio notification and not pop up on the screen so you can swipe to answer.  I verified comparing to my Pixel 3 vs Pixel 4 that the notification and \"Do Not Disturb\" settings match.  It seems to be a glitch with how Do Not Disturb processes phone notifications on the Pixel 4.",
