    "content": "I cannot connect to any wifi network, it says Connecting.. for a few seconds and then changes to Saved. I have tried to connect to different wifi networks to verify if it is caused by the router, but I keep on having the same problem, so it must be a phone issue. I have followed all the troubleshooting that can be found online e.g. toggling WIFI on and off, toggling airplane mode, restarting the phone, resetting network settings, using safe mode, performing a factory reset and even flashing different software versions. Nothing works and I keep on not being able to connect. This problem has been going on for a few days.",
