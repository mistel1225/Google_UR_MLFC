    "title": "Is my repair covered under warranty?",
    "content": "I just noticed the frame of my pixel 4xl has split where the antenna line is, just underneath the camera on the right-hand side. Because of this, the entire top portion of the phone can flex when moderate pressure is applied. The pressure is comparable to being in the front pocket of a pair of skinny jeans. My concern is the device could become compromised by this lack of structural integrity. I requested a replacement, and it was granted. However, I want to avoid being charged for the device if they deem it is not under warranty, so I'm looking for a third opinion. A Google rep told me this was not an issue they have had previous documentation of. However, looking through online forms did lead me to other users with a similar experience. Besides that, after reading the somewhat vague warranty on the device, it does state normal wear and tear is not covered under warranty. I believe this defect is no fault of my own, and this issue should not be considered normal wear and tear. But what I feel or believe is not relevant, so I'm hoping someone can clear the air for me. The device has no indication of an impact on the exterior and has been in a case 98 percent of the time I have owned it. Below is an image of what I am experiencing. let me disclose this is not my device as the condition of mine is not as severe, and I can not capture a clear image of the damage. This image is being used to give a clearer picture of what I am talking about.",
