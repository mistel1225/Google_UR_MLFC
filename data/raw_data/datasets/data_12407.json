    "title": "Pixel 3a xl after android 11 update, random all audio stops working , works after reboot.",
    "content": "After android 11 Update , devices all audio just doesn't work. It has occured like 5 times now, every time when phone was not in use. Then you pick up to use the phone and no sound whatsoever , no youtube audio , ring sound , typing sound , phone unlock sound, even the other end caller sound vanishes .... Just no output.\n\nWhile the sound settings shows audio level full and phone is set to loud. Varying it up and down has no effect .\n\nIt is solved only after a restart.\n\nIt hasn't happened while i am using the phone yet. But either ita in my pocket or kept on the table it happens .\n\nPlease look into it as its very annoying",
