    "content": "I've been looking for devices that came with the android 64-bit OS before buying any but didn't see anything about that on the specs I found.\n\nI saw in another post here that every Pixel phone runs on the 64 bit OS. Is that true for this phone as well? (Since I'm looking for a cheaper option than the newer Pixel phones at the moment)",
