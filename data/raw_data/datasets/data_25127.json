    "content": "My brand new pixel 4xl has a problem displaying dark videos and pictures, the dark areas of images look melted together and lose all the details, resulting in black spots with a weird purple tint around. This happens expecially with low brightness.\nI don't know if it's an hardware issue but I hope it can be fixed by software update. At the moment I am considering returning it.\nDid someone else experienced it?",
