    "content": "All steps taken to fix problem on my end (Complete wipe, software update, etc.) Originally contacted Google support 8ish weeks ago. Was told to take the phone to UBreakIFix for diagnosis and repairs. Was not expecting a lot of resistance given how widespread the issue was and the lawsuit that followed.\n\nSpent several weeks going to multiple repair locations. Each told me the motherboard needed to fix the problem was no longer available, that Google destroyed the tooling needed to make more parts, and that repairs for all Pixel 1 and 2 devices were no longer available aside from screens. \n\nSpoke again to overseas-based support. Was then essentially told \"Too bad, so sad, you're out of warranty.\" They of course are unaware of the manufacturing defect and class action. I bought the phone through an authorized reseller, and now have a bunch of money in a device that I can't use as a phone unless on Bluetooth or speaker. Assistant works about a third of the time. This is my 6th Nexus or Pixel device, and I pay for Google One storage for what that's worth. \n\nI basically got 15 months of use from this phone because of a defect I didn't cause. I don't care about settlement money, I just want the phone I bought to work. This is round 2 for me after my Nexus 5x developed the charging port issue and required replacement. Frustrated, any advice much appreciated...",
