    "content": "My Pixel 4a phone started having static background noise in video recording, even in different silent rooms. I tried various ways I found online including taking the phone case off, checking system is up to date, turning off voice match, assistant, reboot to safe mode, factory reset. It seems like it's a software problem as old versions of the phone seemed to have the same problem. I haven't dropped the phone and only had the phone since Nov 2020. Any advice? Thanks",
