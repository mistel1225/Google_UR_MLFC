    "content": "Ringtone and the notification sounds suddenly became distorted and \"crackly\", then a few hours later stopped working completely. I have double-checked that volumes are up, Do Not Disturb is off. Other audio, such as the phone call speaker, media, voice in Google Maps, all work ok. Tried rebooting into Safe Mode.. no difference. Also, trying to choose another ringtone or notification sound in Settings gets nothing by silence. Any advice much appreciated. (Phone purchased from Google in November of 19... still under warranty.)",
