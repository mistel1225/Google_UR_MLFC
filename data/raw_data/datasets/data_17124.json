    "title": "Google Pixel 2 XL Camera not working",
    "content": " The camera constantly crashes on me and does 't work. I took a picture, tried to take another picture 3 hours later and that's when it stopped working entirely. \n\nIve done a factory reset, I've tried it in safe mode, I've gone into the camera app itself and uninstalled updates. I've tried just using the front facing camera. Nothing works.\n\nBeyond annoyed at this, especially after reading everything here with people complaining with no solution.",
