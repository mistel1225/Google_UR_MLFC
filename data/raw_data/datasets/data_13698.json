    "content": "Back a few months ago my nfc stopped working, didn't think anything of it until a couple months later I noticed that my phone was no longer even with the top of the case I had it in.  I removed it and noticed just a slight separation of the phone backing.\n  At that time, I thought maybe I had left it in my back pocket and maybe bent something.  Over the last couple months, the phone has gotten worse and I removed it from the case again to find that the backing has become much more separated and now it appears that the battery is swollen.  \n  After looking online I have discovered that this is a common problem with the 3xl's currently.  I haven't even had the phone a whole 2 years and am still paying it off.  Love my pixel.  What can I do to get this fixed?  I've attached photos to see if this is the same problem plaguing others.",
