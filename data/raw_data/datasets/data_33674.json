    "content": "Often try plugging in the charger that came with my phone and the phone will not recognize it. I have to continue to try to wiggle the plug or position it just right. Many times it will start to charge then stop immediately. \n\nI tried to call about how to get the problem fixed and was told I can submit a claim but then I have to pay the deductible for a new phone. I don't think I should have to pay for a new phone when this is not because of any damage that was done to the phone. The phone is less than a year old and it is very difficult to get it to recognize a charger (have tried multiple ones).",
