    "title": "Phone stays active during calls - proximity sensor doesn't work properly",
    "content": "When I make calls on my Pixel 3 the phone does not reliably lock as it should.  The proximity sensor works a little bit, but often allows the screen to be active while I'm talking on the phone.  My ear and cheek hit the screen and cause havoc.  It will open all sorts of stuff up, and the most frequent problem is that it hits the mute button causing me to cut out to the other caller.\n\nI have seen other posts about the screen staying locked, but this is the opposite problem.\n\nHere is what I have tried.\n- I thought it was a hardware issue but this is my THIRD replacement phone and all three have had the issue.  I have NEVER had this issue with any other cell phone and previously had a Pixel 2 with no issue.  I don't have a weird shaped face, but I'll admit to having larger than average ears.\n\n- I have tried resetting the proximity sensor, adjusting the sensitivity, and even installed 3rd party apps that adjust the proximity sensor.  This didn't work.\n\n- I booted in safe mode and the issue still happened.\n\n- I have tried moving to the beta phone app to see if the new version in beta fixes it.  It did not.\n\n- I have installed every patch as soon as it's out and am currently on the latest January release.\n\n- On my third replacement phone I didn't transfer anything over in case an app was causing the problem.  The issue still happened using the phone straight out of the box with nothing added to it.\n\nI am at a loss.  I'd like to keep the phone but at this point I'm thinking it won't be fixed and I need to return it.  Any ideas out there?",
