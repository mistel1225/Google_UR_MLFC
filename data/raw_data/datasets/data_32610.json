    "content": "So, since morning my Google pixel 2 is not starting. As it seemed that the battery is discharged, I charged the phone for straight 2 hours. And then tried to restart. But it didn't. Then I checked the charger and changed the socket if anything's wrong with them but everything is fine. I even cleaned the charging pin to ensure there's no dust or anything. Even tried the trick of holding power button and volume down button for 20 seconds. But clearly nothing is working. So, now please help me out.",
