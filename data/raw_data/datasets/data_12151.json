    "content": "Hello, whenever I play a voice note in WhatsApp the screen immediately goes black and doesn't come back unless i click the lock screen button, that caused me to worry so i have downloaded 3rd party sensor tester from the play store and its supposed to activate the sensor, when i hover over it while its active nothing is detected from the app. In addition, inside clash royale game the sensor is always on but nothing happens when i hover over it. I don't have the sensor on at all times like others facing this issue. \n\nps. in regular phone calls its working properly.\n\nIs this a hardware or a software issue? And how can i fix it?",
