    "content": "The speaker quit working on Messenger. It is like it is muted but it isn't!  Turning on speaker does nothing. The speaker works fine on Zoom if I \"enable original sound\".  When I use Messenger, I have to use headphones in order to hear. I have restarted, reinstalled Messenger, and looked at app settings but can't figure out how to get that speaker to work on Messenger. Strangely, it also doesn't work with Houseparty app.",
