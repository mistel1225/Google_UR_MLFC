    "title": "Pixel 3 notification volume control missing?",
    "content": "My Pixel 3's volume settings don't include a slider for \"Notifications.\" All I have is:\nMedia volume\nCall volume\nRing volume\nAlarm volume\n\nIn doing some research online, I know for a fact that \"Notification volume\" exists in Android on other devices, and I feel like (anecdotally) this is a recent development on my Pixel 3. All my notifications use the same level as the \"Media volume\" control, which is incredibly obnoxious if I'm listening to music or a podcast in headphones or in my car. Is there really no way to control Notification volume independently from Media? Even if I set my ringer to silent or vibrate, my notifications don't respect that setting. The only way I can silence my notifications is by also silencing all my media.\n\nHas anyone else experienced this?",
