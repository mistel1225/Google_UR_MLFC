    "content": "I recently used the \"free up space\"function on my pixel. Now I'm not sure how to find my photos. The download folder was backed up and synced do the photos should be available online somewhere. But the ways to access the download folder on the phone are all showing photos that are actually in the device. So how do I see the online collection of photos that were in that folder?",
