    "content": "Hey gang,\n\nI just got a Pixel 2XL and for Gmail and WhatsApp even though I've got vibration off in the system settings as well as in the app, the damn thing still vibrates when a notification comes in.\nThis happens on both mine and my brothers 2XL, are we missing a trick?\nI've tried to reset app settings but issue persists.\n\n2XL\nandroid 10 - build QQ1A.191205.008 - fresh install\n\nThanks!",
