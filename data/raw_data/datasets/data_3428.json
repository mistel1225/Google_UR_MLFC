    "title": "Mail in repair option (out of pocket) for Pixel 4a 5G cracked screen",
    "content": "I dropped and cracked the screen on my Pixel 4a 5g purchased from Fi and shipped by Google store. I went to store.google.com/repair to initiate the repair process. I understand this is not covered by warranty and am prepared to pay for the repair. I went through the process on the website and in the last step it gives me two options - call or chat with agent to proceed.\n\nSo I select to call, and was connected with an agent who told me I can walk in to local 3rd party repair store and work with them or mail the phone in. I choose mail in because the repair store was inaccessible in my location because I don't have transportation and COVID. The agent told me for mail in he will send me a link in email and I can create the repair order, view estimate and shipping info. Great, so I wait for the email.\n\nThe email arrives and it contains a link, store.google.com/us/repaircenter. I follow the link and it takes me to the exact same website from which I started the whole process. I click through the steps again like the first time (see attachments), and it landed exactly the same page from before, that is to call or chat with agent to proceed.\n\nSo how do I get out of this infinite loop? Your advice is greatly appreciated!",
