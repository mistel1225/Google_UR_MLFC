    "title": "Problem while trying to connect an extranal mic to the phone",
    "content": "When plugging in the mic a notification comes up that tells me \"Analog audio accessory detected. The attached Device is not compatible with this phone.\" But I have seen other people with pixel 3s using th same mic that I hvae. I have tried the open camera and still the same issue. The mic works on my old samsung galaxy 7 so the mic is fine. Found an unresolved reddit thread that didn't help much. I also saw that it was announced that pixel 3 was now going to support mics a couple of months ago. Kind of running out of options here. What should I do?",
