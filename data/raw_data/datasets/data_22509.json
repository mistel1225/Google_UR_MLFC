    "content": "Since updating to Android 10 the battery life is horrible. Via OTA and also making a total reset the amount of screen hours from 100 to 0% is approximately 2 hours. I have downloaded version to Android 9 and the duration of the screen is 6 hours from 100 to 0 ... I mean it's a problem with Android 10. I see in the community that happens to a lot of people. Help with Android 10 please.",
