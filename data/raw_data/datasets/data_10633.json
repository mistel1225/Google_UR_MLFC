    "content": "I've seen on websites that the adaptive charging feature (where it charges your phone slowly overnight) was coming to pixel 4 and newer phones with the Dec 2020 security update. I have a pixel 4 and have updated to the patch this morning but I don't see the new adaptive charging feature anywhere in battery saver settings or any other settings. I do have the extreme battery saver setting and the new icons and grid setup options for the wall paper.\n\nBelow is a link to a website where I saw that this feature would be coming to pixel 4, is this site wrong?\n\n https://9to5google.com/2020/12/07/december-pixel-feature-drop/#:~:text=Other%20new%20features%20include%3A,now%20works%20in%20group%20calls",
