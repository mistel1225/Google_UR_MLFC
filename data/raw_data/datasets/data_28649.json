    "content": "Hey guys,\n\nI got a new pixel 3xl and it's performing very poorly with WiFi.\n\nI have a Samsung Galaxy S7 and an iPhone 6 right next to it, on the same wifi network: the galaxy & iphone get moderate network strength and no connectivity issues.\n\nPixel 3 is showing poor signal strength, keeps dropping the connection on and off. It's quite annoying to work with.\n\nWhat gives? Why is pixel struggling when 3+ year old phones are having no problems?\n\nI can't do anything with the router, by the way. I'm in a university residence and we get one master connection. The point is that the pixel underperforms compared to other phones, not that the connection is bad in and of itself.",
