    "content": "Today, suddenly, my Pixel 3 (128Gb) decided to shut down on its own. I restarted, and it shut off again after a few seconds. This has been going on all day. I could barely keep it on in order to do a soft reset. So I decided to do a hard reset, and a full factory wipe out (couldn't keep it on long enough to backup data, so that's that).\nWith this, still the phone shuts off after a few seconds. I now restart the phone, it opens in the Welcome screen and manages to get to the \"please select a wifi\" screen before it shuts down again. Basically, I now have (3 days from a week-long overseas trip, as it could not happen otherwise) a very expensive, useless, paperweight.\nCan anyone tell me what to do?",
