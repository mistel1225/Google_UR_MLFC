    "content": "Hi all, \n\nI'm struggling with an issue with my pixel 3a. Seems to be a common issue yet no one seems to have an answer most posts go unanswered like this one https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/13585244?hl=en\n\nLast night my phone worked fine. All sounds play. No issues. \n\nThis morning I've noticed no sound from Spotify, YouTube, Instagram or any app for that matter. \n\nWhat is interesting is my phone ringtone plays, and my alarms work. Interestingly my alarm pulls from Spotify. This works fine. \n\nI had my partner call me, I couldn't hear her, but she could hear me fine. \n\nSo what we know is:\n1. No sound from any app (will play using external speakers/headphones)\n2. No message alerts\n3. No system sounds\n4. Sounds from alarms(pulling from Spotify) and ringer \n\nI've tried clearing cache and data from the apps, installing most recent updates, tried restarting phone. And general fiddling with settings. \n\nI have also tried factory reset which did not fix the issue either. \n\nAnyone got any ideas for how I can fix this frustrating issue. \n\nThanks in advance\n\nEdit history:\nEdit 1: I have factory reset the device and the problem persists. \n\nEdit 2: No apps(Spotify, YouTube etc) work with Bluetooth headphones, only wired. Can play music through WiFi speakers no problem.",
