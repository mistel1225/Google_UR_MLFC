    "content": "I noticed this issue yesterday when I was on a WhatsApp video call and the sound just cut off halfway. I thought it was a network issue. This morning, I also noticed no sound coming from my alarm. Finally, the speakers aren't working when I put someone on speaker using the Phone app. \n\nYet I can play the media sound on Spotify/YouTube with no problem? I triple checked and all my volume are maxed out.\n\nI've already hard reset my device and cleared cache. Any other ideas?",
