    "content": "Earlier tonight, I noticed a quick flash on my screen that appears to be an app wait/close screen insert that shows up when an app is having an internal issue. Trouble is, it's only pulsing on the screen for a nanosecond, and now I'm unable to open many if my major apps (FB, Gmail, ESPN, notepad, Ameritrade, etc). \nI've restarted my phone, gone through steps to uninstall and reinstall apps, etc, but nothing is working. The pulse still is continuing as I type this, about every minute or so.\nAnyone experiencing this? If so, what's the best way to troubleshoot?\nThanks!",
