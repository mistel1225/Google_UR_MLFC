    "content": "It's been 6 months since the last person asked. Whenever a screenshot is taken, the infuriating pop up appears in the bottom left. If this wasn't bad enough, whichever moron designed it for some reason failed to comprehend the possibilty that someome might want to take two screenshots in succession. What did they do fail to comprehend this? They only made it so the pop up appears in the next screenshot!\nI've waited 6 months for this and have emailed in a few times so far with no luck, is there now a way to disable this stupid feature?",
