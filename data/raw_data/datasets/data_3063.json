    "content": "Hello,\n\nI am trying to get to the bottom of an issue that I am seeing on my account. I am seeing on the store.google.com/repair page that my device has a protection plan until 12/9/21. I reached out to support to get a repair done, and they claim that I don't have device protection. Its pretty clear on the IMEI check that I do. Is this some kind of glitch on the google store? I assumed that I acquired the plan a some point during the purchase of the phone and using the check confirms this. \n\nAny pointers in the right direction will be appreciated. \n\nThanks",
