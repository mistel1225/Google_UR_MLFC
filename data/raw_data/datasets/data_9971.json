    "content": "I have a brand new pixel 5 and the signal is shocking. I have gone from a OnePlus 5 with 4 bars most of the time (we have an ee mast in the village) to now barley getting 1 bar. I have to go up to the top of my house to get 2 bars. Anyone else having this problem or found a way to fix it. It's pretty pathetic really considering how expensive this phone was.\nIf someone from Google could get back to me with help that would be great",
