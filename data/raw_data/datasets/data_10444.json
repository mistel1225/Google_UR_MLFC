    "content": "I have a pixel 4a and while I'm using it, the screen flickers at a fairly high rate. It flickers between a few different levels of brightness, sometimes going completely black in the middle of me doing stuff. It makes the phone basically unusable.\n\nI've looked into the existing ways people addressed a similar-sounding issue with the pixel 4 and they have not worked. There is no smooth display option on the pixel 4a. I've restarted my phone a few times and it seems to fix it for a little while but it comes back. \n\nPlease help or I'm going to have to return this thing.",
