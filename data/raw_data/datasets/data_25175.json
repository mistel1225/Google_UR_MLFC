    "content": "I'm afraid this is not the right place to post this but I've been looking for hours without success. I ordered a Pixel 4 during the black Friday sale and paid for expedited shipping. It was going to get to my house very quickly but for some reason FedEx decided to say that I had moved and sent the phone back. Customer service told me that I would automatically get a full refund when the device got back to them. It's been several days and I haven't gotten my refund. I've been trying to contact support over the phone and just hung up on a 2 hour hold. Sadly I don't have access to my email right now because Microsoft blocked it and will get access back on the 16th. Please help?",
