I being a google user is a stakeholder of yours, how can you leave me dying with my device, data, and money? especially in quarantine days?, .i want you to fix my phone because it is a bug who killed my phone and phones of many others like me. contact me otherwise, i will seek help from different four. if your updates or architectural flaws are harming my device then you are the who fix it by any cost.\ni",
