    "content": "When I enabled adaptive charging on my Pixel 4A last night, and set an accompanying alarm for 11:00 a.m. on the Google clock app, my phone was at 100% when I woke up at 8:00 a.m.\n\nThis is a huge letdown because I thought I would finally be able to plug my phone in overnight without worrying about burning my battery longevity away. Oh well, I submitted feedback and hopefully they'll fix it. If anyone else has this issue please say something.",
