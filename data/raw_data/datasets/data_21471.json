    "title": "Hi, has anyone had success fixing Pixel 3XL faulty touch screen, (almost unusable).",
    "content": "My Pixel 3XL was operating fine until 4 weeks ago. Woke up one morning and tried to use phone, Touch Screen was very unresponsive, had to press screen with some pressure most of time to get response, (and result was would not always that key pressed). Have tried all fixes I could locate on WEB: Safe Mode, rermove any recent installed APPS., full Factory Reset, tried contacting Google Support, (non contactable).  None of these have made any difference to problem.  Hoppe someone has a fix out there.  Keep safe from Covid-19 all of you.  Many thanks, cheers, Alan.",
