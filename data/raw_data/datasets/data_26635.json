    "content": "Mobile (pixel 2) goes for reboot randomly & this issue I faced when ever battery level is below 20%.\nI have observed this happens when I open camera or google map running (with battery level  <20%).\nI am using pixel 2 since from almost 2 years I never faced battery issue, I use to charge only once in a day, but from last month I started charging 2/3 times in a day.\n\nMainly facing 2 issues\n1. Random reboot\n2. Battery drains fast.\n\nIs this get fixed in next update?",
