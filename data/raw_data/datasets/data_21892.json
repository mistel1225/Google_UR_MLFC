I tried to listen some music with some wired headphones  so i connected them in the adaptor and pluged them in the phone.  When i pluged them i recieved a notification : the audio device isnt compatible with the phone. And after that i tried with 6 pairs of heaphones and none of them worked so i really think the problem is in software . Please help me",
