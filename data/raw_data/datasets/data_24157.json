    "content": "Since installing the last update, my phone's speaker when in a call no longer works. Also, no sound plays with my alarm... But I'm still able to hear audio from music apps and video. Is this some sort of bug? I've tried clearing the cache of my alarm and phone app, and it didn't help.",
