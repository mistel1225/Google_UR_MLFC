    "content": "Sometime back in March 2020 my Pixel 2XL stopped generating thumbnails. When connected to my PC all I see is a blue pxl logo. All photos taken before March 2020 still have thumbnails. I have seen a vast number of queries on this issue yet no fix has been provided. is this something we are expected to put up with going forward or should we all ditch Google phones and go with a more reliable make?",
