    "content": "So I have a Google Pixel 4.\nAnd ever since the update of the phone/the photos app in late September my google photos app has been acting weird.\nI care a lot about my photo organization, so I like the fact that everything has device folders in addition to being displayed in the camera photo hub.\nThe problem occurs when I try to move a photo from one folder to another. I move photos from my camera folder to my Pinterest folder, for example, the photo moves fine.\nBut when I try and view the moved photo anywhere outside of the google photos app, it's completely gone, while simultaneously still existing in the new folder in the photos app.\nI just wanted to know if there was any way to fix this so I can organize my photos without fear of \"losing\" them? Or if this happened to anyone else?",
