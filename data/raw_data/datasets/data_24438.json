    "content": "I live in Brazil, this is the second pixel that I bought, because of that I have an american google account too. \nBut at this unfortune shop my pixel didnt come. We are trying a lot to contact you since november, and the worse part of it (besides waiting for the refund) is that the google support NEVER said to my when, and what do I have to do to get my money back. When I try to contact google suport they always sad protocol things as \"we are tying to help you\" \"It may thake some few days\" Nobody never sad to me when nor what do I have to do to got my money back. Im very disapointed with this experience. Please, all I want , all I ask is my money back and end this trouble. I don't want this phone, I don't want to shop with you again, I just want my rights . \nSupport Inquiry: Case ID [8-0259000028299]",
