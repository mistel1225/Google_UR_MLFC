    "content": "Is anyone else experiencing decreased signal strength since March 1st update? My pixel 2, immediately after the update, started showing no connection. When this started, the display would show the LTE icon, full bars with an x underneath. After restarting the device it shows me on H+ or 3G connection. This is mostly happening at work, not sure if it happens at home as i switch to wifi as soon as I'm home. Before the update I had no network issues at work. Nothing has changed at work, in the same office. Signal strength is decent around town. \n\nI've been working with T-mobile for the past 2 weeks doing resets. T-mobile put in a ticket with their engineering team to check on issues in my area. I've replaced the SIM card. T-mo found no issues on their part and are still trying to work with me to find a resolution. \n\nI realize T-mo doesn't have the greatest signal inside buildings, but as I mentioned earlier i was having no issues until the latest update.\n\nOne weird thing that's happening, my phone will show LTE signal with full bars when i arrive to work but nothing loads, not even slowly. i have to restart my phone for it to switch to H+ or 3G. \n\nHas anyone else encountered this? Anyone have any ideas they could share?",
