To hear your notifications, turn on notification access on your phone.  Just touch and hold the home button , then tap headphone settings\"\nI am using Google USB C ear buds and the behavior doesn't happen when then aren't connected.  Short single clicks on volume up button do work.  Can't find button settings for this, please help.",
