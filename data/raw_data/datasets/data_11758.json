    "title": "Pixel 3 XL Constant WiFi dropouts after Android 11 update",
    "content": "Just updated to Android 11 yesterday, and now WiFi continually drops out even though I have strong signal. This problem did not occur before the update. I rebooted the router and I restarted the phone. I also booted into safe mode and still had wifi drops. I then deleted my saved access point and re-joined the network, but the wifi drops continue.  Anyone else having this problem? My wifes Pixel 3 is awaiting the update, but I told her not to update until we can get this wifi issue figured out.\n\nTIA",
