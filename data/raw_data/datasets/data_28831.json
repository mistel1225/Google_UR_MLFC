    "content": "My google pixel 32 GB is freezing even after performing a factory reset. Then i tried a hard reset too but still the same problem is occuring. Phone freezes, screen stops responding and i have to reboot by pressing power button for 30 seconds. I tried changing network and even when there were no apps installed it still does the same. It freezes and takes long time to restart.\nPlease help.\nRegards",
