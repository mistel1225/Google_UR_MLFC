    "content": "Transferring data from my old galaxy s7 to new pixel 3 during setup.  At the end of setup, it said it failed to transfer my text messages over. I really would like my old text messages on my new phone. What do I do now??\nAll my apps and everything are already setup, so I don't really want to wipe and restart. \n\nHow can I transfer my texts? \nAlso, if there is a way to transfer over the MMSs too that would be awesome. \nThanks!",
