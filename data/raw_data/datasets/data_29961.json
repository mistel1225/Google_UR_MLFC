    "content": "I lost my pixel 3xl and tried tracking it on the find device app. It is showing that it was active a few days ago at a location however when i view my timeline on maps it shows that i moved to another location an hour later. Does this mean that the phone's last location was that of the last location on the timeline or is it the last seen location on the find device app.",
