    "content": "I received a notification a couple weeks ago that the Android 11 update was available for my phone. I hit the update button, and let it go. I didn't think about it until 2 days ago, when I again received a notification that the update was available. I again told it to update, bit it's been on the screen saying \"installing System Update...\" ever since. I've tried rebooting the phone, but it's still at the same stage. I am on Wifi, and everything else I do on the internet works. I am on Spectrum for my ISP on the 400MBit tier, so download speeds shouldn't be an issue. The blue \"loading\" bar is active. but there is no progress indicator. The Android 10 update last year was fine, as were security patches up through August 5th.",
