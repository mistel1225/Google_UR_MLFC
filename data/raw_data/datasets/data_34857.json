    "content": "Noticed today (was working less than a week ago)  that mic during phone calls no longer works unless it is in speaker mode, and if in speaker mode the actual speaker volume is non-existant. Oddly, if I play music or a video the speakers work perfectly.\n\nTried restarting, as well as changing Bluetooth from 1.4 to 1.6 as recommended by the reddit thread.",
