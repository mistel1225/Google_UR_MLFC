    "content": "I have a recurring notification sound that comes from my phone, sometimes multiple times in succession. It is a descending three note sound. It still continues even when I set the Default Notification sound to \"None\". The only thing active is an accountability software called Covenant Eyes (VPN), but there are no notification settings for that app. Anyone else have this issue?",
