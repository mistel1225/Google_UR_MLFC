    "content": "After installing a system update yesterday morning, my Pixel 4 stopped connecting to my WiFi.  I did all the troubleshooting and identified the problem was my phone. (Other devices are connected with no problem, and I took the phone to other locations where Wi-Fi is available and the same problem occurred.)\nMultiple contacts with Google support led to a reset of my Wi-Fi and mobile connections, which unfortunately cut me off entirely from Google Fi and thus rendered my phone unworkable for calls/texts/mobile data via the network.  More contacts with Google support have led to repeated suggestions to do the same things which have not resolved the issue.\nOne suggestion was to to a factory reset, which I'm willing to do, but I'm concerned at the step that says to make sure you're connected to the internet.  Obviously I am not, since that prompted my service contact in the first place. \nThus, my basic question: Can I do a factory reset if my phone is not not currently able to connect to an otherwise available Wi-Fi signal.?\nI cannot believe how many repeated contacts I've had with Google support that have led me nowhere.  I've used both chat and email--no consistency and no resolution.",
