    "content": "I'm dealing with a similar situation to this post. Bought the P3 three weeks ago, started crashing, got the RMA, received my replacement phone 3 days ago and this phone is now crashing every few hours. I've gone back and forth with Google Support via email and still waiting on a response. \n\nAt this point, I don't even want to go through another RMA I just want a refund but they are saying that you can only get a refund 15 days from the original purchase, even though this is a completely different phone. I don't know what else to do, I tried chatting with Google Support again but they're telling me they can't do anything else because it has been escalated. So I'm just a sitting duck with a dysfunctional phone. \n\nI've done all of the recommendations but it still crashes: FDR from bootloader, disabled developer options, updated to newest OTA, prayed to the Google gods, rub my head and tap my belly, etc.",
