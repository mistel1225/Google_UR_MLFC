    "content": "After running out of power during a fb live video- upon startup while charging it is now stuck indefinitely in the G loading animation.\n\nTroubleshooting I've done:\n-Restarting numerous times gives same endless boot (holding down power)\n-have let the loading go overnight to no avail\n-have fully charged/discharged battery \n-able to reach bootloader, and used it to power off, and also access recovery mode (restarted that way too) \n\nAs a photographer, I would like to avoid losing all my images/reformatting if possible",
