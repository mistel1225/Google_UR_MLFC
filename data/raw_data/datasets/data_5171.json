    "content": "Yeah this is another post about battery drain. I got a pixel 3 and since the march update my battery goes to around 41% then it starts to drop to 30%, I receive the battery notification while there's like the fastest countdown on the battery percentage until it dies. I've already checked out the apps and all the battery configurations like the support page recommend and everything works fine, I charged it from 0 to 100% with the phone off a few times, and I even did TWO factory reset starting from fresh, and nothing worked.\nSo please I need some help.",
