    "content": "I bought a Pixel 4 a month and a half ago. It kept crashing initially and I gave it some time. Turns out, they speakers stopped working since yesterday. The alarm only vibrates and the phone doesn't ring for any alerts. Can't use the speaker for making/Answering calls as well. Looking for a replacement.",
