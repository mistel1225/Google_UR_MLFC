    "content": "I have had this device for about 4 months, the first month or so it was great and no issue. Then I started to notice the range on which I could have something connected to my phone getting smaller and smaller. At this point it's less than 1 foot.\n\nI have factory reset my phone to no avail, forgot Bluetooth devices and reconnected, reset my devices I connected to. At this point I'm not sure what to. I haven't seen anyone else online with the same issue so Im not sure what else to try.\n\nAny advice would be helpful.",
