    "content": "Hello everyone,\n     I like pixel 3 very much, but about one month ago, there is something wrong with it, I was told my password is wrong, just like https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/4140400?hl=en.  i am sure it is correct,i can't unlock my phone,so i reboot it,then it can't start again,but i can enter fastboot mode,and it displayed \"device state error\".first time i followed Muhammed Zaid Alam said , and it indeed worked.\n    But about one week ago,i was told my pin is incorrect again,this time i try to change my password with  the \"find my phone\"on Google,but it still wrong pin, and i tried to the erase the phone on web,it didn't work too,and it won't start again after reboot.Unfortunately this time the way didn't worked again. \n    I wanted to use a factory image to solve this. i download the image from https://developers.google.com/android/images. when i flashed the system image , it said  \"FAILED (remote: 'Error getting device locked state No Response')\nfastboot: error: Command failed\"\n    And \"Device version-bootloader is 'b1c1-0.1-5343672'.\nUpdate requires 'b1c1-0.1-5578427'.\nfastboot: error: requirements not met!\"\n\nWhat should i do ?   Thank you very much.",
