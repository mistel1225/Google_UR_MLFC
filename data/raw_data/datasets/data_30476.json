    "content": "My Pixel 2 has recently (2-3 weeks ago) started playing the notification sounds at the beginning of a phone call when both answering and calling out. This happens even if there are no notifications. Also, within the past week the notification sound has been extremely loud as well as going off in Do Not Disturb and vibrate modes. I've checked the notification settings and they are normal.",
