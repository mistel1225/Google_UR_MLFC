    "content": "As the title says really. I take a screenshot and the screen flashes white, hurting my eyes especially in low light. I would like to disable the flash as feel it's unnecessary or the function. Coming from an iPhone which didn't flash on screenshot and given it pops up to alert you a screenshot was taken, and the fact I have to hold power and tap screenshot button for it to happen, it's not like I really need another visual alert that I've taken a screenshot! \n\nIs there an option to disable the flash on screen?\n\nThanks :)",
