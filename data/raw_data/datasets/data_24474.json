    "content": "Its almost 2020 and still my pixel 2 xl doesn't support Volte with airtel..Hey google are you making fun of Indian Customers or i guess you don't value the Indian Customers...Though wherever might the issue be i.e Airtel or from your side but you sort it out..Its pathetic seeing people using MI phones and still using VOLTE and we on the other hand begging you for VOLTE even after paying you so much...!!!!! Its time i guess pixels users in india swtich to iphone xr or xs watever it might rather than just being away from Simple carrier features even after paying you so much ..!!!!!\n\n##Hey GOOGLE your name is not even mentioned on the Airtel website its really a shame for the Customers buying pixel phones....\n##Many thanks for not launching the Pixel 4 in INDIA........people would have wasted money by buying pixel 4 and still not being able to VOLTE.......",
