    "content": "When my Pixel 3XL is on the Pixel Stand and I press the Google Assistant button on my headphones to request a timer to be set the assistant says it is setting the timer but it does not.  If I take the phone off of the dock everything works as expected.  I have two different headphones that have a Google Assistant button and both of them show the same behaviour.",
