    "content": "Recently my phone started dropping wifi connections.  At first I could reconnect for a bit but, eventually, it stopped being able to reconnect - the wifi would say \"connecting\" and then revert to \"saved\".  I eventually tried a factory reset and now it can't connect to wifi even to reinstall/setup android. Anyone have ideas or seen this issue before?",
