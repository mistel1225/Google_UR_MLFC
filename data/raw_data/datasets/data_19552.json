    "title": "Google is not sending a Pixel 3a for warranty replacement. I want a refund.",
    "content": "The speakerphone stopped working for the second time since I purchased my Pixel 3a(this is my replacement device). I contacted google support again. They took 10 days to get back to me, and the only option they provided was to ship my phone to them(now I do not have functioning phone). Its been almost 3 weeks since I shipped it and the support representative has no clue what the status of the return is. I've had over 50 emails back and forth with them.\n\nI do not want to deal with this anymore, I'd like a refund for my device. Its unacceptable that I get to have a usable phone for only 10 months of a year.",
