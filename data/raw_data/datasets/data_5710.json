    "content": "I am extremely disappointed with the front facing camera on this device. I switched from Samsung to Google after hearing great reviews about the pixel cameras. I totally regret purchasing a google and would never purchase one again.  Google you should seriously investigate and fix this and arrange for your customers either a replacement or a software update whichever is applicable in this case. People purchase google phones due to the high quality of the camera however this greatly disapoints. Please resolve Google otherwise customers would be going elsewhere.",
