    "content": "Lots of people have been experiencing a gap issue with the Pixel 5. This issue is NOT NORMAL. The Google community 'answer' stating this isn't even an official Google statement and is an utter LIE, why are people taking it so seriously?\n\nhttps://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/77741994?hl=en\n\nThe gap occurs very randomly and occurs mostly down to luck, affects mainly black Pixel 5's, varies in size and length, and is obviously not part of the design. The gap can be temporarily fixed by pushing the screen back into the frame, but it slips back out. This is obviously NOT NORMAL, a QC issue, and is something to do with the adhesive used on the screen, or the screen not being properly adhered to the frame in the factory. \n\nStop misleading Pixel 5 owners, provide an official statement, and fix the issue!",
