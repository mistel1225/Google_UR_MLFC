    "content": "I want to backup pictures from my phone. As the \"Google Photos\" Sync does not have the folder structure of my phones pictures and videos (why??), I want to backup them manually by USB cable, as I have a similar Folder structure on my PC for the Back ups.\nThe folders are there when I connect the phone via USB, BUT I do not see the thumbnail preview of the photos. I would need that preview to see and decide, which of the photos I want to backup.\nI researched and tried the tip to go to settings - app - clear cache, which helped for a second (The thumbnails appeared quickly in the browser on my PC, but only in the visible browser window - changed back to the standard jpg picture icons when scrolling the explorer window or going in a different folder)\n\nI never ever had that before with any device. Picture Back-upping is a basic thing, that should be easy and straightforward. Why does that have to be such a hassle with such an expensive phone?\nAm I missing something?",
