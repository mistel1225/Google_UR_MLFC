    "content": "My Pixel 4 XL's battery is swollen (and the case has pushed open). I have stopped using it because of the danger that a swollen battery presents. \n\nI've had the phone for less than 11 months. What can I do? Can I get a replacement?\n\nI purchased the phone from the Google Store in the USA, but am now in Japan. \n\nThank you.",
