    "content": "I have bought a Pixel 3XL phone due to delivery-in-person for 8 month. \nAfter updating the latest version of Pixel 3XL on1st Aug 2019, my screen can't show the black color. The black areas are seperated in pieces, which makes the whole photos have low quality. I haven't dropped it and use it gently. This has been happening for 2 weeks. I have sent emails to the GG support service but there is no response yet. What should I do now?\nI live in Vietnam and my friend is going to USA next week. Can I get a refund or fixes for my phone?",
