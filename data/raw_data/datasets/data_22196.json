    "content": "On my last phone (Pixel 3 XL) tapping the home button took me to whichever was the last screen showing on my home screen and another tap took me to my main home screen (i.e. the initial one which, in my case, has the clock on it).\nOn my new Pixel 4 XL, I have to swipe back from the app (or up from the bottom of the screen) to get to the last home screen page showing and then swipe right four more times if I'm on the last screen.  This is not user-friendly.\nAm I missing a trick or is this just a backwards step in usability?  I have no issue with gestures but 5 swipes instead of two taps is pretty annoying.",
