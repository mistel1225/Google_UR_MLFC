    "title": "Google Pixel 2 won't accept pin for Outlook app setup. Number pad covers entry line when entering",
    "content": "First, this is for work so I have to use the Outlook app and authenticator. When I go to enter a pin to use Outlook app I put cursor on entry line and it is immediately covered when number pad comes up. I can see that the cursor is there for the split second before it is covered. However, when I enter the PIN it just tells me PIN doesn't meet requirements. PIN length of 6 digits required. PIN  must contain numeric characters only. This happens with other apps but I am able to work around it by holding the phone horizontally and can verify that data is actually being entered. The Outlook app won't go horizontal. I know Outlook is installed and my email is set up because I get the message previews. I just can't use the app to view the entire email and respond etc. ",
