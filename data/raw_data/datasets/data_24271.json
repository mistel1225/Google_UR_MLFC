    "content": "I've had this phone since September and it is the most pathetic excuse for a smart phone I've ever had. I've had to \"Uninstall updates\" on so many apps and uncheck auto updates. This is pathetic.\n\nMessenger: If I let this app update, I lose many of the contact names. It will only show the phone numbers. Brilliant, Google!\n\nCamera: Suddenly, I can't take portrait photos! BRILLIANT, GOOGLE! That's the REASON I BOUGHT THE PHONE. However, if I uninstall updates, I can do so.\n\nPhone. PHONE. As in... this device's MAIN PURPOSE: Now freezes when I try to place a call and cannot pull up the UI, and when it finally does come up and I want to hang up the call, freezes the screen yet again until they system just crashes.\n\nMicrophone: Sounds like you're recording something thru a tin-can.\n\nWhy is this phone so pathetic and when is Google going to fix this crap? Has anyone found any fixes to these incredibly important usages?!?  This is the first smartphone I've ever hated. I wish I never wasted my money on it.",
