    "content": "I got a Pixel 3 about 2 months ago, and I just realized that some of my contacts are missing some of their phone numbers.  For example, my sister shows in my Google contact as only having a cell phone, nowhere can I find her home number.  She is not the only one, there are several that I have found so far.\nHow do I get those numbers back?",
