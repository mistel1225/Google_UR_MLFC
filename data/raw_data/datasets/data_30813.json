    "content": "Ever since the May security update, Play Services has been using excessive battery. I had this same issue with my original pixel when it got the Pie update. It seems connected to YouTube and/or YouTube music. If I use those apps during the day Play services tends to run excessively. Today it has used more battery than almost 3hrs of screen time!\nBefore this update I would regularly get close to 4hrs of screen time. ",
