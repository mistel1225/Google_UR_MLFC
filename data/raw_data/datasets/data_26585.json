    "content": "Okay it's a Google pixel 2 XL. I don't know why I couldn't select that from the drop down menu.\n\nWiggling the charger, doesn't just cause connectivity with the charger to drop, my entire phone shorts like I did a battery pull... This has also has happened with the provided charger in the box. \n\nIs this a repair issue that I should go to Verizon with or should I deal with Google directly OR just go to a 3rd party repair shop and just get it fixed for like 70 bucks?",
