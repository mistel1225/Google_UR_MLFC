    "title": "Pixel 2 XL with Bose QC2 5 headphones - crackling fixed? Apple USB-C dongle?",
    "content": "I've read a couple long threads on Pixel 2 (/XL) users experiencing crackling sound through headphones with Bose QuietComfort 25 headphones connected to the phone via Google's USB-C - 3.5mm dongle.  I see there are now 2 generations of that dongle, so firstly I wonder if this issue has been fixed with the latest dongle version.\n\nAnd secondly, I wonder if anyone's experienced crackling in this scenario when using the Apple USB-C - 3.5mm dongle instead of Google's OEM dongle.  I know the output volume is lower with the Apple dongle, but that's okay as long as there's no crackling noise for my Pixel 2 XL and Bose QC 25.\n\nThanks!",
