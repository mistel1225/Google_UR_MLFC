    "content": "I have tried resetting it. I have confirmed that my screen hasn't cracked. This problem started some days after I installed Google's April update. I don't know if it's related. The problem is obvious when I view videos with dark backgrounds. The same goes for images. When I use a bright theme the problem is non existent.but it will be vivid if I view pictures or watch videos. I'm guessing it could be a problem with the dark mode setting. When you view the globe you can see the shades of dark grey around it. Also viewing the top part of the screen where the notch is supposed to be you'll see a dark greyish bar.",
