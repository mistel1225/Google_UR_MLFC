    "content": "I just got my Pixel 4a 2 days ago.\nI changed everything I use to black theme. I noticed that in black theme, the black colors would bleed into other color whenever I scroll. This is very noticeable when I scroll white texts on a black background. Is this a common issue? Or does my phone have a problem? Is there any way to fix this?",
