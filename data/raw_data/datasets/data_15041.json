    "content": "On a specific date back in March 2020 my Pixel 4XL stopped generating Thumbnails that will show during file transfer on any windows PC. Every PC I connect my phone to shows the same photo as the last with a working thumbnail and nothing since. I have read many comments saying the same occurred for many others on or around the date mine did the same. Has anyone had any luck working this out or is Google doing anything to rectify this problem?",
