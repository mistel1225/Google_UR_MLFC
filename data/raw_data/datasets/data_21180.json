    "content": "I am trying to restore some old contacts that I previously had in my phone. I know about the option to undo the changes you made up to 30 days, but I need to restore some contacts that I had in my phone in December 2019. Does anyone know if there is a way to do this? I find it hardly to belive that the Google database only stores contacts for a period of 30 days.",
