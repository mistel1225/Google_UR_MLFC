    "content": "Hi guys,\n\nNoticed that my pixel’s battery has significantly deteriorated ever since updating to android 10. \nBackground battery drain even when the phone is on standby is faster than normal, and it’s even worse when I use apps like Instagram and the camera app (drained from 50% to 5% in 30 mins from just photo taking).\n\nIs anyone experiencing the same problem and are there any suggested fixes to improve battery life?\n\nThanks in advance.",
