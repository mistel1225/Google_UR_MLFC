    "content": "My pixel 3 takes a while to unlock. \nI notice that unlocking lags a bit for the first few times I want to unlock after I restart the device or after shutting it down. \nWhen I tap on the screen while it is locked, it takes between 6 and 10s for the phone to respond and show the pin pad, the same thing happens when I try to unlock using my fingerprint. The device responds after about 6 seconds and then shows a blank page for another 5 seconds. \nThis issue persists for the first 30 minutes after turning on the device and then everything begins to work just fine. \n\nThe same issue occurs while the device is in safe mode. \nWhat could be wrong?",
