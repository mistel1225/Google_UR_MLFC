    "content": "Husband and I each have a Pixel 3a.  Both having issues with random audio drops on phone calls.  He's living with it until I fix mine.  These were not bought at the same time.\n\nHere are the steps I've tried:\n1.  Factory Reset\n2.  Wifi on/Wifi off\n3.  Call at home, call not at home (cell signal is absolutely fine, not problem.)\n4.  Bluetooth headset, phone itself, bluetooth FM transmitter (speaker) in vehicle.\n5.  New SIM card\n6.  \"repaired\" at Google authorized repair shop (now it heats up and battery drains during calls...)\n7.  RMA replaced my device.\n\nNow I have the replacement (refurbished) 3a.  And it still does the same thing.  \n\nI've tried using T-mobile's \"code\" to check to see if VoLTE is enabled.  It looks to be, but the option to change it is greyed out.  \n\nI replied to the original support email thread, asking for help with the replacement device doing the same thing, and they want to replace this one too.  \n\nI'd really appreciate any thoughts on this.  It's making talking on the phone next to impossible, as I've had conversations with insurance company, doctors, etc that are really difficult to complete.",
