    "content": "Following the Android 10 update a fortnight or so ago, my Pixel 3 has become increasingly erratic and unusable. From apps freezing, to the fingerprint sensor not registering through to massive battery drain and temporary bricking. It's close to useless... Who can I get help from and what can Google do about this? I'm clearly not the only one and this is a premium (~â‚¬1000) handset. \n\nExasperated, I even just followed instructions for a hard reset and the process would not complete. Got stuck on 'waiting for command' screen. WTaF?",
