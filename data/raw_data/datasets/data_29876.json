    "content": "Immediately after unplugging my device with a full charge the battery falls to 1%. I have done everything but a factory reset. This issue began as soon as I received the last update on April 5, 2019. Zero issues until after my phone restarted from this update. No doubt this is the issue. Anyone know how to fix?",
