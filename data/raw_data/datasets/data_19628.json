    "content": "Pixel 3 has stopped charging through the wireless (Pixel Stand) charger.\n\nIt just started doing this yesterday. I've put it in safe mode, and that has not addressed the issue.\n\nUsing the same cable as the Stand, the phone will charge. It was charging intermittently, but after the June update, it doesn't charge at all.\n\nSuggestions?",
