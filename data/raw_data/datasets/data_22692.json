    "title": "When using the Pixel 4 Files App I'm unable to delete certain Downloaded Files.",
    "content": "After downloading a file through my browser I'm unable to delete the folder through the Files App. If I go to Files -> Downloads and it will show the folder even though I have already deleted it. I've tried to delete it through other means like through my PC and through a 3rd Party File Manager however, in those cases the files don't even show. I believe this might be a bug with the Google Files app itself as this similar issue was previously reported.\n\nAny help would be appreciated.\nThank You,",
