    "title": "Why is audio muting itself during video playback when audio is low and headphones attached?",
    "content": "When watching video, and the scene is very quiet, it seems the phone will mute the headphones until it registers a sound level at a higher level.  It is super annoying and distracting.  I never had this problem with original Pixel with 3.5 mm headphone jack.  It seems to be something with the digital to analog converter for audio.",
