    "content": "I purchased 2 Sims in Bali (Telkomsel). After setting it up my pixel would only return a message 'unable to connect, offline'. I have checked all settings, cleared caches, rebooted etc. Whe. Inserted the same Sim in my wife's iPhone it worked fine, suggesting the error is with the pixel and not the Sim. Has anyone experienced this and know why?",
