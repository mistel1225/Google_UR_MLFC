    "title": "Pixel 4:Incoming call audio, alarm audio, haptic feedback audio, app audio and phone app not working",
    "content": "Every few days all audio - call, media, alarm and the mic stops working. The phone app does not work - it freezes the minute I hit the dial button, and I can't make any WhatsApp calls either. The SMS and internet (both on LTE and Wi-Fi) work fine otherwise. The haptic feedback and face unlock stops working too.\n\nSometimes restarting works and other times I have had to do a factory reset. I am going to exchange this for a new device but was wondering if anyone else experience this on their phone?\n\nI bought this brand new, unlocked 2 weeks ago.",
