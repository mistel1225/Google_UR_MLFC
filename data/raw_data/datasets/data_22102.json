    "content": "Photo thumbnails do not show up when the phone is connected to PC via USB (windows)\n\nIt has worked when I bought the phone, now it does not. All settings on my computer are correct.\n\nThis is a basic thing we all need.\n\nExtremely frustrating as other people report the same problem and there is no solution.\nThis phone was dedicated to the camera and taking pictures and now we can not view them.......",
