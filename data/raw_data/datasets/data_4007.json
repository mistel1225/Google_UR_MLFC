    "title": "Pixel 3 locks up since last 2 updates",
    "content": "My phone has gotten consistently worse since the last 2 updates. Phone locks up at the worst time where I can't even reboot it without waiting a few minutes to respond. Typically when I need to take a picture to document receipts at the gas pump. Maps won't load driving mode right now (new feature where music is at the bottom with a Mic button) and loses GPS often in areas where signal is 100%. All this is much worse since the March update. I've almost thrown the phone when at the store trying to bring up a receipt.",
