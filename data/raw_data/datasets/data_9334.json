    "content": "After the December update to pixel 3a when I connect my phone to honda cr-v over bluetooth the car headunit says no device connected but I can play music through my phone in the car. I also don't see any audio controls to control playback but the audio comes through the car just fine. My wife has the same device and hers was not updated yet so I tried to connect her phone the same way and everything worked just right. So I think something on the December update broke my phone's connectivity or visibility to my car. Need help trying to figure this out. I've reset the car headunit as well as unpaired and paired the phone to it multiple times.",
