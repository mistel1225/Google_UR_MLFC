    "content": "I'm using Pixel 3aXL. After updating to Android 11 I see issues with gestures. \n1. The minimize button when in full-screen mode on YouTube, doesn't work. The touch won't register. \n2. While playing games in full screen suddenly the navigation button pops up and doesn't go off. I need to open the game again. \n3. Bubbles doesn't show up even after enabling it in settings.",
