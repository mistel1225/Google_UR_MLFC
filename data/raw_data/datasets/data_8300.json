    "content": "My LTE connection on my Pixel 2 has been unstable since the final December update.  It usually settles on H+ and sometimes goes to 3G. I can only get LTE after removing the SIM card and reinserting.  It lasts for a few minutes, seemingly until I change what screen I'm looking at on my phone.\n\nIt will even tell me I don't have data when it shows that I am connected to H+.\n\nSending media through MMS is practically impossible.\n\nI have T-Mobile for service and my phone was purchased unlocked from the Google Store.\n\nI've tried:\nAPN settings\nReseating the SIM card\nSwapping SIM cards w/ another phone on my account\nResetting network settings\nClearing data and cache from phone services\nFactory reset\n\nThank you for any help.",
