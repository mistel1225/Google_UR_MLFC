    "content": "My phone keeps dropping the WiFi connection since last night. The problem is not with the WiFi, because it's working fine on other devices, the issue seems to be with my phone. \n\nI tried toggling wifi on and off, restarting my phone, switching to flight mode and back, testing on safe mode, and resetting all network settings but nothing seems to work.\n\nMy phone is currently on Android Version 10 and in the few seconds of connectivity I have before it  drops, I've checked for updates but there are none available. Does anyone know what's going on?",
