    "content": "I set them on \"not-optimised\" battery usage, but it doesn't work.\nThey keep on disappearing, even the ones I use the most.\nThe only way to get them momentarily back is by rebooting the phone but it's just \"fake\" because they open as \"new\". The phone doesn't keep any track of where I left them unless the app was used in the last 15 mins or so. It's very disappointing from a phone with 8 GB of ram. My previous Samsung with 4 could easily do this.",
