    "content": "I have had my pixel 5 for about a week now. I usually only charge my phone up to 80 max. I have been noticing that I am only getting about 4hrs when I am drained to around 20%. Is this normal? I have seen reviews of the phone claiming it can easily last a day and a half. I just feel like my phone hasn't been living up to that.",
