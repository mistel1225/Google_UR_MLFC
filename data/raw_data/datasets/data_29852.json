    "content": "My Pixel 2 is experiencing this issue of ghost touch to the point of being unusable. As you can see on this short video, once you turn it on, it will randomly 'touch' the screen on and on. I have tried doing hard reset but still no luck.  https://m.imgur.com/gallery/KH4Nr2J\n\nIs this the issue with the screen? Digitizer? Many thanks in advance.",
