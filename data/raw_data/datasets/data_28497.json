    "content": "hi there. my phone has started to crash regularly. Especially, when I open Google Camera. I tried an alternative app, same issue. I reset my phone and restored my backup. I was able to use (still during restore) my Google Camera for about an hour. Now I have the same issue again. I disabled the Google Camera app, that stabilizes the OS. however, it also crashes randomly, so far when using google maps, the home button or whatsapp and Instagram camera function. Please help! The camera IS what this phone is all about. I m travelling for another year and take all my photos with my Pixel 2, cant resolve the issue practically via warranty.",
