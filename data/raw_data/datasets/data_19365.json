    "content": "This problem started yesterday afternoon. I was taking screenshots of a news article when all of a sudden my phone turned itself off. Then it started rebooting itself over and over.\n\n\nI've tried turning the phone off, but it'll turn itself back on. I've rebooted it into Safe Mode but it turns itself off and continues restarting. Endless loop of flashing the Google and Android logos, followed by a brief loading screen and then nothing.\n\nOccasionally it will get to the lock screen, and will allow me to get into the phone, but it will only last long enough to open a few folders or a single app before turning itself off.\n\nWhen it sits on the lock screen, it will sometimes flash the menu on the side with \"Power, Restart, Screenshot, Emergency Call\" over and over. I can select the options or tap the lock screen to make it go away but if I let it sit long enough it will eventually turn itself off anyway.\n\nI'm too afraid to let the phone die, so I've kept it plugged in, on and off. It's very hot, burning to the touch.\n\n\nI took it to a Verizon store yesterday and was told that they couldn't fix it. The employee seemed stunned by the issue and couldn't do much with it.\n\nAre my only options to buy a new phone? Or could I get a battery replacement and maybe fix the problem?",
