    "content": "Google launched pixel 4a at introductory price of 29999. But half of india can't buy it bcs seller is not shipping to specific pincode . including capital of india ,new delhi .the seller not shipping to even major cities like mumbai , Ahmedabad .so introductory price doesn't make sense if a consumer can't buy it .even today after 2 weeks of launch it's not available . Now I have to pay more bcs of the seller's  or Google's  mismanagement. Is it some kind of a joke? We are talking about one of the  world's top 5 company and this is what you are doing to consumer? Very very disappointed. Bcs I was waiting for it from so long and I feel cheated",
