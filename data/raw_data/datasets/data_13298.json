    "content": "I have a Google pixel 4a. I have only had it for a couple weeks. I used to be able to just swipe up from the bottom of my screen, then choose an app from the alphabetized list. Now nothing happens when I swipe up!\n\nAlso, I used to be able to press and hold the power button then choose \"screen shot\" to take a screen shot. Now when I press and hold the power button, it doesn't give me that option!\n\nWhat is going on?\n\nPlease help asap",
