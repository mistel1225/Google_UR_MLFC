    "content": "Hi. I have a problem.\n\nOn my fantastic Pixel 4 I use the swipe navigation. It's great and k Don't want to change it.\n\nHowever, when I play games.. I notice that I sometimes accidentally activate the back button. It's a swipe from the left or right of the screen.\n\nIs there any way I can temporarily disable while playing games? My old Samsung had a games launcher app where you could control settings for games only.\n\nI've tried 3rd party apps but nothing helps.\n\nAny advice please?",
