    "content": "After July 2020 security update for pixel 4, I noticed Google Pay stopped working. It would not register any contact with the pos terminal. I also noticed that NFC pairing would also not work. I tried safe mode and a factory reset. Neither has worked. Does anyone else have this issue?",
