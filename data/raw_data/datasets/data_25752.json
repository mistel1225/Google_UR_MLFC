    "content": "Long story short.\n\nMy cc was charged a full price Pixel 3 XL two weeks ago because apparently they didn't receive the  replacement device I returned. It was returned, I have a tracking number it was received at their warehouse. The replacement device was refurbished, so I was charged full price for a refurbished device that was returned. Anyways. I was promised it will be credited to my account in 3-5 business days and if it still does not show on my account, I was advised to call my bank. So I did. I called my bank a week later and they do not see any pending credit back or refund on my account. So I'm sitting here, with a $1,065.18 charge on my cc  for a device returned and no one is answering my emails. \n\nHelp.",
