    "content": "Touch is totally unresponsive the first one or two seconds. I have to tap/swipe several times for the touchscreen to work. It works perfectly after the two seconds if I am still touching the screen. Every time i let go and touch the screen again i have to wait for the first two seconds of touch not to register. It is almost impossible to type or navigate and I can't seem to find any solution to this bizarre problem. Safe mode had the same problem. Did factory reset through recovery mode, still having the problem",
