    "content": "The Fitbit Mobile Tracker will not show steps on the app for the Pixel 3XL.  I have done everything Fitbit recommended, and the pedometer app is running.  Any ideas?  Is there a way to force the \"physical activity\" permission to this app -- Fitbit does not request it, but I think needs this to transmit the data to the app.",
