    "content": "I have the problem that was described and solved (for other user)\nI can't add a e sim card. I bought the Pixel specifically to use it as Dual Sim. I can't scan nor input the code by hand. Or: I can technically put it in, but get the message \"Networks not activated\"\nMy build is QQ3A.200605.002 and we are now 9 months further than the linked post and in my case is this problem still present.\nCould it be caused by the network carrier? (Dutch T-Mobile in my case)\nIn all instructions on their site they only know two smartphone brands: fruity and Korean, maybe their e sim is not technically ready for Pixels?",
