    "title": "How can performance of app switching be improved?",
    "content": "Often when switching between apps, the UI will appear to freeze. In the past, I have rage clicked the intended app, but I discovered it's best to just wait. Unfortunately this wait is at best a few seconds but frequently several seconds more. This also happened on my Pixel XL, but I chalked it up to device age. Since this Pixel 3a XL is relatively new, I'm shocked at the abysmal performance of app switching. Even when in safe mode, the act of switching apps is a pain, and in many cases switching back to an app like Google Now or a browser view loses its context and resets to the main activity if not crashes entirely. \n\nAny help or official acknowledgement of this issue would be appreciated.",
