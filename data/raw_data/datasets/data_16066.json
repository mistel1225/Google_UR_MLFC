    "content": "I created an Album with pics and videos to be shared with my family and friends by forwarding them the link to access the pics directly from Google photos. Once the link was shared i now had two copies of the data. One in Photos and another one in the shared Album. In order to save some space I deleted the pics present in Photos but kept the pics safe in the shared album. After deleting the Pics i realised the shared album also deleted those pics and videos thus i was left with just a link to the shared Album having only the Folder name but nothing inside. I am shocked and disappointed to bits for losing all my data because of this. Is there a way to retrieve those pics back or not as i would really want that data back in my phone. Mind you the data was deleted from trash too so i am left with nothing but just a shared folder which is empty.",
