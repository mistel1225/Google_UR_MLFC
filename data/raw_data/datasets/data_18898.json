    "content": "my pixel 4 is paired with my 2012 subaru outback. Any phone call I make or receive via blue tooth is so garbled that it is impossible to use hands free in the car.  I spent hours on the phone with Google a couple of months ago and they said it was third party software.  I deleted all non google apps off the phone and the problem persisted.  Ready to go back to Samsung.",
