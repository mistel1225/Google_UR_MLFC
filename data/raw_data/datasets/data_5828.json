    "content": "My Assistant switched between the new „light bar“, „compact“ and the „old“ design forth and back and now, since while, it stayed on the latter again. A non-uniform rollout is rather frustrating.\nI'm currently using it in german language, sometimes english.\n\nQuestion: Does anyone else have this? I thought the new „light bar “ design is standard by now.\n\nNote: If I delete data in the Google app I get the „light bar\" immediately and it lasts until the next day.\n\nGreetings\nOliver",
