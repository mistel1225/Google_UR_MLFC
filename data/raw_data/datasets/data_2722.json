    "content": "I have .txt files that I would like to have on my phone for quick checking.  On my old iPhone I could look at those files in Notepad.  On the Pixel 4a those files were mostly transferred to Keep Notes.  (Some did not transfer, for mysterious reasons, but that's a separate issue.)  Pixel gives the options of opening with\n     - DOCS (and immediately saves the file to Google Docs)  which I do not want to do\n    - HTML viewer which for some reason randomly does not appreciate carriage returns so is not satisfactory\n   - CHROME which I do not use and do not want to start using.\n\nI know my preference may be unusual, but is the lack of flexibility here intentional by Google?  Or is there a work around?",
