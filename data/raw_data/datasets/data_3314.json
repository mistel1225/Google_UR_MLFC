    "content": "Just bought a Pixel 5 and with that a Moshi Lounge Q Wireless Charging Stand (Qi EPP up to 15 W). The phone has April update installed and there are constant problems with wireless charging. It's quite hard to get the phone misaligned with this charger, but I get constant notifications about \"align phone to charge\", then sometimes it charges the phone quite slowly, yesterday it hold the charge constantly at 19% throughout the night though icons and notifications were showing me that the phone is indeed charging. Is there any hope of fixing this?",
