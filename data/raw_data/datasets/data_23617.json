    "content": "My Pixel 3XL was exposed to some saltwater...\n\nThe phone froze and tried to reboot (both Google logo and G logo loaded), then blacked out.\nNow my phone is dead. \n\nI've tried the methods listed in this link, but was unsuccessful in getting a response from my phone. \n\nWould appreciate any help in figuring out if my phone can be fixed, and what exactly is dead.\n\nThanks!",
