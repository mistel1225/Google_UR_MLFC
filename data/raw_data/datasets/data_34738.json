    "content": "Hi guys, I have a pixel xl 32gb and since yesterday, my phone keeps rebooting and freezing itself. I had this issue 2 times before but somehow got it fixed by turning the phone off, charging it and not using it for a while. I've tried to set it in safe mode today, but the phone keeps freezing and rebooting so no installed apps are causing the problem. Then, I tried a factory reset which in the first place seemed to work but in the process of setting up the device (selecting network, language, etc.) it keeps freezing and rebooting. Even with a resetted phone, it is not working so I think it's hardware related but I'm not sure. I've seen graphical issues on the screen multiple times as well. Unfortunately, there is no warranty for me and I don't know what to do. Any help/solutions would be really helpful. Thanks!\n\nStats from my phone:\nPixel XL 32gb (have it since march 2017)\nLatest android update: 9.1\nLatest security update: February",
