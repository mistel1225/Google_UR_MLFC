    "content": "My Pixel 2 snapchat notifications not grouping together. \nApps such as whatsapp or facebook messenger will allow me to pull down to see all the notifications, but if I don't pull down it will stay grouped into one notification. \nEvery individual notification from snapchat comes as its own notification and it is very annoying as it floods my notification tray.\n\nIs there anyway to fix this issue?\n\nThanks",
