    "content": "After only 2 weeks my phone began acting up, not charging and acting erratically by posting error messages that made no sense. Discussions with customer support resulted in me ordering a new phone. That was 11/16, I have confirmation that the phone is ordered yet can get no response as to if or when the phone shipped. I'm certain all can appreciate the inconvenience of being without a phone.",
