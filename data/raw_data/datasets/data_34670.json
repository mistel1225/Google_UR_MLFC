    "content": "Since the patch previous to Android version 9, I can no longer connect to my work wifi.  When it should be going to the confirmation screen, it is just blank.  So there is no confirmation or accept button to click, which prevents me from connecting.  All other devices have no problem.  I had to System Reset to factory, then it worked once.  After the first time logging in after the reset, it repeated the same thing over again.  I should not have to factory reset my phone every time I connect to my work wifi.",
