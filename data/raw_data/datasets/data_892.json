    "title": "No audio after last security update (June 2021)",
    "content": "Very strange issue.\n\nI have a Google Pixel 3 XL running Android 11, and this morning everything was fine.\n\nI woke up to my alarm at 7am and proceeded to listen to the radio using my device. I saw an article about the June security update and so checked to see if there was an update available to me. There was, so I set if off installing.\n\nI've been working from home and I've barely had time to pick my phone up today but this afternoon I received a call so I picked up. There was no audio coming out of the phone and when I looked, the speaker icon was lit up. I tried to unclick it thinking it was my face hitting buttons but it was stuck on.\n\nI've done some testing this afternoon and been back and forward with Google support but absolutely no joy. I've done a factory reset and all the usual basic troubleshooting you can do but the issue still persists.\n\nThe weirdest thing is that the device won't produce audio even through my Pixel Buds which would suggest to me that this is a software issue and not a hardware one.\n\nMy obvious instinct is to send it off for repair, but I'm out of warranty and I refuse to pay out of pocket to sort out a problem I did not create.\n\nAny suggestions/advice welcome, please!",
