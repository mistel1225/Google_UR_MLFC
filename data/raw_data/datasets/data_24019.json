    "content": "Just updated to Android 10 and it seems like the fingerprint reader has been slowed down as has been the case with some previous android upgrades on this phone. Has anyone else gotten similar behavior? I think it was 8.1 that had a noticeable decrease in speed from 8.0 and then they kind of fixed it after the initial 8.1 release. \n\nJust want to get this out there if anyone else has noticed it and get it on Google's Radar.",
