    "content": "I really like hdr+ mode. Unfortunately, when I open camera every time there is automatical hdr+ mode. I know that hdr+ better in every case, and I have to spend some second to turn hdr mode to hdr+. It would be grateful to get possibility having hdr+ mode in every time, when you open camera and not spend time for switching mode. So I would get more time to take a good photos.",
