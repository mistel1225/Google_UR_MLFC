    "title": "Previously connected devices no longer show up in Bluetooth options",
    "content": "I have a lot of devices connected to my Bluetooth including my headphones, speakers & car, but the other day I tried connecting my headphones Bluetooth to my phone and all of my Previously Connected Devices are gone. The only option I have is to Pair a New Device, but since my headphones are already paired, I can't pair them as a new device. I've tried everything from clearing the cache, deleting all of the Bluetooth storage, turning my phone on and off again and holding down the power button and volume control at the same time and waiting 30 seconds. Nothing is working. I connect my headphones everyday because I need them for GPS when I drive, but this has never happened before and I don't know how to solve the problem.",
