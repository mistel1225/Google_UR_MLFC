    "content": "If I buy an unlocked Pixel 3 or 3 XL through the US google store, would I be able to use the phone with my carrier (LG U+) in South Korea? I know a lot of people do this with other phones such as iPhones etc, but wasnt sure if there would be any issues with the different network technologies and frequencies (e.g. Asia uses GSM Frequency of 900/1800MHz, while US uses  850/1900MHz).",
