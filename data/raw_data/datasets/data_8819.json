    "content": "I got this phone last month, and I noticed that the corners of the screen aren't perfectly rounded. I looked it up and sure enough there were a few posts on Reddit about it. I think it might be a bug/software issue, so it would be good if it could maybe get fixed as soon as possible, maybe in the next security update because it doesn't look as good as it should.",
