    "title": "Since updating to android 10 my Pixel 3 screen always goes black during a call.",
    "content": "This happens even before I put my phone up to my face. It does not have to do with the approx sensor. Only after the call is over and I press the power button a few times (also fingerprint reader) does the screen come back on.\nI had no problems yesterday (or since I have had the phone). The problems started after the update from Android pie to 10 (Q).\nIs there a solution for this problem?\nI have also started the phone in \"safe mode\", so that the chances of third party apps being the problem is reduced. Unfortunately this has also been of no help.",
