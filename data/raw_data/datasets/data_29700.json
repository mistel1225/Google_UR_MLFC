    "title": "Recently my screen call button has decided to answer phone calls instead of screen calls. Why?",
    "content": "Has anything been updated or changed recently that would disable the screen call feature on US based Pixel 3's? This issue has been ongoing for at least two weeks and I was hoping it would be fixed with an update.\n\nWhen I press screen call on incoming calls, it answers the phone and the phone menu drops to the background.\n\nI haven't changed any settings since I bought the phone two months ago.\n\nThanks!\nASC",
