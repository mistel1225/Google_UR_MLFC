    "content": "I have a 8 month old Pixel 3. Since the past couple of days, the power button is malfunctioning. It has become extra sensitive. Just a touch activates it, or opens up the camera or the screenshot menu - without pressing the button. Now the phone also frequently restarts because of this issue. It is most definitely a hardware problem. Please help",
