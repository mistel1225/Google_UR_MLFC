    "content": "Everyone I record on applications such as Instagram or Snapchat my volume of my mic is very low and people who watch it tell me the same thing. My calls are fine I believe it's just through any app. I have tried on the app open camera and it seemed better. I'm not sure which microphone that the apps choose to use but it's ridiculous when this would be a premium phone.",
