    "title": "Pixel 3 XL always shuts down after a minute or two? (performed factory reset, battery is charged)",
    "content": "Ran in safe mode, still shut down after a minute or two.  Performed factory reset to the point of not restoring anything, still crashes after a couple of minutes.  Took phone out of case, left phone off for an extended period of time.  Phone was fine this morning, I slid snooze once and after that the phone has just been unable to stay on.",
