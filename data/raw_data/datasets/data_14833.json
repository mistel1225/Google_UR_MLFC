    "content": "All the pictures I've taken since updating to Android 11 aren't as clear and seem pixelated or have digital noise. Is anyone else finding this? It definitely seems like a software issue not hardware. The picture are taken in the same lighting as before as well.\n\n\nOn a separate note the back arrow in the messages app doesn't always work now.",
