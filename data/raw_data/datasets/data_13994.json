    "content": "I am looking for an alernate charger for my Pixel 4a. Being imported to the Netherlands, my Pixel came with a US adapter and the store enclosed a world adapter to make it work. Nice ofcourse, but the result is a clumsy solution.\n\nThe original charger is rated at 5V/3A or 9V/2A.\nThat's the only information I can find.\n\nDoes the Pixel 4a support Quick Charge? Or Power Delivery? Both? How can I determine if a charger I'm looking at will be supported?\n\nBrowsing my local shop, I have found 2 contenders with the following specs supplied (All USB-C ofcourse):\n\n\nTrust Summa: 3A, 18W Power Delivery 3.0\nDeltaco 3A, 18W Power Delivlery 2.0\n\nAny insight would be much appreciated!\n\nRegards,\n\nJan",
