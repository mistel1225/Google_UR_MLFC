    "content": "Did the drill as recommended. Every touch is vibrating and there is a green box around whatever I touch. I can't even factory reset since I can't get to System and can't run apps since I can't get off whatever it opens up to on start or restart. Only a month old, lots of space so its not that for sure. And the voice is on even though I never use that! Any suggestions before I blow it up? Also seeing random stuff when it starts or restarts. Not things that I have looked at or downloaded.",
