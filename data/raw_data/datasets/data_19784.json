    "content": "I don't know why it is happening.  I can see the angle guide on the screen before I take the shot. I tilt the phone until the guide indicates a zero level of tilt.  Often lately the results require that I edit the picture to make horizontal lines in the subject appear to be horizontal in the image.  Why is this happening?  Thanks for any responses.",
