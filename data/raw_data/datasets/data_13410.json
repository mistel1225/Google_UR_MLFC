    "content": "Hello, recently, since update android 11, every time my Pixel 3A goes to sleep, I have random cuts of the bluetooth.\nIt does this on every device I've been able to test, it's completely unusable. While it had been working perfectly for months.\n\nI have checked that the bluetooth is bugging, not the audio, not the network nor the music app.\n\nAnyone have this concern?\n\nAny ideas to correct this? Because it's very painful, I listen to music all day every day on bluetooth. Such a phone is no use to me....\n\nRegards",
