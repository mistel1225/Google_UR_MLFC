    "content": "Played TsumTsum game on Pixel 1 through all the Android updates.\n\nEven with Force 4X MSAA and Window animation 2x enabled, the game has crazy lag. The game no longer gives the smooth game play.\n\nWorst still, the Force 4X MSAA setting will be disabled after every phone restart. This makes it irritating to have constantly to reenable it.",
