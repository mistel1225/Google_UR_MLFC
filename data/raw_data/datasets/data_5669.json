    "content": "Recently became aware that my call log was not recording my recent incoming and outgoing calls. I cleared call history and restarted phone with no success.  It finally showed call history for two days( do not know what I did) now it is doing it again, no recent calls last two days. Any ideas what the problem might be or what should I try? Thanks",
