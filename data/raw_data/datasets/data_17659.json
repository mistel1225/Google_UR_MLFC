    "title": "Getting a refund for a phone repair",
    "content": "Long story short, I paid for a phone repair back on 06/17/2020 after I was told by a support agent that said they would refund me after I received my phone. Google lost my phone and replaced it, now I'm trying to get the refund for repairs for a phone I never received. Google decided that they won't refund because they replaced the phone, I believe that is a change of the terms and unfair after a written agreement.  Has anyone any advice? I'd like my $151.90 back. \n\n05/30/2020 phone stopped working\n06/11/2020 shipped my phone to you\n06/17/2020 I paid $151.90 for repairs, which I was told I would be refunded\n6/17/2020 you shipped it back to me but IT NEVER ARRIVED, Fedex: 128638242133\nFedEx told me Google has to make a claim\n08/05/2020 - replacement phone sent out. \n\nCase ID [8-19460000******] - Mon, Jun 15, 7:41 PM\nHi Ronan,\nThank you for contacting Google Support Team.
