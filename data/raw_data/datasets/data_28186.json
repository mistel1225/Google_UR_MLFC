    "content": "I am on holiday in Croatia and my pixel phone froze and got the \"black screen of death\" while I was uploading pictures. \n\nI followed the steps outlined in the support article and other threads here with a similar issues. \n\nI tried to hard reset by pressing the power button and the volume down key and even tried a hard restart but the phone is still unresponsive. \n\nIs there a number / email I can contact support with? Also, is there any other way I can reset the phone? \n\nI do not mind losing all the data, just want to get the phone back on!",
