    "content": "So far I love my Pixel 4a, and my wife loves her Pixel 3a XL.\n\nBut we've come to the realization that carrying around an FM radio is a must since the main data line coming into the valley has been cut on a few occasions, rendering the entire valley out of all internet (both home and mobile), cellular lines and land lines. This can lead to several days without any communication other than what we get with the local radio stations or traveling as much as 100 miles away to get signal.\n\nIt's just kind of inconvenient carrying around our Pixels plus an extra device for FM radio. I remember all our older phones had FM radio. Any chance that future Pixels might get FM radio? Or is there a Pixel-like phone with FM radio?",
