    "content": "Got a replacement phone from google fi through insurance. My original Pixel 3 xl (new when i bought it) worked great. I type very fast on the keyboard and it would register everything perfectly. The replacement refurb 3xl they sent me does not.  Sometimes it will work correctly, most of the time it jumps around, thinks i'm swype texting, chooses the wrong letter 3 letters over. I used to be able to \"flick\" the lock screen up with my thumb when i was using one hand... this is no longer possible because I now have to drag my pointer finger from the bottom to the top of the phone for it to register that I'm unlocking the phone.",
