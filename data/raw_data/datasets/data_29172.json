    "content": "Same as Matthew Latham posted in 2018...but Pixel 3...\n\"I cannot connect my Google Pixel 2 (3 in my case) to my home network. I have had my Pixel for two weeks about (9 months in my case) and no problems until a few days ago. Whenever I try to connect to my home network it goes right to the WiFi page and the network says \"Saved\" but is not connected. When I tap on the network it brings me to another password page and in the password box it says \"unchanged\" and I type in my password again and it brings me back to the WiFi page and the network will say \"disabled\" and will not connect no matter what I try, it will not connect.\"\n\nI tried resetting network, bluetooth, wifi. Didn't work. Also tried everything on this page: https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/6183600?hl=en\n\nAny thoughts?",
