    "content": "I'm an existing Google Fi customer since day one. I'm moving up from a Pixel 3XL to a new Pixel 4a 5g. Because my original Google Fi SIM card was one of the very first ones (old and oxidized) I decided to leave the shiny new Fi SIM card in the new Pixel 4a 5g. During the setup, the phone asked me if I wanted to move my Google Fi phone number to the new phone. I'm assuming that my phone number was reassigned to the new shiny SIM card, but I don't really know for sure.  Maybe it's just using the eSIM.  How can I know for sure if my old phone number got reassigned to that shiny new SIM card?",
