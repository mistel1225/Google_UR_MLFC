    "content": "Hi,\n\nNew Pixel 3a user (was iPhone) and am trying to get my Pixel to work in my car. I have a 2006 Golf so no Bluetooth capabilities, however I have got a relatively new radio in there. With my iPhone I used to have an official endorsed Apple charger and it would connect from the phone to the radio via usb and charge whilst playing.\n\nWith the Pixel I have tried a couple of chargers (USB-A to USB-C) in order to replicate this but to no avail. Instead I am using an old fashioned AUX cable to create the link.\n\nMy question is this; if I purchase the official Google cable (https://store.google.com/product/usb_c_usb_a_2) what are the chances that it would work? I can't think what would be different that would allow this to work (however it did with the iPhone; unbranded chargers did not work) but I don't want to waste Â£20 for no reason.\n\nAny help or advice would be welcomed. The radio in the car is a Kenwood KDC-210UI. Interestingly, if I click the 'Android' option via my car stereo, it will pick up random podcasts from the Google Play app, but nothing from Spotify.",
