    "content": "Hello! I has been a very frustrating month and a half. I had purchased the Pixel 4XL back on October, and had connectivity issues, so the phone was sent to your repair center in January, and was issued a replacement unit. The replacement unit had a problem with Face Unlock, and had to sent it back again. \nNow, with this third phone, the phone is rebooting every 5 minutes, and had called support, and was told to send the phone back. I did, and now, I just got a message that the phone is fine and does not need to be repaired! I would appreciate your help on the next steps, since I have been without a phone for too long, and really need to get this fixed immediately. All of the refurbished replacement have had a problem, and every time I call support, they have not been really helpful at all!",
