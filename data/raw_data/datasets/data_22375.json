    "content": "Alarm went off this morning and I couldn't swipe to snooze or turn it off. After that things just got worse. I started with a power button hold down and reboot. Came back fine. A few minutes later the screen froze. Totally unresponsive. Another power button reboot and it came back fine. Same thing happened again and now it's totally off and the power button does nothing. Battery was at 93% last I looked and this was all in the past hour so that should  be good. Any ideas on how to fix my potentially bricked Pix? The device is not rooted. Everything normal up until this morning. I did do the latest update to build version QQ2A.200305.002 a few days ago.",
