    "content": "I have a problem with my pixel 2. After 1 year using I realised that a condition of battery became bad. It loses a charge too fast. For 45 min using only in social media (4g data) and listening to music simultaneously it drain 20%. I've done a battery test (accubattery app), it shows 67% - health of a battery. I'm not able to send my phone to Google back, where can I buy really quality battery to change it?",
