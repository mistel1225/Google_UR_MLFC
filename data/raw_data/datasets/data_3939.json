    "content": "I took a screen shot of my phone screen, and the image is stored in Library-screenshots on my phone. When I want to look at my photos on my laptop in googlephotos, the 'Library' is not available and I can't find the screen shot in any of the available places, even in Photos.\nI want to attach the screen shot to an email sent from laptop. Can't figure out how to do it. (Not got email set-up on my phone.) Can anyone advise? Thanks",
