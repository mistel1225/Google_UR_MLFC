    "title": "Pixel 4 XL battery stuck at 50%",
    "content": "My Google 4 XL's battery percentage is stuck at 50%. Even after being on the charger all night, the percentage never changes from 50%. It will also randomly turn off (not die, because I can turn it back on) if I move to a different location. \n\nI've tried resetting the phone to the factory settings, starting the phone up in safe mode to identify any apps causing the issue, and I've opened a repair order with Google - all to no avail. \n\nI've been waiting for two months for Google to send me a shipping label to return my device for repair, and have had my request escalated to a second tier technician to no avail (Just for a shipping label.......). \n\nMy phone has been doing this for 6 months now - Google Help has been the complete opposite of its name sake and I'm stuck with an expensive phone that I cannot trust to be away from a charger for more than 5 minutes at a time.",
