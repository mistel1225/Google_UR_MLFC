    "content": "Dear all, \n\nI need to help as I don't know how to proceed. My new pixel 3a needed to be repaired and there was a crack on the screen. I paid 160€ to have it fixed. After being fixed it was sent back to me using UPS and there was when the nightmare started.\n\nGoogle said that I have to deal with UPS, UPS said that I have to deal with Google, at the end ZERO help from both sides. The facts?\n\nMy phone is lost since  Monday 16 more than a week.\nI got written confirmation from UPS the 20 the spending 40€ of my pocket on calls wit UPS\nthe 20th was escalated in googles and since then no reply, no actions, no assistance nothing.\n\nI cannot put a claim in UPS, as the website give you an error (very clever UPS)\nI cannot put a claim or escalated the use (as help centre will not allow me to do so)\n\n\nCan you help me? Does anyone have any idea that I could use? So far I am without a phone with 160€ for the reparation + 40€ on phone calls less, and ZERO help from Google.\n\nThanks a mil community!",
