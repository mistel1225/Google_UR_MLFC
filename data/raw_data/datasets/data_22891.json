    "content": "I got my Pixel 4 last week. I installed the few apps i use all the time, but otherwise kept it really simple.\nIt mostly happens right after unlock, i press on the Facebook or Gmail apps, and the phone freezes. I tried restarting it by press-holding the power button for 30 seconds, but after it restarts, the same problem keeps happening.. Then after a while, it goes back to functioning normally.\nThe device is up to date, and so are all the apps installed.\nIs anyone already facing this same problem?",
