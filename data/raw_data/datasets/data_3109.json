    "content": "Hi, recently my Pixel 4XL has started randomly crashing to a black screen.  It stays that way for a few minutes then restarts, sometimes with a tinted green screen.  If i then turn the screen off and on it goes back to looking normal.  Seems to be happening more often recently.  I tried a factory reset and that seemed to solve the issue for a week or so, then it went back to glitching.  Anyone else had this issue?",
