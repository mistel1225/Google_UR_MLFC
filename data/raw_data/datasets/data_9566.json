    "content": "My Google Pixel 2 XL phone was working fine ever since I got it. In the last month or so, I had not installed any new apps or really done anything out of the ordinary with my phone, and was even in my pocket when the issue started occuring. My phone kept crashing every single time I tried to boot it up. I later discovered that the only way to make my phone work was to keep airplane mode on. Whenever it is turned off, it instantly crashes again. Even in safe mode, if Airplane Mode goes off, so does the phone. I tried removing my SIM card to see if that was the issue, but the issue still occured. I have cleared storage, cleared caches, removed apps, force stopped all my apps, tried changing network settings, looked for system updates, tried disabling features such as location, bluetooth, NFC, wifi, etc. and yet the issue still prevails. Is a factory reset my only option? I'd rather not have to go through with the process.\n\n-Aaron",
