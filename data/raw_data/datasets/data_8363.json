    "content": "I keep having this problem of mobile data and wifi being disabled when GPS is in use. I have tried turning airplane mode on and off, restarting the phone (fix the issue temporarily, but it will repeat again once i turned gps on), turning location accuracy off (it will auto turn on again - can someone help me on this?) Is there apps that can turn on location accuracy automatically that i should disable in order to avoid that",
