    "content": "I wanted to say that I have been having problems with my Pixel 3. When I get an informative notification it stays there for 1 or 2 minutes and I can't remove it. For example, when I record a video on Instagram and I save it, I get a notification informing me that I've saved the video and it stays in the device no matter what app I'm using. It happens with a lot of other notifications like the ones when I take a screenshot, etc.",
