    "content": "Hello, i'm using Recorder app on my Pixel 3. Absolutely love it because of the transcription option.\n\nMy last voice recordings lately are not being transcribed. even though the sections are marked as Speech, but there is no transcription generated. not even after restarting / or waiting for a day.\n\nWas this disabled perhaps for some regions (i'm in Spain)? What could be the problem?\nI have older recording with transcriptions. I speak English and previously the recordings were transcribed without a problem.\nScreenshot attached.\n\nThank you.",
