    "content": "We have two Pixel 2 phones and BOTH are stuck on the G loading screen.  Nothing is working to circumvent it, including all available options when selecting POWER+VOL DOWN.     This happened within days of each other.   Out of warranty I presume.   Wondering if I am SOL on these expensive phones?   \n\nLocated in Canada.",
