    "content": "My brand new Pixel 3a crashes out to a SIM locked screen at random occasions. I have tried factory reset and wipe, tried safe mode and it still happens. Contacted support on twitter and was advised to post here. There is no pattern to when it happens and I can't replicate it on purpose, so it is seemingly random. It looks like it loses touch with the SIM and locks the phone, drops network connection as well for a second.\n\nPlease help!",
