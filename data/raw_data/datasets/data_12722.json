    "content": "I have problems reserving notifications (WhatsApp, Gmail...) on my Pixel 3XL on Android 11. When the screen is off for a while, no notifications are shown. But when I turn on the screen, all notifications are popping up. Is more a problem when connected to a mobile data network (LTE, 3G...), not so much when connected to a WiFi I think.",
