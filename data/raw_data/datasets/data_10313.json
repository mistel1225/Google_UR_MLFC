    "content": "I just downgraded my pixel 3a to 9. The seasonal job I just got requires an app that won't work on 10+. I need to keep me phone on 9 until January, but from the messages it gives me, it seems like if I restart it at all it will upgrade to 10. I turned off the auto update on developer options. \n\nWill this prevent it from upgrading back to 10 for the time being? Or will it upgrade again when I restart?",
