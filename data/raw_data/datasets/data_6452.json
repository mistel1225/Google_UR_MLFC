    "content": "My phone hasn't been displaying the correct battery percentage. I've tried restarting my device and it hasn't sovled the issue. My even died saying it was 73%. I charged it and I looked to see what the percentage was and it still Sayed 73%. I've been charging it for about 15 minutes and it hasn't changed. And I don't know if this part helps but my phone has a location tracker (called life 360) and that also Sayed I have 73% I really don't know how to fix this and I'd rather not factory reset my phone.",
