    "content": "Just bought Pixel 4a, was excited for Google Assistant, but it does not always seem to register my voice. I have retrained my voice multiple times but it can still be inconsistent. I have the setting so the screen flashes when it hears me, but even sometimes the screen will flash but Assistant won't actually appear. I also have a Google Nest and that thing responds without any issues, it can hear me from the other room and over th hoover it is a crazy little thing. But my phone's Assistant just doesn't seem very reliable (when it works it's great) as I have to repeatedly say \"Okay/Hey Google\" to get it to wake up properly. Not sure if I need to amend a setting or there is a fault in the phone. Can't seem to see this anywhere in settings or found an answer online. Any help would be appreciated, thanks!",
