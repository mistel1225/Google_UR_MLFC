    "content": "Hello,\n\nI recently got a new Pixel 4a 5g, and it looks like it auto updated and started having problems yesterday. For starters, every time I get a notification, my phone just vibrates without actually displaying what the notification is so I have to hunt it down in my apps. I also cannot use the recent apps feature by sliding down, every time I do it just says no recent apps. In addition, the quick settings that I could normally access by sliding down can't be expanded - I can bring the first menu up with WiFi, battery saver, bluetooth etc, but not the other menus. Also, I don't know if this is related, but every time I restart my phone, dark mode turns off. Any tips?\n\n(Yes, I've tried notification settings, turning them on and off, etc)",
