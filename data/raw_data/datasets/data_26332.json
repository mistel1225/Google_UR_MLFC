    "content": "I am entering a contact for my doctor, but I don't want it listed by her first name (which was the default on my new Pixel 3 phone). \n\nI tried entering \"Dr. Wick\" in both the \"Nickname\" field and the \"File as\" field, but it still showed up in the contacts list under her first name, and displayed as her first and last name.\n\nI finally added \"Dr.\" in front of her name in the \"First name\" field as a work-around solution for now.\n\nDo you know how to get \"Contacts\" to actually file names by the \"File as\" field?",
