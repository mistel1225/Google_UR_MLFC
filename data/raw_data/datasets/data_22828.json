    "title": "My pixel 3 will only sometimes charge when connected, and has major issues holding battery power",
    "content": "Battery power drain, I've stopped many apps and turned off location services. Now the problem is also charging, it seems to have difficulty connecting with the Google c chargers I have but can connect (if in the right place) to non Google supplied c chargers. It's a pretty new phone. Im about to toss it and buy something else because I rely on the phone for my alarm, and even if the charge is connected, it might move slightly and disconnect charge while I'm sleeping, which is a major problem coupled with the battery drain. What in the world is going on?",
