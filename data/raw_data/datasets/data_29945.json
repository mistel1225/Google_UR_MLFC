    "content": "My Pixel 1 is stuck in a bootup loop. It has been constantly turning off and restarting for the past few days, although it would occasionally turn on enough to use for a while. Now, it has been stuck in this loop since last night (16+ hours) without turning on enough to use at all. I have tried multiple methods of charging it as well as following instructions for a factory reset as seen in the forums. Even after it said that it wiped all data (multiple times!), it still is stuck in this loop. I would greatly appreciate any advice on how to stop this!",
