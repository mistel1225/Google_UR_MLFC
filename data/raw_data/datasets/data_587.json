    "content": "My phone completely turned off yesterday. It will not turn on, it will not charge. There are no lights on, I have tried every option in the the troubleshooting. I have held the power down for 30 seconds, I have attempted to call it with other devices (it does not ring). I took it to a private repair centre to diagnose and they said the battery won't take charge and must be replaced.\n\nWhen I follow any of the links given in support here, they do not take me to a page I can actually get support. \n\nThis troubleshooting doesn't work.\nThis 'get help' link doesn't offer any way to actually get help.\nThis 'talk with us' link doesn't offer me any options that actually work to get in contact.\n\nAll of these just send me in an endless loop of 'click here to get support, but actually we'll send you to a page you've already been'. How am I supposed to get actual customer support for my non-functional phone?",
