    "content": "I just bought a Pixel Stand and when I place my Google Pixel 3 on it, it begins charging (although some times it takes 10 seconds to react to it) but it does not prompt to set up the Pixel Stand features. I can't figure out what is wrong. There is no Pixel Stand app or settings on my phone and nothing in the Play Store for it. What do I do?",
