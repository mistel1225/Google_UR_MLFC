    "content": "I heard from somewhere that charging your phone till 80% helps your battery to last in the long run. So i charged my phone to 86% and when i unplug it, the battery percentage jumped to 91%. This is not the first time it happened either. I bought this phone on 5 June 2020 and i post this on 9 June 2020. Someone help, my service provider kept redirecting me to google hotline and they redirect me to the support website so now I'm here.",
