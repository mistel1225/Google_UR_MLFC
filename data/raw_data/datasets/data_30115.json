    "content": "Two days ago, I've noticed the charging indicator (the short text, which displays battery percentage and unsuccessful unlock message) started moving up the lock screen, from its usual place just above the lock icon. The only thing I did, was to clear data of Pixel Launcher, but it didn't help. Does anyone have any clue, how to bring it back down, other than factory reset? I'm attaching screenshots of this wired behaviour.",
