    "content": "Hopefully, this is the right place to post, just doing what the google support told me to,\n\nJust wanted to provide a suggestion for a future google pixel phone, \n\nI have been a Fan of Google phone for some time now, I had one of the Nexus phones but then switched over to the Samsung Note series as the stylus is one of the biggest features I use.\n\nI would love for the next google pixel phone to be able to have an embedded stylus like the Samsung Note 9 does which is what I am using now and what I choose over the Pixel 3XL because of this one feature.\n\nWould like to hear back from someone at Google to see if this is in there future plan so I can know if I should keep getting Samsung Phone of wait until the next Pixel has a stylus.",
