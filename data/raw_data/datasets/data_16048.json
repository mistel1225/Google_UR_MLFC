    "content": "I am big fan of Google smart phones, I have every model since Pixel launched. But got disappointed with my Pixel 2 device volume issue. \n\nI am experience volume issue on my pixel 2 device, I did even factory reset but nothing worked out so far. Making phone calls is useless as voice is not audible. FYI can listen very little sound for media files like YouTube etc. \n\nExpecting some action on it.",
