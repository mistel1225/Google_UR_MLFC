Google promised turn-around of 5 to 10 days.\n\nTracking indicates the device arrived at warehouse on 14th April.\n\nGoogle has yet to acknowledge the device has been received.\n\n10+ emails sent to Neil from the \"Shipping and Refunds\" team yielded no results and no meaningful updates - told to \"wait patiently\". \n\nRequest for escalation to management left unanswered. No timeline, SLA, or next course of action provided despite multiple requests.\n\nGoogle has taken my phone and held it hostage.\n\nPlease help.\n\nIDs:\nRMA02670726\nCase ID [9-1342000030165]",
