    "content": "I’ve been facing the problem of my screen’s brightness suddenly peaking while simultaneaously turning white when receiving a new notification while it’s locked. However, it’d only happen for a split second before getting back to its normal state. I haven’t tried anything yet so far as I really am clueless. Although it happens really quickly, it’s enough to sometimes hurt my eyes, especially in dark places.",
