    "title": "Hi everyone, My Google pixel 4 brightness is still too bright for me at night, what can I do?",
    "content": "I've tried with adaptive brightness switched on and off (doesn't seem to make a difference).\nI also have nightlight turned on and the screen is switched to night mode.\nWouldn't be such a big deal but I have a 4 month old and like to do my Duolingo etc. during the night feeds but I think the bright screen can dazzle him!\nThanks in advance for your help ðŸ™‚",
