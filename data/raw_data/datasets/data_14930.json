    "content": "When making or receiving calls, I am unable to hear the person on the other side of the call. This isn't for every call. It appears to happen sporadically in various locations with and without wifi. I have tried clearing cache on phone app, resetting phone app settings, and a factory reset, but the problem persists. The only \"fix\" I've figured out thus far is to use the pull down bar on the top of the screen and toggle my wifi on and off. Why that fixes the issue and allows the sound to come through, I'm not sure, but I hope this helps the Google crew figure out this odd bug.",
