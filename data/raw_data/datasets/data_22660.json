    "content": "I have a phone so that people can phone me. But my phone doesn't ring when people phone me, so it is pretty useless as a phone.  From reading posts about the issue, this appears to be a fault that has been on-going for 2 years. Other than resorting to paper or pigeon, does anyone know how to fix the fault please?",
