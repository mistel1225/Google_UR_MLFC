    "content": "When the Pixel 4 I've just received installs updates for the pre-installed apps, the installs for updates to Google Chrome and Android System Webview fail (all the other updates - two or three dozen of them - succeed). I've tried a) clearing cache and storage for Play Store app and running it again, but the problem is the same as before, and b) I performed a complete system reset on the phone and set it up from new rather than copying settings and apps from my existing Pixel 2 - this had exactly the same problem with the same two updates. All other pre-installed apps on the phone updated without any problem, and I can install any apps I want from the Play Store without any problem.\n\nAny suggestions on a fix?",
