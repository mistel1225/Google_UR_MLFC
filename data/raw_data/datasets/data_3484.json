    "content": "I have tried multiple web browsers and multiple video sharing platforms. I've contacted supported (useless), and reset all of my app settings and preferences. I also tried rebooting in safe mode. No matter what, the navigation bar will ONLY disappear if I'm watching YouTube videos. That's the only site it behaves properly on.",
