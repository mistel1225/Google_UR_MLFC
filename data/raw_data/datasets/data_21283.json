    "content": "So whenever I take my phone off the Pixel Stand I notice this problem. Can't see the notification bar or time or date or nothing. Can't swipe down even, nothing. All it takes seemingly is a restart or power off and then on to fix this but I don't wanna keep doing that. This is very frustrating. Any help anyone can suggest?\n\nRegardless, this issue has happened to me a few times too and I've noticed it happens when I take my phone only off the Pixel Stand. So I personally think it's something to do with how the phone is configured with the Pixel Stand in the latest update.\n\nI saw another user post another thread on here about this but comments were closed I wanna draw attention to this issue. Google conveniently closed all of their phone lines so they can't help. Pretty lousy on Google's part and that's I guess what happens when they have no offices, their PAYING customers now have to go to community forums for help??? This is hugely disappointing as a consistent paying Google customer.\n\nhttps://9to5google.com/2020/05/06/android-11-dp3-status-bar-padding-bug-cuts-off-time-battery-level-on-pixel-4/",
