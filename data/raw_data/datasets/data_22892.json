    "content": "My Pixel 1 has intermittent screen failure.  the screen goes completely black but the phone is still on.\n\nInitially I thought it was an acceleration or proximity sensor acting up but after time I realize that if I applied varying pressure to the back and sides of the phone, In a \"twisting\" manner i could get the screen to light up again.  I've tried manner of the other diagnostic steps but nothing seems to address this issue. \n\nCould it be a loose wire harness inside the phone?  anyone else come across this issue?\n\nthe screen is not cracked and everything else on the phone works perfect.  it is a real problem that I have to twist and apply a lot of pressure to the exterior of the phone to get it to turn on.",
