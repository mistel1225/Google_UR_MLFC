    "content": "When I make (or receive) calls to others on my Pixel 5, sometimes, but not all the time, they report that there is a lot of noise on my end.  I either sound \"robotic\" or there are \"clicks\" or \"pops\".  However, I can hear them fine and have no issue.\n\n- I have Verizon.\n- I've tried turning on and off WiFi calling, but this does not make a difference\n- I've tried turning on and off HD calling, but this does not make a difference\n- I've used the recorder app on my phone to verify the microphone is working correctly, it is\n- This seems to only be an issue when making phone calls from my house (or indoors) but not outdoors (but the sample size is small so I'm not sure)\n- There is a consistency about callers I have this issue with, that is, if I have this issue with a caller, I will always have this issue (unless calling from outdoors - maybe), and if we don't have this issue then we will never have this issue.\n\nI'm really at a loss on what this issue could be, I seem to have eliminated the network, and the phone microphone.  Could this be something on the callers end?",
