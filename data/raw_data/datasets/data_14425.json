    "content": "I tried to connect my home devices in the Pixel Stand settings. I selected them and went back to the previous screen. However, the settings are not kept, meaning that the devices are deselected if I go back to that screen. If I tap on the screen when the phone is on the stand nothing happens.\nAny ideas ?\nPixel 3, Android 11",
