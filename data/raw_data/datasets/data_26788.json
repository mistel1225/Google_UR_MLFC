    "content": "Hi guys! I recently purchased a Google Pixel 1 and in the first few months of use it gave a blue screen and simply crashed):\nI do not know what to do! There is no assistance anywhere and I have tried everything. I downloaded Android recovery apps but all only support Samsung.\nWould anyone know how to help me? Any way you could get it back?\nThanks in advance! I'm from Brazil.",
