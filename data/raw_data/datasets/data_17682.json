    "title": "Not Connecting to Wifi",
    "content": "After about an hour of use on my phone, it disconnects to wifi and does not reconnect. The only way to get it to reconnect is to restart my phone, which then restarts the hour of connection time before I restart it again. I put it in safe mode to see if one of my apps is causing the problem, and I connected to the wifi. But I'm not sure whether the reason I connected to the wifi was because I restarted my phone (to put it in safe mode) or because it was actually in safe mode. So now I don't know what to do.",
