    "content": "Hi everyone, I was pretty excited when I read of the patch notes for the november 2020 patch.\n\nHowever, my Pixel 4a still only vibrates for calls from starred contacts. There is no ringtone, although I am using the standard options for DND mode and ringing is activated.\n\nIf you have a 4a, does it work for you?\nAre there special options I have to consider?",
