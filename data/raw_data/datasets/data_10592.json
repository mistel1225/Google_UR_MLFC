    "content": "I have been experiencing noticable eye strain and headaches from the Pixel 4a's screen. Im a guy who uses all types of screens for multiple hours daily and have been doing that for years. Haven't had this type of issue before.\n\nI'm positive it is the 4a's screen and nothing else, bcz it only happen while watching its screen and afterwards and not with any other screens or anything else. I have tried tweaking the brightness settings but it doesn't help much. I'm also sadly out of the short return period for the device in my country, since it took me a while to notice and narrow down the issue but now that I have I can't not notice it anymore.\n\nIt seems like the issue with PWM flicker of its OLED display. The frequency is quite low: https://www.notebookcheck.net/Google-Pixel-4a-smartphone-in-review-It-s-not-about-the-megapixels.494895.0.html\nAnd many other people have been pointing out the same issues:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7GHb_traI4\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Pixel4a/comments/idpv79/pixel_4a_eye_strain/\n\nI have used OLED screens in the past(with noticable strain issues on a couple of them especially on the iPhone X), but never had this significant eye strain, let alone the headaches, on any of them.\n\nPlease look into this Google and provide a resolution.",
