    "title": "Many issues with Pixel XL sound systems.",
    "content": "I got this cellphone (Pixel XL first generation) as a gift 2 years ago. It worked perfectly fine until six months ago. First, the microphone just didn't work sometimes. \n\nThe time passed, and now whenever I tried to use the microphone in an app, the whole app crashes. I need to restart the phone one, two or even three times to get the microphone working again, altough some time later the microphone will present the same issue again and I have to repeat the process.\n\nThe headphones have also become an issue. Sometimes when using them I hear a \"crack\" sound, and the headphones I canÂ´t listen anything on them. If I disconnect the headphones, no sound comes out from the Pixel speaker until I restart the phone.\n\nFinally, sometimes I connect the headphones to my cellphone, but the sound still comes from the speaker. \n\nI have already tried 3 times to factory reset my phone, and the problem has not been resolve yet. However, I doubt it is a hardware issue (or at least just hardware by itself), because:\n\n-This issues are not present everytime.\n-The microphone crashes the whole app, and not just records nothing. \n\nI don't know all the problems have the same origin, or they are caused by different issues.\n\nAny help is appreciated.",
