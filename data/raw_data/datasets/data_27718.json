    "content": "Hi! \nI currently live in Sweden and have My wonderful pixel 3 phone which i absolutely Love, especially because of the camera. \nSuddenly however i noticed that something was very off with the camera. \nWhen i try tog shoot videos the camera jitters and jumps. If you have the camera app open and Love/shake the phone, you can hear something sounds loose in there. It's like the stabilisation thing around the camera isn't working anymore. \n\nNow, i bought the pixel from the german Google store, but i currently live in Sweden, and there doesnt seem to be any authorized place to repair the pixel here, so i need help. What so I do?",
