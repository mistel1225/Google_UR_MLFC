    "title": "Google Play Store Region Locked - Pixel 2 - Need To Change Region After Moving To New Country",
    "content": "I purchased my Pixel 2 phone earlier this year, while I was resident in the UK, and did the initial setup there.  The Google Play store region is now locked to the UK and while I can see where the option to change the region is, that option is inactive and cannot be clicked.\n\nI am now living in Canada and need to switch the region so I can access local apps.   Please advise on how this issue can be resolved.\n\nThank you.",
