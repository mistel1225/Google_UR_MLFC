    "content": "I’ve tried cleaning charger port with air. Would work sometimes, eventually stopped working all together and died. I’m sending it in to get repaired under warranty. Since the charger port won’t work and it’s dead, I can’t back up my data prior to mailing it in. Is this an issue? Feedback is appreciated.",
