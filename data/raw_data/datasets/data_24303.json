    "title": "My Google Pixel will not make calls and the network keeps dropping.",
    "content": "When I try to make calls, it says 'calling', is silent for a few moments, and then says 'call ended' and hangs up. When receiving calls, it rings on the other person's side as usual, but does not reach me. No call notification appears on my screen and it ends up ringing out and going to voicemail.\n\nAdditionally, my network keeps dropping out every minute or two.\n\nI have had my Pixel around 6 months as it was a refurbished one sent by Google to replace my other which had a fault. I have tried rebooting several times, including in safe mode but the same thing happens.",
