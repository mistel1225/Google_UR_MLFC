    "content": "This just started after the aug 1 update. My pixel 3 camera, front facing only, is crashing after taking about 3 pictures with third party apps. After a phone reboot it works again but only for 3-4 pictures with third party apps.\n\nThe selfie camera does not encounter this issue.\n\nWhen attempting to take a picture with a third party app the screen will remain black for about 20 seconds and the app will crash. On re-oppening of the app it will state \"camera in use by another application\"\nReboot fixes this issue.\n\nSafe mode does not fix this issue, factory reset does not fix this issue.\n\nThanks,\nDan",
