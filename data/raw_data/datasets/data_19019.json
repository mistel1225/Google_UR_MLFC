    "content": "And the drama that is Pixel Buds continues. \n\n1. My Pixel Buds will randomly connect to my phone while still in the case (from another room!) without notice. I'll be in the middle of a call and all of a sudden, the audio is directed to the Pixel Buds.  The case never moves, it's not charging, just randomly makes the connection to the headphones...which are still stored in the case.  \n\n2. On the flip side of this, now I can't get them to disconnect from my phone without turning off Bluetooth entirely. I want to listen to music via the speaker on the phone, but because they're connected to the Pixel Buds, it's sending audio there. I've made sure the headphones are seated properly in the case (the magnet clicks), I've cleaned the charging contacts on both the buds and the case, I even cleaned the entire buds to make sure there wasn't anything preventing them from making contact...and nothing. Eventually, not making the connection in the case is going to be an issue for charging as well. \n\nThis is my second set of Pixel Buds (first one had wires protruding from the bend in the cable) and they've never worked quite right. Anyone have any tips on how to prevent random connections when most inconvenient and then to kill the connection when trying to return to audio via the device?",
