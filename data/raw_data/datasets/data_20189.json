    "title": "Pay for screen repare BEFORE a warranty replacement?",
    "content": "My phone turned off by itself about two weeks ago and then stopped turning on. I messaged customer service to see if my device was still in warranty. Since it is only 8 months old, they determined that I was eligible for a warranty replacement, so I requested packaging and sent my phone in. As soon as they got my phone I was sent an email to approve $140 to replace the screen since it was cracked. I was not planning on replacing the screen even though it had a small crack. After multiple emails and messages with support I got the same message that they had to do all repairs and I had to pay for the screen replacement. While I was still emailing with them the 10 day window closed and so my phone was returned to me. Despite the fact that I had just received an email saying that someone was looking into this. I got my phone back today and I opened it up and there is now a piece of the screen missing on the bottom. \n\nHas anyone else had similar issues? The phone still won't turn on at all. I have it plugged in and it seems to be responding to pressure and the power button, but has not turned on. ",
