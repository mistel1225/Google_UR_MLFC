    "content": "Hi I have a question that if I buy pixel 5 from UK will it work on Indian 4g network because it is primarily a 5G enabled phone. so my major concern as you can understand arises from the fact that this being a 5G phone might interfere with the 4G working capacity too. I would really like your insight on this matter because I cannot find any answers to my question. However I understand that some of the features might not work and I might also lose the warranty on the phone, but will it even get the new updates by Google? Or do I have to compromise on the updates too?? This arises the two questions that first the 4G will work properly on the phone without 5G interfering with it and second is that I will get the updates of the phone regularly.",
