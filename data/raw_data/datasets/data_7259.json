    "content": "I generally leave my media volume off or at a very low level. In the last 2 weeks, I am greeted with max media volume while going back into my phone after a while of inactivity. Even at night when it is in do not disturb mode, i have experienced this issue. I have done a few restarts but issue is still there. Anyone else having this issue?",
