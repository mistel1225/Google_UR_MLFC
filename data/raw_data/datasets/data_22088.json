    "content": "Every now and then the phone will without warning just restart . Sometimes it is just once in a day. Sometimes it goes days without happening. Other times it multiple times a day. When ever the device comes back on it has lost a good chunk of battery as well. This happens no matter what the phone is doing, it can be playing music to generic texting or just sat in my pocket doing nothing and will often just restart. Since the start of this I have found my battery to be draining quicker as well with the same usage I had before .",
