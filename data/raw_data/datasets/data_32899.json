    "content": "I used to be a loyal Google fan.  But after getting the Pixel 3 XL and having Google Fi service, I am completely disgusting at how Google is supporting this phone and service.  Within 29 days of having the phone and service, I still cannot hold onto one single call.  Either the person can't hear me or the call drops altogether.  EVERY SINGLE CALL!  This includes the calls to Google support!!!  I finally gave up yesterday on Fi and switched to Sprint.  And although a tad better, still every call has issues!!!  And, Google made me purchase the phone outright just to be able to switch carriers!  So, I will just continue to ship the phone back to Google every 2 weeks to get a replacement until the 1 year warranty is up.  Everyone online is saying the same thing about this shitty phone!  I hope Google likes me costing them more in warranty returns then the profit they made from my purchase!  I WILL NEVER PURCHASE ANOTHER GOOGLE PRODUCT!!! EVER!!!!  And looking forward to posting negative reviews on every single website I can find!!!",
