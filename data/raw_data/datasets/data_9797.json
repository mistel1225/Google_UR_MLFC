    "content": "I get fb messages all the time and want my phone to not vibrate when I get them.\n\nRecently got a Google Pixel 4a (5G).\nInstalled FB Msngr App.\nGo to the \"App Info\" -> \"Notifications\" -> \"Chats and Calls\".\n\nNow, there is 2 settings\n- \"default or silent\" - > I have this set to Default because I don't want to turn off all the notification vibrations.\n- \"vibration\" -> off.\n\nNow, surely this should mean that vibrations are off. But it still continuously vibrates all the time. I don't *think* this is related to the App itself.\n\nCould someone please direct me to how to solve this. Thanks.",
