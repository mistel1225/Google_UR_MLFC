    "content": "My google pixel 3's microphone stopped working in some instances. Google assistant doesn't recognize when speaking to it, and when making phone calls, the microphone doesn't pick up my audio unless I'm on speaker phone, or using bluetooth headphones. The microphone audio still works in other applications such as video, or when taking a Snapchat video.  \n\nI've tried powering off and back on, restarted my phone in safe mode, reset my bluetooth and wifi connections, and haven't found the problem yet or resolved my issue.\n\nDo I need to factory reset my phone?",
