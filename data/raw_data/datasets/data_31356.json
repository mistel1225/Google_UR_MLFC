    "content": "The phone gets really hot and then freezes and crashes. When not charging I have to put on the battery saver mode just to reduce the behaviour. But it still crashes. \n\nIt definitely crashes when the following happens \n- updating the apps. \n- Charging the phone\n- removing from battery saver mode. \n\nOnce it crashed in flight mode and when it restarted, it was set to couple of days ago.\n\nAlso it gets really hot around the power button.",
