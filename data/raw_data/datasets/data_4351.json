    "title": "Most of my phone apps suddenly don't work",
    "content": "When I woke up and checked my phone everything seemed fine until i tried opening some apps. They wouldn't open or would open and never load, and when trying to google my problem, what i typed wouldn't show up and would close google after 3 characters or so that i tried to input. Apps like Call of Duty Mobile would open and stay on the activision logo screen indefinitely, duolingo would open then close instantly, as well as clash of clans. The only app that i was able to open and run without a problem so far was Cyber Hunter. How can I fix this or what should I try to do?",
