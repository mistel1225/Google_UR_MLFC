    "content": "When someone calls me, my phone rings but when I answer my phone is silent (like it is off). They can't hear me and I can't hear them. My phone is counting time like we are in a phonecall as usual. When I call others, the same thing happens...either I hear it ringing or not, then phone counts time when they pick up. Sometimes I hear them say hello, sometimes I don't. And they don't hear me at all. Sometimes when I restart my phone it helps, sometimes not. Please help! \nThank you!",
