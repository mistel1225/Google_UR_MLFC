    "content": "I've been having thus rather frustrating issue with my Pixel 3 XL. Sometimes if someone calls me, I pick up but I hear nothing, and on their side they hear it still ringing. I've done the following but to no avail:\n-Changed the volume for calls\n-Uninstalled the Phone app and reinstalled it\n-Restarted the phone (which works temporarily fixes the problem, but the problem comes back after a couple of days) \n-Checked if Do Not Disturb is on (it isn't) \n-Updated the phone app to the latest version \n-Updated the phones software to the latest version \nAny help is greatly appreciated!",
