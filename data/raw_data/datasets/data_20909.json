    "content": "For the past few months I've been noticing that the audio will randomly stop working while using my USB-C to aux adapter. I've noticed that it sometimes happens when I accidentally bump my hand or slightly tug the cord, however when I purposely bump into it or tug it in order to find out what the problem could be, the audio doesn't cut out. \nI've tried using different headphones with this adapter and the same thing happens to them.\n\nNormally the audio starts playing again once I unplug and replug the adapter, I did however once have an incident where the audio would continue to cut out once replugging the adapter however that incident in particular appeared to be fixed once I restarted my phone. I haven't had an issue with my phone disconnecting like this while it's charging but I also don't move it as much when it is charging.\n\nHow do you think I can find out what the problem is and possibly fix it?\n\n~Thanks",
