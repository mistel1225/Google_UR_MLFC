    "title": "Pixel 3XL all sensors stopped working",
    "content": "All my sensors stopped working consistently about 2 to 3 weeks ago. \n\nAfter a restart, they sometimes work for a few hours then they stop but last few days even the restart doesn't lead to sensors workings. \n\nThis includes the proximity, compass, accelerometer. \n\nI've tried the restarting in safe mode and no luck. \n\nI heard about \"clearing cache\" but the directions don't seem to be for Android 11? I can't figure out exactly what to clear but I've randomly cleared various system app cache and that seemed to work after a restart? But then it stopped? \n\nI can't be the only one experiencing this? It seems like a software issue not a hardware issue?",
