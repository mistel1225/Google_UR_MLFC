    "content": "My Pixel 4a has a cracked display that will not accept touch input. At this point, the display has bled out completely and is totally black. I need to erase the device. USB Debugging is not on, the boot loader is locked, and the device is not set up with a Google account. There are no remote management services enabled. What options do I have, if any, to erase my data from it?",
