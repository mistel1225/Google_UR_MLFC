    "content": "I have an unlimited data plan on my phone since getting internet in my area is nearly impossible (satellite only) and an expense I can not afford right now. My previous Samsung Galaxy S8 needed to be replaced that did do the screen mirroring without wifi, unfortunately I did not even think to research that for this pixel 4a. Is there any way to bypass the need for wifi connection or use a usb to hdmi cable to use the cast screen on the Pixel 4a?",
