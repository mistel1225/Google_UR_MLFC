    "content": "Pixel and Nexus have always been Google's view of how Android should function. So far many things are good and things might improve further with time. However, I strongly believe Pixel should stay ahead of the line compared to other Android manufacturers. OnePlus, for instance, delivers 3 years of updates and near vanilla experience (used OP3 and it has received 3 years of updates, security, and OS). I personally think Google should consider 4 years of updates for the Pixel 4 devices (6gb ram should be enough probably for the 4th year update). It's one of the key points that differentiate Pixel from other devices. With such a price tag of 999$ for Pixel 4 XL, I do think 4 years of updates would do justice. That's one thing which Apple executes perfectly, Updates. If other Android manufacturers are moving to 3 years (so far only OP and probably Nokia), then its time for Pixel to push for 1 extra year.\n\nIt's just my opinion. Community members can provide their views or opinion.\n\nAlso, if anyone would like to escalate this issue to the software team, as a suggestion, kindly do it.",
