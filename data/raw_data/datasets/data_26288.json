    "title": "Charger won't stay in charging port. I cleaned out the port with a toothpick and compressed air",
    "content": "Pixel 2XL seems to have a hardware issue that it no longer allows the charger to stay in the charging port without slipping out on its own. Even without touching it. I've cleaned out the port the best I can and seem to have no luck. In addition, I haven't been able to play audio in my car through the USB-C in a couple months. This happens with the Google charger as well as an Amazon one. My phone died in the middle of the night and my alarm never went off for work. I need a fix ASAP. I'm thinking it's hardware related and I'll need a new phone. \n\nThanks in advance for the help!",
