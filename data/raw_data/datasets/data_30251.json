    "content": "With multiple devices, (My car and air pods), when reconnecting or connecting, my Spotify, along with other audio apps, will play the audio fine for a few seconds, then the audio cuts out while the song is still playing in my app. I usually have to close Spotify and reopen it every time I connect to Bluetooth which is extremely frustrating. I've reset all my connections, uninstalled and reinstalled Spotify, and nothing has worked. The issue also happens with Google Play Music, but in Safe Mode it hasn't happened yet. I haven't received any satisfactory help from anyone at Google yet and am wondering if I made a mistake buying this phone.",
