    "content": "The new Rules allow me to do some of the things for which I have been using Tasker, BUT\n\n1. I cannot see how to have Do Not Disturb turn of when I disconnect from the specified WiFi or leave the specified location;\n\n2. The WiFi Rule is in fact not quite as convenient as Tasker's because Tasker allows \"WiFi Near\" as a trigger and does not require connection to the specified WiFi.",
