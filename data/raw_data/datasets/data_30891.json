    "title": "Phone screen unresponsive and covered in multi-color dots -- only works when pressed hard",
    "content": "A few days ago my phone screen was suddenly covered in the dots (picture attached), and it wasn't responsive to touch. Suddenly happened (no drop, etc.)\n\nAt first, it would go back to normal on its own every now and then. Then a day later, if I gently tapped the phone screen, it would go back to normal. Since then it's gotten worse -- tapping it doesn't do anything, but if I push down relatively hard in the middle of the phone screen, sometimes it will work. For the screen to look normal AND respond to touch now, I have to keep pushing down in the middle of the screen while touching the phone -- although this doesn't guarantee that it will work. \n\nEverything else seems to be working (speaker, alarm, I'm getting calls... just can't turn alarm off or accept calls when the screen is unresponsive...). Please help, thanks!!",
