    "title": "Any news on Verizon pixel 3 update to fix what they broke in November? (Timed out no response)",
    "content": "It's well known now that pixel 3 had calls toasted with November update via the timed out no response disconnect at 30 seconds, and temp fix is to turn off advanced calling... Which sadly causes horrible connections and signal strength, but most of the time you don't get disconnected, just struggle to hear and be heard...\n\nAny eta on when hotfix will roll out? Thank you!",
