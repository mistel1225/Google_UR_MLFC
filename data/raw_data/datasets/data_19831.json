    "title": "Microphone not working for apparently no reason",
    "content": "So I bought my Pixel about 3 weeks ago. It all worked perfectly fine until today. The microphone just doesn't work, and I don't know why. I can hear other people and other people can hear me on phone calls, but Google Assistant doesn't (with all the other services that use voice recognition). I tried installing Android Q, faithful to be able to fix the prob, but nothing happened. Please help guys, I don't want to factory reset this thing.\nRegards,\nMatteo Brunetti",
