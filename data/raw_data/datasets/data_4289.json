    "content": "I turned my phone off and on a few times, but the problem persists.  Still cannot do a Google search and the app \"crashes\" or closes down.  Even through voice request.  Since the app came with the phone, I'm hesitant to try deleting it.  Is it possible to delete the Google search engine and then upload it again safely?",
