    "content": "My Pixel 3 is ~6 months old, and has been working great until now.\nLately it has started randomly rebooting, and this morning I had a black screen, where the phone was still on (double pressing the power button to open the camera makes the phone vibrate), but nothing was displayed.\nI manually rebooted by pressing the power button for ~15 seconds; after the first reboot it showed Google loading and then displayed the black screen again, after the second reboot, the normal display returned, but without my personalized settings: wallpaper, lock screen display, and a second language I had in the keyboard was deleted.\nThe contacts in my phone are saved with nothing lost, however they are not being displayed in WhatsApp (only the numbers even though the contacts are still saved).\n\nNothing happened to the phone (exposure to water/ fell down, etc.) prior to this.\nI'd appreciate any input on the issue.",
