    "content": "This took SIX HOURS!   AT&T store installed another camera, which would not get out of selfie mode.He referred me to Tessie, at AT&T Customer Support, who then sent me to Josh at AT&T Advanced  Technical Support. They both said I was to get a new phone overnighted to me, but then Josh couldn't finalize the process, that Google had to sign off on it.  So, I spent the last 2 hours with Edd at Google because Google wasn't doing phone support because of Covid-19. , chatting for around 2 hours.  We backed up the phone and then did a factory reset.  STILL NO CAMERA OR FLASHLIGHT!  Instead of approving the new phone, he said I had to go get a new motherboard, and the closest location is 62 miles away, with the soonest appointment on May 22.  The guy there said they are seeing a lot of this since the last update, and that there is fear that if people get the new motherboard, the same thing might happen when Google issues a fix for what I am going through.  SO...... I am leery of getting the new motherboard and going through this again, if that is even the root cause.  So far, I truly think I have been given a run-around by Google and will NEVER buy another Google phone or product, if this is their support.",
