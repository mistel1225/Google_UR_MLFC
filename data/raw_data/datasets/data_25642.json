    "title": "Is my Pixel 2 screen broken? Suddenly went to BSoD, and will now not display anything",
    "content": "My screen suddenly went black, and it will not display anything no matter what I try. I've tried soft restarts, and nothing displays, no vibrations no sounds. The battery was fine when this happened, at about 50%. I've plugged it into my PC and into an outlet, while charging it, trying to factory reset, but nothing displays, no sounds no vibrations. I let the battery drain, and was able to see a flashing red light at the top right corner when pressing and holding the power button (which means the phone is too drained to turn on). I then charged it again and the flashing red light is gone, but still will not display anything, no vibrations, and no sound. \n\nI watched a YouTube video and as suggested, put the phone in the freezer for an hour, pressed hard all over the screen and back-plate, tapped all the buttons quickly, held them down in various combinations for minutes on end. Nothing seems to be bringing this phone back to life.\n\nSeems like a hardware issue, is my phone broken? Have had it just under two years, and warranty is only for one year I believe. This sucks.",
