    "content": "When I say \"Hey Google, call (insert name)\", it will make the call, but I notice that the message on the bottom still says \"calling (name)\" even while I'm on the phone with them or if I hang up, or if they don't answer. \n\nOnce I use Google to call out, ALL incoming phone calls are directly routed to voicemail until I restart my phone. \n\nI've seen the straight to voicemail issue in other Pixel phones but in this situation it appears to be absolutely connected to using the assistant to make a phone call.",
