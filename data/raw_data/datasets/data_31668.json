    "content": "Hey guys, so I really need some help.  A phone repair tech made a mistake and now I have a phone that powers on and you can hear is functional, vibrates when you hit buttons and touch the screen, but the screen is 100% dead...  we tried putting a new screen on the phone, and both the new and old screen (which was working before) now have no display.  My questions are:\n\n1) What could be the issue?\n2) Is it fixable?\n3) If not fixable, is there a way to retrieve my pictures and videos assuming I cant see the screen to switch the phone to debug mode or to select the file transfer usb option?\n\nThank you! Any input would be appreciated!",
