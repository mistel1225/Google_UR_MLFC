    "title": "Help: Pixel XL boot looping",
    "content": "My mom has a Pixel XL device, and recently it started to boot loop.\nIn the beginning it says \"Your Device Cannot Be Checked for Corruption\" and then it shows Google logo for a few seconds and then restarts.\n\nI succeeded reaching bootloader mode using power-button and volume-down-key, but when I choose to go to recovery mode it just starts to boot to the OS instead.\n\nI tried to re-flash the firmware (from here ) , while removing the `-w` part (to avoid wiping, as I want to recover the data even if I will do factory-reset), but it still reached boot-loop (despite seeing that it flashed fine).\n\nTalking with some smarphones-lab (without letting them check it out yet), they said that many times a boot loop is a hardware issue (the CPU, meaning the SOC ), and that if that's the issue, there is no way to restore anything.\n\nIs it true?\nHow can I fix this and also restore the data? Some of the things on the device didn't get a backup for some reason (for a long time), including for Google Photos.\n\nPlease help",
