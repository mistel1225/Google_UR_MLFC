    "title": "Tried to Sync Calendar to Husband's Apple products, ton of events now missing from my calendar.",
    "content": "My husband was trying to sync our calendar's together. He has Apple, I have Google. He added his calendars to mine and switched the color on his computer. All of a sudden, half of my events (20+ events, mostly work) that were a different color were deleted! I checked the trash and they aren't there. I checked different calendars, different things. But almost all my events, past, present and future, that were a different color, are completely gone. How do I restore these without contacting each of my clients and asking when our next meetings are scheduled?",
