    "content": "So I saw so many YouTube videos with battery tests and bloggers posting about Pixel 5 getting upto 9 hours and more battery screen time . \n\nI start my day at 9 am but my battery dies by 6 pm with 4-5 hours screen time . I'm confused, is my phone defective ?? \n\nJust purchased pixel 5 , 1 month old .\n\nAlso my calls volume and clarity is not good at all.  I could hear person speak when no background disturbance but in public areas I can't hear my calls. \n\nPixel team please help .\n\n( Photo screenshot : 100% initial charge and then second round of charge to 55% . Got me 6 hours screen time )",
