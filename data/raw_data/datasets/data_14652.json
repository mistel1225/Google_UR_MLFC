    "content": "My pixel 3 xl keeps restarting if the screen turns off. The pixel keeps working as far as i keep the screen on by touching the screen..or running something on it. It is also working fine if it is in charging mode. Does anyone know what could be the solution. This seems to me like a software glitch.\n\nI have tried updating all the Apps. rebooting it through Boot Loader, cleaning etc. I have actually tried everything except Factory resetting it.",
