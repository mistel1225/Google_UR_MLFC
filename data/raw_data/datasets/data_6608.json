    "content": "Before the Android 10 upgrade my Smart Lock work flawlessly, since the Android 10 upgrade my Smart Lock no longer works.  I work from home and I must manually unlock my phone 20-30 times a day even though Smart Lock is turned on. I added a fingerprint to my Pin because I'm tired of entering my Pin. I reboot my phone 4-5 times a day to get Smart Lock to work for an hour  then Smart Lock stops working and I'm back to using the fingerprint to unlock my Smart Lock. Smart lock does not work on my home WIFI network nor does it work on other home WIFI networks where it used to work perfectly. Now I'm being notified by Nest that my Home/Away assist cannot find my phone which I suspect is also associated with Smart Lock. When I reboot my phone sometimes my Background is missing, and I have to reboot again, or the phone reboot boots into a completely black screen. I can tell the phone is on because I can feel the Haptic feedback when I touch the screen, but the screen is completely black, I must plug the phone in and literally wait for the screen to come back.\n\nI need my Smart Lock to work\n\nALL THESE (and other) PROBLEMS STARTED RIGHT AFTER THE ANDROID 10 UPGRADE!",
