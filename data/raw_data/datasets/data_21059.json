    "content": "I tend to uninstall apps that I infrequently use so they're not running in background, using resources (CPU, RAM, battery).  I'd rather simply \"pause\" them, if the built-in \"Pause App\" function truly pauses the app/service.  Does it do that, or does it simply prevent the notifications from appearing?",
