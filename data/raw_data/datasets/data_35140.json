    "title": "The Oral-B toothbrush no longer connect via Bluetooth",
    "content": "I've been using the OralB toothbrush for almost a year now without any problems. In the last couple weeks it has stopped connecting to my phone so nothing is syncing on the app. I have been able to successfully connect it to my iPad so I know it's not the brush that's specifically the problem. It must have something to do with my phone Bluetooth. I am also reaching out to OralB just in case. \n\nSuggestions on what I should try other than the usual uninstall and reconnect etc... Already tried it and it didn't help.",
