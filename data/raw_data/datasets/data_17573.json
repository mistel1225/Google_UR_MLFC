    "content": "I dropped my Pixel 3a into a pond. I retrieved it within seconds, powered it off, dried it off, and submerged it into a tupperware of rice. Within the following 15/20 minutes, following a bit of research, I took it back out, loosely wrapped it in paper toweling, and resubmerged it into the rice. Very soon after, I read on Google Pixel Phone Help to simply lay it on a flat surface and let it air dry, which I did and am still doing now. \n\nI am wondering how long I should leave it be before turning it back on.",
