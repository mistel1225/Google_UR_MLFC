    "content": "Recently my google search bar behavior has changed, I don't believe I changed anything.  For a while, I would see what looked like strange search history, but found out that was 'trending' setting and I turned that off.  Now I don't see trending searches, I see no search history at all.  If I open Chrome, I see search history as expected.\nAny help in getting the search history back on my google search bar would be greatly appreciated.\nThanks!",
