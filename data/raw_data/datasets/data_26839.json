    "content": "So I noticed this problem back in early July. My devices speaker doesn't work in calls. I tried all the troubleshooting steps there are in the book, it hasn't fixed it. I have replaced my device 5 times, it hasn't fixed the issue. I called Google to try and explain that the options being provided aren't fixing my problems. So I requested that they should provide me another option. They wouldn't provide me another option. \n\nWhatever you do DON'T BUY ANY PRODUCT FROM GOOGLE!!! Their coustumer service is garbage, I have been lied to, they hung up the phone on me, it is a mess.",
