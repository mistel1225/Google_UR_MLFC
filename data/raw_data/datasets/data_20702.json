    "content": "I have a Google Pixel 2 XL that recently started randomly shutting down.  It does not appear to have any clear causes other than perhaps movement.  When I put it in my pocket, it almost always turns off quickly.  If I carry it in my hand or if it is sitting, it will most of the time turn off eventually, but sometimes it will go for 10 minutes, 30 minutes, or an hour without it behaving abnormally.  It very rarely happens when I am using it with the screen on, but if I am using it when it is off (listening to music, for example) it will randomly die.  When it does die, the battery levels never change and it happens at any percentage. It also never seems to die at night when it is plugged in charging, although it will die if it is plugged in and I am using it.  When it does die, I sometimes have to press and hold the power button several times before it will fire back up.\nUsing other posts, I have so far done the following:\nUpdated to the latest version (Android 10, most recent security update)\nRan my phone in Safe Mode (issue still occurs)\nDone a factory reset (no change)\n    \nI bought the phone in Feb 2019, so it is less than 1.5 years old.  Any further ideas?",
