    "content": "My 13 days old device is behaving crazy. When a headphone is plugged in, it doesn't work as expected. I have Jio as esim and Airtel as a physical sim. I'm facing two issues.\n\n1. When a headphone is plugged in, it works for videos played and audio songs. But when a call comes (physical sim, esim won't work with headphones) it goes to loudspeaker mode. Of you try to unplug and plug-in, we get the call audio for a second and then back to loud speaker\n\n2. When a headphone is plugged in, Esim won't work for calls. It will show the signal and the internet will work. When I have a headphone plugged in and someone tries to call me, they will get an out of coverage area message. If I try to make a call from esim that time, it just drops. Feels like Volte is getting affected at that time.\n Also when a headphone is plugged in, the phone shows a TTY symbol. Is this supposed to be that way?",
