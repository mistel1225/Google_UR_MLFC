    "content": "When playing video, such as movies, TV shows, posted social media videos, there is no audio. DND is OFF.  Volume is turned to highest setting.  Vibrate is turned OFF.  Earphones don't have sound either.  I've cleared everything I feel comfortable doing.  This would be okay if closed captioning was available for TV shows and such, but it's not when using apps or social media posts.  Any ideas??? I have Android Q.  Thanks.",
