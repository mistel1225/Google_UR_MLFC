    "content": "I've tried to boot up to recovery; no luck\nI've tried to flash stock images in boatloader, but as my device is locked it didn't work.\nI've tried to enable flash unlock to flash the update afterwards but it didn't work.\nWhen I press and hold the volume up button while the device is normally booting up I get into a screen saying download mode then it goes to the other screen (attached) . In this state, my PC gives me a notification that a USB device is connected but when I type adb or fastboot devices I don't find my device.",
