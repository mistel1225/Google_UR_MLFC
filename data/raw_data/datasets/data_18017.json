    "content": "Why have I suddenly got this moving keyboard on my Pixel phone? It's dreadful! It has to be moved above the message I'm writing, which means my fingers cover up what I'm writing as I write!\n\nMeanwhile the keyboard goes transparent so you can see the text underneath it and get a rely confused image!\n\nIs this another so-called 'update,' fixing something that wasn't broken with something that doesn't work well! \n\nIs it possible to get the old fixed keyboard back?",
