    "content": "Itâ€™s been 3 weeks and have not received return labels for a device I was trying to return within the 15 day window. This customer service  experience has been a nightmare. I have called 10 plus times and chatted on multiple occasions. No one can tell me what is going on or what to expect. It seems to be some sort of black box/ scam. Case ID [3-7637000027959.",
