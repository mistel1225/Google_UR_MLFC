    "content": "Hi,\n  I work for and eSim manufacturer (Oasis Smart Sim) and we finally officially have our own eSim profile certified server (DP+) with some profiles from our customers.\n  When I try to download our profile from a Pixel 4 a using Sim Manager  and I received the following error code: operation code 9, error code 10014. Look at Android developer Website, it seems that this is related to ERROR_CONNECTION_ERROR: link.\n\nWould you be able to confirm to:\nme that the problem is indeed about a connection error? \ngive me more detail on why this could be happening? I can telnet my server address from my device. Is there some kind of access list that restrict which profile server a phone can get eSim from?\n\nHappy to share my server URL and even activation code in private!\n\nCheers,\n\nMaxime.",
