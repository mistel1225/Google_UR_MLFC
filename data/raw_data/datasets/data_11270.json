    "content": "I have a Google pixel three the reason I bought the camera was that I could selectively choose to focus in editing but I can no longer do it. I’m sick of Google changing the camera the entire reason I bought this phone was to have the camera I don’t even use it for any other reason. I restored Google images to its factory settings so I have better manual control but it hasn’t restored the blur or depth and I can’t choose focus- not on portrait and not on either the left or right image. Edit/edit does not work.  I have lost all access to raw images I used to have access to choose\nthis  I have lost all depth or blur it does not exist on the phone I keep on looking it is nowhere-  please instruct. I  feel like I got bait and switched it is not the same camera I bought six months ago and I’m really upset about it!",
