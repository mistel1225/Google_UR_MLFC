    "content": "I just picked up my new Pixel 3 XL and it works great. But, I just plugged in the USB-C headphones and am only getting sound from the right side. \n\nI have tried removing the cord and plugging it back in.\nRemoving the device form the phone and re setting it up.\nchecking it wasn't set to mono in the settings.\nPlayed different music files.\nRestarted the phone a few times.\n\nI'm not sure what else to try. If anyone has any suggestions or has experienced this problem before please let me know.\n\nP.S. The phone charges fine and the file transfer between the old Pixel and this one worked fine too so I am doubtful it has anything to do with the port on the phone.\n\nThanks\n\nErin",
