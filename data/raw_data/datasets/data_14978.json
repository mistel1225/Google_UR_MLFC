    "content": "After the Android 11 update, I no longer have a voicemail icon. How can I check the voicemail when there is no longer a button for it?   Under \"account\" there is no reset option. I 'cycled' airport mode on and off several times, no voicemail icon. There are two voicemails waiting for me and I can't listen. RESTORE VOICEMAIL to my phone!",
