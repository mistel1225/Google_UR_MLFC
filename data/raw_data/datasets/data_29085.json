    "content": "My phone died earlier today when it was at two percent, so nothing out of the ordinary. I was using Instagram when it died if that would offer any help. I also got caught in the rain beforehand, so my phone was slightly wet, but not wet enough to damage anything, especially since it is marketed as waterproof. I plugged it in for about 5 minutes and went to turn it on but the battery sign kept flashing and turning into what seemed to be the loading bar after updating, but then flashed back to the battery sign. I eventually got it to turn on once, but it just turned back off/died again. This didn't stop til I held down the power button, but continued when I plugged it back in. Then I left it plugged in for over an hour, but this same thing happened when I held down the power button. However, this time it was accompanied by a red flashing light in the upper right corner. I don't know what's going on, so please help if you have any advice. It would be greatly appreciated.",
