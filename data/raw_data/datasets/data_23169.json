    "title": "My Pixel 3 is showing 0%, it won't charge and shuts off when charger is removed.",
    "content": "Started 3 days ago.  It would switch between 0% and the charge it had on it.  Starting yesterday it only shows 0%.  When on the charger it shows it is connected but does not charge.   It shuts off after being disconnected from the charger.  When going to turn it on I get the battery symbol with a ? on it.\n\nI have tried the following with no luck:\nRestore\nChanging power settings.\nDifferent chargers/outlets.\nSafe Mode\nHard reset\n\nNone of them work.  The phone is updated and running droid 10.\n\nWhen I try to find a warranty form or anyway to RMA or get support, I keep getting re-routed to the same few pages, none of which let me file a claim.  \n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/oqCIreJ",
