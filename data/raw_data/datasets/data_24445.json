    "title": "Pixel camera was broken by November update.",
    "content": "My Pixel2 camera crashed and died immediately following the November update. No troubleshooting will fix it, not even factory reset, trust me, I have tried EVERYTHING. If you go to the Google Play Store and look at the comments for the Google camera app you'll see a ton of people reporting the same thing. Google support has been giving me the run-around for nearly a month. They say it is not an \"officially known issue.\" They refuse to take responsibility for their faulty update. It has been frustrating to say the least. Extremely disappointed. If anyone has an ideas on how to get Google to do the right thing and fix the problem that they caused I'd be grateful.",
