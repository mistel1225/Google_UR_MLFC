    "content": "Hi, please help me!\nIf I switch to panorama mode and push the button for taking picture the display \"begins moving\" and a red rectangle is rotating and \"falling down\". But I'm holding stable the phone, do not make any movement. (Nor my hands.)\nTherefore I can not make any panorama photo. \nHow can I fix this issue?\nThanks for your help!\nbest regards, Zolt√°n",
