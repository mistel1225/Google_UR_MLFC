    "content": "I have been having issues with the touchscreen on my Pixel 5 becoming intermittently unresponsive over the past six weeks.  This has never lasted over an hour.  Today, around noon, I tried to access my phone and was not able to due to the touchscreen being unresponsive.  I tried rebooting as well as booting into safe mode.  I have removed the protective screen and cleaned the screen, but the touchscreen still remains unresponsive.  The dot indicating the proximity sensor has been persistently solid whilst experiencing this issue.  I believe that the proximity sensor was defective from the start, and, as of today, has completely failed.\nI simply wish to know how to get my phone replaced, ASAP.",
