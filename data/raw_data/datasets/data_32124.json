    "title": "Pixel 2 Deletes Data by Downscaling Photos Without Notifying the User",
    "content": "When I first bought my Pixel 2, I was able to upload all photos on the device to Photos at Original quality (as the app says) without affecting my Google Drive storage.  Recently I noticed that Google has started uploading my photos at \"High Quality\" which tosses out 50-80% of the pixels reducing the quality of the \"backed up\" photos to an unusable size.  After contacting support (Leo and Rick), they told me I should \"free up space\" on my device which would have deleted the only remaining originals that I have not already lost.  Google support has not taken ownership of this issue and there is no setting I can change in the Photos app to even change this behavior (because the app assures me, without any settings, that I will have the original quality photo uploaded).  I am posting here (and will post elsewhere if I need to) because the Google support seems so unwilling to fix this issue.  I really thought Google cared more about their customers.",
