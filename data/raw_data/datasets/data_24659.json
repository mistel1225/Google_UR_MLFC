    "content": "I just updated to Android 10 OTA yesterday on my Pixel 2XL 128gb. I noticed that my lock screen never shuts completely off/sleeps now. It used to turn completely off/go to sleep and then I could double tap this screen to show time/date/notifications. There used to be a setting to turn this off and on but I can't find it in the Android 10 settings (don't remember what it was called). I'm afraid that my battery will drain a lot faster with the screen always displaying this information without ever going to sleep. I did notice that if I hold my hand over the top of the phone where the sensors are, the screen will completely turn off/go to sleep but then when I remove my hand it pops right back on again. It seems to have something to do with it sensing light/darkness. Any others having this issue or know what the setting is called in Android 10 to change this? Thanks.",
