    "content": "When I try to set up face unlock it says.  \"Enrollment not completed.  Certificate expired.\". UBIF said it is a hardware issue and I would need to go through Google, but Google was who sent me to them for my screen issue and they just replaced the motherboard so how could it be a hardware issue. Regardless,  I have about 2 weeks left on my warranty and want to resolve this.  Has anyone had a similar experience and if so, what was the solution?  Thanks, DG",
