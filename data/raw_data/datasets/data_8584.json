    "content": "I have AOD turned on on my Pixel 5.\nNormally when I charge my Pixel 5 via cable, AOD stays at a high-brightness for a few seconds and then it dims automatically. \nBut when I put it on the Pixel Stand AOD stays always at high brightness, which is unbearable in a dark room at night.\n\nIn the Pixel Stand app I have everything disabled except for \"Do Not Disturb while docked\".\n\nAnyway to enable AOD dimming when on the Pixel Stand?",
