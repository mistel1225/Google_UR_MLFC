    "content": "Recently my notifcations sound turns off for no reason. Example: when ever I get a text message it will only vibrate no sound although i have it set to play sound and vibrate. This happens with all notifications, that i have set up to play sound, FB, calander, etc. If i get a phone call, it will ring and vibrate like it should. i have checked all the settings i can fine, with in each app and with in Settings. All are set to make sound. Do not Disturbed is turned off. So far the only way i can get it back is if i Restart my phone, then the sound will start working again for a little bit. \n\nHas anyone else had this issue with the Pixel 4 XL??\n\nThanks,",
