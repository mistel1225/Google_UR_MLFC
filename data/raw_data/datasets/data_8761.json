    "content": "Hi there,\nMy Google Pixel 3 has suddenly stopped paying sound through wired headphones. I understand from Google Support that this is a common problem but none of the solutions have worked for me.\n- The phone charges through the USB-C port fine so it's not a problem there\n- Tried cleaning the port anyway; also no change\n- Headphones don't show as connected in the Google Assistant menu\n- Have tried two pairs of headphones and neither work so it's not a problem with them\n- Doesn't work in Safe Mode\n- Did a factory reset and that also didn't make a difference\nI have no idea why it happened I'm a bit of a loss what to try next and also who to ask/where to go for help (especially as I bought the phone in the UK but am currently in New Zealand). Any pointers would be much appreciated.",
