    "content": "Hi, would really appreciate your advice on the issue i am having with my Google Pixel. The battery is very bad when i start actively using the phone while it is connected to the mobile network (i.e. when it is in standby mode it is fine). The phone overheats and can drain 1% of battery in a couple of minutes. Interestingly enough, this issue is hardly present when i use the it with my O2 SIM card in the UK (which is where i bought the phone). For example, i  used it in Thailand and Colombia with local sims, and the drain issue was very bad.\n\nmany thanks!",
