    "content": "So today I received a email from Google because it's their birthday and I can pretend it's also mine !!!  by using their special offer code B-GOOFLE21, I can get 21% off today, which temps me to upgrade my Pixel 3a to Pixel 3.\n\nBut both the normal 3 and XL are out of stock !!!\n\nDo Google Marketing know what they are doing ?  What a way to celebrate their own birthday by being out of stock of their most popular items.\n\nOk, before anyone says it, they are popular and they are probably running down their stock in preparation for the Pixel 4, but still a poor show.\n\nI just thought this would have been a good time to upgrade and get a good deal, obviously not !!!",
