    "content": "I got my first 4a about 5 or 6 weeks ago. All was fine until it upgraded to 11 and then it began a catastrophic failure. Google sent a replacement phone which took 3 weeks. That phone has 11 but now wants me to restart to finish the upgrade. As you can imagine I'm hesitant to do so. Have the issues with Android 11 been fixed?",
