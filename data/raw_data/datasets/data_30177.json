    "content": "I have problems with the camera. First, images I get are almost always partially blurred, and it is not because of the focal depth. For example, one of the two objects is blured while both are at equal distance from the camera, or part of the landscape is blurred. Second, the camera won’t stop autofocusing, the picture is wobbling continuously. That frequently makes the whole photo get blurred. And that also spoils the video capturing too.\n\nWhile the second problem may be partly solved by uninstalling camera updates, the first one is not as easy as that. I already tried to reset the device completely and set it up as a new one but it didn’t help.\n\nUpd: No, I didn't reinstall the apps when I reset the phone. I set it up as a new one, and the first thing I checked was the camera function. I also tried the safe mode too\n\nThank you very much for your replies",
