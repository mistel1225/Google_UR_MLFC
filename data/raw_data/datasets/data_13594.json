    "title": "Pixel 2 Battery Drain After Android 11 Update, Even With TuneIn Removal",
    "content": "After the update to Android 11, my Pixel 2XL had an extreme battery drain and stayed warm. After reading, I uninstalled TuneIn and the extreme battery drain stopped. However the battery drain is faster than before. I could get to the late evening without recharging, and now I get to start of the afternoon and I have to recharge.\n\nAlso, the phone no longer charges to 100%, even over night.",
