    "content": "I am trying to set up my new pixel 4 by copying everything from my old pixel 2 and it is pretty frustrating.\n\nI tried using the cable that came with the pixel 4, Nexus 6p cable, pixel 2 cable, Anker cable but the transfer protocol keeps prompting me to change to another cable that can transfer data.\n\nI had no problems transferring data from my iPhone to pixel 2 in the past. Is there a problem with my new phone?",
