    "content": "Dear Google,\n\nI am on my 3rd Pixel 4 XL phone for display issues & back glass not glued (each one replaced via google support RMA and 899 euros frozen on my debit card).\n\nThe 3rd phone which I just this minute received also has the back glass which is not glued down.\nWhoever is refurbishing the Pixel 4 XL for google is doing a terrible job in my opinion.\n\n@Google, please reach out to me with a solution for this ?\n\nGoogle support ticket number is 7-1262000030559\n\nThis is not acceptable !\n\nRegards,\nMat",
