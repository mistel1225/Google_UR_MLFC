    "title": "Video continues audio after closing app since Android 10?",
    "content": "On both You Tube and Plex, when I close the app (not just app switching or minimizing) the audio of the video that was displaying continues. If I swipe up to view running apps, the app isn't there, there is no bottom right windowed video. I can reopen the app and the audio continues. \n\nIf I clear all apps, even though the app related to the audio isn't there, the audio will stop. Specific to You Tube, occasionally by opening a random other app, the bottom corner window will then display.\n\nThis started after updating to Android 10, but thankfully it's the only bug I can report.",
