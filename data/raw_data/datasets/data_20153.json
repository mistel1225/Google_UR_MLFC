    "content": "Hi support,\nBottom speaker started making funny noises for a few days and then stopped working completely. I can't make phone calls with speaker function, wassup... Alarm doesn't work.  Other functions work, like music apps, YouTube and the sound is clear.\nI did try everything, even factory reset....\nCould I change somehow those speaker functions to the other speaker so I can avoid going in a repair shop?ðŸ˜£\n\nThanks",
