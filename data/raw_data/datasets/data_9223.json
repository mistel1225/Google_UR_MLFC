    "content": "I just upgraded from iPhone to Pixel, and love most aspects of this phone. One main reason I didn't change sooner was due to sound quality when recording live music. I read an article recently that indicated that this issue was resolved.\n\nFirst recording yesterday; static from over saturation was so bad I can't even recognize what I was recording. PLEASE tell me there is something I can adjust for this!",
