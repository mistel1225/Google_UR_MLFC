    "content": "I bought an unlocked phone, was working fine. Downloaded a movie webpage, then started getting weird notifications so I ended up factory resetting the phone. Now my phone is not unlocked, it says my simcard is invalid, and wants me to contact Verizon to activate the card. But i was using T-Mobile service on it from before performing a factory reset.",
