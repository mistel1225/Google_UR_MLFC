    "content": "Before the newest update (Version 11) I never had this problem, but now whenever I go into my files and type in the name of my image (I sometimes rename my downloaded images so that way they were easier to find) it says there's nothing, despite the fact I know there is a file named whatever it was I typed in. And I know the file exists because I scroll down and I see it and it has the exact name I typed in.",
