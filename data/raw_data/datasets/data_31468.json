    "content": "As far as I know, Belkin and Google are the only companies that make a fast charge qi for Pixel 3.  Since Pixel 3s have been out for a while, I was hoping someone might know of another company that makes a qi that will fast charge a Pixel 3 because I want a car mount fast qi for Pixel and neither Google nor Belkin makes one.",
