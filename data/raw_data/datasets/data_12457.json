    "content": "I have noticed the screen is really laggy and coming from the Huawei mate 20 pro which itself only has a 60hz panel the pixel is at times awful. It looks like refresh drops below 30hz at times.\n\nI thought this may be battery saving measures kicking in once my battery got below 20% bit as I type this I have 36% left and the issues are clearly visible.\n\nResponse to touch e.g scrolling on Instagram or Twitter is very laggy and it just judders, doesn't look smooth at all.\n\nIs my screen defective?\n\nI have noticed that at the centre top of the screen I appear to have a dead or faulty pixel as when viewing some video content in portrait I get a flickering green pixel appear and disappear. I also have a secondary pixel defect near the selfie camera hole punch which appears as a grey pixel when watching videos on YouTube etc but when I return to home screen the grey pixel disappears.",
