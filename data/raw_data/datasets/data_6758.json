    "content": "Hi I have a Pixel 3 phone. Others can not hear me during calls,  it does not record sound and Google Assistant  does not respond to my voice since I did he system update a few days ago. Same thing happened with the last update and I had to do a factory reset and chat with Google Support. It was fixed with the help but it happened again now.  I like this phone a lot but this is annoying so much. I dont want to do a factory reset again. How can I fix this? \nAlso it is so weird that the problem started to happen when the warranty is about to end!",
