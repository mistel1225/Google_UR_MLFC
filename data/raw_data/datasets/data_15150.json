    "content": "The Pixel 4 was sitting on my desk and randomly shut down by itself. The battery was nearly fully charged when this happened. I tried to hold down the power button for 30 seconds, hold down the power and volume down, and volume and power up and no response. I plug it back into the same charge that I had used to just charge the phone and get no response and does not show the phone is charging.",
