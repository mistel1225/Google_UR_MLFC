    "content": "When phone is connected to bluetooth I can hear it ring, but once it picks up I hear nothing.\n> Tried disconnecting and reconnecting the bluetooth.\n> Forgetting the device entirely and reconnecting.\n> Rebooting the phone and trying again.\n> Other devices work fine when connected, just this one is failing.\n\nWhen phone is connected to bluetooth I can't play any audio through spotify, youtube, netflix, etc, (but phone sounds work, i.e. new message, phone call, alarm, etc)\n*Same steps as above\n\nWhen phone is plugged into headphones I can't hear anything but like issue 2, phone sounds work.\n> Tried about 5 sets of headphones, that all work on other devices.\n> Rebooting phone.",
