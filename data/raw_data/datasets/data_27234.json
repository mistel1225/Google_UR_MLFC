    "content": "I am considering Pixel4 as my next mobile, however I am not sure about lack of finger print scanner which was replaced with face recognition. I am using mobile bank application as well as Revolut. Both of them use my fingerprint to unlock. How will they work with Pixel4? Could I use face recognition as a replacement for fingerprint scanner or they will start asking for password instead?",
