    "content": "In the past week I've noticed an issue getting progressively worse with time to the point that my microphone won't work during a call.  I will have to switch over to speakerphone to use my phone.\n\nI've noticed that during both non-speakerphone and speakerphone calls that applying gentle pressure to the screen produces a clicking/crackling sound that can be heard on the receiving individual's end.  When in a non-speakerphone call, this clicking/crackling can also be heard through the earpiece.  \n\nThe phone was taken to a ubreakifix and they replaced all 3 of the microphones, however, the issue still persists.  They reached out to their help desk and to Google.  They were informed that the phone will have to be sent back to Google for repair or replacement as they will not let ubreakifix replace the motherboard for whatever crazy reason?  \n\nThis is very disconcerting as I won't have a phone for who knows how long.  I'm worried the OG Pixel microphone issues are coming back to haunt some of us.",
