    "content": "The Google assistant on my pixel 2 is turning on by itself and returning random search results. This happens when I am in some random conversation with people. I have done the trouble shooting steps suggested by Google support & at the end factory reset the mobile. The google team have taken my logs and feedback details. Seems there is no ETA when this can be fixed . Open for any suggestions to get this fixed?",
