    "content": "When I use the earphones that came with the pixel 3 I can't turn the notification volume down, even if the phone's silent (so without earphones it would not make a single sound) when I have them on and listening to music or watching videos the notifications make sounds and calls make sounds and I can't turn it down.. Hopefully I was clear.",
