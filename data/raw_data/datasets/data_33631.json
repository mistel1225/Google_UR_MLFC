    "content": "Last night I put the phone on the charger with 33% battery left, It was charging.\n\nThis morning i wake up, and it is off. black screen. I try to turn it on, nothing.\n\nI put it back on the charger, nothing. No battery notification, no lights, no vibrations.\n\nI've tried to to use the bootloader via powerbutton + VOLUME DOWN button, but that does not work , (held for 30 seconds plus+ several times...)\n\nI tried different chargers and tested my own charger. My charger seems to be functioning properly. (charges a non-PD phone, albeit slowly.)\n\nThe fact that i see absolutely nothing on the screen leads me to believe this maybe not even be a battery problem.\n\n\nAny suggestions? \n\nI am also new to this site, how do I file a claim as the phone is still under warranty?\n\nThank you",
