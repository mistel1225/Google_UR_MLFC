    "content": "In december i sent my phone for warranty, due to that my battery was swollen, which was easy to feel from back side of case. Warranty got accepted and got repaired, but... case wasn't changed, because I still can feel distortion on back, there was a lot of glue on right side and i have some feelings bottom part is a bit curved. Where can I send an opinion about that service?",
