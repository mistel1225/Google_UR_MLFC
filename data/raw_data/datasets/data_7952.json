    "content": "I cannot make or receive calls on my Google Pixel phone (The very first version).  Everything else works fine. Can send/receive messages, play videos, etc.\nThis issue started about 10 days ago. Initially by restarting the phone I was able to make a call. Now even that wouldn't help.\nI even got a new SIM from my carrier, but still the same.\nI have used this phone for nearly four years and I am quite happy with it, so I don't want to go for a new phone if I can resolve this issue.\nCould someone help?\nThanks.",
