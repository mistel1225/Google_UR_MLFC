    "content": "Hi,\n\nWe have been awarded the Google Promo reward (Bose Headphones) after the purchase of Pixel 5 and validating the claim. We recieved Email on 3rd November 2020 saying it will be shipped through DHL. Its been over 3 Months and we have not recieved the Bose headphones. I have been trying to escalate the problem but the Google support team are not really supportive to come up with a solution. I have so far written 15 emails aksing for the help and they do not have any update on this. \n\nIts  more than 60days according to the terms. What is the actual problem and whom should I escalate the problem to?",
