    "content": "Several of my contacts have disappeared from my phone, no reason I can think of.  I've done all of the fixes I see online and spent time on the phone and chat rooms but no solution has been found.  Not only that, but now some of my contacts are listed under the # symbol instead of the alphabet they should be under.  This has been an extremely frustrating few days and I'm hoping that someone has a solution for me.",
