    "content": "I have seen past posts & solutions to this problem that are now closed.  I tried every solution posted and then some including;\n1. Turned off HD calling\n2. Powered off the phones several times\n3. Removed and reinstalled our sim cards\n4. Reset the phone app\n5. Reset the device network settings\n\nNothing has worked. My phone is just barely 2 years old and I so wanted to love this phone. Verizon has not been able to fix the phone on their end. Any other suggestions?",
