    "content": "I figured out how to add the back keys, but now the back key is on the left side I've had Samsung for 8 years and now I realize why I kept on buying it. The left back key is horrible, IOS is even worse they don't even have a back key.\n\nIs there a non rooting solution to add a back key to my right side without going to buy another Samsung for $1,000? Help. I told Google that I would pay them to add the back key to the right side considering I pay for YouTube TV and I pay for no commercials on Youtube and I pay for Google one and I pay for all this other stuff I'll pay them $2.99 a month to have a back key on my right side.ðŸ™„ðŸ™„ðŸ™„",
