    "content": "I was recently given a pixel 3a by someone that did not need it anymore due to receiving a phone from their job. I tried to activate the phone last night and it won;t accept my google information. Keeps saying \"Verify account. This device was reset. To continue, sign in with a Google Account that was previously synced on this device\" I took it to my local Verizon store and they said they didn't know what to do and couldn't help. Has anyone dealt with this before or know how to go about it. It was activated an used previously by 2 different people so it's not like it can't be done. Please help.",
