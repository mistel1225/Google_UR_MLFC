    "content": "Hi - I have an issue where gifs displayed in apps, especially Facebook Messenger, cause severe studder and device slow-down. A gif will cause UI animations to play very slowly, and makes the device less responsive, such that even the keyboard is very laggy and hard to use. Performance is even worse if multiple gifs are on screen at the same time. The issue goes away if I scroll to where no gifs are displayed. The issue occurs regardless of whether I use gifs from Gboard or a built in gif search in an app.\n\nI've tested the same app on a Pixel 3a xl and there was no issue. Phone is new and has been in use 2 weeks, and I did copy over my data from my previous pixel to set up this phone. I posted this issue on the Facebook help forum but got no response.",
