    "content": "Ok. In September of this year Google Pixel 4 XL crapped out on me OUT OF NOWHERE. By that I mean out of nowhere it began to, whenever I would attempt to turn it on, it would only get to the Google icon with the swirling circle beneath it. And would stay that way for HOURS until the battery died. I then figured out how to attempt other restart and recovery options to no avail. Eventually getting a hold of someone from google help who called me back walked me through the same things, before referring me to a recommended store for a walk-in repair. They did a similar assessment and told me that I would need to  have google replace the device while it is still under warranty. I NEED HELP GETTING THIS REPLACED. PLEASE.",
