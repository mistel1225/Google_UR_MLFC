    "title": "Pixel 2 on Android 11 (Oct 5 sec update), phone restarts when playing videos & battery is < 35%",
    "content": "Ever since I've updated to Android 11, I've noticed my phone has been restarting when I play videos on Youtube or other sources and my battery happens to be at 35% or lower.  I'm currently on the October 5th security update.  I've had the phone since Oct 2017 so I don't know if it's an issue with Android 11 or the battery is going bad.  The Google Assistant informed me the health of my battery is fine. It charges to 100%, and I still use it normally throughout the day, but it does require more charging than in the past likely due to its age. \n\nI've been seeing other reports of Pixel users experiencing random restarts since upgrading to Android 11, so I suspect it is a software bug.",
