    "content": "Hello,\nEver since obtaining my Google Pixel 5 in November, I have had issues with connecting it to car Bluetooth. I have been able to connect and heat audio through a car's speakers, however I have not been able to see or control the tracks on the car's multimedia screen. \n\nWhen I connect to my car (2015 Subaru Crosstrek) I have gotten one of three screens (pic attached). \n\n\"No audio device connected. Connect a Bluetooth device from the settings menu.\" Again, this is happening while music is playing though my phone on the car speakers. \n\"No items to be displayed, since this Bluetooth audio is not capable of title display.\" This occurred AFTER I tried forgetting the phone from my car and the car from my phone and reconnecting. \n  \"Bluetooth audio is not possible with this device.\" This happens when I try to pause the music using touchscreen.\n \nI have ran into similar problems on at least one other car (2015 Honda Civic). This is not an issuer with my old phone (Samsun Galaxy S7) or my Fianc√©'s phone (iPhone 11) on the Subaru. Which leads me to believe this is an issue with the phone itself.  Furthermore, I do not have any issue with the audio itself. There is no skipping or cutting out with the audio. This issue is exclusively with the controls. \n\nI have exhausted most of troubleshooting capabilities. Mainly, unpairing the devices, restarting the phone, etc. And I have not found any similar issues online. ",
