    "content": "All of a sudden all my text messages and emails are showing up on my home screen as previews and not just a notification.  I have tried to troubleshoot this, called tmobile, and still they are showing up.  Does anyone have any insight?  I have looked at previous questions in regards to this and I don't have a lock screen option like the posts are suggesting.",
