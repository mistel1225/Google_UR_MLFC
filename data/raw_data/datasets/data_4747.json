    "title": "A bunch of my recently used apps are refusing to open for no reason",
    "content": "I have a game that I play on a relatively regular basis. It opened at 4:00 and 1 hour later it looked like it would open and then would crash. I tried other apps. Some would open and some would almost open and then crash. I tried uninstalling audible and reinstalling it which worked for a short time and then about 45 minutes later I tried to use it and it half opened and then crashed. \n\nI haven't had any updates that I'm aware of and nothing changed from the time that the phone was working fine until now. I'm connected to Wi-Fi, battery is over 90%, and I've freed up enough storage space to have 14 gigabytes free which is 78%. \n\nI have rebooted the phone multiple times And I have tried to force stop the apps in question.",
