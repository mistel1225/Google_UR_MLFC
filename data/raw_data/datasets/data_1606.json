    "content": "I installed the new beta for my 4a 5g. After restarting my phone, the touch screen didn't work. I tried to restart, but I was stuck on the looping Google logo for hours.\nHad to do hard reset. After that I couldn't log in. I didn't even got to the log in screen, because it wants to restore my phone from another phone. It asks for my screen lock pattern, I gave it in. Tried every option. Go to my Google account, no luck. Try to restore from the cloud, no luck. It always goes back to the pattern screen. I read that after a hard reset, you have to wait 24 hr to try to log in. Did it. Still the same problem....",
