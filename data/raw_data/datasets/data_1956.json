    "content": "Anyone else use a Pixel 5 on Virgin Mobile UK? (purple SIM/Vodafone)\n\nWorks fine in 4G only areas, however most 5G cells connect but then display an X - Both 5G AND 4G are then unusable and the phone has to be forced to 3G to work.\n\nWiFi calling is also unavailable, phone drops back to 3G to make calls\n\nPhone displays setting version virgin_gb-23000000571.29",
