    "content": "When I long press on the Play Store app, I found a master list of all of my phone's installed apps. From there, I can open each app's page in the Play store -- where I'm given the option to open or uninstall.\n\nBut I noticed there are some google apps where the Play Store only gives me the option to uninstall, but not open.  For example, Pixel Tips, Sounds, or Google VR Services. (One that's extra weird: the Pixel Stand App. when it opens the page in the Play Store, there's not even an option to uninstall.)\n\nWhat are these google apps that are supposedly installed, but can't be launched? I searched for them all over my phone but I can't figure out how to open them.  Screenshots below. ",
