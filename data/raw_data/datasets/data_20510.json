    "content": "I'm having a most peculiar problem with my Pixel 3. I installed the May 2020 security update last Friday, and it randomly started thinking the battery was drained and would shut down - sometimes at 20 or 30 percent, sometimes at 80 percent, always doing different tasks - sharing, watching YouTube, using Facebook, doing nothing at all. I've tried all troubleshooting tips - Safe Mode, clearing app cache, factory reset, even did a reset and didn't connect to my account (so that my apps wouldn't download) and it still crashed during a YouTube streaming test.\n\nFWIW, it doesn't crash when connected to the battery.\n\nSo... what else can I try? I recognize that there may be nothing to do until the June update to see if that fixes it, but I'm open to suggestions. Thanks!",
