    "content": "I ordered a replacement device from Google for my Google Pixel 2XL device because my old device shuts down every time I plug it into charging.\n\nI can't use the cable for a device-to-device copy data for restore because my old phone shuts down when I plug it in, so I need to reply on cloud backup.\n\nNow when I'm trying to backup my old device and restore into new device, I can't seem to do if because Settings > Google > Backup shows a grayed out Back Up Now button. I can't create a backup.\n\nI could start creating a backup about an hour ago, but it always errored \"Can't create backup, please try again later\". Now, the button got grayed out so I can't even start. Google customer service told me to turn to forums because they can't help, so I'm posting my issue here.\n\nAnyone faced this issue before?",
