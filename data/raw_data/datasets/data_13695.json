    "content": "Hello everyone,\nI have been reading on healthy battery charging. What do you think about plugging it in when it hits 20% and stop charging at 80%. There is a statement that going to full 100 percent when using a high-voltage charger can put some strain on the battery. Also, what's good screen time and battery duration during the day as hours for Pixel 3a. I'd be happy if the Google support team replies and clarify the case. Thanks.",
