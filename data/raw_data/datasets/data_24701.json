    "content": "I have found a number of times that my phone was hot and battery remaining was plummeting and I was receiving a warning that apps were using more battery than expected.  Upon review the item draining the battery was Bluetooth only.  This was occuring when Bluetooth was not even in use.  (Not disabled, just not connected to anything). A reboot seemed to be the only resolution.",
