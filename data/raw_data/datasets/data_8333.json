    "content": "It seems that taking a screenshot in the Pixel 3A has changed AGAIN. When I tap the option previously used - small icon with the circle in the middle - it now gives me Google Lens which you have to move around and cannot get rid of the small X bottom right.  Along with the fact that they took away the one button option to screenshot - it seems they are just trying to make life difficult!  Frustrating.",
