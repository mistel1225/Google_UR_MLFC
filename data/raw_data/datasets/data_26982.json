    "content": "Hello,\n\nWhen I try to view my camera roll via the Camera app, the images won't come up. I tap on the little circle, the last image I took flashes on the screen for a split second, and then closes.\n\nI've tried wiping the app storage with no joy. I've tried moving all previously taken images out of the DCIM folder and taking a new images, same issue. If I uninstall all the updates from the app, it works as expected.\n\nAny suggestions would be appreciated. \n\n(Pixel 2 XL)",
