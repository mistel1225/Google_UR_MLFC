    "content": "After installing the January 2021 update, the battery indicator on my Pixel 3 is stuck at 56%\nThe batty itself seems fine, it charges and holds a charge fine, as usual, but the percentage indicator is stuck at 56%, so it doesn't go into battery saving, it shuts off \"suddenly\", and I don't know when it's charged.\n\nIt began immediately after rebooting to install the update, so I'm hoping it can be fixed by another update. Does anyone have the same issue?",
