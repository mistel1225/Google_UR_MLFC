    "content": "Over the past month I seem to be having the same problem with increasing frequency. When I try to charge my phone by plugging in the USB type-c adapter the phone will not charge sometimes. I have also had this issue with the headphone jack that came with the pixel 2 XL phone. Trying different Chargers sometimes resolve the issue. However more recently I'm also seeing my battery drain much quicker than usual. Sometimes within an hour. I'm wondering if this is a hardware problem and what I should do next.",
