    "content": "I live in Spain and switch between a Spanish SIM and a Verizon SIM for WiFi calling and texting. I have serious difficulty connecting to the Verizon network from Wifi. I have to reset the WiFi connection multiple times before it will actually connect even though it says \"Verizon WiFi calling\" is connected. I also have to do this to make calls. None of my American friends here have this issue with their phones (iPhone and Galaxy). Is there a solution for this? The issue started back in January, and I had never had problems before. I'm in Airplane mode and then connect to WiFi to prevent potential international charges (I got a $30 call bill when I took it out of airplane mode and had data connection mode turned off, but it still connected.) I looks like I'm not the only one with this issue, but the replies were shut off.",
