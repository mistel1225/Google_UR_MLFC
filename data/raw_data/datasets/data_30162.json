    "content": "I just got my Pixel 2 (I know I'm late into the party). Updated to Pie while setting up the phone. But everytime I check on system update, there is always one, I follow the instruction to restart to complete the update. Then I check again on system update, another one is available.\n\nIt comes in different sizes 49mb, 101 mb, 59 mb, ..... - you get the point. Probably have done at least 6 of these tiny updates.\n\nI don't think the update is related to the Pie or maybe. But I've been setting up my phone all day and still there's an update available until now.\n\nIs something wrong or should I just keep updating?\n\nThank you.",
