    "content": "Hi\n\nI have received the device today by FedEx courier after repair \n\nNothing is done on the issue I have shared \n\nPhone is getting warm and front camera takes blurry selfie \n\nAs per telephone discussion with B2X services they are suppose to check the phone camera only for 15 min and if after that phones warm above 45 C then they will do the repair \n\nAs per them my phone gets warm upto 42 C so they did nothing \n\nThey said this is Google policy to check this only for 15 minutes and indoor only \n\nSo pixel 4a camera is not to be used outside and more than 15 minutes \n\nNothing is said and done on blurry selfie \n\nWhat type of rules and services Google is providing, I fail to understand that \n\nI am sending this to consumer court now \n\nThanks \n\nMayur Joshi",
