    "content": "Hello Everyone.\nNormally how long do you wait for RMA and Shipping label from Google team. I have opened my case ID [2-xxxxxxxxxx801] ( Claiming about my Pixel 2 is powering off when you are connecting it to the headphone adapter or adapter ) since Jan 3, 2019. Google staff from Pixel Hardware Support accept my issue and would give me warranty that day but at last they give me wait for RMA and Shipping label via email for almost 30 days now with no any update and reason why I don't get RMA and Shipping label yet. Everytime I reply them email, they would reply me back that \" Case handled by the specialists. Once I get the update from them I will keep you posted\". Just that.\n\nWhat would you recommend me to do with this case?? I should get right for my warranty but don't know why Google treat me like this.",
