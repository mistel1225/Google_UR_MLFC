    "content": "Hi all,\n\nGot a Pixel 3a yesterday. I'm not sure if the screen is working correctly though. Any button that I try and press near the top edge of the screen doesn't seem to be responding properly. (It allows me to drag down for notifications though). This happens across all apps. When I'm in Chrome I can't click into the box to type in a web address, and when I'm in setting I can't click the button near the top left which I assume is a back button. The rest of the screen is working fine apart from the top.\n\nWhat I've tried?\n\n- Restarting device\n- Hard restart\n\nI plan to go into a phone store today and test a Pixel to see what happens in the same scenario. Maybe I just have a defective unit.\n\nAny help is appreciated :) \n\nThanks,\nTom",
