    "content": "Hello, i bought my first pixel  2 months ago and it hasn't given me any problems. I have almost always charged it with the original charger, I have tried it few times to charge it with others and it has not given any problem. 10 days ago I tried to charge it with one and it didn't give any signal (i tried charge with the 4a turned off and it seemed to drain the battery faster), only when I got home did I manage to charge it again with the original charger. Since then, I can't load it with one other than the original. And 5 days ago the message \"Unplug charger\" or \"Liquid or debris\" started to appear, and appears every time i take the usb and i have to activate the usb. I do not leave home because of the covid and I have never subjected or wet it, I have already cleaned and vacuumed it and the message still appears. Today I did a factory reset because it was not even charging with the original charger, but in the end the message continues to appear. After a while it started to load but it seems to be more difficult (don't charge ate the first time). The only unusual thing I did on the phone was to put a skin  for more than 1 month. Someone can help me? Thanks.",
