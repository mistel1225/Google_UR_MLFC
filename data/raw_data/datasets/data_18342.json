    "title": "Pixel XL 1: Brick After Aug 2020 Update",
    "content": "I see that this phenomenon has happened with many other Pixel users over past updates.\n\nI had my Pixel 1 XL charging overnight, per usual. I woke up to check my alarm and the phone was completely dead, unresponsive. I have used my normal charging cable as well as other type-C charging cables myself and my partner have on hand. Still unresponsive.\n\nIt's suspicious that bricking has happened with previous updates, especially now after the announcement of a new line of phones.\n\nI haven't had an issue with Nexus or Pixel before this. Does anyone know if Google will compensate for repairs? OR is there an easy-ish fix I can attempt myself? I have replaced the motherboard and did other repairs on my Nexus 5 before upgrading to Pixel. Any advice is much appreciated.",
