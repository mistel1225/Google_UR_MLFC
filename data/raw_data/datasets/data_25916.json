    "title": "Cannot set up Photo Frame with Pixel Stand and Pixel 4",
    "content": "I have not been able to get the Photo Frame function of my Pixel 4 XL working with my Pixel Stand. When I set up the phone with the stand initially and tell it I want to use the Photo Frame, it successfully finds the photo albums in my account. And when I select one or more of them the Done button even changes colour indicating that it can be used. However nothing happens when I touch it. I cannot go forward with setting up the Pixel Stand until I tell it to skip instead. If I go back into the settings to set up the Photo Frame when I go to select the albums to use it tells me that I don't have any albums.\n\nIt worked just fine with my Pixel 3 XL, but I haven't been able to get it set up at all with the 4 XL. I've deleted the stand, I've cleared the cache and storage of the Pixel Stand app. Nothing has worked.",
