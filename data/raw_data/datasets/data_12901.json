    "content": "I used to have a pin+fingerprint combo lock screen on my Pixel 2, but ended up stuck in the lockscreen loop. I tried rebooting, I tried rebooting in safe mode, I tried everything, but ultimately I ended up having to wipe all data and factory reset my phone. When I reset my phone I ended up not setting any kind of screen lock because I was afraid of this issue. I was able to use my phone with only minor glitches for about 3 months or so. Then, I ended up having a security breach and had to change all my passwords for everything, and security recommended I add a screen lock. So this time I decided to try fingerprint+pattern lockscreen backup. It only took a couple of days before my phone just turned off and would no longer accept my correct password, getting stuck in the lockscreen loop again. I need a new phone, but I'm afraid to get another google phone because its been years and they have not resolved this issue. Has anyone had this happen with google pixel 4a??",
