    "title": "Why does my idle lock screen pick up random, tiny motions but not large, intentional motions?",
    "content": "If I'm lying still, and nothing is going on, why lock screen will randomly display itself from God knows what kind of motion it's sensing. But if my move over my screen or wave my hand over it, it completely ignores me, every time. This is very frustrating and very counterproductive.",
