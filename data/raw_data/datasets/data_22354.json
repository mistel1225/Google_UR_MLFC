    "content": "I've been using the alarm from the built-in clock app, but it hasn't been working. I have tried setting a few, and sometimes none of them go off. Sometimes, the first alarm will go off, but it won't repeat if I've snoozed it (no matter how much I fuss with the snooze settings). And NEVER have ALL of the alarms gone off (I usually set 2-3). \n\nEvery time I open the app, a notification at the bottom pops up that says \"Alarm & timer notifications are set to off\" with a link to the settings page. But when I get to the settings page, every option to turn them back on is greyed out! I can't figure out what setting has made it impossible for me to turn these back on (under \"Firing alarms & timers\"). Under \"App Info\" for the clock app, Notifications are turned on. Under the clock app \"Settings\" I have \"Show Notifications\" turned on, and every option checked on. What gives? ",
