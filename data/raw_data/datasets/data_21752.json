    "content": "When I open you tube on my phone I could cast, by clicking the icon, and it would come up with my TV, now nothing comes up. The TV is a Samsung and always worked before the April update. The phone has also been going very slow loading apps and videos, but the WiFi connection is fine we have checked it.",
