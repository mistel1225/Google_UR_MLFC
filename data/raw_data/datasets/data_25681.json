    "content": "I have a Pixel 3 XL that is showing that it's charging (the lightning bolt on the battery icon) even when it isn't charging. It also seems to be draining faster than normal, but that is more of a casual observation.\n\nI do not believe the charging port is physically broken.\n\nDoes anyone have any suggestions? I would prefer not to do a hard reset except as a last resort.\n\nThanks in advance.",
