    "content": "My Pixel 4a out of the blue during normal use began having issues with applications (apps open, then immediately crash, but work fine under reinstallation) and the quick bar would crash after a second or two until I uninstalled all it's updates. I also tried the quick bar in safe mode with the updates, yet it still crashed. Any tips?",
