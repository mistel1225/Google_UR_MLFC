    "content": "Just got a Pixel 3 a week ago.  Was able to connect to the bluetooth in my car (2013 Toyota Rav4) no problem.  Makes and receives calls, and I can play music including functionality like skipping songs.  The issue is the song metadata (title, artist, etc.) has stopped showing up.  It's not even blank - now it just says connected.  My previous Samsungs (all of them up to Galaxy S8) showed the song metadata but now it's gone with the Pixel 3.  I tried changing the AVRCP settings to all of them restarting the phone and repairing with the car after each one.  It might show song data for the first connect, but then stops unless I change the AVRCP again.  Any permanent fixes to this other than restarting the phone each time?",
