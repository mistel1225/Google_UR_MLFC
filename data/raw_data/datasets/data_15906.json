    "content": "Pixel XL crashed and cannot restart. \n\nThe screen does not turn on and I tried several methods to reboot in Safe Mode (long pressing power key, volume key, etc.). Pressing the volume key and power button leads to vibration but the screen remains black. The phone is completely 'bricked'.\n\nThe phone crashed while watching a video on Whatsapp.\n\nPlease advise recovery method or solution.\n\nThanks",
