    "content": "Hello. There was a problem with my pixel 3. Forgot my pattern key. I reset it to factory settings via a fastboot. Now it still asks for a pattern key, below is the \"Use account\" button, but when pressed, it returns to the key entry screen, not allowing to enter my account and password. This is on the video, if you need to understand.\nI have already tried everything I found on the Internet and cannot solve the problem. bootloader and everything else is locked, I was not going to flash the device  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOZERFmSL_s",
