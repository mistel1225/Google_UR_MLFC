    "title": "Phone call/recording audio issues",
    "content": "I've factory reset, updated, and restarted multiple times. But the issue persists. I haven't been able to put a cause to it yet, but I will either not be able to hear a call/or them hear me, or I'm heard as static. This is with calls, apps(messager, snapchat, tiktok, etc) anything that captures audio. It even effects my assistant. I ask one thing, and it did NOT come close. (say eggplant, get hockey puck info.) Tried re-training voice input, but still goes haywire. I also had this issue on my pixel 3, my last phone. Unfortunately like I said, there's no discernable pattern to when it malfunctions. But it's at about 50% of the time. 10% if I'm using my Bluetooth buds. It's really pissing me off. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you",
