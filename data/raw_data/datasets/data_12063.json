    "content": "Recently Bought a google pixel, broke the screen (my bad), send for repair and requested a hard copy of invoice as my insurance company needs those to process my insurance (got declined from google telling they don't do hardcopies). Explained the situation to my Insurance Company they told me to provide them the soft copy BUT the soft copy even though my device was repaired 5 ish days ago and deliver almost 2 days ago is not here. After contacting google the issue was escalated and no response is there till yet. My insurance company has a time limit in which i need to send the documents and i cannot explain them how i am not able to send the repair bill because google cannot generate the invoice.",
