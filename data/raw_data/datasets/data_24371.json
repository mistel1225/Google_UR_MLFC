    "title": "Pixel 4 Unlocked on ATT network does not allow WiFi Calling",
    "content": "Purchased the Pixel 4 from Google Store.  Phone comes unlocked.  I am on ATT.  Can not activate WiFi Calling.  Much research and the results are that the GPixel4 is not HD Voice Compatible with the ATT Network, and that ATT is not able to add Voice Over LTE code to the phone. ATT was not able to define when/if this would be addressed.  Google Help advised that this was not a known issue and had no details as to what resolution, if any, was being considered.\n\nI am returning the phone for a full refund, still out a couple of hours, hassle, and the non returnable accessories I purchased for the phone.\n\nGoogle pros...am I missing anything?  This looks like a turf war between ATT and Google.  Sucks to be caught in the middle...\n\nMK",
