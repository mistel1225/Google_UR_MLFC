    "content": "Hey Google Community! \nI ordered a Pixel 5 phone directly from Google, and when I received and opened the box, it was empty.... The box did not appear tampered with, it was simply empty when I opened it. I'm curious if this is a one-off, or if anyone else has struggled with this problem? **Also, I wonder if anyone knows how/where I can escalate this problem (outside of standard customer service, as they have been very unhelpful)? It's now been an ongoing problem for months....\nThanks Google Community!",
