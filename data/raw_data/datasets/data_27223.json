    "content": "My Google Pixel 1 is having a battery draining problem(low energy) even when the computer is shut off & has charging all night, not charging to full capacity!  \n\nAre there apps that will drain the battery, even when the device is shut off?   My Pixel has turned on by itself in the middle of the night, which is why I ask this question! \n\nIs there a way to replace the battery of the Pixel 1 myself?  If so, what type of battery would I replace the battery with?  I used to replace the battery in my desktop computers, but they lasted a long time, over 5 years!  I really like my Pixel 1, but I just don't have a budget to spend more than what I make, to buy a new Pixel every year!  \n\nOn a side note:  We have a year 2000 Toyota Avalon, that the software ends at 2019, & we had to replace the car battery for charging issues again!  so I guess the car is stuck on 2019 come 2020! I guess that is one way to add service fees to cars, for job creation, inflating prices, is thru baked in computer malfunctions when consumers lack the tools to do it ourself?  They are always recalling for faulty airbags due to heat & bad plastic!  Like the Google Pixel battery not charging, like car batteries, do they expect us to buy a new car, I no longer have a budget for, because the batteries & dates are faulty thru some electronic computer malfunction!",
