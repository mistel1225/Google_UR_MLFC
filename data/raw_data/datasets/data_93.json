    "content": "First of all, this used to not be the case. Bedtime Mode has worked perfectly in these settings until a couple months ago.\n\nAs you see in the screenshots, I have it set for \"While charging at bedtime.\" This timeframe is 11:00pm-5:00am. That used to be no issue, but now, Bedtime Mode just won't turn off automatically. 5am will pass and my phone will still be in Bedtime Mode, with the notification!\n\nHow is this possible? And why did it just start happening? Check the screenshots to see that it's not within the timeframe, and the notification says \"Bedtime Mode is on.\" Even though the screenshot couldn't capture this, grayscale was also still on.\n\nI shouldn't have to stop charging my phone to turn off bedtime mode should I? I feel like that defeats the purpose of having a time frame set.",
