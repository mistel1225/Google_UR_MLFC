    "title": "Pixel 2 XL having vertical colored lines appearing on frontal camera after the Beta 3 of Android 11.",
    "content": "Since Android 11 beta 3, my frontal camera has shown vertical colored lines in whichever application that uses it.\nDuring the beta program I opened a bug report on Issue Tracker (here), and I was able to downgrade back to Android 10. But after the stable update, I am locked in a Android version that killed my frontal camera overall usability. Downgrading is impossible, since Verizon won't let me unlock my own phone's bootloader.\n\nThese recordings show my problems: imgur.com.\n\nI either need help communicating this issue to Google's Android devs, or downgrading to Android 10.",
