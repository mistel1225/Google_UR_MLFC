    "title": "On my Pixel 4a I cannot hear anyone on calls unless I use speaker phone or a Bluetooth source.",
    "content": "I try making calls with my phone to my ear and can't hear anything. No dial tone or anything. Others on the line say they could hear me. I then tried making the same call with speaker phone on and can hear everything. Also i tried calls with Bluetooth headphones and could hear just fine. \n\nOther sound problems as well. Spotify and other Media doesn't play over phone speakers but will play over Bluetooth. When not connected to any devices the Spotify notification shows wired headphones as the source even though there is nothing in the aux port.",
