    "title": "Proof that Googel swapped my phone",
    "content": "On the 9th of January 2020, I have sent my phone to Google for a repair, here they apparently swapped my phone for a new one. A couple of weeks ago I have sent my phone in for repair at the store where I bought it and they told me that they can't repair it because of non-matching EMEI numbers. This because of the swap in January. They told me to contact Google for proof of this but it has been days since I emailed them and I am not getting any response. Please if anyone knows how to get in contact with the Dutch support team of Google tell me! I have been without my phone for weeks and it is making life difficult work/family-wise.",
