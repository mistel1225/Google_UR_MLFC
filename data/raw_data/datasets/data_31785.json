    "title": "Do not disturb stopped working after April 5th security update on both Pixel and Pixel 3. Why?",
    "content": "Originally had this issue on a Pixel but have just upgraded to Pixel 3. Everything was okay until the final update (April 5th security patch). Since that was installed the do not disturb function shuts off immediately after turning on. When this happens it changes the volume from vibrate only to sound on.\nIf I reset to vibrate only and try to manually select DND, sound is turned on again.",
