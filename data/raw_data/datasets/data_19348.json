    "content": "I can't download or update anything in the playstore, it  keeps saying \"waiting for download\".  Also, there is an update running (a dinky little <3MB security update) but it's been stuck at \"Installing Security Update\" that's been stuck there for over a day.  I have good wifi and I've cleared the playstore cache and restarted.\n\nPlease help,",
