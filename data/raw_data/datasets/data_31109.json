    "content": "I have a battery issue. The battery is draining out way too quickly, when i am not using the phone in the night, and wind down is on, still it goes down by approximately 20%. And the main issue is that as soon as it enters battery saver mode, it goes from 15% to 0% within 10 seconds. Is this a defective piece, what should i do now?",
