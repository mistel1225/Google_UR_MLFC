    "content": "I put my pixel 2 on charging and went to sleep. When I woke up, it simply wouldnt turn on. I tried all the methods advised in the forums here. Rebooting it, soft/hard reset, troubleshooting the charger, everything. It still doesnt turn on. The annoying part is, this is the SECOND time the exact same thing is happening with me. \nSince it was under warranty the first time, they replaced it with a new pixel 2 (in Oct 2019). And just a couple of months later, the same thing repeats. Due to COVID-19 circumstances, I'm locked outside the UK and I can't even get it repaired under warranty till I get back. Working from home without a working phone is an absolute nightmare. Anyone has any suggestions on how to go about this?\n\nEither way, I'm never purchasing a pixel again. Google, you've lost a customer.",
