    "title": "Pixel 2: After Update to Android 11 the Pixel Launcher repeateadly crashes (even in safe mode)",
    "content": "Yesterday the update to Android 11 was installed on my 2.5 years old Pixel 2. The launcher started repeatedly crashing.\n\nAfter a factory reset it seemed to be stable. Then I configured the apps I used to use and the issue re-appeared.\n\nBut, what makes me nervous, even in safe mode the launcher crashes now.\n\nAny good idea except not using the phone anymore (because w/o the apps I used to use before the phone is nearly useless.)",
