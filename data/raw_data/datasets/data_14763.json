    "title": "Android 11 update- improvement or act of technological torture?",
    "content": "Since updating to Android 11 my pixel 3a is about as useful a a string with 2 cans.   Sluggish, battery drain,  drop calls, don't receive calls and messages, spotty internet coverage, android auto doesn't stay connected and google files ( can't even use the previous files app that was on phone prior to update) give a message that says none of my apps can open file or can't preview this type of file.  Have performed a soft reset  and a hard reset with no results.  Troubleshooting and additional steps with T-Mobile made no difference so they sent me a new device.  Still, the same issues remain.  What gives?  Are we at the point updates and new services are just shoved down our throats with no regard as to quality or reliability because consumers have no real choice but to accept whatever crap is forced upon us in order for our devices to continue to work.  That, or we can go to appel and get pretty much the same shit from them.  Google has a lot of bells and whistles and pretty little baubles but no substance anymore.",
