    "title": "Battery drained in minutes. Not Charging.",
    "content": "I had experienced a weird behavior with my Pixel2 phone. When am using the Pixel2 phone, within 2-5 minutes, the battery started draining from 20% to 0% instantly. To my surprise, I could see the drainage very fast within minutes. \nI tried to charge, ofcourse with original charger, but the device is not charging. \nAs mentioned in these forums, I tried to charge the device for an hour and pressed Power button & volume down button to restart. But it didn't switched On at all.\n\nI had charged for 4 hours and tried the above approach. It vibrated once and the red light was constant. It blinked for 3 times and it was constant most of the times. After 4 hours of charging, I don't see the red light at all. \n\nLater I tried to change the charger to see if the issue is with charger and charged for 5 hours. The issue is still the same.\n\nOne thing happened good to me is that the device is still under warranty, bought in Dec-2017 and Google gave 2 years of Warranty. When discussed with tech support, they raised a pick up request, and it's 3 days there is no update on the device. The device is still with courier and is in transit. Hoping the best that Google would repair or replace the device so that I can continue to use the device for some more month.\n\nLast time it happened the same with Nexus, Pixel devices that the MotherBoard crashed on the next day of the warranty expiration., and I ended up spending thousands of rupees for Motherboard replacement. \nWish Google would help me in this aspect and not let me to spend thousands again and again.",
