    "content": "When I used the command \"Ok Google shuffle my thumbs up playlist\" it tells me I do not have spotify installed on my phone. This worked last week, and now has stopped. Any time I try to play any music via the voice assistant it only tries to open Spotify. I just want to play music I have downloaded via the Google Play Music app. FYI, i have download only selected.\n\nHelp..",
