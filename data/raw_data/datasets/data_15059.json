    "content": "I have contacted Google support via chat and phone (phone goes straight to voicemail). I've been told various times to look out for an email with a return label but I never get it. I see on here that others have had issues with obtaining a return label as well. \n\nNote, this back and forth has gone on for so long that the device protection program has already charged me the $900 or so dollars for the broken device! This is despite various previous communications to Google Support to either extend or halt the deduction until they either send me a label or just simply provide the address and information needed for to write my own. Again, during a pandemic, I have been wrongfully deducted $900 due to lack/horrible of customer support from Google.  This has deterred me from buying any future Google products - period! And this is coming from someone who bought Pixel 1,2, and 4, and was looking into Pixel 5 - NOT ANYMORE!",
