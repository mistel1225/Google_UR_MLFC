    "content": "Phone stopped working assumed it was a dead battery, charged the phone and it started bootlooping. I had flashed android 8 onto it as I wasnt a fan of 9, tried flashing 9 / factory images in both a/b slots but still stuck in boot loop. Anyone got any tips or is my phone just a paperweight now?",
