    "content": "Hello, when I try to watch a YouTube video in landscape mode, it doesn't fit the screen. I have the option to pinch in and zoom but then the video cuts on the corner. If there are some texts on the bottom of the video, half of it out of the screen. Does everyone have this issue or is it something that I am doing wrong?",
