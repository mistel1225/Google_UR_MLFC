    "content": "Hello All,\n\nI purchased my original Google Pixel 2 from an online shop Clevertronic.de in Germany in April 2018\nYesterday night when I was using Whatsapp and just trying to click elswhere, the phone hanged first and then the screen shut down.\n\nSInce then the phone is not restarting. I tried to hold the power button down for 30 seconds. I also tried to hold the power+ volume button down for another 30 seconds. Still the phone seems to be dead.\nI also tried to charge the phone for an hour and try again but it still does not work.\n\nI have never dropped the phone directly. Always used an Otterbox casing.\n\nI contacted the online seller i.e. Clevertronic and they said ask Google.\nI believe I must have some Warranty since this damage is within a year.\n\nCan someone please help me out? Is it a SW or HW issue? In case you need any more details about the phone then please let me know.\n\nThank you and have a great day!",
