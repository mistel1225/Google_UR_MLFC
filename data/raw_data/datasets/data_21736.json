    "content": "I rinsed my Pixel 3XL with water from the tap. After 5 hrs ish, my phone got very hot and the screen went off. It has water in it because I can see the fog in the camera lens. The thing is that the touch does work, but since I see nothing, I don't see what I am tapping.\n\nIs there a way I can activate screencasting (I have a Chromecast) using Google Assistant? I tried but I couldn't get to share the screen.\n\nIf you got any other suggestion of what can I do, I will appreciate.",
