    "content": "I've noticed lately that I lose data when using Pixel or Hotspot function on the phone itself and with any device trying to connect.\n\nPhone shows LTE with reasonably strong signal strength but I can't connect to internet. I reboot the phone and it starts connecting to data again.\n\nPlease fix this. I use my phone for work and I need a reliable data connect and with LTE, that should not be a problem.",
