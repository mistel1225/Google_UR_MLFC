    "title": "Do Not Disturb Settings Randomly Change on Pixel 3 XL",
    "content": "I have my do not disturb settings set to allow messages and calls from starred contacts. I have 3 automatic rules active for weekend nights, weekday nights, and a regularly scheduled meeting once per week. I use driving mode but I have it set to open Android Auto rather than do not disturb.\n\nRandomly, I find that my settings have been changed to allow calls from anyone and no messages. The settings will remain unchanged for several days and then one day I'll find they have changed on their own. I can't find any pattern or app use that causes the change.  \n\nAny suggestions where to look to find the reason behind this?\n\nThanks.",
