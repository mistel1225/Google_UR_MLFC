    "content": "Have tried uninstalling and reinstalling apps such as WhatsApp, zoom, duo, etc. Did a soft reset. Removed the sim and re-inserted it. Finally did a factory reset. Nothing seems to have worked so far. \n\nFunny that the mic works for voice calls, assistant and capturing videos. \n\nMy pixel is less than a year old.",
