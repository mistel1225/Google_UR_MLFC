    "content": "When making calls via Bluetooth connection I get a crackling sound through the speakers. Also, while playing music through any medium i.e. Spotify, Saavn, Gaana or Google Play music apps, some words in the song go missing and don't get played as if they were skipped and it continues with the rest of the song. \n\nI have a 2014 Toyota Camry car and it's not the Bluetooth system which has issues as other apple and Android phones works fine. Have gone through developer change suggestion, reboot, resync phone to car, etc. Nothing has worked. Other Android devices do not emit the same problem when connected. What is the fix for this problem??\n\nPlease help.\n\nAdesh Shah",
