    "title": "Pixel 4 - Using App-Specific Notification Sounds",
    "content": "Ran into a bit of a head scratcher.\n\nWhen setting up Notification sounds on my phone for an app, I can see that they are categorised into coloured boxes, My Sounds, Pixel Sounds, Classical harmonies, Minimal Melodies, etc.\n\nIn My Sounds, it shows a list of app notification sounds; Facebook Pop, Hangouts Message, Slack - Boing, Slack - Ding, etc. \n\nHowever, this is the same list regardless of what app I'm in. For example, in my previous phone, the Duo Mobile (2FA) app had its own notification sound. In the Pixel 4, I don't seem to be able to access this sound anymore. Duo Mobile uses the Default Notification tone instead. \n\nGoing into the app's settings to notifications just takes me to the system's settings screen, and the Duo Mobile sound isn't listed in any of the categories, and tapping on the \"+\" doesn't give access to it either.\n\nAny help or hints would be much appreciated.",
