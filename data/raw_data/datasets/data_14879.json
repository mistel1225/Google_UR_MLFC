    "content": "My Pixel 3a stopped recognizing my SIM. Went through google for replacement and I got sent back a defective... i repeat... defective device. I couldnt even set it up due to the touch screen not working.. its been 3 weeks now with out my phone. I would just like a working phone. Why is it taking so long to send me info on another replacement? Why did I even get a defective device as my replacement in the first place? This is very frustrating.",
