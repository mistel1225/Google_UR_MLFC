    "content": "Pixel 4A has a descent battery for a moderate, hence we waited for 4A 5G to be launched in India. Now Pixel has already delayed it so much that, Pixel should launch Pixel 5A in India as after a period of time 4A 5G and 5 specs are looking to be boring. Very bad strategy by Google towards Indian market. I myself waited for 4a 5G to be launched in 2020 so that I can purchase it. But now the specs of phone have become old and I might not prefer to buy 2020 Specs in 2021",
