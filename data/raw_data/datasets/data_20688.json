    "content": "For about a week now, my phone will have a full charge at the beginning of the day and drain at a normal rate. However right around 50%, no matter what I am doing I will all of sudden see the battery life drop to less than 10% and if I catch it in time and close all apps it will stop around 5% but if I don't it will die. Then when I plug my phone in its at 0%. Once it comes back on I can charge it to less than 50% and not have the problem for the rest of the day but the next day after a full charge it will happen again. I don't know what is causing the problem because I have rebooted the phone several times and got the most recent update earlier this week. I deleted an app I had just downloaded thinking it might be the problem but it didn't fix the problem. Is this something I can fix or do I need a new battery in the phone?",
