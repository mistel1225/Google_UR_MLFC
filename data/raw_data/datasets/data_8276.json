    "content": "I recently received the new Pixel Buds as a gift in Canada. Now, I'm in Germany, and am having several issues with them. \n\n1. Connectivity. If my phone is in my pocket, often times the earbuds will disconnect. Even worse is when only one of them disconnects.\n\n2. Hissing. If I'm listening to something quiet (a YouTube video at a low volume for example), I can hear a distinct audio hiss in the background of the buds. \n\nAny help with these issues?",
