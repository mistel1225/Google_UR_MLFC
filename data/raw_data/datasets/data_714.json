    "content": "So essentially whenever I try to connect to my guest network, it gives me this message, and will not allow me to sign into it with my password. I've tried every conceivable solution thus far: airplane mode and restart, restarting, clearing cache, reloaded WI-FI addresses, restarted the router, etc. It's not a problem with the WI-FI because it works with everything else in the house. Thank you very much!",
