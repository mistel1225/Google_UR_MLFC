    "content": "I'm hoping to find a fix before having to just buy a new phone, but here we go. \n\nLast week my phone gave me the no sim/no service problem, despite having 1) having a sim card and 2) knowing I was not in a dead spot (my mother was in the car with me, same phone, same provider no problems). This happened 3 days in a row and I ended up buying a new sim card, which fixed the problem for about 6 days. I am now on hour 6 of not being able to get my phone to have any connection. I'm able to be on wifi but I cannot receive texts or calls. I've restarted it. I've turned it on airplane mode, I've tried to boot to safe mode, I've taken the new sim out, I've reset my network settings. I've tried to  change my prefered network type (it seems to be stuck on global. I don't know if this is correct or not, but I can't change it even just to try). \n\nI've been told I can call my carrier to see if they can reset the antenna. Does anyone have any other ideas? Or is this phone a lost cause now?",
