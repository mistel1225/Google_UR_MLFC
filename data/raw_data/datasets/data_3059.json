    "content": "I have a google pixel 3 XL that I'm still making payments on and one day it shut off and it will not turn on anymore,I didn't drop it in water or drop it at all it's in pristine condition, no trauma happened to it . Just won't come on. I have taken it to many cell phone repair stores but the last one just called and said that they can not fix it that it's bord level and unrepairable. What do I do, or what can be done.",
