    "content": "My chromecast volume has priority over my device volume when hitting volume rockers. This is abnormal considering I'm not connected to a chromecast, also not on wifi. It causes some issue when attempting to control volume where the chrome cast has to be adjusted first. Any advice would be appreciated, as this is incredibly bothersome. Screen capture attached. ",
