    "content": "Hey everyone, I am 2 days into my purchase of a new pixel 4 XL, coming from an iPhone XR. I have downloaded about 6 gb of music in spotify, have a few of my credit card provider apps and some other necessities, and have enrolled in Google 1 for storage of my photos. The sodtware is about 10 gb itself. I decided to get 64 gb version, and total I am at 52 percent of that. Would you guys stay with this 64 gb version or do you think that after use for a year or two would fill up the phone? I have cut down quite a lot on my music that is offline available in anticipation of this. I have 15 gb data plan, so I have some room to stream music but it's not unlimited. Just wanted to see what others who are experienced with Pixel/Android would think. Thanks ðŸ˜Š",
