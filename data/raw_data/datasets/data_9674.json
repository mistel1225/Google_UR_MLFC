    "content": "I got my pixel 4a last week and I've noticed that it sometimes won't light up when I get a phone call (I have it set to do not disturb, but with calls from contacts allowed). I've tried clearing the phone's storage, resetting app preferences, rebooting into safe mode, and none of that has worked (at first it seems like it did work, but then a few hours later or the next day the screen still sometimes won't light up). I don't believe a factory reset will work since this phone is new and the issue seems to have persisted since I got the phone. I don't think the issue occurs when I turn off do not disturb, but I would like to have the phone consistently light up for calls from contacts when do not disturb is on.",
