    "title": "Pixel 3 crashes when connecting to WiFi network",
    "content": "When I type in a WiFi network password and click \"connect\", the phone loses power (goes directly to black without the usual shutdown screen during restarts) and then restarts. This is true for multiple networks and whether or not the password is correct.\n\nThis started after upgrading to the lastest version of Android 10 on February 5, 2020.",
