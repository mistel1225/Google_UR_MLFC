    "content": "I recently got a new Pixel 3.  Quite often when I am on a call,the person on the other end can only hear my voice intermittently.  Some calls have no issues, while other conversations are useless because they cannot make out what I am saying at all.  It is not a network or coverage issue.  I have also disabled the advanced LTE features.   Any other suggestions before I send this back.",
