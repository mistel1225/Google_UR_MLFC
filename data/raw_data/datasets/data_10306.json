    "content": "When connecting my Xbox One Bluetooth control on my Google Pixel 2 android phone only half of the inputs seem to work. Everything works except the analog sticks, d-pad and triggers. This is new problem as everything was working properly a few days ago. I've already reset the controller back to factory settings along with my android device. Nothing seems to resolve this issue. The controller works perfectly on other devices.",
