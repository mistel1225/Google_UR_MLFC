    "content": "Hello\n\nHope someone can help here. \n\nMy Wife & I both have the Pixel 3 phone and are both experiencing issues with the back camera.\n\nHer phone whilst recording goes all shaky as if she was in an Earthquake even with the steady function switched on.  It's also trying to continuously auto focus all the time and looks terrible on playback.\n\nWith my phone it cannot take still pictures properly.  Video recording is ok and taking pictures whilst in video mode is ok but going into camera mode and taking still pictures is a nightmare. My screen goes all fuzzy as if you were trying to record a video via a television or VDU screen, you get those fuzzy lines that go across. \n\nI've done safe mode and factory resets on both phones and still no joy\n\nDoes anyone else have any other clues what it could be?",
