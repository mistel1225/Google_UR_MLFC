    "content": "Dropped my phone in water. I then put it in rice, took off case and screen protector. Everything seemed fine apart from crack in protector.\n\nNow the top part of the screen doesn't react at all, in apps the phone does random things and the o, p and backspace keys need a lot of extra encouragement. I've restarted the phone a few times -- no effect.\n\nThink there is something wrong with the screen (a true detective, me).\n\nWhat should I do?\n\nThank you!",
