    "content": "I purchased a new pixel 3 from google play store. It arrived about a week ago and there is a small green circle on the bottom right of the phone, near the menu buttons. The phone is obviously defective.\n\nI've looked at exchanging the phone through google's warranty, but I don't feel like I want to do this. I would hate for a refurbished pixel 3 to be sent to me considering I received a defective one to begin with. I also don't want the pixel 3 to be fixed, this also seems odd considering I didn't hurt the phone.\n\nI'm not sure how to proceed. I've created 3 \"callback requests\" through the \"tips and tricks\" menu on the phone and haven't been contacted at all. I'm starting to get pretty frustrated at how bad this customer service is.\n\nDoes anyone have any advice for me?",
