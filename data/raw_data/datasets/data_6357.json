    "content": "So, When I'm done listening to my streaming music on my phone whether its Pandora or YouTube Music, as a rule of thumb, should I be force closing my music app in the background so that the music app doesn't use more background batter than it should, or should I just leave my music paused? Within Android 11, it's still a bit confusing to me.. I'm asking because of course without listening to ANY streaming music on my phone, my Google Play services battery usage is lower, when I stream music it goes higher of course. However, should I be \"Force Stopping\" my streaming music app from from working, and swiping it out of my RAM though? Thank you for any help! I appreciate it!",
