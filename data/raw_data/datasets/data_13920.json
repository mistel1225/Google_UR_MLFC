    "content": "I have tried all the listed remedies that Google has suggested: putting phone in safe mode does not work. Restarting phone does not work. Deleting cashe does not work. I have no nomedia files. The photos will not capture and I get a notice of HDR + trying to complete. But it never finishes. I think the updates would be great if they worked. I have evieved no reply from google if I fix is coming. I have also tried uninstalling the update on the camera. Then reinstalling it. Still no luck. Thanks for any advice you can give",
