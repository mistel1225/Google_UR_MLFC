    "content": "i have tried a factory reset and charged it ! it went up till 95% but still gets stuck at that point, never reaches a 100, after 2 more charges now it caps off at 87% , sometimes even at 78%. since it kept fluctuating, i tried calibrating the battery by completely draining it 0 and plugged in the charger while the phone was off! it charged till 75% in 90 minutes but again it capped off at 90% even after i kept it plugged in for another 3 hours! please help, disappointed to see a brand new phone have battery issues!",
