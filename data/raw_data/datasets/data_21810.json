    "content": "I have received my Pixel 4 two months ago. Yesterday, when I tried to take a photo with the 2x telephoto lens, it was completely black. The main camera still works, but the telephoto is completely black. I have tried to clean the lenses, update software, restart Android, and I've also tried to restart the entire phone. What should I do? Plus, when I try digital zoom, the phone crashes.",
