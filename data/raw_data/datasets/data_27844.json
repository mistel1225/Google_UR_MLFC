    "content": "After updating Android 10, the phone UI has kind of gone haywire. Very often when I swap between application or even while performing general operations, the screen blinks continuosly as if the screen was about to go dark and never come back alive.\n\nThis happens very often especially while using new navigation gestures and also when notifications are present in the lock screen.\n\nDid I find a bug or is it my phone because the phone is fairly new?",
