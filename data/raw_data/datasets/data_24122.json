    "content": "My Bluetooth keeps cutting out/dropping out when I put my pixel 3xl in my pocket. It seems to happen when I go for walks in an outdoor scenario and I have the phone connected with earbuds or headphones. I have tried a numerous amount of headphones such as Sony's wh1000xm3 and Sennheiser PXC550 along with some earbuds such as JBL's endurance peak and JBLs Free x. It seems to be a lot worse with the true wireless earbuds. I have tried to impair, repair the devices. Also tried rebooting my phone and the devices and I have tried resetting the Bluetooth settings. Also my phone is up to date with the software but nothing seems to be fixing it. I was just wondering if anyone else is experiencing this issue and if there has been a fix? If not, it would be good to hear other people's experiences so perhaps google will act upon this frustrating issue.",
