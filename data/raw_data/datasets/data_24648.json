    "content": "On my pixel 3a I am having an issue when recording video that you can hear a beeping noise in the background. It does not matter which apps records the video- Can be the google camera app, facebook camera, snapchat, they all have same beeping issue.\n\nThe steps I took to troubleshoot so far- \n1.) Took off the phone case tested and still having issue.  \n2.) I rebooted the phone into safe mode tested and still having issue. \n3.) Factory reset the phone. Tested and still having issue. \n4.) Went back into safe mode from fresh factory reset tested and still having issue. \n\nHere's a video of the sound: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vf7t9qC0Ypg Listen carefully and you can hear it (it seems to be coming across on the left audio channel).\n\nAt this point kind of thinking something is wrong with the phone. Do you have any other things I could try?",
