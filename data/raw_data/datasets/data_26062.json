    "content": "Started my day listen to music via Spotify through my phone into a USB-C adapter, aux cord, and into my car. That lasted about a minute before abrubtly stopping and playing through my phone's speaker. I rebooted my phone, and it started working again for about 25 minutes before it cut out again. I have not been able to play music through an aux cord since that happened this morning. I have purchased a new aux cord and adapter/dongle, and tried every combination through my car with no luck. I also tried with my earbuds that plug directly into the usb-c with no luck. I have plugged in a charger to my phone and it does charge, so I don't think it is an issue with my phone's port. \n\nThe earbuds and the original dongle are certified Google products. The two aux cords and the newer usb-c are not, as none were available at the store. I am pretty sure I have narrowed it down to a problem on my phones software, but I do not know where to go from here. I have rebooted my phone over 5 times since the first issue both through the selection after holding the power button as well as holding the power and volume button together for 10 seconds. \n\nI am traveling 10+ hours the next 3 days, so the sooner I get a solution, the sooner I can get back to listening to music while driving.",
