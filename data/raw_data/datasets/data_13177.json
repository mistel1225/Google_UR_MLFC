    "content": "My car has only USB-A ports, What USB cable to be used to connect my Pixel 4a into car to be able to use Android Auto? In the box I find USB-C to USB-C cable only\nIf I wish to buy a Google USB-C to USB-A cable here in India, there is no stock in play store. I find it amusing when google is selling a product, it doesn't sell the authentic accessories. Does it mean that I can use any brand USB-C to USB-A cable ? If any particular brand/specs to be followed let us know.",
