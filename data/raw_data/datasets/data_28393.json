    "title": "Pixel XL3 won’t boot since installing the new Android 10 OS",
    "content": "Ever since installing the Android 10 operating system my phone won’t turn on. I did accidentally discover that by holding the on/off button and the volume button for 20-30 seconds, a screen appears with a Android  bot and the notation « no commands ». You can’t do anything from that screen but if you wait long enough the phone will finally turn on and seems to work fine after that. It’s annoying and shouldn’t be happening at all",
