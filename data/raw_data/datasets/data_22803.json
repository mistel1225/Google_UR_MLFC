    "content": "I bought a Pixel 3 and a Pixel Stand at launch and they worked well until recently. I started noticing my phone was off in the morning after sitting on the charger overnight. I started watching it and I believe it would turn off between 70%-80%. I started charging via cable and the same thing happened. Google Support stated my warranty was expired and referred me to ubreakifix. They swapped the battery and told me it was swollen and the phone worked fine for a while and now it's it happening again. I did a full factory reset and the phone kept powering down while trying to complete setup. I'm out of ideas at this point, has anyone experienced this? I'm not even sure how to pull the logs if they're wiped when it powers on. Any help would be greatly appreciated.",
