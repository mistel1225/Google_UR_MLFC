    "content": "Two days ago my son's phone (Google Pixel 3a) stopped connecting to wifi; a few hours later we realized it was getting no service at all, and the settings app kept freezing up and crashing. I called T-Mobile who decided it may be a sim card issue; I went to the T-mobile store today. They replaced the sim card and are showing no issues on their end, but the phone still has no service. I've tried resetting \"wifi, mobile, & bluetooth,\" but that did not help. I've already uninstalled all downloaded apps. I'm unable to do a factory reset on the phone because I'd have to approve it through our family link account; however, apparently this will not work because the phone will not connect to wifi. Kind of out of ideas for what to try next. Any thoughts?",
