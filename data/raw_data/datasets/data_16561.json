    "content": "When I used the new select feature in the recent apps screen to select cyrillic (Russian) text (which the select tool recognizes and highlights) I noticed that android 11 uses english letters when the selection is copied to the clipboard.\n\nIs there a setting that will make the new select feature recognize cyrillic (or any other language other than english)?\n\nIf not then I'd assume this is a defect because selecting text via the keyboard works with any language I throw at it.",
