    "content": "I purchased a Pixel 3a about a month ago and about two weeks ago something happened that is now causing my Settings app to crash when I try to open it.  I don't know what could have caused the sudden issue - maybe an App I downloaded, maybe a firmware update.  Whatever the reason, it crashes when I try to open it.\n\nUnfortunately, almost every single solution I've found online requires you \"Open your Settings app\" which is, of course, the issue here.  I can't do that.\n\nI've attempted restarting my phone normally, restarting it in safe mode, making sure my phone is plugged in, making sure I'm not on WiFi (apparently sometimes that works).  Everything short of a factory reset (which comically enough most guides navigate you to your Settings app to do) which I'll do only as a very last resort.  \n\nAll of that said, is there anything else I can do to fix this?",
