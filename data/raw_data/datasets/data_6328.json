    "content": "When a phone call comes in, it leaves a colored disk on the desktop. It contains the initial of the person that just called. It is the same colored disk in my phone contacts list.\n\nI know I can slide it down to make it go away. \n\nHow do I make it not show up at all? I really dislike that extra step required to eliminate it. I don't know, but it seems unnecessary to require an action once the call has ended.",
