    "content": "My Pixel type C earbuds are not working anymore in Pixel 2. It recognise the device but sound doesn't come up and the volume up down is also not working though the earbuds are connected to the phone.\nI have tested this with another phone as well it shows an earphone is connected, but sound and volume up down functions are not working.\n\nI think something is wrong with my earbuds. I bought this in last February.\n\nCan someone help me with this please?",
