    "content": "Just got a new Pixel3.  I can not use my bluetooth headset unless I am in a quiet room.   I am 46, so my hearing is not perfect, but I have been using bluetooth headsets for years, including my last phone.  i can not answer calls around traffic, crouds of people, Tvs, cant even use it driving over the road noise.  I desperatly need to find a way to increase the volume output.  To compare, My last phone I ran about 60% volume, the pixel3 is at max volume and not even half as loud.",
