    "content": "Are you f'ing serious? Sometimes I think Google tries to be too progressive. I just bought a Pixel 3 about a week or two ago and for the most part I was pretty happy about it. That is until I needed to connect the phone to my PC and realized I couldn't do it. My PC only has USB 3.0 ports, and honestly, I didn't even know there was a new USB format out until this happened. The phone comes with a USB C to USB A female adapter but no male adapter. Why? Then I look at the Google store and the cable is $20!?!

I hate Samsung, Apple too, but my next phone definitely will not be a Pixel, or any other Google phone. At least if I had gotten an iPhone or Galaxy I know I could've connected the phone to my freaking PC without having to drop an additional $20 on an $800 phone...",
