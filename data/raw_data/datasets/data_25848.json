    "content": "Hey hey!\nSo just after the official Android 10 release a few weeks/months ago I wasn't able to unlock my phone with Pixel Imprint. Also other apps which can be unlocked with fingerprints (like WhatsApp, bank apps...) can't be unlocked. This happens after switching users (I have 2 on my phone). A restart fixes it but it will reappear after switching users. Also the swipe for notification function always works. Seems to be a software error but I don't know what to do.\n\nOli~",
