    "content": "Hi all,\nIs it possible to change the default mode that the stock camera launches in from stills-camera to video?\n\nI want to launch the camera with a double-tap on the lock button and have it fires up straight into video mode. Currently it always starts in stills mode.\n\nI know it is a simple swipe to move between the two modes but 90% of the time I want video rather than stills so it would make sense to me to swap the default setting, especially as I often film from my bike so need quick access with the least fiddling around.\n\nThis is my first Pixel so apologies if I'm missing something simple. I came from Samsung where I was able to do this and so just assumed I would be in there somewhere.\n\nThanks for any advice you can offer",
