    "title": "Pixel 3a becomes unresponsive when plugged in, and usb-c cable only charges one way.",
    "content": "The first issue that I noticed was I would plug my phone in before bed, and when I would wake up the phone would be unresponsive. Neither the power button or the fingerprint scanner would not wake the phone. Once the phone was unplugged it would become responsive again, but would be uncharged, and the clock would be about an hour and change behind. Restarting the phone would set the clock back to the correct time. This all has happened 2 or 3 times over the last couple weeks. Then today I noticed that the usb-cable was only charging one way around and not the other. I'm not sure if the two are related, but considering that the phone's battery was still drained when I found it unresponsive it seemed like they might be. I've only had this phone about 3 months. There's no obvious damage to the cable or the port, and both appear to be clean.",
