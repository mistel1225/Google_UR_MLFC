    "content": "See pic. Can't read app names after clicking Search Bar on home screen. Also, see time/notification bar also black on black up top. Sometimes search results are also black on black (although not in this screenshot). Started since Google App went dark theme a few weeks ago; it's been updated since, but no fix. Everything up to date on my phone. On Android P, not on Q beta. Dark theme turned on in system settings.",
