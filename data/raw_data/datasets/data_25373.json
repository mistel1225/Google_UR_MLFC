    "title": "Pixel 3 phone mysteriously & suddenly dead. Does not charge, doesn't power on.",
    "content": "My 9 month old Pixel 3 suddenly stopped working. It had neither been dropped nor was it exposed to moisture. No physical damage of any kind on it. Battery charge was last somewhere between 60% - 50%. I used the phone for a call then about 10 minutes after my conversation ended, while the phone was sitting idle on my desk, the screen went black. I plugged in the charger (original Google) but it had no effect. With the assistance of Google support, I went through the 30 second power button hold and the power - volume down hold; still nothing. Ultimately an RMA had to be created for a warranty replacement. The person I spoke with at Google support (Mara) was great. She was understanding and helpful.\n\nMy concerns are with the overall Google warranty process:\n1) Why is it going to take 5 days for my replacement phone to arrive?\n(RMA created on 12/12, phone shipped on 12/13, FedEx shows it will arrive by end of day on 12/17)\n2) The replacement phone is a refurbished item, yet the hold Google placed on my credit card is the full retail price for a new phone.\n3) Is this a lesson learned for customers not to deal with a 100% online retailer? In this day and age I would expect that a warranty replacement cell phone should be shipped such that it arrives next day or at worst two days after the RMA is created, not 5-days after.",
