    "content": "Sometimes when I swipe up from the bottom of the homepage to open the app drawer, a round blue button appears that looks like it is pulling apps up behind it. When I release my finger the blue button disappears with the apps behind it, going back to the home screen. So I don't know what it is for or even how I found it, because I'm not sure of the particular swipe I used to get it. Anyone else seen this? Thanks!",
