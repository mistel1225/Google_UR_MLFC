    "content": "I turned my phone off to install a system update. Turned it back on and discovered I don't have mobile data, can't send or receive SMS, can't use the phone (I get a popup telling me to turn off airplane mode even though it's not turned on). WiFi works fine.\nI tried to restart, checked my network settings (turned on data roaming, checked APN but found only one available, tried switching to 2G and 3G then back to 4G), reboot in safe mode, performed a factory reset...Still no luck.\n\nCan anyone offer any suggestions? THanks!",
