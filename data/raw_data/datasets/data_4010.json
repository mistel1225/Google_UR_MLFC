    "title": "Google Messages App sending mass texts instead of MMS to group chats all of a sudden",
    "content": "Randomly today any time I send out a message in a group chat with one or more iPhone recipes, they get my replies as individual texts, and not as MMS (not into the group chat on their end). I have made no changes whatsoever and have no idea how or why this is happening.\n\nYes: I have the setting in the Google Messages App under Advanced set to \"Send as MMS\" and not set to \"Send as mass text\". That is clearly not the culprit or I wouldn't be posting here.\n\nI've already tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app, didn't help.\n\nI will also note that another friend of mine, also with a Pixel, also on Google Fi (like I am) is experiencing the same issue.",
