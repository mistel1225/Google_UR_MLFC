    "content": "The Google Assistant on my Pixel 4 cannot understand me well unless I'm offline. When I turn off my wifi and mobile data the assistant is blazing fast and understands me at near 100% accuracy. However, as soon as I go back online its slow and understands me about 25% of the time.\n\nI'm guessing this is some bug related to using the new on-board assistant. Considering I'm always online the Google Assistant on my pixel 4 is nearly unusable.",
