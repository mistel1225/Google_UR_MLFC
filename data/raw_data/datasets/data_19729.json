    "content": "Pixel 3 XL randomly changes time and date mostly back in the year 2000. This happens several times a day... what I have noticed is the internet connection gets lost the same very moment when the change happens or vice-versa. Please help! Most of the app data show incorrect time, For ex. Yelp shows that my review was posted 20 years ago. I'm even scared to connect my smartwatch to this device coz of this issue.",
