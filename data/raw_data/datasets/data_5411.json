    "content": "After installing the March 2021 security update, my Pixel 4XL rebooted itself, booted, and prompted for the password to unlock itself.  After entering the password, the phone froze, then the display turned off after approximately 15-30 seconds.  After powering the phone off, the phone gets to the OS loading screen and has been sitting there for approximately an hour.\n\nI assume I'm just screwed and will need to wipe the phone at this point?",
