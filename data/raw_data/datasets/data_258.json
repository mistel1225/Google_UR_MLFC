    "content": "The top right of screen which normally functions all of the time won't respond to anything while my phone is vertical and using an app. It works fine on the home screen. I can't search YouTube or tweet without turning my screen horizontally, for example. Sometimes this glitch prevents me from pulling down the quick settings bar at all when using an app. It's very frustrating.",
