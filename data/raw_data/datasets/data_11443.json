    "content": "Hello all.\n  I bought a Pixel Phone last year in the US (unlocked version) during the summer and when i got back to my country (Colombia) decided to use it here and when I am on the internet everything is perfect, it connects to LTE networks and let me browse on it at high speed. The problem comes when I want to make a call, the phone changes automatically from LTE network to HSPA+ network (sometimes only HSPA) and the call is not over LTE. In my local carrier I have voice over LTE (VoLTE) but since I am not able to enable it by calling *#*#4636#*#* and go to the \"Phone information\" tab I am not able to turn it on by myself. My question is, Should Google enable it in order to make this work or this is something to do with my carrier? \n  To be clear, when I was in the US, I used Google Fi and had VoLTE calls (it showed the HD message) and also Calls over Wi-Fi and many more features and in my country I can't have VoLTE.\n  I will post a link to the screenshot to show you what I am talking about.\n  https://photos.app.goo.gl/wj1RtCkpbtktooR89\n  Thank you so much for your help.",
