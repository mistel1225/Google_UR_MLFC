    "title": "My Pixel 3a will no longer accept my correct Pin. Remotely erasing phone doesn't fix",
    "content": "My Google Pixel 3a has stopped accepting my PIN, which I've been using for months and know to be correct. Phone just tells me the Pin is incorrect and says to try again in 30 seconds. According to the Google support site, I should erase the phone remotely using the Android \"find my phone\" site and then set up the device from scratch. However,  I have clicked the \"erase phone\" button for my device on the Android website and  I still can't access my phone as it won't accept the PIN. I've switched it off and back on and the problem persists. This is a major inconvenience as I work from home and now can't be contacted. Google support suggests a manual factory reset as a 2nd option but doesn't provide instructions on how to do this. Any help would be greatly appreciated",
