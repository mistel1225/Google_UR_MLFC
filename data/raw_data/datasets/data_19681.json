    "content": "While playing COD or Pubg in my Pixel 2xl, my teammates can hear lot of background noises like running fan, tapping screen and other irritating sound for them. Basically my phones mic it's not applying any filter or noise reduction. I have also tried third party voice recording app and seems the problem is with my mic only but while recording videos from stock camera app there's no issue with that, noices are reduced. I'm hoping for the solution from any google support.",
