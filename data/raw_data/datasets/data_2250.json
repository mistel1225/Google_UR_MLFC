    "content": "Hi all,\nI'm debating between buying the 4a or the 4a 5g.\nI've noticed some difference between the way photos and videos look on the 4a compared to the 4a 5g, when watching a couple of YouTube comparison videos. It seems that the 5g has more saturated (over saturated?) colours (especially in video mode), slightly less detail perhaps, better skin tones and a less washed out look, but maybe less good night shots? The cameras are the same so must be the software. These are just my observations from literally two comparison videos, and so I'd be really keen to get feedback from anyone with experience of both phones!\nCheers, \nAlex",
