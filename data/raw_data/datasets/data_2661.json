    "content": "I recently purchased a Google Pixel 5, and purchased a USB-C to 3.5mm aux cable to play music from my phone through my car speakers. When I plug in the aux cord to the car it makes a static noise so it seems as though it will work but when I try to play music no sound comes out of either the phone or the car speakers. I have tried another vehicle, and other aux cords, and none of these have worked.",
