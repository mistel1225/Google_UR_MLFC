    "content": "My car only has aux input. Originally, phone call audio would play through the car speaker via the aux cable connection but in recent weeks this function has stopped. All other audio still plays as usual. I have tried switching aux cables without success. I haven't been able to find any settings that would have changed to cause this.",
