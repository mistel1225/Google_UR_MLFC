    "content": "In June, I returned my faulty Pixel 4XL and was provided with a factory refurbished model as replacement, under warranty. \n\nThe replacement now has a swollen battery and the back case is bulging as a result. I am concerned that this is a safety risk, and also that the phone keeps shutting down without warning and the battery draining. \n\nHow do i rectify this ASAP?",
