    "content": "Whatsapp application freezes or won't respond properly during whatsapp video call.\nI'm able to use other apps other than whatsapp when I'm on video call.\nWhatsapp functions properly when not in video call but during video call the application doesn't want to respond, can't interact with the application.\nI've tried clearing the cache, data, uninstalled and reinstalled and even did a factory reset but nothing seems to work.\nI don't know what the problem is.\nIs this a whatsapp defect or Android 10?\nI think it's not whatsapp because other manufacturers are not facing this issue.\nIn my opinion its a software issue.\nPlease Google, solve this.\nI've been facing this issue for a long time now.\nThis is seriously very sad.\nHope this issue gets resolved fast.",
