    "content": "My Pixel XL changed a US phone number to an international phone number.  This has only happened to one recipient.  I can call the person, but can not text. In the details it shows correct number, but with an international code.  The number is correct in contacts.  They have told me it is a third party problem.  No one seems to be able to fix it.  Help!!!",
