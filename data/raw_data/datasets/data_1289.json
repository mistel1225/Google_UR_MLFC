    "content": "Some apps have started crashing today on my device. The first one was Fitbit, then Candy Crush now I'm starting to have problems with another one. They close a few seconds after I've open them and some time later I get the alert with the  error message \"App not responding\".\n\nI already had this problem a few days ago and I did a Factory reset, after that the phone seemed to work fine.\nNow the problems are starting again.",
