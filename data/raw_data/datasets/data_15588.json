    "content": "The device can only be charged when it is turned off.\nI tried safe mode, hard reboot and factory reset. I even tried cleaning the USB port.\nOddly enough, it still works with headphones.\nI tried to contact Google for warranty claim but ended in a loop redirecting me to the help center main page...\nDo they still have a support team for their products?",
