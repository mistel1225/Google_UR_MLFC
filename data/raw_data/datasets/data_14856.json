    "content": "I own lot of Google Products like Pixel Phone, Pixel Buds etc. I interact with the support team occasionally. Recently I had a weird experience with support team which I don't want to get into in detail in public forum. I would like to report the behavior of support personal as suspicious activity. Is there a way I can report it?",
