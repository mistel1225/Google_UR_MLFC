    "content": "ALthought there is a Reditt Community for discussing Android Q Beta, I think its rediculous that we need to create an account on some random site that is disjointed and difficult to use. Therefore I am taking it upon myself to start a thread here for discussing Android Q issues.\n\nI will start with the only issue I seem to be having is constantly losing connection to bluetooth with my Fitbit. I need to reboot the phone to get it working again.\n\nThis has been reported to FitBit and in the Android Beta Bug Tracker which can be found here. https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/128656648",
