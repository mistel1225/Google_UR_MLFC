    "content": "My phone was suddenly failure to charge.\nI keep my phone with USB connection but no matter how long I charge it, the battery level still does raise. In the setting menu, it showed me that my phone is plugged but not able to charge right now. Could you tell me how to do? I am looking forward to your reply.",
