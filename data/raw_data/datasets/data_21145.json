    "content": "I've got a problem on the screen - usually happens when I'm watching netflix, but can happen after I've turned netflix off - common factor here is that it starts up when I'm watching netflix (but not every time) and continues afterwards. usually a restart will sort it out\n\nBasically, I will get a band of white/interference scroll up the screen. it's not a regular thing like every X seconds, it is seemingly random. \n\nCan't find anything similar on here. any ideas? screen works fine otherwise, all touch functionality etc. is fine.",
