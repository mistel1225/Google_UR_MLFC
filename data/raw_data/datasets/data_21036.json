    "content": "I dropped my 3a a couple times throughout the past month. I have a moderately protective case and a screen cover that cracked when I dropped it both times. After these drops, I noticed a new black speck in my camera view when taking a picture and video in every app I could test it in. It seems to be hardware damage. When I zoom in, the speck becomes bigger and it looks like either a grain of dirt or a very tiny fracture without any cracks around it. I really just want to send it in for repair or replacement but google wants me to post this on a forum.",
