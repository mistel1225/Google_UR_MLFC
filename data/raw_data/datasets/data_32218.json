    "content": "When the offline voice recognition came out, it would no longer mutes any audio that was playing through the phone when you used it. When you use the regular voice recognition, you hear the beeps and the audio that's playing the mutes.  Now with the offline voice recognition, when you push the microphone icon, it doesn't beep or mute the audio that's playing. So sometimes it will actually pick up the audio that is playing as the speech that you're trying to give it.  Clearly this can be frustrating. There doesn't appear to be any way to fix it, other than disabling it. Can anyone else verify this change? The offline voice recognition is really good oh, it's a shame they didn't account for this.",
