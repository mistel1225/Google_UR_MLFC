    "content": "I have had no problems with my phone until today. I was making a few videos with my phone and suddenly the camera app started crashing.  I tried to shut the phone down, but it wouldn't respond. When I hold down the power button for a long time, the screen goes black, but only for about 10 seconds. Then the phone automatically reboots, but not all the way.  It is just spinning in the start up screen.\n\nMore important than the phone is the last videos I took with it, which I am desperate to retrieve.  I checked Google photos on my computer and it stopped backing stuff up a few days ago.  How can I retrieve media that I know is on my phone if it won't start up.\n\nAlso, should I go back to iPhone?  This piece of shit is really pissing me off right now!",
