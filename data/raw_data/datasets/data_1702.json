    "content": "I was editing a note on Google Keep via my phone, when the phone glitched and went back to the home screen. I tapped the Keep Notes app again, and all my notes and labels were gone! I checked Deleted Notes, and they weren't there. I checked Archive, and they weren't there either. Is there a way I can get those notes back?\n\nAlso, I use the first Google Pixel XL.",
