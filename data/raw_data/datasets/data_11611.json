    "content": "Ever since android 11 issues with audio stuttering/cutting out and bluetooth disconnecting. \n\nI created a post here before and there was only one non-response from google, yet people continue to comment that they are having the same issue:\nhttps://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/71484847?hl=en\n\nThere was also a related bug created for this issue and again only one non-response from google. To this day people are still having the same issue and none of the monthly updates have fixed it. No one is even assigned to this bug. Bug can be found here:\nhttps://issuetracker.google.com/issues/168233990\n\nThis has been the most frustrating customer service issue I've ever encountered with any company and I'm considering leaving android for good. Not being able to listen to audio on a phone in 2020 is absolutely ridiculous\n\nPlease please please look into this and actually respond",
