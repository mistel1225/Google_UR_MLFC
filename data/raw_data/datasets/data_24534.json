    "content": "Hello everybody,\nwhen first charging my Pixel 3a after the battery hit 10% I noticed the \"Rapidly charging...\" meassage.\nI used the adapter sent together with the product to do so. Because I have frequently read that faster charging is associated with a shorter battery lifetime, I'd like to disable it. Searching the web, there seems to be an option for Samsung phones but not for Pixel phones.\nIs there any option to disable it, which I have overseen?\nIf there is none: Do you recommend a specific adapter to use for normal charging?\n\nGreets",
