    "content": "My camera is slow to start, when I double-tap power the viewfinder just shows black (and the shutter button etc, but no image from the lens) for about 4 seconds. I've cleared the app cache and that helped some but it's still about 2 seconds of black before I can take a photo, which can seem like a really time if you're trying to quickly take a photo (and I'm usually trying to take photos of my toddler so need to be quick!) Also, this only seems to help for a few hours before the issue returns.\nMy phone is fully up to date",
