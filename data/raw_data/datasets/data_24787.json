    "title": "Pixel trapped on bootloop",
    "content": "After updating my device to Android 10, my device automatically tries to restart and eventually gets trapped on bootloop. It neither restarts or even starts! Furthermore, battery draining real fast. Also, phone is getting hot after using for only 20-30mins. And when the bootloop problem appears the phone keeps getting hot. When I try manual boot option to power it off, it goes power off. But, when I again turn it on, it shows inappropriate date and time. This happened with me before as well but happened 4 times today after updating to Android 10. Idk what's the issue.",
