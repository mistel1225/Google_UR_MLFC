    "content": "Around spring 2020 Bluetooth stopped working for all of my devices beyond two feet away. So that includes earbuds Bluetooth speakers, amps, and cars. I reset communication settings and added one Bluetooth connection at a time, and one Wi-Fi connection at a time. But I can't solve it, any help would be appreciated.",
