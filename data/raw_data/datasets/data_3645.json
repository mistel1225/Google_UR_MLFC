    "title": "Pixel 5's Vibration got a lot weaker since March update",
    "content": "The Vibration and haptic feedback has been a lot weaker since the March update.\nI noticed it because of missed calls and no more vibration on notifications. Also the haptic feedback when typing got a lot weaker. I had someone call me to confirm the problem and I noticed the Vibration is almost non existent. Before, everything worked just fine.\nI haven't made any changes, tried rebooting multiple times. Nothing works.",
