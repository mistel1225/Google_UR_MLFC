    "title": "Microphone and speaker issue, but unable to get help from Google support",
    "content": "Recently my Pixel XL microphone and speaker have stopped working, a normal issue with this generation of Pixels caused by a manufacturing fault. Since I bought my phone second hand, I cannot fix the issue via the Google Store order section. Therefore I have had to contact Google in the stanard ways. Unfortunately the only available means of contacting Google for me is through phone. This could be because of Country specific restrictions or other regional causes, but no big deal right? Well I have tried sending call requests through the Support application on my phone, but i never get a call back. Can someone please help me as a phone with no working speakers or microphone, is a pretty bad experience.",
