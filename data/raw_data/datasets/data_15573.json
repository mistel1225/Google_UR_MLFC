    "content": "I cannot transfer photos or videos from my Pixel 3XL to my windows 10 PC(desktop).  The option on my phone is not there when connected by USB-C to PC at the bottom of the swipe down page.  It was there, and now its not.  How do I get the Android file transfer option back on the swipe down on my phone?  Im also in developers mode, and it still wont sync on the phone.  Also, the PC was updated to the latest Chrome version",
