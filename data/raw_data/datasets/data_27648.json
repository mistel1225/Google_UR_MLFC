    "content": "The Android OS volume controls are horribly broken. For the most part, I love stock Android.\n\nHowever, the decision, starting in Pie, to couple volume controls that should not be coupled, *and* give the user no option for more advanced control, is inexcusable for a brand that has a motto of \"Be together. Not the same.\"\n\nSpecifically: Notifications volume should be separate from Ringer volume, and System volume (taking pictures, etc.) should be separate from Ringer volume.\n\nThere are no excuses for this, and I will not be purchasing another stock Android phone if I am going to be shoehorned into crippled volume controls.\n\nI should not have to mute the Ringer, or anything else, to mute notifications, and the same for system sounds. Period. It is a terrible design decision not to give me that option somewhere.",
