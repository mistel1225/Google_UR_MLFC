    "content": "My Google Pixel 2xl screen stopped working while updating my apps. \nIt has been that way for two days now. My phone was working FINE until I started updating the apps.\nI have done all restarts, factory reset. I had to lose things because of this.\n\nI NEED HELP!\n\nI'm in Lagos Nigeria, there is no Google Pixel help centre in my country! I'm not sure I'm wrong for using a Pixel instead of other phones with help centres here. I'm not sure I'm wrong. Why would a screen freeze while updating apps and be the same for TWO DAYS now?",
