    "content": "In the Security settings, I'm getting a red icon for the Google Play system update. I got that once before, and after restarting my phone the icon turned back to green with the check mark. This time no such luck. Is there something screwed up in the Android system where I'm getting this?  Screen shot at https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PFKj7bzP4cfWHWpb-pIJAvW7Tx8Quw5W/view?usp=sharing\n\nI haven't seen the December security update yet, but I think that's separate (immediately above the Google Play system update). Google Fi for phone service. Checking both for updates says my phone is up to date, but the red icon remains",
