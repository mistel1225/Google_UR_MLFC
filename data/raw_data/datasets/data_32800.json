    "content": "When I go to send a messenge to someone, the text will take a while before saying that it hasn't sent. In reality, the other person actually recieved the text, and if I tap the try again option, it will send again, but continue to come up saying not sent. It also seems like others who try to send messenges to me have the same problem. This is on the default messenges app.",
