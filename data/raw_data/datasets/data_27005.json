    "title": "Recommended me a stock android phone with good support.",
    "content": "I am totally finished with Google and Pixel products.  I went through 3x pixel 2 devices with various hardware faults. I foolishly bought a pixel 3 hoping it would be better.  It was worse.  My first unit arrived with a faulty USB, and the retailer replaced it.  The replacement has a faulty camera after 6 months, the retailer (John Lewis) binned me off to Google.\n\nMy phone has been back with Google for 3 weeks so far, absolutely no communication as to what's happening.\n\nFor something that is supposed to be a premium product, the build quality is very poor, the QA is poor and the service (in the EU) REALLY REALLY bad.\n\nSo looking for recommendations.  Samsung is not a contender (hate their OS bloat and horrible policy of silently installing duplicate stuff I do t want or need), Huawei is a poor choice right now.  LG and Sony, will they even be making phones in a year?\n\nI am looking for something that comes with stock Android, but has good quality service and build quality.",
