    "content": "Since late October / mid November my Pixel 4 XL has been Draining battery much faster than usual. I have tried reseting the phone which didn't help. I sent the phone out for repairs and Google sent me a replacement phone but I still seem to have the same issue. The battery drain can be so bad that my phone will go from 60/70 when I sleep to 0 in the mornings. I have to keep my phone plugged in during the night else my alarm won't go off.\n\nWould I anyone have an idea of what's going on?\n\nI",
