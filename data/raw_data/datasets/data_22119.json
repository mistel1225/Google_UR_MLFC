    "content": "I have created couple of screen recordings here:\nhttps://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1hjZIwrXD9dBS0dWD1GzAK2VcqMV2BjR_?usp=sharing\n\nhere are the two videos:\n\nworking.mp4 - shows a heads up notification card from the screenshot app that lets a user know that the tap was registered on the action by greying it out\n\nnon_working.mp4 - shows a heads up notification from another app ( Okta verify ) which displays no UI feedback on a tap. I end up tapping the action area multiple times to see if the notification really worked or not.\n\n\nI reached out to the app maker via a play store review but was of no use.\nI kept telling them that there seems to be a difference in how the notification is handled but I dont have the right technical terms to get this through to their RnD.\n\n\nDoes anyone here see this problem with other apps on their pixel devices? ( i have checked the Outlook app and don't see it there)",
