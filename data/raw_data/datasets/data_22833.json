    "content": "Hi all, \nToday I noticed that many of my texts are not tied to a contact anymore, while some are still tied to a contact.  The ones that still do have a number associated with a contact are sync'd to my gmail account, while I guess the others (which were generally more recent and added to my phone) appear not to be in my gmail.  \n\nI think it had to do with yesterday trying to edit a contact and selecting a gmail account, now a good portion of the contacts have just completely disappeared.  It is quite annoying and I don't want to manually re-add them in by looking through my texts and then inferring which contact it is.  \n\nAny help would be appreciated.  This just seems so annoying, how can I add a contact to your phone and then have it completely disappear?",
