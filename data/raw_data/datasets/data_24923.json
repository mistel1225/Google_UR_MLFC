    "content": "Ever since I switched over to the Pixel 4 (from a Pixel 2), my phone is having issues making and receiving phone calls when connected to my 2017 Subaru Outback via Bluetooth. I have the latest OS on my phone. I have restarted my phone. I un-paired, and re-paired my Pixel 4 with my car. Nothing is working. It keeps telling me my phone is \"Out of cellular network range.\" I live in Ashburn, VA (near Washington, DC) so I know that's not true. I never had this issue with my Pixel 2 when connected to my Subaru's Bluetooth. In the meantime, I can't make or receive calls while driving my car. Does anyone know how to fix this issue?",
