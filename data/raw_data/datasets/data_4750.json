    "content": "Most of the apps crash on Pixel 5. When I open GMAIL for example. It appears to close but it's running in the background. Same behaviour for most of the apps. Native apps like messages, phone are working fine.\n\nI tried to clear cache, storage, restarted phone. Uninstalled and installed app. Checked permissions. \n\nNothing worked. My phone has 85 GB free storage.\n\nThe apps keep crashing. I have requested a call back from Google but no response :-(\n\nPlease help!",
