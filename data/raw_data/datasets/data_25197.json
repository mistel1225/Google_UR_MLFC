    "content": "Apps on my Pixel 2 have suddenly become unable to properly link to YouTube videos. On Twitter or Reddit, for instance, if a hyperlink for YouTube is clicked it will not direct to the correct content, but rather the YouTube home page. I cannot be sure whether or not it started with Android 10, but it's only been a few days now so there's a good chance.",
