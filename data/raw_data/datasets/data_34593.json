    "content": "Earlier today, my pixel xl screen was a bit raised up and I noticed that because the volume button was no longer working. I applied gentle pressure and it snapped back into place, but now my phone won't charge. It powers on but will not take a charge fron the old or a new cable I just bought. I tried using compressed air into the port to get out any debris. Any help would be greatly appreciated!",
