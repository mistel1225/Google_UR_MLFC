    "content": "This morning my pixel 3 was on a boot loop. Google logo on a white screen would apear and 2~3 seconds after screen go black and started again.\n\nSince power button won't shut down I try safe mode, power off and recovery, but the power option only would restart the loop. After some time trying I got to start the phone once (it was about 50% power), after restarting to check if it as all ok my phone would not even boot loop or go safe mode anymore.\n\nTried the original supply and cable and various cables and supplies with no sucess. The phone dont try to boot and if you try power buttom + volume down it wont respond. When connect to a computer or power supply it doesn't show the typical chaging % with a ring of white dots just quickly display a gray battery icon with a black lighting. \n\nIt is only 2 years old.",
