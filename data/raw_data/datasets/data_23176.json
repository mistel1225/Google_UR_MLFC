    "title": "Motion Sense works at first, but stops after a while",
    "content": "When I play a song on Spotify and have my phone locked, I can skip songs with Motion Sense just fine. However, after a few minutes of not using it, it just stops working. I wave and wave in every way imaginable way but it doesn't display the light at the top and doesn't work anymore. Only when I unlock the phone and lock it again it works.\n\nIt seems like the feature just 'goes to sleep' after a period of inactivity. Is that possible? Am I missing something in the settings?\n\nThanks for any help.",
