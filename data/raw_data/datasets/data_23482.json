    "content": "Voice to text function has become super slow. This phone was an upgrade from what I previously had and the old phone was quicker. I can type faster. I purchase more speed. Ive spoken with Metro support. Still I have no answers on how to fix it. This phone's functions have all become slow and I've been told I used all my high speed data. What does that mean I'm stuck with the phone that doesn't work correctly?",
