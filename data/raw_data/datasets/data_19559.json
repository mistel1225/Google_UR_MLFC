    "content": "I want to send my Pixel 3 XL for a repair. It is under warranty according to google site where I checked with IMEI.\n It was bought in Germany but I live in Greece.\n It has a charging problem, I went to a local repair center and they told me that the flex tape/cable that connects the charging port and the mic to the motherboard needs a replacement and they don't have spare parts. \nHow can I send it to Google Repair Center in Germany where it was originally bought? \nThank you.",
