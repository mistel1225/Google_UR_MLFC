    "content": "When I record video, there is no shaking, but when I watch the video, there is shaking.\nThe electronic stabilization does not work. If I turn off the stabilization in the camera, then everything is fine, nothing shakes. I deleted all data (factory reset), it didn`t help. \n\nPlease, watch the attached videos: Video test\n\nPlease, help me to solve the problem.\n\nP.S. Gyroscope functions well\n\nKind regards,\nGeorge Dilanian",
