    "content": "I need help! I was supposed to receive a return mail slip for my phone. I have yet to receive anything and I can not figure out how the hell to talk with anyone. I need to get this issue resolved ASAP. I need my phone to run my business without it I run the risk of losing customers and income. I do not need anything else handicapping me especially with COVID. GOogle is a billion dollar company I would think you would have a help center. This is ridiculous",
