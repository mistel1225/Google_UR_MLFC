    "content": "Google, my grandmother bought me a brand new Pixel C tablet straight from the Google website multiple years back.  Then,  my nephew got ahold of it, changed the password and so I had to do a hard reset. Unfortunately,  some time had elapsed before I decided to do that and when trying to log back in all of my normal Google accounts I usually use did not grant me access. Apparently, I created a new account for my pixel c tablet and have no idea what that account is.  I've been trying for years to get back into my tablet looking up every possible solution to no avail. I've also been searching for a Google customer support phone number for years as well and never have found it.  I've tried putting in my phone number and searching for every possible email that I could have created and tried them all with nothing working. I'm completely stuck here and am desperate to be able to use my beautiful brand new tablet that my grandmother paid around $500. As of now, it's just collecting dust.  PLEASE HELP ME GOOGLE!! THANK YOU, Jeremy Zack Squires",
