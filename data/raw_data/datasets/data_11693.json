    "content": "My preferred music player, PowerAmp and my music files transferred successfully from my old phone however this player cannot access the Music folder on my Pixel 5. I've confirmed that the YT Music app cannot access this folder either. If I navigate to a song file and tell it to play, it works on both apps but I can't get either to link to the folder it libraries in either app. I've also ensure that both apps have full permissions to all data on my phone.",
