    "title": "What algorithm filters the exhaustive Call History list down to the not-so-exhaustive Recents List?",
    "content": "New Google Pixel 4, purchased from Google, using T-Mobile network.\nUpgraded from a Samsung Galaxy S7.\nUpgrade went smoothly (all call history transferred OK).\n\n\nConfusion regarding the Recents list in the stock Google Phone app.\n\n1. During early use, when tips & hints were popping up occasionally, I noticed a blurb that commented on what was expected to be seen in the Recents list. I dismissed it too hastily to grasp what it said.\n\n2. Shortly after, I made calls to 2 back-to-back service providers found in Yelp. Looking at the Recents list a short while later, Recents showed my call to only 1 of those 2 companies. One call wasn't in my list of recent calls. Odd.\n\n3. In the Phone app menu at top right, I found Call History, which shows an exhaustive list of every made/received/missed call (including that 2nd company I'd called earlier).\n\n\nQuestions:\n\na) What algorithm does the phone use to filter/shorten/modify the Recents list relative to the comprehensive Call History list?\n\nb) If a) doesn't provide an obvious answer, *why* is the call history trimmed when displayed in Recents?\n\nc) Can I set my phone to show Call History in place of Recents, as my preference is that the default list should be comprehensive, not filtered?\n\n\nThank you very much,\n-Jason",
