    "content": "I used to be able to swipe right and view all my open web pages, but after s recent update I can't. It brings up Google news pages. Extremely frustrating. Also, when I search in the Google taskbar, the page I view is lost and I have to go back to the search bar and search again to get back to the page, going through the whole process again  Can someone help as it's really infuriating. I hate this update.",
