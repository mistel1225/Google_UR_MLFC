    "content": "Hey peeps,\nI really like my Pixel 4 XL. The connector of the battery to the motherboard has broken, for a second time in one year.\nI now have two batteries that are unusable because the connector of both have broken. Is this a known defect of Pixel 4 XL?\nI am spending 2021 hiding from COVID in a different country. The country I am in do not sell Pixel batteries.\nAny ideas on how to fix this issue?\nShould I contact google?",
