    "title": "Pixel 3 overheats, freezes and shuts down non-stop while using with just a few apps",
    "content": "The phone terribly overheats and is quite hot. It freezes the phone and shuts down non-stop from running apps like amazon, google news, gmail, chrome browser and etc. The camera freezes upon loading and freezes the whole phone. Everytime, it either shuts itself or I have to manually turn it off because it freezes. Not sure what's going. Even with the new battery replacement, I can't even use my phone just the daily normal use of checking email/news and such. My son's pixel 2 is still running and doing crazy stuff. So disappointed at pixel 3. Nothing to fix this overheating issue.",
