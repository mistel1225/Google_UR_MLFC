    "content": "I have setup a warranty repair request and have been waiting for a shipping label or a physical return shipping package to be sent to me.  Brought my phone into UbreakIfix, and was told to ship it in to google.   It's been nearly 3 week with about a dozen phone calls to google.  still no email, no shipping label, no shipping return packaging.    Every time I call in the response is the same \"it's been escalated\".    I don't understand how one of the world's premiere tech companies can't email me a shipping label?  So in the meantime, I've been without a phone for 3 weeks, while my phone is still in warranty.\n\nDoes anyone know what the address is for the google repair center?  I just want to pay for shipping myself and send it in for repair.  Please help!",
