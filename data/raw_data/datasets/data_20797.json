    "content": "My phone has refused to charge in the last few days. I would charge it for hours and thr most it would charge is 11%. I even got a new chwrging cord and it did not work. I read that the pixel 3a xl does not charge wirelessly. I'm not sure if that's true as I don't have a wireless charger to test the theory. \nI then put the phone in safe mode at 1% battery life, which is the last of the charge from earlier held, and continue charging when it switched off. The screen flashes with a low battery symbol but when attempting to turn it back on with the power button, it does nothing. Holding down the power and the down volume button also does nothing. It only flashes the battery icon and refuses to charge. It was plugged into a charger overnight and still has not held a charge and will not turn on. I purchased this phone last April, so it is just over 1 year old.",
