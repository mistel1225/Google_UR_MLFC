    "content": "Hi I've 2 pixel 4 XL's here, 1 was a replacement, the screen is yellow tinted face on with white backgrounds, or chrome Google home page it's even worse on the replacement, not sure where to from here but the whole is awful, both ambient eq and tried all 3 colour settings and it makes no difference, is Google aware of this, has the screen been calibrated like this warmer look deliberately? You notice too much in bright environments but as the light drops at home in the evening it's very prominent and annoying, before I try 1 more replacement and give up, Google care to comment if this screen has been calibrated warm or have I got 2 duff units?\n\nForgot to add if I tilt the phone backwards or left and right it goes pure white so there is definitely an issue going on here.",
