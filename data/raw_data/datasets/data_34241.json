    "content": "My wife lost her Pixel 2 phone in Costco. The last know location seen in Device location app is Costco San Jose and then switched off. I setup requests to lock and erase as directed in the app. Now we don't know if the device is actually locked and erased. \n- How to know if the device is actually erased or locked? \n- Are there other means to track the phone using IMEI OR register the IMEI so that the phone cannot be used even with other SIM. \n- How to get notified if the phone gets switched on again?\n- My wife changed here Google account password, hope this wouldn't affect tracking the phone. \n- What else could we do?\n\nI have a pixel too. I tried opening Pixel Support from my setting, but it is chrashing.\n\nAppreciate your help.",
