    "content": "Impossible to pick up any incoming calls. I can hear the incoming calls but nothing shows on the screen. Open the phone app nothing shows. Reset to default piexl launcher, still nothing shows. What is good with a phone when you can't even pick up a phone call ? I had Sony Xperia phone before and never experienced such issues. I don't think it is fair to blame this on 3rd party apps. As far as I know there is no other Andriod phones experiencing the same kind of issues. If there is a compatibility problem than it lays on Google piexl side.\n\nCan I return this phone? It causes me nothing but grief.\n\nThanks",
