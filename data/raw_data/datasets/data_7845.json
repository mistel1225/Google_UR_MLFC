    "content": "No matter what I try (increasing location accuracy, clearing my maps cache, etc) my Pixel 5 and my wife's Pixel 4 XL keeps showing our location at our old home ~2 miles away which is wrecking havoc on my Nest Home and Away Assist. I've attached an example of a recent Home/Away Activity report which shows my phone coming and going even though I never left the house that day! \n\nWould love any suggestions for how to fix this.
