    "content": "I never understood why Pixel 5 wasn't launched in the Netherlands in the first place. Having the 99.4% 5G coverage in the whole country. Being the number one country in terms of coverage of 5G... So I bought in Germany. Guess what? Google hasn't enabled T-mobile here yet. Why? T-mobile sub6 is exactly the same configured as the germans. Would be great if one of the techs could copy paste that config for NL T-mobile and push in the next update. Thanks!",
