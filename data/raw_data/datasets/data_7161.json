    "content": "Before, I've seen it have Android version 9.0, and now it's Android version 11.0 and seems to perform slowly.\n\nThus, I want to do a factory reset of my Google Pixel phone (pixel 3a).\nI follow this guide: https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/4596836?hl=en\nBut it's not working well, it just removes all my personal data but the Android version now still 11.0.\n\nIs there any safe way to get my phone back to the factory setting? Like android version 9.0, etc...\nThanks!",
