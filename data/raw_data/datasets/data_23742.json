    "content": "Bought *pixel 3* two months ago and when using speakerphone at least half time the other end can't hear me.  They pick up and say hello about 4 times, and only if I turn off speakerphone can they hear me.  Or I break up. I know this was a big issue in the fall.  Can someone advise whether Google ever recognized this problem and if any solution is promised.  Or do I arrange for an RMA?  Thanks!",
