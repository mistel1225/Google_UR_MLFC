    "title": "Static/Buzzing noise from Pixel 3 - no resolution from Google Support",
    "content": "My Pixel 3 phone has been replaced (with refurbished devices) twice. All 3 devices have an annoying static buzzing noise in the phone speaker. It is so frustrating that Google refuses to acknowledge this is a hardware problem. I have spent so much time dealing with customer support. They all regurgitate the same stock responses. They assure me they understand the issue and will resolve the problem by sending me another thoroughly tested refurbished device. I am tired of wasting my time. I think this is terrible service and I strongly suggest not buying a Pixel phone. I regret it. A complete waste of money.",
