    "content": "So I recently got Samsung Galaxy buds, I have downloaded all proper software for them to work, and only one plays audio, I have tried different pairs with my phone, all having the same issue, and it's not the buds, they work great with my brothers phone(also Google pixel 3) so I am wondering what can be done about this, because it is quite annoying.  Thanks for any input!",
