    "content": "The new update has caused my phone to work in properly. I just updated it 20 minutes ago and tried to stream content from multiple streaming sources and I can no longer stream to my chromecast post update. It worked fine immediately prior to the update and did not work immediately following the update. I would like to revert back to the old system immediately, but it appears that Google has not given me that option. It appears that I can only search for existing updates and if installed already there are no alternative options as far as software updates go. This is very frustrating considering this is a new phone and it was working seamlessly prior to the update!!",
