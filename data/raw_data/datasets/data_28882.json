    "title": "Is my pixel 3a XL, purchased through Google in Spain covered by warranty?",
    "content": "I recently bought a pixel 3a XL through Google website in Spain. I understand that Google has a 2 year warranty for devices, but it says that this is only applicable in USA and Canada, but what about other countries? I mean I purchased it from Google not from some random website. It says repairs are only out of warranty. I've had a terrible experience with Nexus 6p and Nexus 5 before and I'm worried that this one will act up, especially that it has already restarted once on its own. Phones normally never do that!! Google has terrible support, I am not able to reach a Google specialist and I've requested call backs many times to no avail.",
