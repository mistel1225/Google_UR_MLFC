    "content": "So my front camera works at first when video chatting in FB messenger but after a few seconds it goes to pixeled lines or blurriness. It works with taking pictures and videos but it seems to happen in FB so far that I've noticed. I just got it after Black Friday so it's new and I'm wondering if this is a common problem, an app issue or a faulty phone. I never had this problem on the app on my old Android.  Any help would be awesome, thank you!!",
