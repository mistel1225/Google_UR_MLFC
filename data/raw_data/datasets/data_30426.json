    "content": "So? When did we loose the ability to turn off notifications per-message in Android Messages?\n\nI don't see the \"Show Notifications\" option when you go to  ::message:: -> ::hamburger:: -> Details -> Notifications\n\nIf I go into Settings > App and Notifications > Messages, I see where I might be able to turn off notifications globally for messages and then possibly per message but all the toggles and check boxes are greyed out?!!\n\nI'm hoping this is some sort of oversight or bug cause why remove this flexibility?!\n\n\nMissing blue bar that would allow me toggle notifications on and off.\n\n\nAll those toggles.....greyed out!",
