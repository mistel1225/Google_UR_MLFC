    "content": "When upgrading from my pixel 2 to 3, the formatting was downloaded. I had individual contacts on my home screen. They did not show up on my new phone (3) and when I attempted to add them, a prompt shows up that they have already been added to the home screen. How can I reset this or delete them when I cannot see them on the home screen?",
