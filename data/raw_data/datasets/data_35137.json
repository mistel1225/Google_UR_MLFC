    "content": "Did Google remove the option to take a screenshot from Google Assistant? When I first purchased my Pixel last year, I could \"Okay Google... Take a screenshot\" and it worked without issue. Now when I tell it to take a screenshot, I get a pop up telling me to turn on the Use screenshot toggle in the Assist & voice input settings. I've confirmed this is on, restarted assistant, rebooted, etc... I'm still getting this message.",
