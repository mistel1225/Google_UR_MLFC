    "content": "Am I the only one who lost photos and videos in Photos from the upgrade?\n\nTechnically they don't seem to be lost as I can see the missing media when I select Files, either selecting Images or Videos, they all seem to be there and the list is huge. But they're mostly gone from Photos. Even some recent videos from last week. Nothing's in the Archive. Nothing was \"cleaned up\" to free up space.\n\nMy whole Photos list is very thin. I've had this phone since 12/3/17 and usually just keep all the photos and videos on the phone. Photos has 220 items, while Files (Images&Videos) has 935.\n\nHow do I get everything back to show in Photos?\n\nEDIT: It seems all but one picture displayed in the Photos app are all in the Google Photos cloud storage. Everything else that's only in my phone is not showing up in the Photos app. I just took a test picture, not uploaded to internet storage, and it's showing in the Photos app.",
