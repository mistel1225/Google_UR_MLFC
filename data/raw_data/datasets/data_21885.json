    "title": "Some factory wallpapers seem to have disappeared",
    "content": "For quite some time now, it appears that some of the factory images that could be used as wallpapers, appear to have been \"lost\". As a characteristic example, there is a category of wallpaper images called \"Earth\", where the cover image for this category presents the surface of a planet that is lit by a very bright source of light from above. That very same image used to be available in the \"Earth\" category and one could go ahead and use it. However, this is no longer true. I cannot find this image anymore. Also, my current background is an image of a planet like Jupiter with one of its moons. While it is definitely my wallpaper at the moment (actually, for several months now), I cannot find the picture anywhere among the possible wallpapers.\n\nAnybody knows what has happened? I can still see images in the various categories for wallpapers. But apparently I cannot see everything. Perhaps some images were removed when an update of the OS happened at some point?\n\nI have a Pixel 3, 128 GB, 2.8 GB free, running Android 10.\n\nThanks in advance for all your help!",
