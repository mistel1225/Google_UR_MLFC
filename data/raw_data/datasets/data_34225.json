    "title": "Pixel phone boot loop issue after recent security update",
    "content": "On Feb 12th 2019, I have received the same February security patch update for my pixel phone. While updating the phone it has gone to boot loop. I searched in google to fix this issue. Many users has raised the same issue as mentioned above and suggested for hard reset of the phone.  As I have not backed up my data initially, I have not done any hard reset and tried restarting and re booting.  Since problem was not solved I immediately called the call center/support center of google on 13th and I have done the factory reset as per the google support center agent instructions and configured the phone after factory reset, but the issue was not resolved. On 14th Feb 2019, again I Google Support center agents and explained the sequence of events and they recommended that the phone need to be sent to their repair center in Mumbai and sent a B2X agent for collecting the phone and yesterday i.e., 18.02.2019 I received a mail form B2X stating that mother has gone faulty and has to be replace and sent a quotation for Rs. 22,339 /-. \n\nIt is surprising that how mother board will go faulty with security patch update. I have purchased the phone in March 2017. In just one and half year how mother board will go faulty for security patch update.\n\nPl. sort this issue soon, so that I can get back my pixel soon.",
