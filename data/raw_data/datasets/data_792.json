    "content": "While at home and connected to my wireless network, I am unable to send MMS, they fail to send. However, if I shut off wireless on the phone or go to a store with WiFi, MMS sends just fine. My provider claims that the issue is not theirs, and therefore must be the phone as \"everything is fine on the network end\"",
