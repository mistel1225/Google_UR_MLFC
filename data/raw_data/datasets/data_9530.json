    "title": "Pixel 4 XL with 50% battery problem. The warranty expired a couple of weeks ago. What do I do?",
    "content": "This has been persistent for the past 2 weeks. The phone sometimes charges and sometimes it won't. If it turns on it will turn on with 50% battery and not move up or down even though the battery might be nearly at 1% charge or more. \n\nMy warranty expired like 3 weeks ago to my great luck. Any suggestions?",
