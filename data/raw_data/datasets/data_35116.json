    "content": "I was using my Pixel 2016 in the YouTube app when the wifi suddenly disconnected. I kept on tapping on my network, but the network kept on saying \"saved\" and never connected. I tried safe mode, but it didn't work. Eventually i reset the modem and finally factory reset the phone, but no luck. What can I do?",
