    "content": "I have a new Pixel 3. When I try to pair with my Altec Lansing baby boom speakers I get an error message on the phone say “can’t communicate with Altec baby boom”. No other devices are connected, I have turned Bluetooth off and on, and have powered off the phone. It’s not the speaker as it connects to Apple products. Any one have any suggestions? Thanks.",
