    "content": "For the past two months my Pixel 3a does not  connect to Android Auto in my 2018! Civic.  \nIt charges the phone so it's not the cable. I can run Android Auto from the phone and it will play music over the car's audio system.\n\nOne other note I can't get my PC to see the Pixel. I try and change the settings from using the USB for  charging to data transfer but it won't let me.\n\nReady to trade this in for a iPhone",
