    "content": "I have been using my google pixel 2XL since Oct 2017, and yes I had a few problems lately but they are nothing major ones. But now I can't even use my phone since it keeps on turning off. I have noticed this issue when I came home the other day when it was 4-5 degrees outside. Now when I try to turn on my phone it just turns back off whenever sometimes 2 minutes and sometimes 30 minutes or an hour. since last night at least every 5 minutes. I haven't backed up everything and I am worried a bit if its because any app that I installed recently.",
