    "content": "I just woke up and my Pixel 3 is asking for my pattern to unlock (it probably got an OTA update while I was sleeping). So I input my pattern, the same pattern I've used for years... and it says my pattern is incorrect.\n\nI have tried plugging it into my car, since it's a trusted device; but it can't connect to my car until I unlock my phone.\n\nI have not changed my pattern. What do I do now?",
