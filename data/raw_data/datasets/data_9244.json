    "content": "Hello I've noticed recent problems with wifi on a pixel 4a. Site will be super slow to load or even timeout before loading. Other devices on my network are fine / no issues with things like browsing or steaming when this issue comes up so I think it's isolated to the phone.\n\nA quick a reliable fix is to disconnect from wifi even for a moment then reconnect. That fixes it for awhile only for it to return. I've also found if I just put the phone away and try again a few minutes later things can also return to normal.  Thoughts?\n\nI have 250mbps cable service, x3 error pros.",
