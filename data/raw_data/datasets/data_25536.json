    "content": "I have first gen pixel buds, and they constantly give me 2 problems. \n\nProblem 1) I can put the buds on, and they're connected to my phone, and I'm watching a YouTube video or something. Then I receive a phone call, and as soon as I answer the phone call the pixel buds disconnect from my phone and I have to reconnect them mid-call. It's gotten to the point where whenever anyone calls me they immediately know to wait a few minutes for me to reconnect my pixel buds\n\nProblem 2) the buds don't have a good connection with the case anymore. When I put the buds back in the case, it doesn't always register that they're in the case, the green light doesn't go on, and as a result, my phone will connect and disconnect to the buds several times even though the buds are put away and stored. \n\na) What can I do to eliminate these problems?\nb) Have these problems been addressed in the next gen pixel buds?",
