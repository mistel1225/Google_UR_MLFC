    "content": "I bought a new Pixel 3 yesterday through a local reseller.\n\nThe phone was one of those that went through a quality test by the reseller, and in the box there was no usb-c to power adapter. Or, better, there was a Samsung usb to power adapter. Which is pretty useless as in the box there is a usb-c to usb-c cable only.\n\nAnyways, I tried charging it a usb-c to usb cable of mine, both connecting it to my PC or the power plug (both with the Samsung adapter and with an Huawei adapter).\n\nWhat happens is that the phone keeps trying to boot, but right after the Google logo appears, it shuts down again. It does this in a loop, as long as it is plugged in to some power source. If I unplug it, I get the low power icon (red discharged battery).\n\nI have no clue what to do, as I'd be happier if it can be fixed without going back to the reseller.\n\nThanks for any advice.",
