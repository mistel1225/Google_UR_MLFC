    "content": "Since I have my phone, I have never had the weather information displayed in the \"At a glance\" widget on my home screen. I have seen several old posts on this and on other forums of people having the same or similar problems, and I have already tried the following suggestions from these:\n\n1. Turn on and off weather updates and weather update for current location from Google app customise settings.\n2. Uninstall and reinstall Google app updates.\n3. Join the Google app beta and leave it again.\n\nNone of these has solved the problem. Contrary to some other reports, the weather info has never appeared for a while and then disappeared again. I have never seen it at all. Also the toggles for the weather updates settings do not automatically turn off, they always stay the way I set them.\n\nThe Google app has location permission as well as Pixel launcher. I do not have my location turned on all the time, but I've left it on for more than a day and still no luck. I'm not sure if it's related, but I also do not see any weather info in my Google feed, although weather updates are turned on in the settings.",
