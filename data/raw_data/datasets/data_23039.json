    "title": "Do not disturb settings exceptions always crashes \"Settings keeps stopping\"",
    "content": "Whenever I go to Sound->Do not Disturb->Exceptions, selecting \"Calls\" or \"Messages, events & reminders\" always crashes.  The first time I select either item, I get kicked back to the Sound menu. If I try to go into Do not Disturb->Exceptions and select either item a 2nd time I get the \"Settings keep stopping\" error message. Settings then force closes and I start all over.\nI've sent feedback with system logs. I have tried the following:\n1) Restarted the phone, \n2) Cleared data&cache for settings\n3) Turn off DND, set Turn on automatically to \"Never\". I only have the Sleeping and Event Automatic rules defined.\n4) Restart in safe mode",
