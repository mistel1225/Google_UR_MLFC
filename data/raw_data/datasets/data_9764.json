    "content": "I've got a Pixel 4 with no screen protector or screen damage that acts very strangely when I plug the phone in.  I have random mistaps on the keyboard, and sometimes it seems the screen is detecting multiple inputs as it zooms and pans around on webpages and pictures.  I unplug the phone and the issue immediately goes away.  I've tried a restart but that hasn't done anything for me.",
