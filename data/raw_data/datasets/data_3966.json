    "content": "My partner was robbed and their Google Pixel 3 phone was stolen. We tried to remotely lock and erase it at android.com/find, but these options are unavailable, they apparently require a previous set up. What are our options? Can Google lock or erase it for us using the IMEI? Please assist. Thank you.",
