    "content": "I recently switched to a Google Pixel 4 after using handmedown iPhones for years. I'm generally used to being able to restrict apps from any data at all, but much to my chagrin, I cannot find the same option here. The only option I have is to turn off background data usage, which isn't what I am looking for. Anybody more familiar with these know if there's an option, or am I just stuck with restricting data for everything?",
