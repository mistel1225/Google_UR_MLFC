    "title": "Pixel 4 XL Wireless Charging Battery Bug.",
    "content": "I have recently purchased a Pixel 4 XL with the Pixel Stand for wireless charging.\n My problem is that, by charging the phone for an extended amount of time on the stand, the battery read out is wrong.\nMy first encounter was it being at 100% when I removed the phone at 96%.\nThe second encounter was it being charged to 94%. But after removal from the stand, it showed 99%.\n Is this the phone's issue, or the chargers issue?\nPossible fix?\n\nThanks.\n (Upon the first and second encounter, restarting the phone worked. But doing this every time is a bit annoying.)\n(No issue with wired charging prior to using the wireless stand. Tried wire charging again, it works fine.)",
