    "content": "Really upset about my Pixel5's glass breaking from a slight 30-40cm high drop! Slipped out of my hand and ege got smashed while it had its cover on! Even the cover got damaged! And the cover is supposed to cover the edges! I really don't understand.\nIs it the quality of the cover?\nIs the cover too loose?\n\nWhat is the process to get this thing fixed? I can't believe after pre-ordering and then waiting for it to arrive and waiting even more for a few covers to be available this happens! ",
