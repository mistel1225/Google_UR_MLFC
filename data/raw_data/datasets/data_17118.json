    "content": "When I plug in my phone and android auto starts it won’t play downloaded music on Spotify. \nIf I’m in my driveway within wifi range it will play, if my data is on it will play. \nBut when both are off I cannot play my downloaded albums from Spotify, the screen just freezes up and won’t let me access music. \nIt just started doing this recently, was never a problem before.",
