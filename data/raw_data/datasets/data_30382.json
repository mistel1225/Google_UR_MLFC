    "content": "I have a pixel 3 xl. I am rarely able to functionally call outbound when Wi-Fi is enabled. The call will connect but the other party is unable to hear me and the touch tones do not work. As soon as I turn off Wi-Fi and place the call again it always works. It doesn't always show that it's connected with Wi-Fi, but turning off Wi-Fi always resolves the issue. Is there a known fix?",
