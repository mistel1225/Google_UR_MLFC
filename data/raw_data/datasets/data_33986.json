    "content": "Been on support calls with Tracfone several times.  They have adjusted settings on their side and changed APN several times.  They blame Pixel 2 for incompatibility. Phone was purchased 10/18/18, immediately upgraded to android version 9 and worked good until 2/20/19.  At that time SMS texts started taking hours to arrive and MMS messages did not arrive at all.  Latest android update was 2/5/19.",
