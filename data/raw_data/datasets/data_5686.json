    "content": "Purchased the Pixel 4a 5G yesterday and I am not receiving phone calls and text messages are delayed while using Mint Mobile.  I saw that the Pixel 5 has the same issues and a fix is coming out to for that next week.  I would like to know if this is going to fix the same issues on the 4a 5G as well.",
