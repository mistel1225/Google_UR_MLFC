    "content": "Hi,\n\nJust got my Pixel 4a yesterday, and I've found out that the in-line volume controls for my 3.5mm pair of wired Apple EarPods do not work. They work fine on my previous phone (iPhone 6s), but not the Pixel.\n\nI can play / pause and sometimes skip songs with them, but the volume controls straight up don't work.\n\nIs it possible to fix this somehow?\nThanks",
