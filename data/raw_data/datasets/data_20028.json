    "title": "Texts not Delivering after Beta 11",
    "content": "After installing the Android Beta 11 build, I was having some problems with it so I decided to Opt Out and go back to Android 10. After going back to Android 10 my texts will no longer send with MMS. They will appear dark blue on the default messaging app but will only say \"sent\" below and never delivered. The person I am texting will get the text instantly even though it only says \"sent\" on my end and not \"delivered\" or \"read.\" After a couple of minutes my text will update to an SMS text that is light blue on my end, and the other person gets a duplicate. I have tried factory resetting my phone, taking sim out, all that stuff. Nothing fixes this issue. Could have to do with my contacts being backed up to my Google account, or maybe beta 11 cursed my phone, I'm not sure. Any help would be appreciated.",
