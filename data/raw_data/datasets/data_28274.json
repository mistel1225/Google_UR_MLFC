    "title": "Cannot reconnect to remote wifi device (camera). Toggling the wifi on the phone fixes it.",
    "content": "I am unable to reconnect to my remote wireless device over wifi.  I have a GoPro camera that I used to be able to connect to and after upgrading to Android 10 I am no longer able to connect to it.  My workaround is to toggle wifi OFF/ON and this works every time.  What did Android 10 update change that broke my ability to reconnect to remote wifi devices?  Why does toggling wifi or rebooting the phone fix it?  I can repeat this failure 100% of the time and every time the workaround stated above corrects the issue.",
