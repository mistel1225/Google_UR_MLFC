    "content": "My camera stopped working two months ago. Sometimes it crashes, sometimes gives message \"Something went wrong\" and if i close pop up message the frontal camera continues working. I tried troubleshooting steps; couple times from many attempts I managed to make a photo but after closing the app it wasn't working again. I've seen many people flagging the same issue in Camera app reviews on Google Play regarding Pixel (mostly pixel 2). Is there any fix planned?",
