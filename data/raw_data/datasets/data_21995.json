    "content": "The following post is about what I experienced with 3XL a year ago.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/b1rvkq/one_drop_left_an_unpleasant_mark_under_the_glass/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share\n\nOne-time knee-hight drop left weird silver mark UNDER the front glass of my 3XL.\n\nThis time, my 4XL.\n\nA few days ago I was standing in front of my desk, and I put my 4XL into my pocket, like dropping the phone into the pocket.\n\nThe phone was supposed to hit the bottom of my pocket, but accidentally I was standing too close to the desk, so the phone hit the hard desk before it hit the bottom of pocket. Somehow I did it again right after the first drop.\n\nSimply, it was two times drops of mere 8 centimeters height.\nIt was even smaller impact compared to what happened to my 3 XL a year ago. And this time my 4XL was in a proper TPU case. No scratch or dent. All functions ok. Like last time.\n\nAnd the same silver mark appeared UNDER the front glass of my 4XL. The bottom right corner is most apparent, just like the last time. But this time I got more marks bottom and top, less apparent than the bottom right.\n\nThe phone is working just fine. But the silver mark is indeed unpleasant. I just hate to see that.\n\nWhat the hell is that extremely fragile, aluminum foil-like thing under the front glass?\n\nI've never seen that thing from the other phones.\n\nThoughts? I just wanted to tell somebody about this.",
