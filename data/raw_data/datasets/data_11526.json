    "content": "Even with all settings for haptic feedback and vibrate on keypress turned off off, my phone still makes haptic vibrations on unlock, and when editing pictures in the camera app. \n\nThe sensation is incredibly unpleasant to me.  It makes me want to throw my phone.  There is never any circumstance where I want my phone to vibrate.  I would be very pleased if there were a system level setting to turn of all vibration.  Is there any way to accomplish this?",
