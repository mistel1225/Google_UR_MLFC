    "content": "My husband took my screen protector off to replace the glass sticker and found that the back of my phone was completely shattered even though it's constantly in its case. I never take it out. My phone also overheats to the point where I can barely hold it without burning my hands. This happened with my previous Pixel 3 as well. I'm not sure how it has a hole crushed in the back of the phone because of the case shows zero damage.",
