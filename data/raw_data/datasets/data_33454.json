    "content": "Been looking online for bootloop fixes and have come across nothing useful. \nTonight I got my brand new pixel XL and was excited to use it. I proceeded to set it up but shortly after everything was finished it froze. I restarted it and after it booted up, it shut down again. \nFrom them till now it's been stuck in a bootloop.\nAnybody know how I can fix this?",
