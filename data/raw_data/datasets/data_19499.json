    "content": "The front camera of Pixel 4 XL is really giving me a headache. Whenever I take selfies, my face comes out to be distorted. When I say distorted, I can actually see the camera widen my face when I open the camera app. And after taking the photo, the image is nowhere close to what I look like.",
