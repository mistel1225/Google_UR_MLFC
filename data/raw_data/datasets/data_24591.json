    "content": "So I'm a long time Google phone user (since the Galaxy Nexus) and this is a first for me.  I have a Pixel 3 XL that's about 13 months old, 1 month out warranty and the back of the phone is popping off because the battery is swelling.  I've never had a Google phone device do this before.  I contacted support and they told me to take it to UBreakIFix to repair it at my own cost.  This isn't right.  Obviously there's a manufacturing defect with the battery because it's swelling.  I should not have to incur the cost because the battery is defective.  Remember the Samsung exploding Note phones?  Am I going to have to wait until the phone explodes?  I think Google should do the right thing and exchange the phone.",
