    "content": "If my active profile on the phone is not the primary profile, then find my device cannot locate this device. Is this a defect?\n\nFor more background, I've created a profile for my kids. It's generally the active profile. So if the phone got lost, it's probably going to be the active profile at the time. If find my device can't work because of this, it make find my device useless in this situation.\n\nPlease fix!  Thanks",
