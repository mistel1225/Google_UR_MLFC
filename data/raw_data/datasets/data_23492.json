    "content": "Music suddenly stopped playing in my car from my Pixel 2 XL about a month or two ago and I can't get it back. I bought a new dongle directly from Google. I bought a new aux cord. Neither helped. My car still plays music through the aux cord from different phones like the iPhone X and XR and HTC 10 (I've tried only those so far). Tried restarting my phone, playing with settings, nothing works. Google support told me I was under warranty but had to go through Verizon. Anyone else have the same problem and able to fox it without sending phone in for repair? Not sure if it's a hardware or software problem. Charging works fine so USB port shouldn't be corroded.",
