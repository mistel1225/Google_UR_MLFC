    "title": "How to address persistently unresponsive screen after closing applications??",
    "content": "The screen becomes unresponsive (visually and to gestures) after an app is closed, the phone screen turns off, and the phone is turned back on. This applies to any and all apps, and even before any additional apps are actually installed. I have tried restarting my phone, restarting in safe mode, factory reseting, using with a SIM card, using without a SIM card, and on at least three different Pixel 3 devices. Google Support has been largely unhelpful and only offers to send refurbished devices, even though I bought the phone new. How has no one else reported this??? I'm open to suggestions.",
