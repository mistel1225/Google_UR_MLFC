    "title": "Assistant Light bar gone Pixel 3a",
    "content": "Hello,\nI've had the light bar for the assistant for around a month but now it reverted to the old version. I've already tried everything from the other answers on this forum but nothing worked.\n\nMy device language is German but my assistant language is English. But theoretically, both languages are supported by the new bar. I mean, it worked for a month or so. It still works for my friend who has the exact same phone and the assistant language German.\n\nI hope someone can help me with this.",
