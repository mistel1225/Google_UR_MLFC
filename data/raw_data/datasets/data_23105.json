    "content": "Almost once a day my Pixel 4XL freezes when putting Youtube into full screen landscape mode. It happens in the google feed and in the youtube app. The audio will continue playing but the screen is frozen and wont respond to any button presses or gestures. Eventually the sound will stop and phone will be completely frozen until I hold down power button to hard reboot. Everything is up to date.",
