    "content": "Using NovaLauncher Prime 6.2.12.  Notification badges appear for other apps (GMail, Facebook, Phone) but NOT for Messages.  The badge did work with previous versions of Android on the phone.\nLooking through Settings -> Notifications, it looks like everything is enabled/on.\n\nAny ideas?\n\nAny feedback would be appreciated.\n\nTIA.",
