    "content": "Here's the deal. I listen to several music apps, all nested together in a bubble labeled \"Music\". Okay, I'm listening to Google Music on my phone. If I swipe up to pull up my recent apps, Google Music is, of course, there.  If I swipe up and clear all my recent apps, Google Music continues to play, but the app isn't in recent apps anymore. Is there another way to stop the music besides waking up the phone, navigating back to my music apps and finding and opening Google Music and hitting pause?  Is there a setting to stop GM by swiping up, which is how Spotify, YT Music, and Amazon Music work?  Thanks.",
