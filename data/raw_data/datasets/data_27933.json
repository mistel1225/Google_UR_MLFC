    "content": "I'd like to claim for the damage my cell phone caused. The frame is broken and this happened even with the case. I'm not talking about a scratch, it's completely cracked. How is that possible? My phone hasn't suffered a major blow or fall. You can tell that I am really careful with my phone becasue of how the rest of it looks. ",
