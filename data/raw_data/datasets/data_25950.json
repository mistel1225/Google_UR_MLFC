    "content": "I don't get an error so not sure if it's an actual crash but since upgrading to Android 10 the launcher closes and reopens immediately when on the home screen and the app locker. The latter being the most annoying when you're typing in the search box\n\nI have tried clearing data / cache for the launcher and all that did is erase my app layout, which should have a backup option \n\nAnyone know if there is a way to fix this?",
