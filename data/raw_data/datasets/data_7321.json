    "content": "this is for my older mum. she panics when she has to swipe. she doesn't get alot of calls and if she's using the phone she can handle the call button that turns up better than when locked. we have had the pixel 3 for nearly a year and she's doing OK. but I'm asking as I haven't found a way to sort the lock screen swipe. \nI realise there's external buttons u can hook up but can we not change that screen in accessibility? can't find anything else. \nthanks for any suggestions",
