    "title": "Using 3rd party app for blocking spam callers & texts on Google phone/Google Fi?",
    "content": "I have a Pixel 3XL (Pixel 5 on order!) and use Google Fi as my mobile phone provider. Online research has shown that neither Google Fi or Google phones have the ability to block \"wildcards\" such as area codes/exchanges. I get multiple \"neighbor spoofing\" calls every day and intend to add a 3rd party app from the Google Play Store to accomplish this. I'm considering Mr. Number (currently using free trial) or Blacklist Pro. Do I need to disable the Google phone spam filters for a 3rd party app to function properly? Anyone have an opinion on which of these apps work best? I want to block both calls and texts. Don't mind a small subscription charge.",
