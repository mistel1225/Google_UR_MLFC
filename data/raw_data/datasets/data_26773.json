    "content": "A couple days ago, my Pixel 2 XL started having weird charging issues. A couple days ago I left it charging overnight but it did not charge. I plugged it in to a car charger and it kept turning off and showing the black & white battery but not really charging. Then I plugged it in to the regular charger and it started making the sound I associate with charging, then turning on battery save mode, then not charging, and then back to the charging sound, and so on. Meanwhile the battery was draining about 1% every 2 seconds. I turned it completely off, waited a while, then plugged it back in and it charged normally. \n\nI've been able to charge it that way for the past couple days, but last night it did the repeated charging sound thing again. When I unplugged the charger, the plug was burning hot to the touch. I tried with a different charger but had the same result. Any suggestions?",
