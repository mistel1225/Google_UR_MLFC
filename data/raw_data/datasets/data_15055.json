    "content": "Had the 4a for 10+ days, successfully using earbuds (3.5mm jack), and that's suddenly stopped working. Tried with multiple earbuds (they still work w/other devices). Tried rebooting phone, turning phone all the way off, bluetooth on and off, airplane mode, etc.\nIt's as if the phone does not recognize the earbuds are being plugged in.",
