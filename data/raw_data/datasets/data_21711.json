    "content": "Very often, when my front-facing camera on my Pixel 3 is activated, the camera both: goes terribly blurry (like static on a TV) and there is a horrible static noise that is very audible and very annoying. Essentially the front-facing camera is completely unusable while this is occurring.\n\nEventually, if I hit the flip camera icon enough times, it stops. But it will trigger again randomly.\n\nThis has been written about in numerous other places with no clear solution. It is something that seems to be a software issue, not a hardware issue.\n\nIt happened randomly ~4 months ago. I wasn't using the front-facing camera much then (pre-coronavirus), so I didn't make a big deal of it.\n\nI've tried other solutions written about on other threads and Reddit, including clearing my camera's cache (in storage), deleting my phone's voice match for Google Assistant (which I now have off), removed Google Home entirely, etc.\n\nAny other troubleshooting tips for this? Help would be infinitely appreciated; this issue is horribly annoying and is a daily problem now.\n\nI won't be clearing my entire storage (too annoying). But one thing that's interesting is that I did boot my phone in safe mode and this still happened.\n\nSo I'm wondering if it's some sort of Android / Pixel software setting I can roll back - rather than an app causing a problem.\n\nI am not interested in sending my phone in for a refurbished model.\n\nAnd naturally, during this pandemic, Google's 1:1 support is unavailable and their response time is...well, not helpful.\n\nThank you!",
