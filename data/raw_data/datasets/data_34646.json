    "title": "Pixel 3 XL - February update did not fix call issue",
    "content": "I just bought the Pixel 3 XL at Verizon yesterday - came home, and when testing calls, I could only be heard if using speakerphone.  I can hear them, they can't hear me unless speakerphone on.  Found countless threads about this known issue.  \n\nSupposedly the most recent update this month fixed it (prior thread about this with over 700 responses got locked this morning) however I am STILL having this issue.  All updates applied to phone including the 2/4 update.  Cannot use Assistant either since it will not even recognize that I am speaking in order to capture my voice.",
