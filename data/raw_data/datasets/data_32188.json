    "content": "My touchscreen was unresponsive yesterday AM but I was able to squeeze to enter voice command and hit the home button and it was working fine.  It froze again this morning and I tried to press the home button via the voice command window again but it did not respond, so I restarted the phone by holding the power button.  The touchscreen was still not responding.  I then tried to boot into safe mode and it still was not responding.  I finally did a factory reset via recovery mode and it is till not working.\n\nAny suggestions on what I can do?",
