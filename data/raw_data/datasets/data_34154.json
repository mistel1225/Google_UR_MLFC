    "content": "I am trying to turn my phone on. \nIt had been restarting itself randomly today and then simply turned itself off and didn't turn on again. I tried pressing the power key for 7 seconds  but nothing happened. I then tried holding power and volume for 20 seconds, the phone vibrated several times after 20 seconds but nothing else happened.\nIts basically a brick now.\nI haven't down loaded or done anything new for several days so I can't think what has caused it.\n\nIt was near fully charged when it shut down.",
