    "content": "Since the latest update, my display flashes on, and off, and from a yellow to a cool blue tint when charging via Pixel Stand.\nIt doesn't always happen, but seems to be happening more, and more.....the charging seems to be unaffected, and I haven't noticed any other problems,  and I have talked with others who certainly experience this issue in other groups.\nI have sent in the feedback, but if anybody has a fix, or some advice, I certainly appreciate it....\nThanks my friends.",
