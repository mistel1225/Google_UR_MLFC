    "content": "According to the Google Opinion Rewards FAQs, my app should automatically be paying out to the Paypal account associated with the email I'm using. This isn't happening, and my credits keep expiring. I've tried contacting Google Support, and every person I get ahold of redirects me to someone else who redirects me to the FAQ section again. Can anyone help me figure out how to get my account to pay out the credits so that I'm not losing them?",
