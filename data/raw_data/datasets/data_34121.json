    "title": "Pixel XL Android 9 update- occasional boot loop",
    "content": " I've had an issue with my Pixel XL getting caught in a boot loop after a recent update to Android 9. It's a phone in excellent condition and I'd prefer to not have to get another phone (this is my second pixel- my first pixel stopped functioning after a similar issue). Both Google and my network provider weren't able to diagnose/repair/replace the original Pixel and I'm concerned about this issue. I took the original Pixel to 4 different technicians and all of them believed it was a fault within the software",
