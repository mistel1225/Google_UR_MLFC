    "content": "I have tried unsuccessfully to set up the smart lock and unlock while home. I have not been successful in both. I have rebooted phone several times, I have followed the instructions for the smart lock, I believe, religiously. I have talked with Fi support and they suggest I check with the community. \nI have fingerprint active on the phone plus pattern and password. Despite trying multiple times the smart lock doesn't seem to take hold. I am at a loss of what should be next. I do not want to do a factory reset. \nThank you for any help.\nBob",
