    "content": "Hi - I sent my pixel phone to get repaired two weeks ago. It went with DHL and the correct Google packaging as instructed. The phone has not been received yet (destination is Warsaw), and on the DHL tracker it says the phone is still in transit. It’s been in Poznan for over a week and keeps showing as a clearance event (leaving Poznań) but is obviously just getting sent back repeatedly. Google said it would be a 10 day turn around total!! I don’t know why the parcel can’t reach Warsaw and can’t find a costumer service number f DHL (I have emailed them too). Has anyone else had this issue? What should I do?",
