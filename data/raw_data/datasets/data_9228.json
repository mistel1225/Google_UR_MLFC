    "content": "Hi,\nI have a strange issue with an \"unknown\" service or app that is draining battery rather crazy on my phone.\nThe unknown  part comes from the fact that I can't identify which app or service is responsible for this, in the Battery Usage overview I can just see something that is apparently similar to a PID.\n\nPlease tell me if there is  a solution on how I can identify this app/service.\nI have also attached some screenshots for a better explanation.\n\nThank you.",
