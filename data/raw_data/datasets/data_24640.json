    "content": "I want to prevent device loss, without the privacy and battery issues of leaving location services on. \nAny recommendations? For one, a way of ringing the phone, even if the phone is set to silent. Besides that any recommendations? Personally, I have a smart watch which vibrates when the phone is at a distance, but this is for my wife's phone.\n\nThanks?",
