    "content": "I just got my Pixel 5 yesterday. This is my first Pixel so I don't have any background on these devices. Anyways, I took it off my charger at 6am and it's now 930am. I've used it a good deal and it still says 100% battery life. I mean, if that were true I'd be ecstatic but obviously, it is not. I've seen this issue pop up in here on other models but nothing on the Pixel 5 and I didn't really see any solutions. For additional information, if it matters, last night was the first time I charged it and I did so on a Pixel stand.\n\nEDIT: I restarted it and it is still at 100%.\n\nEDIT2: It's now 10am and its dropped to 96%. Maybe its just a new battery fresh charge thing thats's happening. I'll keep this updated.",
