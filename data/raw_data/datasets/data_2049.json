    "content": "This is my third Pixel 4a 5G with touchscreen issues. It seems that there is a consistent input on the touchscreen at all times. This causes a ton of issues with controlling the device and makes typing on the phone a ridiculous hassle. I have contacted support and the replacement phones have all had the same issues. Is this just an issue with the pixel 4a 5g hardware? Prior to trying this model, I had the Pixel 3 for 2 years with no issues. At this point I regret \"upgrading\" to the newer technology.\nCurrently the touchscreen issue for my latest replacement seems to have the input somewhere in the center of the touchscreen. The phone before this replacement had a similar input on the lower left quadrant. And yes, I have my software fully up to date.\n\nPlease help!!! Google will not refund the phone at this point (even though I have had 3 replacements since buying in November), and I don't know what else to do.",
