    "content": "When I record videos in normal speed and then edit them to slow the speed I can't access them. The editing software, stock and aftermarket, both go through the motions and save the final video but it's just a black or grey screen. When I try to play, in multiple players, nothing happens.  Edited videos also only show up in my Google photo album, not my Gallery app, which I never had a problem with on my Pixel 2.  When I tried to share a video from there to FB I found the same blank video. \nThanks",
