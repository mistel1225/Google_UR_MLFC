    "content": "My last time nfc usage was 1 week ago in Google Pay, everything was fine. Untill today NFC suddenly doesn't work.\n\nI have try different app include google pay and the problem still exists so it is not a particular app issue. \n\nTried Safe mode and doesn't work either. Dont want to factory reset my phone at this moment so I hope someone can give me a hand on this.\n\nI guess is the recent system update that caused this problem? The Feb 2020 update.",
