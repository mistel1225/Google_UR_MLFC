    "content": "I turned it off and when I turned it on a warning appeared about security. Want to know what is the default status. By default should it be turned on or off? I read somewhere that if it is turned OFF and if OTA update fails for any reason, mobile will get bricked and even technician can't help as bootloader can't be unlocked. But if I turn it ON, is it equally secure with Titan M in place?",
