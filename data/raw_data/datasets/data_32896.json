    "content": "I took a trip to Mexico and took a bunch of photos on my Google Pixel 2 only come back to the US and see that some of my videos flat out refuse to play and some of my pictures only part of them show. I don't know what to do and I am so done with this phone. It seems to have many memory issues from deleting a random contact everyday and now this. I bought this phone for it's amazing camera and unlimited photo storage but if Google can't fix simple things like actually saving contacts and photos I will have to move my business over to Samsung or Apple which seem to get a clue on how to get a phone to properly save a photo or video.",
