    "content": "Since the last Andriod update I have lost functionality of the do not distribute features. Sometimes it just turns on mid day for no reason l. Sometimes it won't block notifications. Sometimes I will get an email notification at 4 am despite it being in do not distribute mode.  \n\nIf I restart the phone every day it definitely reduces the occurrences but does not eliminate them. I'm to the point where I can't trust it to work and have to shut off my phone at night, which means I can't use it as an alarm.",
