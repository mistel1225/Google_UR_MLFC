    "content": "Hi, \n\nSince I have updated my GG pixel 2XL to android 11.0, there are many issues come up. Here is the detail:\n\n1. My phone didn't recognize the charger cord. I have tried to use this charger on another phone (which has type C too), it was okay except for my phone. So now, I must use the other charger has type C to charge my phone. Especially, when this phone is charging, it will auto power off. \n2. When the new call is coming up, sometimes I pick this call then the speaker is auto-enable.\n3. The bubble messenger of Facebook couldn't show multi-chat at the same time\n\nAs far as I know, GG 2XL will not receive any new update version, so how can I fix these issues above? \nOr how can I downgrade to android 10? \n\nFYI, I have tried to restore but nothing changed\n\nThanks,\nArya",
