    "title": "Pixel 3 wifi is super slow. iPad/laptop are fine. Wifi gets \"fixed\" when I turn it off and on again.",
    "content": "My Pixel 3 wifi's connection seems to be abnormally slow. Most of the time Chrome seems to handle the internet connection at a reasonable speed, but most apps like YouTube, Twitter, 1Password, system updates, seem to take an abysmal amount of time to connect to the internet.\n\nThis happens when I'm 2 meters in front of the router with nothing blocking me and also happens when I'm in other rooms. My iPad and laptop don't have this problem. My roommate's Pixel 3 also has this bug.\n\nOne workaround we found was to toggle the wifi off and then on again. This seems to work most of the time. For example, when I open the YouTube home page everything will be black and loading. Then I toggle the wifi and almost instantly everything loads just fine. Same with Twitter. This works on my phone and my roommate's phone.",
