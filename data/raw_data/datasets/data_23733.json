    "content": "Note: This is not a question about how to transfer files from my phone to my PC. I know how to do that. I also know that I can use Google Photos to backup my photos but I want to know about how to manage the photos when I transfer them from my phone to my hard drive through a USB cable. \n\nWhen I transfer files from my Pixel 3 to my PC, I am having trouble because when I look in the Camera--> DCIM folder, many additional individual folders are created. (This definitely happens when I use \"portrait\" mode but also seems to  happen randomly with other pictures). It is such a headache to try to extract each photo, photo by photo into a general Pictures folder from the individual folders. I would like to talk with the person who designed this organizational system....\n\nThanks in advance for any help you might have to offer.",
