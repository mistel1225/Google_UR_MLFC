    "content": "My pixel 3 can no longer install OTA updates of any kind. This started with the android 10 update - I had to factory reset the phone to get it to update to that. \n\nAnd now it has the same issue with the December security update - I've tried everything to get it to work - phone is always fully charged, and I don't interrupt the process - but it always fails. \n\nI've never rooted it or sideloaded anything - phone is 100% stock and I've had it from new.",
