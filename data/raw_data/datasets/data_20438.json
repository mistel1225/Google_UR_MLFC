    "content": "Usually I charge my phone once per day, and it lasts me a whole day. Suddenly, a few days ago my phone died only a few hours after charging it, and since then I haven't been able to get it to charge properly. I do not believe anything changed before this happened, however I cannot access my phone to look at the battery information because now when plugged in to a power source it simply goes between the white battery with a lightning bolt in it (saying that there is no power but the phone is plugged in), and a series of dots around a displaying 0%. Without me touching it, it seems to go between these two displays, and I can't seem to get it above 0%. Please help! I am using the same cord, same power sources that I always have, so the only other factor is the phone its self.",
