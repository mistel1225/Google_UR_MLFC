    "content": "My Pixel 3a doesn't charge till it isn't switched off and then continues to charge if i later switch it on. Over that, it also so doesn't start charging immediately, it takes a couple of plug in plug outs for it to start charging. i had dropped my phone and cracked and broken the glass, could that be an issue?",
