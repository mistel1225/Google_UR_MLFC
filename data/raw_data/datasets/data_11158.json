    "title": "Pixel 5 selfie video quality issue",
    "content": "Just got my pixel 5 few days back and notice that the selfie video quality is very blurry and is showing with a very high brown reddish color. Seems like it's not balancing the colors right making your face seem extremely saturated. This is very visible when doing video calls also via Duo app. I don't see this color and blurry issue with my pixel 3XL.",
