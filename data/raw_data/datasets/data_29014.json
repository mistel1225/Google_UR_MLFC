    "title": "My Pixel keeps shutting down immediately after booting up. Then repeats the cycle.",
    "content": "I have followed all protocol provided by Google to address rapid battery drain as well as Pixel shutting down immediately upon trying to boot up.  Soft, hard and factory reset included. Phone is now bricked and won't get further than almost to home screen upon boot up before displaying message in white box stating that the phone is shutting down. \n\nIssue has been \"escalated\" to higher Google support multiple times.  I was advised that I would receive an email from Google within 24 hours.  I reached out again after 24 hrs had passed only to be told to wait another 24-48 hours. I was then told to wait another 24 after this time had passed while being told the problem was being reviewed by a higher Google support troubleshooting department who is currently reviewing my case.  \n\nI've been a Pixel and Google advocate, but am not encouraged by the progress to this point.  Any advice from the community or similar experiences out there?",
