    "content": "I have had a Pixel 3 for a year and a half now, and it has worked fine until recently.\n\nEarlier this year, around mid-October, my phone started glitching badly. Without any buttons being touched, it would cycle between the home screen and the page that comes on when you hold the power button, and would frequently turn itself off. It would cycle so fast that it was almost impossible to navigate anywhere on my phone because the glitch would override any buttons I pressed.\n\nEventually, I was able to factory reset my phone through the menu that appears when holding the power and volume buttons while restarting my phone. (My phone wouldn't enter \"rescue mode\" or \"recovery mode\"; it just showed a screen with the android icon and didn't give any options to move forward. There was no \"safe mode\" option on the main screen.)\n\nFactory resetting my phone solved the problem for a while, but it has happened again several times since then, and is happening more frequently now. I have had to factory reset it twice in the past five days.\n\nIs there anything else I can do to fix this error?",
