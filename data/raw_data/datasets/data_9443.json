    "content": "I save videos from my phone to my computer and then edit them.  This worked fine when the files on phone were saved as VID.  After a recent update, my phone (Google Pixel 3a) now saves them as PXL files, and my PC does not recognize them. What can be done to fix this, other than a new phone or a new desktop computer.",
