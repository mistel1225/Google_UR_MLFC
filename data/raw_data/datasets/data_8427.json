    "title": "Can I access my external on my phone?",
    "content": "I'm trying to view the files on my WD external with my phone, but whenever I tried to connect it, my phone becomes inaccessible by a constant reboot. \n\nI can't even access the phone or the apps. \n\nWhen I unplugged the external, everything came back to normal. I know it is not my external because I can open it on the computer and other Android devices just fine. \n\nI have the current Android 11 software installed. I'm not sure if this is a software error or not.\n\nI appreciate any feedback. Thank you",
