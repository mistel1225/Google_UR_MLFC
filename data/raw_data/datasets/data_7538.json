    "content": "After years of using samsung galaxy phones, I switched to a pixel 4a this winter. I love the phone's performance, with the keybiard as an exception. The keybiard is f*cking gatbage. I have disabked gbiard, and have my keybisrd height set to Extra Tall, and I am consistently mistyping letters; a probkem I NEVER experienced with samsing. Wtf. Can I remedy this, or do I just throw this phone in the trash and go back to Samsing? Note: I left the typos in whike writing this as my example. Is it a faukty sensor in my screen, ir what's up?",
