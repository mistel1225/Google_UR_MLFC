    "content": "My phone's been having top speaker issues, I contacted Google Support and they offered to send a replacement phone, after a hefty $950 hold on my card, they sent me the refurbished phone, which out of the box had a shattered screen. Is it possible to just give them this shattered device back and keep my original phone as is, I'll have it sent to get repaired instead of dealing with their, apparently, unreliable customer service and refurbished devices?",
