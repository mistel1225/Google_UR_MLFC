    "title": "My very recently bought Pixel 3a doesn't start up. I live in Belgium. Where to send phone for repair",
    "content": "Phone arrived today. Sarted it up for the first time and worked fine, started setting it up. Had to go somewhere and when I came back the phone shut down and won't start up again. Have tried all different methods to factory reset or reboot. Nothing worked so far. Have tried charging it with the supplied charger, didn't work. I'm guessing there is a hardware failure somewhere. Would like to send the phone in for repair seeing it is still under warranty. I live in Belgium. The warranty pages keep sending me in loops. When I click the \"start the process\" button it just sends me to the google store home page. When I click contact support it sends me to the community page.",
