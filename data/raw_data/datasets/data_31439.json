    "title": "Constant issues with call drop off and connectivity on since owning a brand new Pixel 3",
    "content": "Purchased in November.\nReported issue of call drops in November.\nVodafone Australia notified that they cannot replace phone but once tested and if they find an issue they may provide me with a refurbished phone(absolutely disgusting).\nActions taken so far:\n1. Tested phone to check if any network issues - no problem. Problem continues \n2. Removed VOLTE - problem still continues.\nIt's 6 months and I have paid for a premium product only for Vodafone to say 1. They don't think anything is wrong.\n2. Even if it something is wrong I will get a refurbished phone.\nI am paying full price and I get a refurbished phone if they cannot fix.\nThat is the difference between a Google and Apple phone.\nDon't get me wrong I love the phone .... but it just does not do the basic function of making and receiving calls.\nI have lost friends via arguments, business opportunities because of this piece of **** phone.\nI need help and and need to ascertain if anyone reads this support desk message.\nI am frustrated to say the least. \nPlease contact me on this email.\n\nRegards,\nDylan",
