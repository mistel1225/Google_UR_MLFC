    "content": "While watching youtube videos full screen, the navigation bar at the bottom hides itself automatically but I cannot unhide it, until I pull down the notifications bar. \n\nI have the bar turned on as I prefer to have it, however in Android 10 I could swipe from the bottom of the phone (near the charging port) to unhide the bar and hit the back button. Since upgrading to Android 11 it will not allow me to do so. \n\nI have found out, that pulling down the notifications and releasing (going back to the video fullscreen) it will then work as normal.\n\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/11FzcW5Uq251SIsjoUeMfNmiCT1ROXdPt/view?usp=drivesdk",
