    "content": "I´m having a dreadful time with my pixel 2 recently.\nAbout 2 weeks ago, I had to do a factory reset (after several failed attempts at sideload) due to sluggish performance after the January update. With a fairly new install, 3 days ago I had one instance of lockscreen freeze, as described on: https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/12740836\nBut I was lucky enough to have a couple of resets bringing it to function again. Earliar today it happened again, and I couldn´t avoid the factory reset. It worked for a while, I tried forcing the February update, but got the lockscreen freeze again.\n\nThis is so stressing.... Should I just give up and get a new phone?",
