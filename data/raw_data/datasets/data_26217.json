    "content": "I recently upgraded from my trusty Pixel XL to a Pixel 4 XL.  All is fantastic except people that call me or that I call can barely hear me most of the time.  A word will occasionally come through with enough volume.  There is also lots of static.  This BT device worked perfectly with my old Pixel.  I can hear them fine, and podcasts and Music are fine as well. What can I do?",
