    "content": "Hi, I live in Israel and I am interested in upgrading my pixel phone to the latest Pixel 4. Google doesn't sell the pixel phone over here and I was planning to purchase one from abroad, but I have now read that Google did not receive an agreement from the government to use the radar motion sense features in its phone and I am wondering what features would be disabled if I still purchase the phone and use it here?\nThis issue is really disappointing.",
