    "content": "I went to my phone this morning to \"Play Music\" where I have downloaded about 300 songs and had a screen pop up saying \"\"Google Play Music is no longer available\". No warning for this by the way! It suggested I could transfer my library which I have tried to do but only 22 songs went across. And it appears I can only listen to music if I am connected to the internet.\nMy question is:\n1. Is there a music app that I can download that will allow me to listen to my 300 songs and not be connected to the internet?",
