    "content": "My PIxel 4 was broken the day it arrived. AT&T support had to escalate the issue to get it to connect, having me try a series of different APN's  until one finally worked. \n\nA few months later, the whole phone stopped working. A pop-up appeared stating hardware failure, contact Google. I was sent to a warranty center and they replaced the motherboard.\n\nNow, after the motherboard was replaced, my storage that comes with the Pixel has changed and my storage is full. These are photos taken on the PIxel and stored in High Quality (not Original). These are the directions to get unlimited storage.\n\nI have been contacting Google Support for weeks. I get the round robin, transferred to someone else, and they all say the exact same things.\n\nFunny enough, they even referred me to here. The support team has sent me to a forum to fix my issue, when the issue is with Google itself.\n\nSo, why does the best internet company in the world, have such terrible support?",
