    "content": "When my device has fully charged, the always on display shows \"Fully charged\" for say a couple of minutes, and then displays \"100%\" for a couple minutes. The display constantly alternates between the two until I unplug the phone. \n\nThe Pixel 3 I had previously always displayed \"Fully charged\" until I unplugged it.\n\nIs there an issue with my device or charger, or is it an issue with the always on display?",
