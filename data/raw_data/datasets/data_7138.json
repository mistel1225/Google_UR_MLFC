    "content": "HI all,\n\nI received my Pixel 5 on launch date yesterday and it's fantastic. I upgraded form the Pixel 3XL which I've always charged overnight on my Pixel Stand.\n\nI found last night that I was being woken by the room being half illuminated by the clock screen (The black screen with just clock and notification icons).\n\nI have set up the pixel stand with the pixel 5 to set 'Screen off when dark' but it seems the sensor or camera isn't picking up when it's dark? When I placed my finger directly over the camera area of the screen it would turn the screen off.....at a bit of a loss as to what to do?",
