    "content": "My Pixel 4 continuously plays my notification sound when sending a gif or video over WhatsApp and also when watching videos online on anything other than on YouTube, Netflix, Prime Video, Instagram and Facebook etc and I can't seem to turn it off or find out why I does it but it's really annoying as it covers the sound of said video that is playing",
