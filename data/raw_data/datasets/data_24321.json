    "content": "Since recently, whenever I get an incoming call and want to silence it and turn off the screen by pressing the power button, the screen goes blank, call ringtone is silenced, but after a second - the screen comes on again showing the incoming call. \nAdditionally to the full screen incoming call notification, I also see the popup notification on top.\n\nPhone app version is latest 33.0.249138098.",
