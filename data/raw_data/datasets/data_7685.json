    "title": "How do I turn down the sound for notifications, but leave the volume up for phone calls?",
    "content": "Most phones allow you to change the volume for your telephone calls and your notifications separately - for example, you can turn OFF the volume for notifications, but leave ON the volume for my ringtone. On the pixels it seems that notification and ring volume are linked as the same volume control. Is there any simple way to separate them? I have parents who are ill, and I need to receive my phone calls, but I'd rather my notifications were quieter, or even off sometimes. Please help. Thanks!",
