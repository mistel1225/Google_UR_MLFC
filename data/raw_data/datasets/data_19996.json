    "title": "Pixel 3 boot loop with no way to recover",
    "content": "Phone stuck in a boot loop - can't even switch it off (holding power does nothing). Holding Volume Down gets it into a menu with a big red triangle and \"Fastboot Mode\" written in red, along with some other stats. The highlighted option is \"Start\". Using any of the volume buttons to navigate the menu immediately results in another reboot, so I am unable to navigate to the \"safe mode\" or \"recovery mode\" options.\n\nPhone is getting very hot, wish I could at least turn it off. Guess I will have to wait for the battery to drain",
