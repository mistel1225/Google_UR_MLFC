    "content": "I basically am unable to restore any data from my old pixel phone to my new samsung galaxy S8. This pixel phone was stolen about 3 weeks ago. There is no option in the backups and reset to get the pixel data that is backup on my google drive to this phone. I was trying to get it on my PC somehow but I don't see a method. Basically I want the app data from my pixel backup there are very important recordings on there.",
