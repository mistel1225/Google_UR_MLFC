    "content": "I bought my Pixel 3 about a year ago, and a few months ago it stopped showing notifications for text messages. I am using the regular Messages app. I have checked my settings for Apps & Notifications and for the Messages app to make sure that notifications are not turned off in any way. I do get the dot next to the Messages app icon to indicate new messages.\n\nThank you for your help!",
