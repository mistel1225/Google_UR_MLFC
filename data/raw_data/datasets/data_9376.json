    "content": "I have recently bought a refurbished Pixel 3 because I had broke my last Pixel (a Pixel 2). \n\nAfter I have set up the phone I assume realize that the camera was out of focus unless I get up close to an object. I had this issue on my Pixel 2 as well.\n\nI've reset, troubleshot, changed the focus in the night settings, and none of these options have worked.\n\nI attempted to add photos to show the quality of the close-up compared to the quality of the far away shots but the file add-on button is not working as well.",
