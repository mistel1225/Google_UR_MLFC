    "title": "My Pixel 3a has the date and time set to be network provided and keeps changing to October 2000.",
    "content": "The time and date for my phone is set to be network provided.  Really since I updated to Android 10 the date randomly changes to a date in October 2000 and back.  I reset my app preferences, cleared cache, factory reset the clock app, etc. All of this temporarily fixes the issue but then it happens again same day or the next sometimes multiple times a day.  I switched off the network provided time and switched it back on which also fixed it temporarily but the issue keeps recurring.  My provider is Verizon if that matters.",
