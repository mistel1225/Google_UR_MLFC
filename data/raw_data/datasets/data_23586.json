    "content": "Really not sure if this question is in the right place but here goes. I just got my Pixel a couple days ago and had downloaded Discord on it. I attempted to join a call with my friends and plugged in the earbuds that came with the phone. It didn't take long to realize that no one in the call could hear me. I unplugged the earbuds and tried talking into the phone's mic, but they still couldn't hear. No matter what I did, nobody could hear me talking. I looked at Discord in the settings app, but nothing there seemed to be able to help. However, Google Assistant seems to be able to hear me just fine with my earbuds off. Could some one please explain what the problem is?\n\nEDIT: My bad, a Google Pixel 3, not 3a.",
