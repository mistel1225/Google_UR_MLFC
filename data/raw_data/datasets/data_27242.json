    "content": "Compared to the Pixel 3, the fourth family has only one selfie camera and autofocus has been removed from it, this is a minus, why remove it, what works better?  The question is open!  Everyone puts ultra-wide-angle cameras on smartphones, but Google thinks that zoom is more important to users - that's why the Pixel 4 just has a dual camera with the zoom that Apple has had since 2016, although Google insisted that they did not need a second camera for optical zoom, each  year they contradict themselves.  Next year, they will add a third ultra-wide camera and a self-focusing camera with autofocus.  Maybe the main camera in Pixel 4 is very good and it is slightly better than in the previous generation, but it would have been earlier if Apple had not worked out its deep fusion and night mode as it should on iPhone 11, in pixel 4 there is no such separation from competitors as  was earlier in comparison with pixel 2-3 versions, competitors worked out software algorithms.  The video, as it was 4K 30 frames, remained, the competitors already have 4K 60 frames on the front camera, but what the hell is Google?  put another sensor that can record 4K video 60 frames, purely for video, if the IMX 363 is so good for the photo part, leave it too, there is only two cameras in the back, and on the front, put the sensor up to 4K 60 frames, the prices are almost the same  same as Apple, but in the aggregate and in general worse!",
