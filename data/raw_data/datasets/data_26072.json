    "content": "As per title, no device seems to be able to find the 5ghz band when tethering my internet connection through my pixel 3. I tried with a PS4 and a laptop both capable of connecting to 5 GHz WiFi networks but unable to connect to the pixel 3 on the 5 GHz spectrum. Any ideas why this is happening?",
