    "content": "I have a problem with my Google Pixel 2 XL where incoming calls always interrupt my ongoing calls. For example, if I am talking to somebody on a call and then somebody else call me, my phone starts ringing and I am no longer to hear or speak on my ongoing call until I decline the incoming call. It's extremely frustrating.",
