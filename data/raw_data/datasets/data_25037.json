    "content": "For some reason my Pixel 4XL has not received the Auto Call Screen feature even though the phone is up to date. I have worked long and hard with Google support on this trying to understand why.  Google is stumped.  Is anyone else unable to access the new Automatic Call Screening feature on their pixel 4 phone? At this point I am going to have to do an FDR apparently and if that doesn't result in it appearing then I guess the phone is defective.    if anyone has any insight before i factory reset (which won't fix the issue i'm sure), i appreciate it.  I am guessing a phone replacement will be coming down the line if this isn't resolved.",
