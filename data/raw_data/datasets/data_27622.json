    "content": "Photos that I took in portrait mode and edited with Snapseed have vanished from my Snapseed folder. I cannot save any new portrait mode photos either, they appear in Snapseed very briefly but then poof, are gone.\n\nExtremely frustrating since I had so many photos in there. How do I fix this?",
