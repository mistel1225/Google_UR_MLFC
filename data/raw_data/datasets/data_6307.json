    "content": "Over the past 3 weeks, I've had 4 separate instances where I search for a name in the messages app to send that person a text. When I pull up the thread, it is completely empty. I've done several things to try to restore the messages, including clear storage and cache. Have been unable to restore them. I am backed up if I lost something vital, but my main concern is that it KEEPS HAPPENING. Any idea what I can do to prevent further loss?  Really don't want to set my phone to back up every hour over something like this.",
