    "content": "Up until last evening, the camera app and flashlight on my pixel 4 xl worked just fine. I was on Google duo and went to switch the camera to the back camera and suddenly it said my video was unavailable. Now the camera app and flashlight will not work on my phone. I did all the troubleshooting with force stopping the apps, uninstalling updates, clear cache, data, etc...nothing has worked and even opening app in safe mode doesn't work.",
