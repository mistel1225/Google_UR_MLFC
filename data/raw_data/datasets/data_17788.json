    "content": "My phone was working just fine all day until I called my mothers work phone and she tells me she is getting a call from me to her cell phone. After the call ended I go to check to see why my phone was calling her other phone and my phone did not turn on. Mind you I just called my mother around 3 minutes prior to this by using my phone. I'm thinking my phone went and updated my phone cause it was completely black but then I look on the backside of my phone and there are 2 white dots on my 2 cameras on the side. My phone is stuck on loading the screen as if you just updated the phone and the update is installing. Please help.",
