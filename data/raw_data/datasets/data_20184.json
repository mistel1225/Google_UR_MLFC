    "content": "I need to run two instances of Blink (Home Monitor) on my Pixel 3a running Android 10.  One account for my house and one for my neighbors while they're gone.  The best app so far is 2Accounts but after a reboot it doesn't alarm with an intrusion unless it's manually started.  Is there an app that actually works for Blink (preferably free)?",
