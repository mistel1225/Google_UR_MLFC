    "content": "My pixel 2 freezes each time the screensaver (digital clock) comes on and doesn't respond. I have to go to the boot menu and restart the phone each time. I tried a factory reset but that worked initially and the problem came back when half the apps were installed again. I can't change the screensaver either. Please help me if you can! Thanks!",
