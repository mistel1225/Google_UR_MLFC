    "content": "Hi Support,\n\nI bought a Google Pixel 4 less than two months ago.\nI must say it's the first time I've used Google Store to purchase hardware and also my first Google hardware and boy am I disappointed.\nGoogle Store says it can take up to 60 days to ship the HP laptop offer and my Pixel 4 has terrible screen calibration.\nI mean my fingers miss the right spot 80% of the time. Writing this message took forever and had to use word suggestions otherwise some words would be wrong.\nPlaying games is ridiculous and most of the time can't even close the in-game ads to keep playing.\nTruly frustrating.\nMy question is where can I go to get this fixed or replaced?",
