    "content": "I have a Pixel 3. The motherboard is bad, or so it has been diagnosed. I would like to replace the 64 GB motherboard with a 128 GB motherboard; they look identical. I'm wondering if it was possible for the two to be interchangeable. I would be doing the work myself and I'm comfortable doing it, I'm just wanting to verify if those two motherboards are interchangeable.",
