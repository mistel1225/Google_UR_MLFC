    "content": "In Android 10 and earlier, I could access my google drive from within the wallpapers app and changing out images weekly or whenever I wanted was easy.  Then after the update to Android 11 I can only access the preset images or from my photos.  I could access my drive on the device, download the image to the device, then find the image in wallpapers and set it but this process is cumbersome, eats up the device storage, and is markedly a worse experience than what was present in the previous version.",
