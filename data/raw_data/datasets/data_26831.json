    "content": "Hey,\n\nI accidentally dropped my beloved Pixel 3 yesterday and It has only been charging occasionally ever since. Most of the time it does not charge at all but the percentage does not go down if plugged into an outlet. Randomly the percentage shows 0% for some time and suddenly jumps back to the - I assume - real percentage.\n\nWill a  battery replacement resolve this issue or is it just a waste of money?\n\nI am well aware that I will lose any warranty when opening the phone and replacing the battery, but because it dropped it I will not get a replacement device anyway.\n\nAny help is greatly appreciated.\n\ncheers",
