    "content": "I updated to android 11 last night. Ever since then, I can't open/see recently opened apps. Every time I try to connect to support it says the chat is closed. Then this morning I connected to someone and they told me to clear the pixel launcher cache and then try to boot in safe mode. I did all of that and still nothing. When I swipe up it just opens to the most used apps and shows all my apps but recently opened is no where to be seen. Anyone else experiencing this issue it got ideas on how to fix it?",
