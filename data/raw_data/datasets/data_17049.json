    "content": "My Pixel 2 started randomly rebooting 2-3 weeks ago, usually when an application access the camera. Since then it has been happening more and more often, and more often without trying to access the camera. I severely limited access to the camera to see if a rogue application was guilty, but still it happened.\n\nFrustrated, I completely reset the Pixel 2 to factory defaults today, and have the same problem, before reloading any other applications and without even accessing the camera.",
