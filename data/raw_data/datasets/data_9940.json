    "content": "Hi. I ran into this issue for the first time with my Pixel 3a. I press the power button and it gives me an Android Recovery screen.\n\nHere is a graphic recreation I made of what I see  ->  LINK\n\nIf I select Try again, it boots my phone up normally however I run into an issue where after a minute or two - the device will begin to lock and unlock itself constantly. This results in me unable to control the phone at this point, constantly spamming a cycle of turning on and off at the lock screen by itself.\n\nI'm a bit lost at what I can do to resolve this problem. I would go ahead and pick Factory data reset but there are files that I really don't want to lose I have saved on the phone.\n\nI've tried sifting through different potential solutions on the internet but certain processes seem convoluted for different devices. Can someone inform me on any way I can approach this situation with my 3a?",
