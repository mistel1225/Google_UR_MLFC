    "content": "I have two Pixel 2s - one for my personal number and one for my business. The personal one gets way more use and is not in great shape (short battery life, some dings, etc) while the business one, which just sits around, is practically new!\n\nI want to swap them. How do I do this? Can I just remove the SIM cards and swap them?",
