    "content": "My current phone is a Pixel 2. When the Pixel 4 comes out, I plan to buy that (directly from Verizon). In the past, I've manually set up each new Android phone I've owned, but I'm a bit jealous of my kids who update their iPhones automatically. So I'm wondering whether this will be possible going from the Pixel 2 to the Pixel 4 (or if it was from 2 to 3, which would likely answer my question).\n\nMy goal is to choose some settings (as is done with IOS) and then after waiting even a few hours to turn on the Pixel 4 completely configured identically, to the extend possible, just like the Pixel 2 it was copying, including all Apps and App groupings.\n\nCan this be done? If so, how?\n\nThanks in advance.",
