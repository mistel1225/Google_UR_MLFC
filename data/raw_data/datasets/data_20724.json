    "title": "June 2020 Update's 'Bedtime Mode' effecting usability of multiple alarms for different days",
    "content": "Scenario - Prior to the June 2020 update to my Pixel 3 XL, I had different alarms (with different times) set up for certain days of the week (ie. MonWedFri - 8:25am and TuesThurs - 7:45am).\n\nThe new Bedtime mode only allows me to set 1 alarm/wake up time (that disables 'Do Not Disturb') for the morning, so if it's set at 8:25am, it ignores the 7:45am alarm.\n\nPrior to the update, I had noticed 'wind down mode' would end at the defined time OR at the earliest alarm time. This seems to be gone now.\n\nWas this an omission on purpose or accident? And is there a workaround while making use of the Bedtime feature?",
