    "content": "Where are voice-mails stored and what is the capacity?  I keep getting notifications when I open my VM that says my mailbox is almost full.   I just looked at my VM's and there were 20 of them adding up to 15 minutes total.  I've had the phone for about 2 years but this is something that only started a few months ago.  Also, is there a way my VM's can automatically get emailed to me?  I know I can send them one at a time but if there was an automated process I'd use it in a heartbeat.  Oh, the phone/voicemail app is the one that came pre-installed on the phone.",
