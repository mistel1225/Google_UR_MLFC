    "content": "Can anyone get file transfer working on 4a 5g via Usb cable to pc or laptop? I tried different cables (a and supplied c), ports and devices, all failed. I can progress from usb charging to transfer files to another device, but then nothing beyond.\n\nIt is either software or hardware issue with phone. Phone paired ok and Bluetooth works, it just wont show up in Decice Manager or File Explorer in Windows 7 or 10 on laptop and pc. \n\nA factory reset as last resort suggested but that may not work if hardware problem. Before try would be good to know if it works at all. 2 hours of technical help has so far not resolved.\n\nThis is important as cable is quickest and most convenient way and can do offline.",
