    "title": "Battery taking 8+ hours to charge without restarting it.",
    "content": "This is not a consistent issue and is only a couple weeks old but it seems so odd. Sometimes the phone charges fine, sometimes like this evening, I pick it up after 45 minutes of unused charging and I've gained 5% and it tells me it's going to take 17+hours to charge to full. Restart my phone and I'm at one hour and twenty odd minutes to full charge. Restart always seems to fix it. The first time it happened I just thought ah well my phone just needed a restart, always a healthy thing for a computer no big deal. But I'm restarting my phone about every second day now. I don't really want to do a factory reset. Are their other options for me that might fix this? The timing for when the issue started seems a little too close to the last update for comfort but I don't know the likelihood of that as the cause. Feeling frustrated and looking for suggestions. \nThanks",
