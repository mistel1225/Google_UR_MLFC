    "content": "Does anyone have issues with the Gboard keyboard typing inaccuracy? For example, when I am typing a word and hit space bar, I am hitting the letter 'b' or 'n'? Or when my intent is to hit 'r' and I get an 'e'?\nOh and by the way as I was typing this, I had to correct my words; I don't know how many times, I lost count. Ex: When I was typing 'hit' I had spelled 'hot', etc.\nI remember my HTC phone keyboards had a calibration feature that fixed these crappy soft key keyboards and it was pretty good.\nIs the Gboard wanting us to use the suggestion feature instead of typing correctly? \nThe issue is when you type two words and end up with a 'b' on the middle ( ex: hellobworld) and your almost to the end of your sentence and noticed that you spelt it wrong like 5 words back. You either just press enter and let it be wrong and fix it, or you hold the delete button until you get back to the error and re-enter your words. Lol.\nBit for God's sake fix this. I had this issue on my Pixel 2XL and now on my Pixel 3. You would think that since the pixel 2XL had a bigger screen, it wouldn't be an issue. Maybe I just need to learn swype. SMH.",
