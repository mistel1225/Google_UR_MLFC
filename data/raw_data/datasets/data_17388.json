    "content": "Using My old pixel 2 xl (sim card removed) as a WiFi only tablet.  Everything was great until I tried to use google message. It won't let me send or receive texts, It says to install a working sim card.  Messages works great on my wife's samsung tablet (which I could install a sim card on but have not).  I need to use my current active phone number to send and receive texts but on this old pixel.  Is this a built in issue with hardware or a carrier issue, or is there a switch I can activate and get messages working on my WiFi only phone?  Thanks for any help or suggestions\nMark",
