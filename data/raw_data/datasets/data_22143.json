Installation worked OK but the phone is not accessible in \"File transfert\" mode.\n\nWhen i connect it , in the device manager i see it as Google 3a in \"mobile devices\" section of device manager for a short while  , but a few seconds after it is then moved in the \"other peripheral\" section as \"unknow peripheral\"  with a warning icon indicating it is not installed correctly.\n\nCan someone help please?\n\nBest regards.",
