    "content": "Hi All, \n\nGoogle Pixel 2 was charging overnight. The touchscreen became unresponsive.\n\nI booted it up into safe mode - didn't work.\n\nI factory reset it - didn't work. \n\nI never had issues with the phone before. I believe there was an update recently. I do not have a screen protector and the screen is not cracked nor has the phone been near any water. \n\nAny help would be welcome. Thanks!",
