    "content": "Hi. I've read recently that Camera app v7.2 is being made available for more phones in the Pixel range. My P3a had a camera update the other day and I expected to get V7.2 but looking at the app I'm still on v6.3.026.265696615. What version of the camera app should I be on with the P3a.? Phone is standard retail version from Google UK with Nov 5 update. Andy",
