    "content": "I was told my problem was escalated and I should wait from an email from the senior support team, but the email hasn't arrived, and I don't have any other way to contact google.\n\nThe chat representatives are dismissing my requests and ignore my complaints, and the last session was ended by the representative abruptly.\n\nMeantime my pixel phone is not functioning almost two weeks, after coming back from a repair.\n\nIs there a way to contact the senior team directly?",
