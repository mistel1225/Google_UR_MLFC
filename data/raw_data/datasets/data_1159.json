    "title": "Once my battery gets below around 50% it will regularly drain down to 0% within seconds.",
    "content": "On occasion my phone will suddenly and sharply drain and shutdown within 3-4 seconds from about 50%. I've tried all of the battery tests and updating all apps / system with no results. There doesn't seem to be a correlation apart from using apps. It doesn't deplete in rapidly sleep mode however. Google maps and Chrome have been causing it most recently.v\n\nAny thoughts? Thanks!",
