    "content": "Searched the posts, but all the hits seem to be for different issues. I'm a bookseller using my phone for product photography. In my photos I'm getting three or four greenish-brown vertical bars of discoloration. Sometimes they move horizontally while I'm waiting to take the shot. I experienced this once on an older Galaxy phone (7?) while using a 3rd party camera app but it went away when I switched back to the regular camera, so wondered if there's a setting I'm missing in the Google camera or a different camera app that would process it differently?\n\nI'm using CFL desktop lamps in a flourescent-lit warehouse space, same as I was with my previous Galaxy S9 that didn't have an issue with it. All my other photos elsewhere look great. I can get the bars to disappear by nudging up the brightness bar on the right, but it's a tightrope to over-exposure. \n\nBelow is a quick shot of what I'm usually getting. I know I need a better lighting setup (soon), but the end pics actually look great after adjusting white balance and knocking out the background in post. The discolored bars remain, though, so any thoughts on getting rid of them would be amazing. ",
