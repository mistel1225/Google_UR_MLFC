    "content": "I have a first gen pixel that is constantly rebooting, crashing, restarting. So i did a factory reset, didnt instal any extra apps besides what the phone comes with and it still wont stay on longer than a few mi utes withouy crashing. So i rebooted and did another factory reset, and after it crashed this time, i rebooted in safe mode and the phone worked fine. Again, there is no extra apps that i have downloaded. Rebooted out of safe mode and of course, it started crashing again. So the pjone qorks fine in safe mode but not in normal mode . Cant go in and deleye any downloaded apps becaise i havent. So what processes do i need to stop or get rid of from the main pixel processes to stop my phone from crashing? -",
