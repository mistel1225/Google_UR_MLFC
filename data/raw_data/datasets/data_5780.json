    "content": "My phone showed that the latest security had been paused due to lack of WiFi connection. So upon reconnecting with my home network I went into system updates and clicked on the resume tab, few seconds later it paused again and the resume tab appeared. It's stuck on 0% of 68.4mb. and just will not install, has any one else had this issue and found a solution without needing a full factory reset?",
