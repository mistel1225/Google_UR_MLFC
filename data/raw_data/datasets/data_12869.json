    "content": "Android 11 on a Pixel 3XL with Verizon...\n\nI have my Do Not Disturb set to only allow calls from contacts, however all calls still come through.\n\nFurthermore, in the phone app>settings>blocked numbers, I have the toggled the switch to block calls from unidentified callers, yet all unknown/private/restricted calls still come in.  \n\nFrom what I'm reading, DND just doesn't work for all so I'm skeptical, but who knows? Maybe there's a magician out there that can help.\n\nAlso, does anyone know what the expected  behavior is if DND works as intended? Does the phone show that there is a call coming in and just not ring? Or does it just appear in the recent call list, with no live indication of the call?  What does the caller experience - rings and then voicemail, or straight  to voicemail?\n\nThanks in advance for any input.",
