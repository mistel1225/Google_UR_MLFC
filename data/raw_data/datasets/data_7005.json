    "content": "Not sure when it started but my Pixel 3 now plays the default notification sound while the phone is playing the ringtone sound on an incoming phone call.  In the past the phone would only play the default ringtone on an incoming call and I would like to change it back so that I only hear the incoming ringer sound when I get a call.  I cannot figure this out and I'm hoping that someone has a solution for me.",
