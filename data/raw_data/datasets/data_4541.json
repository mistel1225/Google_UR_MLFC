    "content": "Every few seconds a screen interrupts what I am looking at.  The screen says \"Display over other...\".  I have rebooted the phone twice and it is still happening.  The Verizon store said it's not a phone issue but a google issue.  I have a Pixel 2XL and I see it's not even listed as a device option.",
