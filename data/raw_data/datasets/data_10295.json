    "content": "My new Pixel 4a phone does not obey either of these instructions to close one/all open apps:\n  Close one app: Swipe up from the bottom, hold, then let go. Then swipe up on the app. \n  Close all apps: Swipe up to the middle of your screen, then swipe from left to right. On the left, tap clear all.\nRight now, I have to go into Settings/Apps and disable each open app one at a time. \nWhatever happened to the \"global\" close option as on my old Nexus phone?",
