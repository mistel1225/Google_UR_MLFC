    "title": "Inability to block texts from spoofed numbers",
    "content": "I get spam texts, probably about 10 a day, that are from spoofed numbers, I think.  In any case, I get an alert that a text has arrived that the app (apparently) thinks is spam.  So I have to go respond by blocking the number it came from which does no good.  If this were gmail, spam texts would go  directly to the spam folder with no intervention  on my part.  Until that happens, spam text detection is not very useful.",
