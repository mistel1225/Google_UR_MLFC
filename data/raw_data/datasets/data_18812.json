    "content": "I received a replacement device and it's defective. The battery won't hold a charge and I can't use the phone unless it's plugged in. I've been going back and forth with Google for a month. I've sent in multiple bug reports and you told me to call Assurant. They want to charge me $99 deductible to replace a phone that is defective. This is completely unfair. You sent me a bad product. I need to have this replaced and have the deductible waived. Your customer service is very limited, but I haven't been able to get through to anyone and now your chat function appears off. Please get back to me about this!",
