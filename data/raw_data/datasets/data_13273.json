    "content": "I am quite eager to purchase a pixel 4a but my carrier does not seem to \"support\" the pixel 4a e-sim feature. But their website does mention that the network \"is compatible with any eSIM device that complies with “Remote SIM Provisioning Phase 2 Standard” issued by GSMA\"\n\nI would like to know whether the pixel 4a supports this standard. \nIt'll be great if anyone could provide information on this. I couldn't find anything online but I'm sure the user manual in the box would include some details.",
