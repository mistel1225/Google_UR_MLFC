    "content": "I installed Android 10 on my Pixel XL today and the webpage download function in Chrome no longer works - it says \"Downloading\" but never finishes.  Downloading pages as PDFs via the Chrome print function still works, and I can still download apps - it's only the webpage download function (activated by the downward-facing arrow) that's broken, so far as I can tell.",
