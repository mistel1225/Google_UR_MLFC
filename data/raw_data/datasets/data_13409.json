    "content": "I have deleted the .nomedia files AND factory reset my phone, which I already find unacceptable as a fix. No supposed \"fix\" has done anything. Just when can I expect any sort of update to fix this? As far as I've heard, this was an issue since the beta, and it still hasn't been fixed.\n\nAs an added bonus, my battery seems to drain fast AND multi-tasking no longer works.",
