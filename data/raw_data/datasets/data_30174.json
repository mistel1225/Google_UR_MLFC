    "content": "My Google Pixel 2 XL seems to have a strange habit of shutting down in the middle of the night for no real reason. I put it on my charger that I have put it on sense I had it and then I found out that this thing occasionally shuts of in the middle of the night.\n\nThis is an issue for me because I use it as an alarm clock in the morning. I am not sure why this is happening. If I had to guess it is because if it gets too low the screen stays on all night and drains the battery faster then the turbo charger can handle and then it just dies because this doesn't happen that often but it does seem to happen if I place it face down on my bedside table.",
