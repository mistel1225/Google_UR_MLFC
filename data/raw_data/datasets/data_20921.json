    "content": "I read an article there was something called fast share that was supposed to replace it but this was June of last year and it obviously hasn't happened yet. Also looking around the internet I'm supposed to be able to use the files app. But using that app and opening up any file I get no option of sending a file to someone else. I just want to be able to send a file from phone to phone without having to upload it to my Google drive and then sharing it with them. Drive is so slow with their very limited bandwidth. I really like my pixel but why can't we have this simple functionality that Apple has had for years\nThank you for any help",
