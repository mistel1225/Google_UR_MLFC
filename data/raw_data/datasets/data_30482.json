    "content": "I am travelling overseas and my phone suddenly stopped being able to connect to both wifi and its mobile network.\nI have a 3 UK sim and my own Australian sim - both of which were working until last night.\nI cannot find a single wifi network even though on my laptop I can see plenty and am easily connected to one now. The wifi icon just has a question mark over it.\nI cannot connect to mobile data or network using either of my sims. Both of them have plenty of credit/data. Mobile roaming is definitely switched on. \nI have tried the following:\n- changing sims\n- the reset WiFi, mobile and bluetooth function\n- restarting my phone in safe mode\n- full factory reset of my phone (I am devastated because I have lost all my recent photos - since the phone couldn't connect to backup).\nI have tried to contact pixel support - but of course the primary way of doing this is via the device itself, and with its connectivity issues this won't work. \nI have tried through the internet via this link https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/7109524?&ref_topic=7084203#contact=1 - but for some reason can't find the 'contact us' link that is meant to be on the top right hand of the screen.\nSo now I am stranded overseas without any connectivity - not to mention my phone had a lot of my trip info saved. \nI am very frustrated as there is no way of contacting google for support!",
