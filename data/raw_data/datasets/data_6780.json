    "title": "Question regarding pop-up \"Device infected?\"",
    "content": "Hello, \n\nI was on yellow pages and clicked on a website linked to the restaurant I wanted to visit and it brought me to this website that asked me to share my location. Then, I received a notification from Chrome that said \"Device Infected ?\" and asked me to check my settings. When I clicked on my settings, it brought me to \"mobile-av.com\" but I did not click on anything I just closed the window. I then put my phone in safe mode and check on Google Protect to make sure. However, I am wondering if that \"Device Infected\" was something that Google pixel is known for sending users when they are on less recognized sites. I guess I am a bit nervous and worried that my phone might be infected somehow \n\n\nThank you",
