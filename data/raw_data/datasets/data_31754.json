    "content": "I just bought and received the new PIXEL 128GB from ebay seller 2 days ago. Within these 2 days using, I find 2 issues as blow, One is the battery only reach 99% after the full charging, the other issue is the battery drain quickly, for example, I just watch youtube around 10 seconds, the battery could drop 10%, and on the back top of glass plate is warm I felt. \n\nAs I have another PIXEL 2 which is using more than one year. I think the new PIXEL which I bought 2 days ago is sth wrong in its battery.\n\nCould GOOGLE help me to solve this problem, please?\n\nThanks!\n\nSam",
