    "content": "With the recent update, I am no longer able to transfer files from my Pixel to my PC. It worked fine just prior to the restart after the update. It makes a physical connection because I can seethe device in Devices and Printers but it never shows up in File Explorer. When I use the Windows trouble shooter, it comes up with something like old \"Samsung Notes\" driver or something like that. Anyone else? Thanks",
