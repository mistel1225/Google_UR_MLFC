    "content": "My Google Assistant is very slow to respond. It often doesn't answer at all (as if it doesn't hear me) or it takes a while before it'll give me an answer. It's really annoying and almost redundant then. I will ask it for the time or weather, or the news, and by the time it reacts to my voice (screen lights up, looks like it's thinking, etc), I already pick up my phone to check it myself because it took so long. I also have a Google Home and that answers immediately, and it's older. How can I optimize my Google Assistant?",
