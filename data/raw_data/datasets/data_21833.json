    "content": "I've been trying to play music with my aux cord and the USB type C cord attached as usual, and sound only comes out my phone not through the aux cord and speakers in my car or Bluetooth speaker. I've tried safe mode, factory reset and nothing has changed. I need help. I've also spoke with several support employee's and got disconnected with the last trying to restore my phone. What is there left to do that could fix this?",
