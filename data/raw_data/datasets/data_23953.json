    "content": "I upgraded my Pixel 3 XL to Android 10 yesterday and have activated the full gesture navigation. \n\nI am noticing that on the homescreen, the applications or folder that are in the lowest area aren't very responsive unless I either tap a few times or raise then close the launcher. \n\nIs there a sensitivity setting for this or could this be a possible bug? Is anyone else experiencing this? \n\nAndroid 10 on my Pixel XL and Pixel 2 XL do not seem to have this issue.",
