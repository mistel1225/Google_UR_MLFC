    "content": "Both my email accounts are linked to my Google Pixel 3A. The backup account was accidentally made the default account I've been looking through the settings trying to make my primary Google email account become the default and I can't figure it out. I think I'm going to try deleting my backup and signing in again.. possibly became default because it was the first account logged in. It's such a process is there actually a setting for this?",
