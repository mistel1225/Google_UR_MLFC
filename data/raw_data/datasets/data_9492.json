    "content": "Pixel 4a call/.../setting/add setting/caller id greyed. Anybody has this issue?\n\nGoogle support could not fix it. Phone carrier can't either....\n\nSometimes it would work but 99% of the time it stays greyed out. If I swap hide/not id. It goes greyed again\n\nTried \n-updating call app\n-factory reset\n-even got a new phone (exchange)\n-carrier said the feature is turned one\n-tried a another sim\n\nMy prev pixel 2 has no such issue.",
