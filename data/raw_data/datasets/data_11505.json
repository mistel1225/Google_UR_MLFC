    "content": "I pre-ordered my Pixel 4a and received it a week after the launch, so I have had it for about a month.\nEverything worked fine, no problems.\nNow, about a week or two after first having it, the Volume Up button wouldn't work, so I had to first lower the Volume and then make my phone Louder on Screen.\nThat was not that much a problem.\nI then get my new Phone Case (dBrand GripCase), put it on, and had it in my Pocket for ca.2 hours, and some weird sounds were coming out of my top Speaker when I wanted to listen to something.\nAlso, when I wanted to call someone, and used my top speaker, it wouldn't work and I didn't hear anything. I checked my connection, my Volume, and everything should have worked, but it only did on my lower speaker.\nAlso, sometimes the Phone just randomly restarts, but that doesn't really bother me.\n\nThat's it, I hope you can help me!\n\n(I'm not a native speaker, so sorry for the mistakes )",
