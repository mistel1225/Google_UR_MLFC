    "content": "I've restarted my phone multiple times. It used to work afterwards but now it won't do it, even after restarting it multiple times. The equalizer in YouTube Music works along with my other apps. Why is it only a problem with Google Play Music? This has been an issue not just on my Pixel 3 but was a problem on my old Pixel and even my Galaxy S6 edge.",
