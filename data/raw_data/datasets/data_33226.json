    "content": "The phone has been working perfectly for the past 3 month, but suddenly it started freezing on the lock screen. I also reboot it and it starts working again, but the freezing on the lock screen continues.  I have set the phone in safe mode, but the same problem showed up. I have factory reset it but the problem continues. Please let me know what I can do about it.",
