    "content": "turning stabilisation off in the camera settings dose not completely disable stabilisation. I'm guessing there are algorithms that remain on as my footage is still  being manipulated , ive done some research and think it might be to do with the \"look ahead \" algorithm. ive attached a video to help explain why this is an issue to me. are there deeper settings i can access or do i need to abandon pixel 3 a for a different phone?\n\nhttps://vimeo.com/384242254?activityReferer=1",
