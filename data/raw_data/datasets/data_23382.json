    "content": "I clicked \"download and install\" on the Mar 2019 security update. When I looked a minute later, the phone was off.  It never turned on again.  Plugging it in to wall or computer, holding the power button down for awhile, or power+volume-down, all did nothing.  The battery before this was around 55% and I haven't had battery problems so that's not an issue.\nThe phone is about 21 months old so out of warranty but was working perfectly before this update.  From my phone call with the support people, it sounds like Google isn't going to take responsibility for this problem.\nI'm guessing there's no option other than to replace the phone (I'm taking it in to check) but I at least want others to be aware of this, and post if they have the same problem.",
