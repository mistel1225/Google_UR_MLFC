    "title": "Pixel 4 XL (and 2XL) Randomly Turning Volume All The Way Up When Connected to Bluetooth Headphones",
    "content": "As the title says, today my Pixel 4 XL and my sister's Pixel 2 XL have randomly turned the volume up to max while connected to Bluetooth headphones.  Mine are Bose headphones and hers are Skullbuds Earbuds.  I was watching YouTube and it didn't do it, and then when I was listening to Spotify for a bit it deafened me (luckily I'm a sound engineer and I'm used to loud sounds). My sister had it happen on Pandora.  When I try to turn it down it usually goes right back to max. After a few seconds it will let you turn it down, though.  A few minutes later and it will turn the volume all the way up again! It's very annoying. Today is the first day today I've been updated to the new update, so I'm think that is it. I did see a post about this problem on the Pixel 3 but there was no solution. Also, I'm on mobile so sorry for formatting, spelling errors, etc.",
