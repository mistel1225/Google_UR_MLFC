    "content": "My phones charging port will hardly work. Im having a hard time to put it on charge. The port is clear of debris/ lint. Earbuds will not work. It only works will one single cord. Even then i have to fiddle with it for about 6 minutes to get it to charge. I have turned it off and back on. Do I need a replacement port or something?",
