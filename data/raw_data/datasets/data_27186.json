    "title": "got latest update; random phantom screen inputs makes device unusable, even if factory reset.",
    "content": "I got the latest update several weeks ago and thought all was going smoothly. Recently, I noticed the ambient screen became a little 'jumpy' as if someone was tapping it to login. As of two days ago, it became unusable. Not knowing if there was a rogue app, I performed a factory reset. When trying to go through the initial setup, the random phantom screen inputs remain and I'm not even able to make it through the setup screens. I haven't dropped it at all. Only other interaction is washing it with a little water for less than a minute; IP67, right? Lost as to what is wrong with it.\n\nAny suggestions is greatly appreciated.\nThanks,\nDavid",
