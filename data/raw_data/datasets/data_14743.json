    "content": "What should i do if, when trying to transfer videos from my phone to my laptop via cable, the video file says \"pending\" as part of the file name ? it doesn't transfer at all onto my laptop (macbook, btw) in the little file transfer window it also says that the video file takes up 0 space, but on my phone everything plays perfectly... i'm *pretty* sure this is only happening with video, not images. Haven't been able to find anything on this issue, so i hope it isn't an obvious, stupid question. \nthanks for any help!",
