    "content": "Hi im living in Pakistan currently on a Pixel 2 XL. \nI wanted to buy a Pixel 4 XL and wanted to know if motion sense would work here. \n\nAnd the reason i ask is because Pixels never launch officially here hence im still confused as to whether it will work or not. Pakistan is not in the XDA list but neither are countries like UAE etc either.",
