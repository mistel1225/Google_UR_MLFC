    "content": "I have Android 9 in my pixel and it is up to date.I'm able to connect  to a WiFi network but once I'm connected though, it takes forever for things to load, if they load at all.If  I turn off WiFi and use mobile data instead, it loads things almost instantly.\n     I  did reset my network settings and restarted my phone.I also tried reconnecting to my WiFi network after turning it off but problem remains.My other home devices have never ever had an issue like this connecting to the same WiFi network.\n      Can someone please give me an answer.Because I just bought this phone.",
