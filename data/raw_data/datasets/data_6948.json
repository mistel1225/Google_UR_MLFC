    "content": "I recently bought a Pixel 4a 5G direct from Google, and installed my T-Mobile SIM card in it, under the impression it would be plug-and-play with the unlocked Pixel. I've experienced a bunch of network issues that I have not yet been able to rectify. This is my second attempt at asking for help. I'm speculating i may have some ignorance to the best way to utilize the Pixel on Tmobile. I have included a summery of the issue, as well as my T-Mobile debugging to date below:\n\nSummary of issue(s): \n1. I don't seem to have to have reliable data/cellular connectivity (even after adding a new APN configuration per TMObile's recommendation) in places i would expect it; Denver CO, Salida CO, etc. \n2. I do not have the option to configure Wifi calling. How can I get access to wifi calling on the Pixel 4a 5G. Both google and TMobile documentation references selections that are not available in my OS.\n\nTMobile service feedback: A call into TMobile support sent me to an APN configuration page, to build a custom network configuration. It is basically identical to the default Tmobile APN that came native. I still do not seem to pull 5g in the city. I often see an H+ next to the network icon top right. TMobile also mentioned that wifi calling is only supported if the Pixel is bought from Tmobile? Am i missing firmware? Do i need to buy the hardware from Tmobile? \n\nDeBug logic: My brother owns a 4a on Tmobile and does have access to Wifi calling. Both Google and TMobile say Wifi calling is obtainable on their websites, but i do not have any configuration options in my current Android OS.\n\nPossible remedies: Do i need a new SIM card? Do I need to buy the hardware direct from TMobile (this is what i was told to obtain the Wifi calling feature). Do I have a defective Pixel?\n\nMany thanks in advance! I really hope i can resolve these inconveniences on the most expensive phone i've ever bought. And quelle any ignorance I may have, or defects the device may have.",
