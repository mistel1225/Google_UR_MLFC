    "content": "As far as the connection problem I have tried forgetting the device from my phone and resettingy speaker. I have made sure the media option was turned on for my speaker on my phone. My next problem comes into play here. When I adjust my sound using the buttons on the side of my phone it shows I'm adjusting ringer volume and not media volume. The media volume slide does come up next to it in a darkened tone. When connected to a device it the media slider does not have the Bluetooth symbol as it previously had. These are new problems for me this phone has paired with this speaker and played music many times before and the sound buttons used to adjust media and I'd have to go into settings to adjust ringer volume. Any suggestions are helpful because I'm at a loss!",
