    "content": "My Pixel3 phone was notifying me that the storage is full but I ignored. \n\nRecently, it shut down. When I tried to turn it back on it said something about data being corrupt and asking for a factory reset. \n\nIs there a way I can get my photos before doing this? I tried side loading an OTA image but without success.",
