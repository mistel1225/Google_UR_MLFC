    "title": "Why does my pixel 4a drop 1% every minute or so while im doing simple tasks on my phone?",
    "content": "I got my pixel 4a a couple of months ago and ive been charging it from 20% to 80%. I think I may got some issues with battery draining cause after I disconnect the charger, battery drops very rapidly without doing anything with the phone. When I do any random daily task with it I feel it doesn't keep up with \"the promised\" battery performance. Tried searching online some common solutions with it and it seems other users with the same problem resolved it reflashing the rom. Should I do the same or is there any other solution that won't risk me bricking the phone",
