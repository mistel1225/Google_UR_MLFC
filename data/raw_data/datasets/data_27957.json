Every attempt just sends me back to my home screen.\n-Can't update any apps as the Play store crashes every time I try.\n- Phone is not ringing when I receive calls.\n-Battery is draining quickly and charging extremely slow.\n\nTried restarting in safe mode and had the exact same issues. Is there a fix coming or has anyone found ways to correct these bugs.",
