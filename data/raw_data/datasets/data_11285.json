    "content": "My pixel 3a was not charging and under warranty, so I sent it to a google repair shop as I trust them more than uBreakIfix. The phone was fixed but it came back with its bootloader unlocked and a message on restarting that my pixel3a security might be compromised. The play store is also no longer certified and it doesn't allow me to downloaded Netflix and disney+. Please help me how to fix this problem. Google repair agents gave me a new problem that I didn't have before.",
