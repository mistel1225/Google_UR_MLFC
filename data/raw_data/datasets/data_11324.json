    "content": "Former iphone user, and I love my pixel.  With app/internet navigation, I am used to swiping from left to right to go back; right to left to go forward again.  But with my pixel, both directions take me backward.  I found where I can turn the swipe nav on/off, but not change what they do.  Any help?",
