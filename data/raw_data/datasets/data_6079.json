    "content": "I have to use my pattern to open any locked folders on my phone. I verified my fingerprints are loaded and accepted. I can use fingerprint sign-in for my Norton AppLock also on the phone. My system folder no longer locks. Inconsistent & very confusing. Please help. Maybe a patch/repair in the next update??",
