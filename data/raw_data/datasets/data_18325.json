    "content": "I've just downloaded the official Android 10 update on my Pixel 2. After the installation, it prompt me to restart the phone. I proceed to restart my phone and now it's stuck in the G logo loading page, and would not get into the home screen. I've tried a couple of things, and listed the outcomes below.\n\n1) when holding down power button for long duration, \n- it just keep looping the Google and G logo page.\n\n2) when holding power + volume down buttons,\n- Start: goes back to G logo loading page\n- Restart bootloader: back to Bootloader page\n- Download mode: back to bootloader page\n- Recovery mode: a quick google page then goes straight to \"No command\"\n- Barcodes: showed 3 barcodes\n- Power off: phone shut down\n\nWhat should I do now? FYI I'm from Australia.",
