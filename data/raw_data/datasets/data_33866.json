    "title": "Pixel Buds failing to connect to anything",
    "content": "When I have my Pixel buds in their case, they charge, the case charges and they can connect to my Pixel 2 XL without issue but a few seconds after I remove them from the case, they disconnect and I have to reconnect them while they're in the case. Along with this, the touch pad on the right earbud isn't working, even during the short period that they're connected to my phone. It also seems they can only pair if forgotten by the device and only while the charging case is charging itself. This same issue occurs with all devices I try to pair them too. If anyone has come across a fix for this issue it would be greatly appreciated.\n\nRunning Andriod version 9\nPixel Buds firmware version 2.2148.154-GMR-61508-545",
