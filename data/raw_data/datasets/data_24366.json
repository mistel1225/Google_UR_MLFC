    "content": "I have no idea as to what to do. Have experimented with the camera a lot and all images, especially taken indoors with medium light or outdoors with low light turn out very grainy and as such the subjects in the photos don't have a structure. Can't believe it's pixel camera and that's what worries me. \nDo not know if it's just my phone's camera.",
