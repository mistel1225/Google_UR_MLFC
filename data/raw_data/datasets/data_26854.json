    "content": "Hello\nWhen locked, my screen is always just black - it never shows if I have messages, missed calls, emails, WhatsApp messages, etc.\nI have set it show all Notifications, and UK Chat got me to reset App defaults, but nothing.\nI know that, unlike my old Samsung S4, there is no LED that can show you when you have a pending message, and this is a major loss of functionality for me.\nI am missing lots of messages and this is very frustrating. \nAny suggestions would be gratefully received.",
