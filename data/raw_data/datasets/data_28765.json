    "content": "I am getting very poor battery life on my mobile with screen on time ranging between 2hrs 30mins to 3 hours. I have tried reboot the device in safe mode but of no use. Even the microphone in my device doesn't capture the voice properly. The other party always complains that my voice is not audible. \n\nIf any body could help me to solve these issues?",
