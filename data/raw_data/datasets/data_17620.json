    "content": "My Pixel 2 apparently crashed this morning and got stuck on the Google loading screen.\nNeither a soft reset or the bootstrap is functioning, it just got stuck on that screen.\n\nAny ideas what could be done?\nI'll be leaving the phone home, let it drain the battery and see if that helps in any way.\n\nP.S. I'll not be able to look at the post for a couple of hours untill I get home.\n\nEdit: I got into the bootstrap, booted it and currently functioning again.\nAny ideas what caused this?",
