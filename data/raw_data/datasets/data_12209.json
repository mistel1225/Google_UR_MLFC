    "title": "How do I downgrade from android 11 easily as screenshots are hard/not working on pixel 4",
    "content": "Count this as a bug report and a question.\n\nI want to downgrade back to 10 because screenshots have become nearly impossible and when it is working, inconvenient. It crashes on apps I use, playback issues have become a problem, and my friend's older devices have had a dramatic performance drop. Is there an easy way to do this or does it involve software work (I'm nearly willing to chance bricking this now POS at this point)\n\nThe main thing that's making me angry is taking screenshots. The new gesture feature doesn't work for screenshots for 1. 2, The pixel 4 has the volume and power button on the right side of the phone. I'M RIGHT HANDED! I have to switch hands just to take a screenshot and I can barely do that because it doesn't register it half the time. If there wasn't a fix beforehand, I'd be like \"okay fine\" but no... You had the hold down menu on the power button that gave us screenshots, but removed that calling it \"clunky.\" How is the double button press and the weird gesture bs any different?",
