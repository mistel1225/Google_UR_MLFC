    "content": "Hello. I just received my pixel 4 and have noticed that on a black solid wallpaper or background there appears to be what looks like light bleeding at the top and bottom of the screen. It's yellowish in colour and about 1/2 cm. I can only assume my screen is faulty but I just wanted to ask if anyone else has had this issue? I've tried to take some pictures of the issue and will attach to this post. \n\nCheers. ",
