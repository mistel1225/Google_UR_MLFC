    "content": "Hi. :)\n\nGoogle Pixel says \"no service\". I can see my IMEI, also tried different simcards, which are definitely functional, I can see the phone number from simcard, but Pixel still says \"no service\". Newest Android P, reflashed entirely.\n\nPlease help me figure out if this is a hardware or software issue.",
