    "content": "Hello Google\n\nI love my Google pixel 4a..☺️ \n\nI am trying to pause few apps to save my battery life which is working fine but the problem is that it remains only for few hours.. like 24 hrs approx. next day again the apps I paused get's functional. So my question is.. shall we increase the pause duration or shall we set a perticular window on timely basis that the selected apps will always remain paused during that period\n\nThanks\nAtul",
