    "title": "Pixel 1 Randomly Shuts Down. OK in Safe Mode but can't back up.",
    "content": "I have an original Pixel 1 phone that randomly shuts down and won't come back up unless it's connected to a charger or external battery all the time.\n\nIf you run the phone in Safe Mode, it works fine; it doesn't shut down and doesn't need to be plugged into external power. After rebooting it, I disabled all non-essential apps but that seemed to have no effect.\n\nI want to try a factory reset so I tried to back it up to Google Drive, but when I attempt that I always get the error \"Couldn't back up data. Try again later.\" Clearing the drive cache doesn't actually seem to do anything, either - it just runs forever.\n\nAny ideas on how to fix this?\n\nThanks.",
