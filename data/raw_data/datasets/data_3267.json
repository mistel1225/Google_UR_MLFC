    "content": "Hi, \nWhen you used to perform a search using the search bar widget (not the Chrome widget) you used to have the option to 'Open in Chrome' either via a long press on a link or via the 3 dot menu in the top right. Neither of these now have this option. \nI used to use this all the time.\n How can I get this back? I don't really want to have 2 search bars on my home screen.",
