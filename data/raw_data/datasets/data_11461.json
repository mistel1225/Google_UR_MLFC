    "content": "Even though after trying multiple pin-codes the only thing i got to notice is \"Currently Out of Stock for the *PINCODE*\". Is this kinda stuff really appreciable??? Since, many of the people in India has been awaiting for the Pixel 4a. \n\nIn addition, these kinda waiting decreases the customers interest towards buying \"Pixel Phones\" and head towards other smartphone brands.\n\nIf the Pixel 4a needs to outshine in India, then please get the product ASAP!!!!!!\n\nFLIPKART \"NOTIFY ME\" is useless as it doesn't even notify us even after the product is available.\n\n***********************************Get back PIXEL 4a IN STOCK************************************",
