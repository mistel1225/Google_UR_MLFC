    "content": "My Verizon Pixel 3 is taking FOREVER to connect a call after I hit send since I updated to Android Q.  I'm taking like 15-20 seconds!  I've never had this issue before and my wife's Pixel 3 which is also on Verizon is having no issues since she has not installed the Android Q update.",
