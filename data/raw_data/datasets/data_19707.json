    "content": "My phone has no problem ringing. When it rings my display doesn’t acknowledge that there is a call. I have no way to answer it. I go into my call log and as soon as the caller hangs up it shows up in my recent calls. It does not do it all the time just most of the time. When it does it correctly, the caller is in my contacts. But, it does also happen to calls in my contacts. \nMay be related. I have an alarm set to go off every day at 3:00 so I can take meds. It worked great in the beginning, but now it only vibrates at 3:00. No sound. It seems to have started the same time my calls got messed up.",
