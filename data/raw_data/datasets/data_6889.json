    "content": "Both of my Pixels and I've heard of other's Pixel are freezing up on this subscription web based search application.\nWith my old Pixel I switched to many other browsers,  each eventually would freeze up.  Heck my phone froze up just now trying to copy the address to report this to you.\n\nThe people that run the web application cant find the issue either with many attempts.\n\nI truly need help this and I look forward to being able to thank you for fixing this issue!!!!!",
