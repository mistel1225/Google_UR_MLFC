    "content": "All of my incoming calls are going straight to voicemail as if my phone is off when it's not. Do Not Disturb is not on and I've reset my phone as well as resetting network settings. This has been going on for a couple of weeks now and I didn't realize it until I checked my voicemail and had over 20 messages! I contacted my carrier and everything was fine on their end. I can make calls and send/receive text messages. When I go to the phone app settings and go to calls and then additional settings it tells me there is a network or SIM card error. I've taken the SIM out and re-inserted it and the issue remains. However, I did notice 3 scratches going down my SIM card and wondered if that could be the issue? But why would I be able to do other things?",
