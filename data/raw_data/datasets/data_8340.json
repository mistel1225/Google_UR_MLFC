    "title": "Pixel 5 adaptive brightness",
    "content": "Along with having the battery percentage bug I have an issue with the adaptive brightness \nThis is my second pixel 5 and same issue so I'm guessing it's across the board .\nI have reset both phones and restarted from scratch with no change .\n\nTaking the phone from a really dark environment e.g pocket into bright environment e.g daylight or office lighting and the Auto brightness takes so long to react . Unlocking with fingerprint I cannot even see the screen because the brightness is on the lowest and it takes 5 or more seconds to start brightening.\nI put next to a 4XL and ran a lux app on both and you can see how smoothly the 4XL reads the light change but the pixel 5 is really delayed and jumps up in aggressive increments .\nSurely I'm not the only one experiencing this or id think I'm going mad .\n\nHope this can be addressed in the next update , along with the battery percentage bug .\nIt's making using this phone hard",
