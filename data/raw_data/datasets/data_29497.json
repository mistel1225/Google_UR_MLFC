    "content": "Google Support Inquiry: Case ID [7-0557000026448]\n\nHere are the timelines:\nPhone ordered: 11th May\nPhone delivered: 16th May (did not get the trade-in kit with the phone)\nTrade-in kit delivered: 10th June (after 3 follow-ups)\nPhone delivered to Google: 14th June\n\nGoogle did not send me the trade-in kit for 4 weeks, I contacted the support center 3 times just to get the trade-in kit delivered. After getting the trade-in kit, I posted it back and it reached google in 4 days.\n\nThe promised value was $249, while I received only $55. They have cited the reason that the phone was sent back after the 30 days window. By the time received the refund, the time for returning the phone was also over, and I bought the phone only because it promised a good trade-in value for my old phone.\n\nI have raised this to the Google support team and have been following up with them for a month now - they do not have any response other than \"we have third party, they are looking into is. They are investigating the case, etc.\". Though in my emails I have sent them all the proofs of the delivery dates for trade-in kit, my old phone. The Support team is not helpful at all, all the responses I received from them look like some automated/copy-paste responses. This was my first experience of buying a Pixel phone and it has been a horrible one so far.\n\nThis is really frustrating, and there is Zero transparency in the process and Zero accountability from Google on this.",
