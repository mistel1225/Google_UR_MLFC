    "content": "I would like to see Google add a native automatic (sunset to sunrise) dark theme option.  Other devices like Samsung phones with the One UI and even the iPhones with iOS 13 have the sunset to sunrise dark theme option.  Just blows my mind that Google didn't have this feature with the launch of Android 10.  I have submitted this feedback on my Pixel several times.  Will keep submitting it as well so hopefully they will add this in a update in the near future.",
