    "title": "Can not clear Voicemail notification icon on Pixel XL after Android 10 update. How can I fix?",
    "content": "After upgrading my Pixel XL to Android 10, I received a call today and was left a voicemail which brought up the notification icon. After listening to the voicemail, I deleted the voicemail (I have 0 voicemails now) and after ending the call, the notification stayed on at the top. I can only make it go away by turning off the notifications for voicemails (as shown in the photo) but after about an hour or two, I get the notification with sound again in the top corner and I have to turn off notifications for voicemails again to make it go away. I have repeated this process about 4 times now. I have tried to clear the cache for the Phone app but this didn't fix the issue. My service provider is StraightTalk. Any idea on what I can do to fix this?",
