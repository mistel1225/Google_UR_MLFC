    "content": "I love my PIxel 5, but I am having trouble having calls on speaker phone (which I do all day long when i am working from home).  When I set my phone down on the table (right in front of me) people say they can't hear or understand me.  I did not have this problem at all on my PIxel 3.  When I pick up the phone, everything is fine.  I can't imagine how placing the phone (screen side up) on a table would interfere with the microphone, which is at the bottom of the phone and not obstructed when i put the phone on the desk/table.  The speaker is fine, but I when i set it down, the problems begin.  Any thoughts?  It sounds like a minor problem, but I spend a lot of time on my phone and prefer the speaker to headphones.",
