    "content": "Hi. I recently got Google Pixel 3a because of it's amazing camera quality. I use it for my gaming youtube channel to record facecam and i mostly record 30-40 minutes of footage to max 1 hour and then edit them. I have never had problem like this on samsung and iphone devices... I record the video and when i reach about 15-20 minutes recording stops automatically after showing me the message that says something about overheating. I know many phones get hot while recording and it's normal but can't i do anything so recording won't stop?",
