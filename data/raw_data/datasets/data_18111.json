    "content": "i went swimming with my 4xl and an error msg about liquid/debris detected. the phone then suddenly turns off. tried turning on a couple of times. a few times the phone boots and then turns off by itself again. the third time i tried to turn on the phone, nothing happens. after an hour of trying to get rid of liquid in the phone, the phone was still warm, even though there is no display. i then tried to charge the phone. that is when the green screen with a question mark on the battery logo appears. its been continuously blinking green screen with that battery logo till now. \n\ni bought my phone in singapore but currently living in malaysia. im anxious that i have to send the phone to service which might lead to a factory reset, cos i havent backed up my current data yet :(\n\nenlightments would be very grateful.",
