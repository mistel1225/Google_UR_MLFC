    "content": "Haven't seen this specific issue in posts. I have pixel 2 and husband has 3a. He turns phone off every night while charging; I just use DND. I'm up later and send texts to his phone after he's turned off. They've always shown up in morning when he turns phone on, though of course there's no time stamp.\n\nA few days ago we noticed texts that I send after his phone is off show as sent on my pixel 2 but NEVER show up on his pixel 3a, whether SMS or MMS. Once his phone is turned on and I resend, they go through.\n\nI know this is a small issue compared to some, but it's very frustrating cuz I don't know what he has received and what he hasn't. I realize the simple fix is to tell him not to turn his phone off while charging at night :D  But it's a habit that's hard for him to break!  And it doesn't make me wonder if it's happening with other friends or family that have different phones or just between he and I.\n\nWe're both using Google messages for this and our carrier is Verizon. We have unlimited data so data and Wi-Fi are always turned on. We've updated the messages app, cleared caches, and are on the latest OS. Any other ideas? Don't really want to reset? Phones as we're not that skilled (and haven't backed up, etc). Thanks!",
