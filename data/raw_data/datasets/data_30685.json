    "content": "I have bought a Belkin fast charger (27W Watt Power Adapter, Model: F7U060vf), it lists Pixel 2 XL as supported on the side of the packaging. I also use a Belkin USB C to USB C cable. Sometimes the phone charges when I connect the cable to the phone, sometimes not. Also, more often than not, the phone turns off after a couple of minutes charging. I can then turn phone on again while still beeing connected, but then it shows no charging, sometimes. Other times it keeps charging as normal, only to turn itself off again after a couple of minutes. I experience this with 2 different USB PD 2.0 supported chargers, also I have tried 2 different cables. USB A to USB C cables in standard USB non PD chargers works perfectly. I have tried factory resetting the phone, that made no difference. Sometimes also the phone turns off immediately after connecting the cable, and wont turn on until I remove the cable. All of the equiptment I use clearly state \"Supported fast charging\" and is bought in authorized stores. I have read this forum, but that only lists a lot of people having the same issue. I live in Norway, so no official Google Stores to talk to.",
