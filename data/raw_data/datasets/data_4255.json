    "content": "When I am using incognito mode on my phone, the circle icon that usually displays the symbol/logo of whatever website I am on (eg. The Google logo is displayed when it is a Google search) is displaying the logo of my uni I am not at university because Covid. I have logged out of all school accounts on my phone. I have removed all uni related sites from my history and I have refreshed and turned off my phone several times but the problem still persists. I don't know if it's an issue with the display, ie my phone is not connected to the uni there's just an issue with the symbols/icons for tabs or if my phone somehow is still connected.",
