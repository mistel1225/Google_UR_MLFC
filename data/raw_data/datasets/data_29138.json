    "content": "I reboot my device so many times, turning on and off of the aeroplane mode again and again. But I still can't connect to any WiFi. I can still use mobile data, and I can still connect to the WiFi with other devices. This patch is supposed to improve the stability of the WiFi connection. Anyone has the same issue?",
