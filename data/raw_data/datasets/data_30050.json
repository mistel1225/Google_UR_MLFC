    "content": "I have heard about turning off hearing aid accessibility that apparently sometimes enables itself in phone app settings but it wasn't turned on. I have tried the sound amplifier mode only to find out it is meant to amplify sounds around me by using headphones. And after that I think it still might be a software issue. I'm running the newest Android Q preview but in using it for quite a while now and this only started happening today. Do I have any chance it could be worked around any other than by using headphones or fixed in software or do I have to get a third party repair it (I bought it from a reseller with a note from Google that was in the box that apparently resellers don't sell devices eligible for repair under warranty)",
