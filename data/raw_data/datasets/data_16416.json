    "content": "Got a new phone.  Main profile data transfers with cable, without a problem.\n\nCreated the new profile on the new phone, went to transfer data, and can't find a way to actually transfer from one profile on the old phone to the same new profile on the new phone.\n\nBegs the question of \"why even have profiles if you can't take them with you?\".\n\nFortunately for me, the profiles are for separating apps and I simply have to log back in, so no data loss, just a tedious pain across 3 different profiles.\n\nHowever, if a parent sets up a profile for their kid who plays games, there is no way to transfer the progress to the new phone??\n\nMaybe I'm missing something, but mum's the word on Google searches.\n\nHas anyone successfully copied a profile from an old phone to a new one?",
