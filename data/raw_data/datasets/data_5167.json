    "content": "I have Bluetooth enabled speakers paired to the phone. Media sound goes to them perfectly well, no issues. However I cannot get the audio from voice calls inbound or outbound to go to speakers. (I'm using the default phone app)\n\nWhen I paired the speakers I granted them all permissions it asked for.\n\nI can't find any option in the Phone app or System about voice call output. It always seems to just go to the phone's speakers.\n\nAndroid 11, Bluetooth 5.\n\nI think there must be a simple option I haven't selected but I can't find it. Anyone know?",
