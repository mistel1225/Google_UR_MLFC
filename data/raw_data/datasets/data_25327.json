    "content": "To Whom It May Concern:\nWe are Staten Island Technical High School students in the Science Engineering Research Program (SERP) working on designing a research project that will explore the effects that virtual reality and augmented reality have on students’ learning. We know that you are very knowledgeable on Virtual Reality and we’re hoping you could assist us with our research. Is it possible to schedule a demo with the company to see what you offer and to discuss further options? In addition, is there an email contact that we can get in touch with? We look forward to hearing back from you soon.\n\nThank you for your time and consideration,\nLauren Peysakhova, Leah Livin, and Maya Lyatunovskiy\nSERP students",
