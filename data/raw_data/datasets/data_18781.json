    "content": "Has anyone fixed this issue? I have reached out to chat and did all recommend resets even the factory reset and problem still persists. My screen is cracked so they will not take it back in to fix it, but recommended I contact a repair business. My speakers work for music, videos but not voice calls. I don't see how a repair of the speakers will fix this issue.  On another note who is unhappy with Google each time they waste several hours on support chat!  I know I am again for the 5th time in one year.",
