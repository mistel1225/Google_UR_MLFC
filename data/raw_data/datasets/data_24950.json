    "content": "There are around 12 GB of images in my Pixel XL phone. I want to upload the images to my PC so that I can free up space in my phone. When I connect the phone to my PC with a USB cord (and follow instructions) I don't see the folder with the images that I want to save to my PC. I see a folder with screenshots which I copied to my computer but not the images or the photos in the camera.",
