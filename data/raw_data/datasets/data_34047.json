    "content": "I put my phone on the side, picked it back up and it had stopped working. \n\nThe screen was black but it would still vibrate. When I called it i could hear it ringing on the phone I was calling from but it wasnt ringing on the Pixel 2. Really disappointed. I have moved over from Iphone and at this rate wouldnt have another. Google are saying that my phone isnt covered as it is over 12 months old- it is 13 months old. \nI dont know where I can go to to get help with it as google doesnt have stores and doesnt have a way to contact them like Iphone. \n\nAny recommendations?",
