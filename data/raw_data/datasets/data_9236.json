    "content": "I'm looking for a way to transfer a thread from messages on the pixel to my pc (windows) other than screenshots). When I google it, suggested are downloads like droid and decipher. Is this the best strategy or is there another way? I haven't tried anything yet. Looking for recommendations. With gratitude, thank you in advance.",
