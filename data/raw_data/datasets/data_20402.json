    "content": "For the past few months, whenever I connect any pair of Bluetooth headphones to my pixel 3 XL, it buffers and cuts out. I have also noticed that the cutting out and buffering become worse when I move around or move my phone while wearing the headphones.\nAt first I thought it was my headphones but I've used 4 pairs of headphones and I have the same problem everytime. They work fine on my computer too. \nI have tried forgetting all Bluetooth devices and a factory reset and nothing has worked. \nI just bought the new pixel buds and now it pauses the music randomly and tells me what time it is and what my notifications are.\nWhat the heck is going on?",
