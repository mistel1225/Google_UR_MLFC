    "title": "Pixel 5 goes into fastboot mode every time it's rebooted. How can I avoid this?",
    "content": "I'm trying to have a normal restart or reboot, rather than have the \"Fastboot\" screen come up each time. I can eventually get out of it by holding down the Power button and the Volume Down button while fastboot has \"Start\" selected. But this is really annoying. I don't want to see fastboot come up at all when I do a Restart.  What's going on here?  Thanks!",
