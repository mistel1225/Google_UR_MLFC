    "content": "Suggest and request not to release Google Pixel phones in India or do not provide access to Airtel users especially, in India.\nThe Airtel supports lower and cheaper cost phones from Samsung, Nokia, Motorola and Xiaomi but not Google Pixel phones.\nIt's over 2-3 years am requesting the Airtel network and Google for giving a VoWifi support on Airtel, but always I gets an answer to shift to other network that supports VoWifi and VoLTE. \nWhen the answer is to shift to other networks, what is the purpose of releasing phones in India and tie-up with Airtel?\nSpending thousands and thousands on a premium Google Phone, the satisfaction is less on usage and with poor network support and connectivity. \nThis is not a feedback but an ask to make sure Google discusses with Airtel and get the  devices supported for VoLTE and VoWifi. The network is pathetic and lots of call drops.",
