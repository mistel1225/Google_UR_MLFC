    "content": "When I wake my phone and swipe up to get to the home screen, I have to swipe from the very bottom to 1/2 way up the screen. Very frustrating. This is in contrast to my Pixel 3 which required only a flick of the thumb. \n\nI don't understand why this is even a feature. What could too short of a false swipe possibly cause other than a potential unlock failure? \n\nIs there any way to fix this? \n\nThank you",
