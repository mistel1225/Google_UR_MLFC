    "content": "One day the phone no longer vibrated for any reason. The mechanism can be faintly heard sometimes, it is either detached from the chassis or at reduced power or something.\nHave tried with no luck the following:\nTurning on and off. \nInternet research.\nThe various triggers to make it vibrate etc. \nNothing makes it shake the phone. \nHave checked all the settings.",
