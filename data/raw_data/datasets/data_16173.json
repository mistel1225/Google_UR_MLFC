    "content": "I am purchasing a Pixel 4a due to arrive by Sept 30 / October 1,  however I already received the packing to return my Pixel 3a xL. Obviously, I can't be without a phone for over a month. I'm assuming once I get my new phone THEN I'll return the Pixel 3a XL for whatever credit I can get,  Correct?",
