    "content": "I am upgrading my old Pixel 1 to a Pixel 4a. \n\nI removed the SIM card from my old Pixel, and put it into the new Pixel 4a per instructions. Easy peasy.\n\nI'm sending in my old phone for trade-in value (such as it is), and the trade-in instructions clearly say that I should not have my old SIM card in the phone when I mail it in. Makes sense, I need it in the new phone.\n\nBut the new phone (the Pixel 4a) came with a SIM card of its own, which I had to remove to put my old SIM card into the new phone. What do I do with that new SIM card? Destroy it? Throw it out? None of the instructions mention it.",
