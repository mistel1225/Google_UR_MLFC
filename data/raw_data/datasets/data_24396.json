    "content": "My Pixel 4 used to unlock when I simply looked at it.  A recent update (day or two ago around 12/16/19) happened and now it won't unlock when I look at it, I have to press the power button first... how do I get back the \"face-only\" unlock?  I don't seem to see an option for that.",
