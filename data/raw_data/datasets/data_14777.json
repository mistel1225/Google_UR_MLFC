    "title": "Phone locked in portrait mode after charging",
    "content": "So basically this started after the android 11 update. after plugging in my phone to charge, my phone got locked in portrait mode, I unplugged my phone to check what's going on and still it was locked in portrait mode. I went on youtube and saw a force rotate button so I clicked it and it just told me my phone is locked in portrait mode. I've tried everything to fix this like deleting android system webview which was suggested by some guy in the community. The only TEMPORARY solution I've found is restarting my phone EVERY time I charge it. Please help, thanks!",
