    "title": "How can I make all of my photos automatically be stored in ONE folder?",
    "content": "On my phone, all of my photos are automatically sorted into different folders that I never created. For example, there are separate folders for Camera, WhatsApp Images, WhatsApp Video, Download, etc. I cannot figure out how to arrange my phone settings so that it consolidates all of these different folders into just one folder. It's a nuisance having to repeatedly move all the images into just \"Camera\" rather than the phone do it automatically. It is especially a pain because I want my Dropbox app to be able to automatically sync my phone's pictures onto my Dropbox, but I am struggling being able to get my Dropbox app to recognize my phone pictures since they're all split into different folders. Many thanks to whomever can help!",
