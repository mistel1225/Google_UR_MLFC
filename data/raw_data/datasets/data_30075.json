    "content": "every time i turn my phone on and unlock, the device's touch screen becomes completely unresponsive. The power buttons still work, however the device can't be locked, only turning off the screen. Note that the screen stays responsive until after the device is unlocked. The phone works fine in safe mode, however the problem persists after a factory reset. This has made the phone completely unusable. Any suggestions are welcome.",
