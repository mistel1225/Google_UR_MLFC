    "content": "I would like to limit the battery charge on my Pixel 3.  Example:  limit charging to 85% of battery on my Pixel 3.  I could not find a setting to do this.  Ideally this would work with cable and/or wireless charging.  Is there a setting to stop charging at a user defined threshold?",
