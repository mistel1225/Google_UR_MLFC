    "title": "Complain about Pixel Technical Support",
    "content": "I had seek help through live chat with Pixel Technical Support Team (Surya) which started to help me at 4:45pm, however, after 4.54pm's last reply she just disappeared and did not provide with any further instruction nor let me know if I am suppose to wait and finally, i left the chat at around 5:20pm. I also did not receive any follow up email from her on what had happened with the non reply. It is very unprofessional and disappointing to receive such service and its a waste of people's time. I cannot find any outlet for complain and hence would like to seek help in escalating this to prevent such issues from happening to anyone in the future. Please advise.\n(Pictures are chats in chronological order from top left to top right then bottom left to bottom right)",
