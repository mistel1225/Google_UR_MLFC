    "content": "Anytime I play games on my pixel the touchscreen locks up in the bottom portion of the app. I have to swipe up from the bottom in order to input into the game as if changing apps. In doing so I have a 2-3 second window before the inputs don't register again. Specific apps include MTG Arena, Retroball and Crosswords. My hypothesis is that they interfere someway with the OS.",
