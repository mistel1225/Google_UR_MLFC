    "content": "I'd like to be able to attach a photo as custom attachment to a contact. I'm not talking about the main contact pic that you see in the little circle in your apps. Just like you can add a custom field like \"inside leg measurement\" can I attach a photo (eg. of my friend before he shaved his beard off)?",
