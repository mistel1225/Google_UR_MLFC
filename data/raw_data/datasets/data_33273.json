    "content": "I have a pixel 2 XL phone. I used to be able to go into the contact and assign a certain ringtone to that person. now and I hit on the three dots it tells me that the app is missing to do this. I was trying to take some bloatware off of my phone and probably to deleted this app. The ringtones that were already assigned to my contacts are still there and working. I just can't sign any ringtones new contacts because the app is missing. I've contacted Google people twice and they have tried 4 hours and did not know what they were doing. I could reboot the whole phone back to the original and probably get the app back, but I don't want to lose things are on the phone. Can anybody tell me what the default app is for the Google 2 XL phone to open up the ringtones. I can go into the folder and see the ringtones but when I click on it it tells me the app is missing to open it. Thank you and have a great day",
