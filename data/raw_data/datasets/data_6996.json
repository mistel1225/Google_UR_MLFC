    "title": "Twice now my phone has rung after I've muted it. I'm not using Do Not Disturb. How to prevent?",
    "content": "I muted the phone by pressing the volume down key all the way down before a doctor's appointment. The phone rang at its usual volume (while I was in the doctor's office, unfortunately). The call was spam. This happened before several months ago. I've checked all the sound settings and can't see anything that would cause this. If there's not a solution, I will have to turn my phone off before appointments, concerts, etc., because I can't trust it not to ring.",
