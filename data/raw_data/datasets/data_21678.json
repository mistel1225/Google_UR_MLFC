    "title": "My Pixel 2XL Charging Port has stopped working suddenly. HOW CAN I FIX THIS?",
    "content": "With the entire country under lock-down my Pixel 2XL has suddenly stopped working. I have been facing issues with the charging port over the past week. The headset connector that comes along with the box initially stopped working, initially i thought it might be because of some issue with connector. My battery died a few hours back while I was working on my phone and later when I tried charging it wouldn't show any signs of charging. I tried charging a different phone from the same charger, the charger was working. I tried a different C type charger to charge my phone and it still didn't work. I even tried cleaning the charging port but there was no end result.\n\nThere's lot of inconvenience caused. I tried to read through  this  forum hoping to find a fix instead I see several people complaining about the same issues. \n\nWhat is the solution to this problem and how long will it take for the problem to answered and fixed?",
