    "title": "Wifi toggle button turns off randomly, and cannot turn it back on (Pixel 3).",
    "content": "The wifi function on my wife's Pixel 3 turns off randomly, ie, the 'Use Wi-fi' toggle button turns off. When we turn it back to 'on' wifi does not in fact turn on. Exiting out and going back to the Wi-fi area confirms that the toggle button is back in the 'off' position. \n\nHer phone has the latest Android version 11 installed. We have tried restarting the phone, and restarting in safe mode. We have also 'reset wi-fi mobile and bluetooth' settings. None of these steps work. Nevertheless, if we persist at turning the phone off and on then eventually wi-fi can be turned on. But the problem will occur again before too long, and without warning, so that my wife uses a lot of mobile data before she realises the problem has occurred. \n\nAnother thing that happens when we are working with the wi-fi function (as we try to troubleshoot this problem) is the phone sometimes displays an error message 'UI System isn't responding', and we have to click 'close app' to return back to the previous screen and continue using the phone. \n\nMy Pixel 3a is fine, and we have no connectivity problems. The issue is definitely with the phone, hardware or software. I have read online about this problem, and other users have found that a factory reset does not help, so I am loathed to try this due to the inconvenience involved. Some people have speculated that it may be a hardware issue. The phone is less than one year old (purchased in May 2020). \n\nAny help would be appreciated.",
