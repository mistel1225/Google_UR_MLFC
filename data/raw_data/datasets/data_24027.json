    "content": "I know you can easily switch off the esim temporarily, but why isn’t this possible for the regular sim?? It seems that the only way to do this is to actually remove the sim card from the phone, which is very inconvenient. Wouldn’t it be possible to have this functionality? I have an old Moto with Android O and two sim cards, and each of them can be switched on and off independently.\nBest regards.\nJ.",
