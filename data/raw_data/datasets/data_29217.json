    "title": "Pixel 2 not charging when turned on. Switched itself off while 20% battery remaining",
    "content": "For the last few weeks, when my battery goes below 50% or so, I have to turn it off to recharge it.\n\nIf the phone is still turned on, battery below 50%, the \"device charging\" text appears, the battery charging icon appear... However, after 1 hour, the percentage will have dropped by 1 or 2% instead of increasing.\n\nIt looks a lot like https://support.google.com/pixelphone/forum/AAAAb4-OgUs908ouH1Chb0?hl=en\n\nAnd then yesterday, it switched itself off overnight, while there was ~20% remaining yesterday. I could not start the charging again, despite the mobile being off (I tried several cables, including the original cable shipped alongside the device.\nI managed to work around this by keeping the charging cable (I used the original cable) strongly pressed against the phone (first by hands, then using elastics when I got tired :D :D). After a while charging this way, I could finally switch the phone on again.",
