    "content": "The phone is 1,5 year old. It has not been tampered with, everything is original. I have dropped it a few times.\n\nIt's not in developer mode.\n\nI would like to enter recovery mode to restore it but it fails with slot unbootable (boot-slot: b). Because of this it is not much i can do. \n\nI haven't been able to get the device to show up when using adb devices. I've had the latest system update hanging around for a while without installing it. And my concern is that it is that installation that somehow has failed.\n\nDetailed description of steps that i've tried:\n\nPixel 2 status:\nDeveloper Options, USB Debugging: Disabled\nBoot-Slot: b\nSecure Boot: Yes\nDevice State: locked\n\nTrying to enter download or recovery mode:\nDownload Mode: \"Operation denied\"\nRecovery Mode: \"Error: Slot Unbootable: Load Error\"\n\nTrying Fastboot:\nfastboot flashing unlock -> FAILED (remote: 'Flashing Unlock is not allowed')\nfastboot flashing get_unlock_ability -> (bootloader) get_unlock_ability: 0\n\nYou cannot unlock the bootloader if you haven't enabled Allow OEM Unlock in Developer options.  \nWhen it's not possible to unlock i'm not able to flash using fastboot.\n\nTrying to change Boot-slot:\nfastboot --set-active=a -> FAILED (remote: 'Slot Change is not allowed in Lock State')\n\nTrying ADB:\nManually flashing the factory image(using the full OTA variant since the bootloader is locked):\nADB and OTA does not work because Recovery Mode does not work and USB Debugging is disabled.\n\nSo i've pretty much run out of options :(\nThankful for any help!",
