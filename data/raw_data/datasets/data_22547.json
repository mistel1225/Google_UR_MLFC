    "content": "Since updating to Android 10, I have not been getting any notifications.  I'v also noticed that my text messages are delayed as well.  I got home yesterday and got 4 text messages that were 2 days old.  \n\nI've checked everything I can think of to verify notifications are turned on and from what I have been able to find; they are turned on for everything. Even did an app reset and that does not seem to have fixed anything.",
