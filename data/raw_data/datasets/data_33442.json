    "title": "How do I Import Media From PIXEL 3 XL attached to MBP into FCPX",
    "content": "I would like to import footage stored on my pixel 3 xl directly into a FCPX project. When I plug my phone in, FCPX opens the Media Import window. It teases me with the option to view All Clips, Photos or Videos. But none of the options actually work. I can't view any media stored on my device. Is there a specific folder FCPX is looking for? I have media in the standard folders, but nothing is showing up. I have also tried a variety of ways of making sure my phone is unlocked but still nothing has shown up.\n\nAny insight into this would be cool and helpful.",
