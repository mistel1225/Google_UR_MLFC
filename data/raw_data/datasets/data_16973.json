    "title": "Bought in June, by September the screen flashed and went black, vibrates and flickers, mostly black",
    "content": "Phone was bought new from Google Store in June. Went bad on Sept 5th. Followed suggestions to remove case, clean and charge. The phone was fully charged and still on the charger when problem began. Soon as my hand touched the phone, the screen flashed brightly and went black. Would occasionally flicker or have a few lines when attempting to start after holding the power button down. The phone will not start, nothing visible on screen to work with ... it's ... just ... black.\nOh, and it is dead. 09/05/2020",
