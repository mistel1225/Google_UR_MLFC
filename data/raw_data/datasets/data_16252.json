    "content": "I originally setup a pattern and a fingerprint to unlock the phone, was working fine for 2 years.  Today i had to restart the phone and now there is no pattern to unlock, it is asking for a password which I never setup a password, I have tried my Google password and many others and now not working.  The phone has been acting odd the last few days which was why I restarted it.  Do I possibly have a virus?  Do I need to do a factory reset?",
