    "content": "I just purchased the Pixel 3a XL 3 weeks ago to replace my 2 XL and the photo quality is worse compared to it, is this normal? Everything I read online touted the superiority of the 3 camera and that they were the same ones being used in the 3a, but I was never disappointed in my 2's camera and love using it. These pics on the 3a are consistently slightly blurry and lacking in detail... I've tried all the troubleshooting options for fixing camera focus but it's not as if *where* the camera focuses is the issue--it's that the spot it is focused on is never as sharp as it was on the 2. Cleared cache, tried safe mode, etc. Quality still sucks.\n\nUnfortunately I was 2 days too late to just return it otherwise I would've had the crack in my 2's screen repaired and kept using that. Now I'm not sure if this is something I should send the phone in to have fixed under the warranty, or if I failed to understand some aspect of the 3a's camera that would explain the poor quality and I've just wasted several hundred bucks?\n\nI've taken several dozen side-by-side comparison shots and attached one to explain what I'm talking about. Obviously the 3a's is an 'acceptable' photograph and would've been great a decade ago, but it clearly looks like a downgrade in quality to me.\n\nInfo says both were taken at Æ’/1.8 and the 2 was 1/120 while the 3a was 1/125",
