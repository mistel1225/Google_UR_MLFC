    "content": "My Pixel 3 battery is stuck at 1% and doesn’t charge. When I go to battery under settings it says “Plugged in, can’t charge right now”. This is the second time in 6 months that this happens. The first time I had to replace the battery in a third party phone repair shop. I am starting to wonder if this is Some kind of planned obsolescence. The charger I use is the original.",
