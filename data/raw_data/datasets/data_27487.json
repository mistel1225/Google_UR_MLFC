    "content": "Pixel 2XL 128gb running Android 10. I need to say \"Ok Google\" three times in succession for the Google Assistant to listen to me. This was happening before Android 10 update too. I've checked all settings already and it doesn't matter if it's a quiet area or loud area. Any ideas on this issue? Thanks.",
