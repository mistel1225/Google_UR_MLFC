    "content": "I bought this phone not long ago and Wi-Fi has worked awfully since the very beginning. If a game requires a download, it often tells me I'm offline, so I have to use my 4G connection. Twitter is the same. Pictures and videos take ages to load. However, other things like downloading an app seem to work fine. Every other device works fine, it just this phone that has the problem. I unfortunately don't have any other Wi-Fi connections to try. What could be the problem?",
