    "content": "Since upgrading my Pixel 3 to Android 11 the sound in the wired headphones that came with the phone has stopped working.  At first the controls on the wire stopped doing anything and then more recently the sound in the left earbud stopped coming through completely.\n\nTrying another set of wired headphones (SoundMAGIC E10C) initially it worked but the left ear bud in that has now stopped working too (even more oddly when I subseuqnely tried these on another device it wasn't working there either).  \n\nCould my Pixel 3 operating Android 11 be choosing to break headphones?\n\nAll help with this mystery really appreciated.\n\nThanks.",
