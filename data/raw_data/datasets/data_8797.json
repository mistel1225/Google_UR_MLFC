    "title": "background color of app groups (folders)",
    "content": "I like to group my apps into folders instead of spreading them out across multiple pages. For ex. I put all my games into one group.  On the pixel 5, the background color of these folder groups is transparent. This would be fine if my wallpaper was a solid color. But when I use a photo as wallpaper it makes the groups really hard to see. I don't suppose there's a way to change this background color to be opaque? Alternatively, I'd also be happy to simply have a opaque circle that just has the name of the group. I.e. a circle that says \"games\" instead of the teeny tiny icons.",
