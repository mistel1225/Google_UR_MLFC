    "content": "I have tried connecting the phone to a charger and computer. Computer detects it as QUSB_BULK which seems to be some sort of last resort recovery. Screen is always black and the only thing power button does it to reset the QUSB_BULK mode - it disconnects from USB for a sec and reconnects. I've been trying to send a message before this happened and it rebooted, it started up normally, then within a minute rebooted again and then last time it shut off it went dead with above symptoms.",
