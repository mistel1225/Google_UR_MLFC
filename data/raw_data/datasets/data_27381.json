    "title": "Why doesn't the Pixel 3 / 3XL support True Wireless Stereo Plus?",
    "content": "The Pixel 3 and 3 XL both have Qualcomm's SD845 chip, which is supposed to support True Wireless Stereo Plus (meaning both sides of wireless earbuds will connect to the phone at the same time, not one side only). However it does not seem to be the case, as only one earbud connects. So does this mean Google did not enable True Wireless Stereo Plus support?\n\nDoes this also mean that the Pixel 4 and 4 XL will not support this as well?\n\nI have a pair of Creative Outlier Gold earbuds. I have also tested with the Mavin Air-X. The only review I have seen so far that managed to connect both earbuds at the same time, is using a Xiaomi phone.",
