    "content": "Just bought a brand new google pixel 3a from eBay couple days ago. However I notice  that this device only has 32GB storage instead of 64GB. And I can't find any information about this 32GB version. So I am very curious right now. Is this even a retail version? Please help, thanks in advance.",
