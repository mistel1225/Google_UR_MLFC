    "content": "Just got a new phone and somehow managed to add a third home screen filled with garbage news briefs and THERE IS NO WAY TO MAKE IT GO AWAY. How do I kill this stupid irritating screen full of garbage that I don't want and that is wasting my battery? I've swiped in every direction known to man (the swipe function sucks, by the way), I've restarted the phone ... I have NO IDEA what this thing is except it seems to be Google based and is just page after page after ENDLESS BLOODY PAGE of idiotic news links I never asked for and don't want. PLEASE TELL ME HOW TO KILL THIS.",
