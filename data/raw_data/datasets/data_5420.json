    "content": "My pixel 4a was briefly exposed to water, but it was in a case with a screen protector, and I quickly dried it all out. Everything works perfectly except for just the top inch or so of my screen, and pinch zoom no longer works. I turned the phone off and left it off for roughly 24 hours, and tested to see if any of my recently installed apps were causing it. No dice.\n\nI checked the sim tray where the damage indicator is located, and it is completely fine--it didn't turn pink or red as it would if there was damage there. \n\nMy phone is essentially perfectly functional, but that dead zone is extremely frustrating. Is there something else I can try, or would a ubreakifix cover this? Again, no liquid damage is implied by the sim tray indicator, and by and large the phone is working flawlessly. It's just pinch zoom and the very top edge, especially at the left and right corners, that don't respond.",
