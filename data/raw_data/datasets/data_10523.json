    "content": "I have a big hardware issue with my pixel, and I'm not able to file a complaint...\n\nI'm trying to follow the instructions at https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/7109524â€¦\n> Open your phone's Settings app.\n> Tap Tips & support.\n> Tap Contact us.\n\n But there's no \"Contact us\" button on my pixel 4a! I don't know what to do, and I need to get the issue fixed asap.\n\nMy new pixel 4a presses the power button by itself, and tonight I woke up to find it really hot (it was scary to be honest, I thought it could explode) since it continuosly restarted by itself.\nIt also randomly opens the camera since it \"presses\" the power button twice.\n\nI tried to boot the smartphone in safe mode, but the issue is still there.\nThe smartphone OS and apps are up-to-date.\n\nI ask for a replacement.",
