    "content": "All of sudden, I see on my homescreen that an alarm has been set for 21:00. I didn't do it and can't find out which app has created it.  The alarm icon also now keeps showing up in top right hand corner. No salary goes off at that time even.\nThis problem seemed to start with the last system update.  I've deleted the storage of alarm clock so that isn't the issue. What else can be done to find it and stop?",
