    "content": "I tried clicking pictures in dark in both normal and night sight but noticed two dots on my screen due to street lights or any other similiar light source which is even remotely around. They move like some laser lights even if i move the camera. Can Any pixel 4xl user confirm if they are facing the same problem or should i get mine replaced?",
