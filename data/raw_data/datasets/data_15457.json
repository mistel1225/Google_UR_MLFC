    "title": "After the March update Pixel 3 is lagging heavily on lock/unlock and won't unlock at all on calls",
    "content": "Updated to March update on Pixel 3, and now the unlock and lock performance is significantly slow. It takes sometimes up to 5 seconds for the Always On display to show up after lock and it takes 2-5 second for the screen to come on after fingerprint unlock. When I am on a call, it takes over 45 seconds to unlock, so i accidentally left a few long blank voice mails when I didn't get my caller.",
