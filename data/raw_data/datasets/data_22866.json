    "content": "Pixel 4 purchased December, after updating January 2020 the following week stopped working sounds and vibration, neither could make or receive calls.\nrestart in safe mode I do not solve the problem, hard reset does not solve, suddenly the next morning everything works with NORMALITY.\n10 days later the problem returns, safe mode does not solve it, hard reset does not solve it, I leave the phone off all night and when switching on it works again.\nfirst days of February 2020; again the same problem arises: safe mode does not work; Hard reset does not work, leaving it off all night DOES NOT WORK. February update arrives the next day and sounds and calls return to work.\nbut 10 days later the problem RETURNS no sounds, calls fail. Safe mode does not solve, hard reset does not solve, turn off the phone all night and works again.\nWill the time come for NOTHING to solve the fault?",
