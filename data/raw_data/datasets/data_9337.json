    "content": "Everytime I plug in my charger or unplug my charger the rotation for the screen stops working and auto-locks on vertical for a couple minutes untill eventually allowing me to rotate the screen again. \n\nI should also mention that the auto rotate feature is irrelevant and this happens regardless of whether it's on or off. even when I manually rotate the screen it locks back to vertical",
