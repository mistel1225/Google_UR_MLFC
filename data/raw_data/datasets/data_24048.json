    "content": "Anyway to lower the dial pad tone? I have the off/ on  toggle but otherwise, I don't know which, if any of the volume controls might  lower the dial pad sound without lowering something  else. \n\nFYI -\n\n•  Ring Volume is set full loud because of my work setting.\n\n• Call volume - is that for talking and hearing while on phone calls?\n\n• Media volume - I assume (but don't use) for web audios.\n\nThanks.",
