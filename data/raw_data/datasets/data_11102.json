    "content": "At first I thought it was an app ( avast antivirus) so I unisalled it . I thought that was it as the problem went away for weeks but it is back. It stays connected in as much as you can place/ receive a call but you need to talk through the handset. If I go to settings/ Bluetooth/ disconnect / connect,,it will fix the problem  I would love to hear from anyone else who has had the same problem/ issue. I am going to run the phone on safe mode for the next day or two to try and work out if it's a rogue app or my Van that's at fault. Thing is I have had the Van for 14 months and had an Asus ZenFone 5z and a ROG 3 without issue. I have had this pixel 5 for a month or so and it's a problem.",
