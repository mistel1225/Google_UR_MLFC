    "content": "Very suddenly there is distortion and buzz at all volume levels regardless of what media I play.\nThis used to only occur at the max three volume levels, now it is constant. \n\nThis did not happen after a system restart or any damage to the phone, simply when I woke up and started using it. \nTried rebooting normally and in safe mode, leaving phone off for a while. Nothing has fixed it.",
