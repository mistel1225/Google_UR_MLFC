    "content": "Adding new WiFi address, password, security info.  Turning off, back on.  Just received the Pixel3 as a replacement phone, and cannot figure out why it won't recognize our address.  Other phones and computers are on same WiFi address.  Same thing happens at both office and home Wifis.  Can anyone help?",
