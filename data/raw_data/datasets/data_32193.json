    "content": "My 1st Gen Pixel has a problem with the speaker when making calls. I can hear the other side, but the sound is very faint. The voice is very, very low and sounds crackly, distorted and like the other side is under water.\n\nThis problem is when using the handset in a normal configuration. When I place the call on loudspeaker, I can hear the other side normally.\n\nThe phone has not been dropped, nor has it been wet.\n\nHow can I fix this? I believe my phone is under warranty. I am in Brazil.",
