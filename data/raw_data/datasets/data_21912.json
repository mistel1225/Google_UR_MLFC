    "content": "In have seen this post in other questions. But none of them provide any solution.\n\nI go to settings switch off  show notifications. But after some time i see it turned back on and i keep getting all messages.\ni dont think this is a bug with whatsapp. Rather a bug with pixel notifications control. Or a bit freaky thing that whatsapp might be able to control system notification settings? Looks like its able to force turn on notifications for an app even after i change it in settings?",
