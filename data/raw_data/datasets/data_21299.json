    "title": "Pixel 2 unusable due to \"Bluetooth keeps stopping\" error message popping up every couple of seconds?",
    "content": "My 64 GB Pixel 2 ( Android 9, security patch level 5 February 2019) seemed to be drawing more power than usual, so fearing that it was some app behaving like it shouldn't, I rebooted my phone. After turning it on again an error message saying \"Bluetooth keeps stopping\" appeared, giving me the options to look at \"App info\", \"Close app\" or \"Send feedback\". So after I hit \"Close app\" this message appeared again. It has been appearing ever since, every 3-4 seconds - there's a million of these error messages on top of each other now.\n\nSo I've tried restarting it, switching on airplane mode, rebooting it in safe mode - none of it makes a difference, this keeps popping up every 3-4 seconds without end. It doesn't even seem to matter whether bluetooth is turned on or not. Can anyone help?",
