    "content": "Problem with the rotation of landscape pictures on my pixel 3a.\nSome days ago i started noticing that when i snap a landscape picture weather it through front or back camera , the pictures is presented upside down and not being saved as seen. If i turn on auto rotate , it does work properly however that is not a solution because i keep auto rotate off, and it used to work with auto rotate off.\nThis issue happens in whatsapp mainly, the main camera just presents the pic vertically while it was taken horizontally.\nIve deleted the camera cache, reinstalling whatsapp , updating , deleting recent updates and apps.\n\nThe issue persists even in safe mode.\nI wont factory reset my phone, this is unacceptable.",
