    "content": "I just got the Pixel 4 LAST night. In store they gave me an out of state phone number (202 area code). I got home and called T-Mobile customer service who gave me a local numner (443). Now, in my Phone's settings the 202 number still shows (when I call that number it says its in active and no text messages come to my phone). However, my phone rings on and responds to texts messages to the 443.\n\nPeople can text me at the 443 # but the 202# actually appears for me under my name on their phone. Also, when I've texted back in group threads, I recieve my own message and number back like I'm a participant and not the sender of the group.\n\nI have been on the phone with T-Mobile for over 2 hours today with no luck. Please help! How can i properly update the phones settings to the 443 #?",
