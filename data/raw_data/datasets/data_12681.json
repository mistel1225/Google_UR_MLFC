    "title": "Photos in my photo app on my Pixel 4A that are not showing up in the files app or instagram.",
    "content": "I took photos at the dog park today and I used the edit feature in the Google photos app to adjust the tone and coloring. \n\nWhen I went to tried and post them on Instagram I couldn't find them and then I went to check them on the files app on my phone and they were nowhere to be found. So I can find the photos in the photo app and all the variations of them but when I go to my files app I am missing almost 30 or 40 photos from the past 2 days and the dates of the photos in my files app are different than the dates on the photos app. The dates in the photos app are correct where the dates in the files app are incorrect and oftentimes skewed by three or four days in either direction. \n\nI have cleared the cache for both the photos and files app. The phone is only 4 days old and imported all of my folders over and the issue only seems to be affecting photos taken my my Pixel 4a's camera not any of my screen shots, downloaded images or older photos\n\nUpdate: I have discovered that some photos  dont show up in the photos section of the google photos app, but do show up in the library in their appropriate folders. The ones not showing up in the photos section are the ones that I cannot post (both Instagram and Facebook). But I can individually go to to the photos I want to post and share them that way, so I still can access them but not post them from the apps.",
