    "title": "Pixel 4a drops call immediately after dialing. Cannot receive any calls too. Reboot fixes the issue.",
    "content": "I use Pixel 4a on RedPocket GSMA (AT&T) network. I've been facing this issue since I got Pixel 4a / Android 11. Every now & then, I would be unable to make calls. When I dial anyone, the call drops immediately. At that time, no one can reach me either. All incoming calls get routed to voicemail & the phone doesn't show notifications for the new voicemails either. \n\nToggling Airplane mode doesn't fix the issue, but rebooting the phone fixes the issue. The issue appears again in around a week's time. The biggest problem is I do not know when the issue starts, and miss multiple calls. I realize the issue has started only when I make a call. \n\nThe issue is exactly the same issue reported for Pixel 5 in the below thread. There is a response that a fix will be rolling out next week. Can you please confirm if the fix will be rolled out to Pixel 4a as well? \n\nhttps://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/81013955?hl=en&msgid=84081837",
