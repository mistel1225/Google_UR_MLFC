    "title": "Gifs Won't Play On My Google Pixel 3a",
    "content": "I've had my Google Pixel 3a for about a month or so now, and I've noticed that gifs on here don't always play as they should. If I look at them in my gallery, they work fine, they play as they should, it looks like there is nothing out of the ordinary. When I'm about to post them somewhere (Tumblr or Twitter), they work fine as well. It's once I've posted them, that they just look like a still image. This happens on Tumblr A LOT, this also sometimes happens on Twitter. On occasion FB Messenger, but for the most part, they seem to work there.\n\nThis happens a lot more with the gifs I create myself, using different gif making apps, but even with the ones I save from other places, Giphy or Google images included, they seem to stop working once posted.\n\nIs there something I can do about that? Is there a setting or something I can change? Because apart from this, the phone is great, but this limitation is just REALLY annoying!\n\nHopefully, there's something I can do to fix it.\n\nThank you to anyone who can help me.",
