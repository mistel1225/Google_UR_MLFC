    "content": "In both Google Play Music app and Netflix the Chromecast icon only appears sometimes, seemingly randomly.  Also the list of devices that can be seen in the Google Home app is constantly changing, from none to all of them but not constantly at any number.  This is frustrating when I just want to listen to music or watch a stream.",
