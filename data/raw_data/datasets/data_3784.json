    "content": "Just noticed this fairly recently, most likely after the March update.  When in Facebook, if I am presented a link to realtor.com (or zillow.com), and upon going there, when I try to scroll through the listing photos, it is very jumpy and erratic, definitely not smooth.  This does not happen if I open the realtor.com app (or zillow), just when following a link presented from within Facebook.  It does not happen when just scrolling through Facebook feed.\nMy partner has a Nokia 8.3 and he does not have this same scrolling issue, it is smooth.\nI tried uninstalling WebView updates, did not help.  I tried disabling webview, and after that links would not resolve from within Facebook.\nAny help would be much appreciated.  Thanks!",
