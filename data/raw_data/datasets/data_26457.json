    "title": "Speaker sounds bass heavy/ sounds normal again when hitting pause and play",
    "content": "When playing a YouTube video or any kind of media the Videos audio sounds very bass heavy and just awful.\n\nThen hit pause wait a second a two and then play again and the sound changes to a more balanced sound.\n\nThis might not occur every time when you start a video and it also might take one or two tries to fix it. But this is just a workaround. This\n Has nothing to do with the hardware imo, I got a replacement device - same issue",
