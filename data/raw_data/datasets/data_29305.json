    "content": "Hey guys,\n\nI have a Pixel 2 (XL I believe) and have had no real issues with it since I got it, other than my charging cable being only able to charge my Pixel (I think it was damaged in shipping, it ONLY fits my Pixel) until a couple of days ago where I tried to charge my phone in the morning and got a solid red light in the top right, and a power symbol different to the normal charge symbol. It's a white battery outline with a two-pronged power cable/connector. After some searching I found this means the battery has discharged, and considering this is still a new phone and batteries should never discharge fully, I was wondering what the heck to do?\n\nSecondly I've tried for several days now to contact Google Support but it tells me that I have to wait for \"local business hours\". I am currently in Germany, and have checked from 1000 - 1800 from Saturday - Monday and not once has the option to contact Google Support come up so, my second question is, when the heck is \"local business hours\"?",
