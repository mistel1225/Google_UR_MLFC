    "content": "Trying to reach out to google support with no luck... They are not taking any calls during the pandemic... The directions are just taking me on a loop. I'm 7 days away from my warranty being expired. I went into the authorized dealer who said they would not fix my screen under warranty. My screen started to have a thin purple streak from top to bottom last night. When I woke up this morning, the screen was pretty much 90% black. Any way I can reach out to Google!!!??",
