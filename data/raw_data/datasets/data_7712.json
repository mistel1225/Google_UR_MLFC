    "content": "The only thing that I'm struggling with on my Pixel 5 is the ability to change the ringer/notifications using the volume keys.  I don't like that it defaults to the media settings and adjusts that instead by default.  I was going to set a rule as well as a possible solution, but you can't set it as a schedule, just based on Wifi or location.  Well, with Covid it's better for me to set a schedule to change the setting instead of using those options.\n\nAny idea on how to make it simpler to change the ringer/notifications other than having to open the settings menu twice a day?",
