    "content": "Hi, does anyone know why I received an email from Google about my Pixel when I don't have a Pixel phone? The email reads: \"Welcome to your new Pixel, Phone by Google  Now that you're set up, discover ways your new phone can help make every day easier...\" etc. \n\nMy phone is a Samsung so definitely not a Pixel - I've never seen or been anywhere near a Pixel. Why would Google send me this weird email?",
