    "title": "All apps crashing upon opening",
    "content": "I have since factory reset my phone and the issue is gone, but a couple of days ago all of my apps just started crashing as soon as I opened them.  Every single app would crash, except for google chrome.  The google app (search bar) would show a crash message every 15 seconds or so.  I hadn't installed any new apps that day or the day before.  Clearing the cache or data on any of the apps did not stop them from crashing.  \n\nRestarting the phone or going into safe mode didn't help.  I would like to know why this happened and how I can avoid it in the future.",
