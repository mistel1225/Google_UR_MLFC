    "content": "Hi; I noticed my Pixel 4 was downloading an update this morning. I turned the phone off for a meeting, then when i turned it on again 20min later it has been stuck in a boot screen showing the google G and a loading bar underneath it. Its been on the screen for over an hour; it ran the battery flat and then once plugged in keeps going. I've tried restarting it using the down vol and power button and it goes back into the same issue; I've tried selecting recovery mode but that doesnt work either (saying no command). Any suggestions on what to do?",
