    "title": "Home routines don't work while wireless charging",
    "content": "I have various custom routines which activate/deactivate smart lights in my house. While every routine works fine and as intended, i noticed that one specific routine and i would guess every other routine stop working while the phone is charging wirelessly. I just recently bought a wireless charger (pretty good one from Anker) and since then, the routine just won't work... \n\nI double checked and can confirm the routine works fine while the phone is NOT wireless charging. Does anyone noticed anything similar or even has a fix?\n\nThanks.",
