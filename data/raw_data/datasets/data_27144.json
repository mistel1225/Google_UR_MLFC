    "content": "When phone goes to always on screen, background of the screen turns green, it also is very bright at night. I have performed a factory reset and played around with all the settings that i can think. Does anyone else have this issue? This is my second replacement phone, the first one had flickering issue not sure if i should return this as well or turn off always on display instead.",
