    "title": "Disable ringtone/notifications through the device speaker when paired with Bluetooth headset",
    "content": "My Pixel 2 will ring both the headset and my phone speaker on an incoming call. My Pixel Buds are either in my ears or in the case (where they are disabled). If my Bluetooth is connected, I want calls and notifications to not ring/notify through my Pixel 2 speakers. In fact, I do not want ANY SOUND AT ALL to come out of my device. My coworkers understand that I can still hear them just fine if I have my headphones in and my music is paused/silent. \nI understand that some will want the device to ring in case you happen to not have the earbuds in, so there should be a setting somewhere, right? It seems there needs to be a setting for each type of sound (alarm, notification, call, etc.) to be \"This device\", \"Bluetooth speaker\", or \"Both\". Or now that multiple Bluetooth connections are becoming more common, maybe a checklist for each sound type for where you want it to sound off. \nIf there is no functionality supported by the device/OS itself, is there an app that can create this functionality?",
