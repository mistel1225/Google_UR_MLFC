    "content": "Hi,\n\nI bought a Pixel 3 three months ago.\nYesterday morning when I woke up, I found my Pixel 3 was overheating and the surface was too hot to touch. The phone was automatically shutdown. \nWhen I tried to turn on the phone, the phone turned on for a bit and then turned off again. Eventually I booted the phone into the save mode, but the phone continued to overheating and won't cool down. So I turned off the phone.\nAfter an hour turning off the phone, the phone was completely cooled down and I was able to boot into normal mode. However, after I booted the phone, it had 50% of battery left, and within 10 minutes, the phone battery reduced to 5% and became too hot to touch again. So I decided to shutdown the phone and refrain from using it.\nThen I charged the phone overnight only to discover that the battery remained at 5%.\nNow the phone won't turn on.\n\nCan you suggest what might be the issue here? Thanks!",
