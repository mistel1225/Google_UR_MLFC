    "content": "Hello Experts,\n\nI have bought storage and currently all my Photos and Videos are Synced to Google Photos.\nBut even after this, Photos and Videos still exists in the Phone and hence device is running out of space.\n\nI do have done free up space option and i see that there is nothing to remove as Photos and Videos are are already Synced to Google Photos.\n\nBut when i go to device Storage, i can still see around 30 GB of the media content exists. But they are already Synced to Google Photos. \n\nHow can i delete the Photos and Videos from device which are already Synced to Google Photos ?\n\nRegards,\nAshwin",
