    "content": "Hello\nOn Saturday, my phone was being unresponsive so I turned it off and ten it started to do a software update randomly. Once it finally finished, I noticed  that my touch screen is very slow in response and some parts of the screen just don't respond.\n\nAnything jus under the curve (the part under the front camera) doesn't respond so for example, if if I try to change my screen brightness it's not working and it's currently stuck. Anything I touch in that area is not working. \n\nAlso my keyboard. When typing it responds slowly and enters in letters I didn't press making it difficult to type anything.\n\nSometimes if my screen is open and I'm not touching anything, my screen will randomly scroll or go on an app, etc as if I had touched something.\n\nPlease help. I've had a lot of problems with this phone since I got it in February.",
