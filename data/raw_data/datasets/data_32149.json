    "content": "I am having weird issues with Pixel. Youtube videos use to not play sometimes. It just shows a single snapshot and never works. After multiple restarts, sometimes it would work. Once it starts working it works fine till next reboot. \n\nI thought maybe it was space issue or some app causing it. So i did a factory reset. Kept getting same issue. \n\nAnd now, after a week randomly the screen flashes, becomes very bright and the phone just hangs. The only option i have is it do a hard reboot. \n\nAnyone else faced similar issues? \n\nHave tried multiple factory resets and nothing works. Running out of any ideas.",
