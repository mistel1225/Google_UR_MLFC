    "content": "I have owned every pixel phone and never had a single issue.\n\nI wake up this morning to a dead phone. I plug it in to charge it and there's a question mark on the battery symbol.\n\nThen I tried to turn it on and it turns on and it's sitting at 50% battery. Well that's strange... There's no way I could have charged 50% in 5 minutes.\n\nI look online and I say that this is a known problem and that I'm supposed to get a replacement phone through warranty.\n\nHow exactly do I go about doing that?",
