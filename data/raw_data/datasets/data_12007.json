    "content": "I am eagerly waiting for the Pixel 4A to come in stock of Flipkart from last month but still i am waiting without having any information of its stock, i had contacted google UK they couldn't help, i had contacted Flipkart India there executives are just saying to press \"Notify me\" button and wait for the stock. I waiting from last 30-40 days but still i don't have any information or option to purchase a google pixel 4a device. I am helpless here and i think i will have to drop my plan to have my Pixel 4A in India even if it's launched here. \nI have mailed Flipkart India, Redington India as it's the importer but still i have got no help, this is my last hope as i was really excited to have my Pixel 4A which was available in India but i dont know what flipkart is doing. Please help AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.",
