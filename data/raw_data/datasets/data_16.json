    "content": "Phone worked fine last night.  Had about 85% charge.  Went to bed charging.  Woke up this morning to black screen.  Plugged into computer, only Qualcomm HS-USB recognized.  Find my device last saw phone at about 4:30 in the morning.  Tried holding power button for 30s up to a minute nothing changed.  While plugged into PC it does drop the HS-USB hardware from the PC for about 15 seconds then comes back.  Hold power and volume down does nothing.  Tried this repeatedly.  Any other options or is it time for a new phone?",
