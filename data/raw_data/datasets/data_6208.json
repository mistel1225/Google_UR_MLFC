    "title": "Curved corners of the screen looking strange after the December 2020 update?",
    "content": "After my Pixel 3a took the December 2020 update I noticed that the corners of the screen are no longer smoothly curved, and appear more like 45 degree edges. The screen's physical corners can now be seen to extend under the bezel, especially if you tilt the phone. It's most noticeable when the screen shows brighter colours.\n\nIt seems like up until this update, the OS implemented smoothly curved corners via software so that the physical corners of the screen under the bezel were effectively 'off' or black. Has anyone else noticed this?\n\nThe effect is a bit distracting and removes some of the polish of an otherwise amazing phone and lovely screen!",
