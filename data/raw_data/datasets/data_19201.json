    "content": "7/1 - Phone starts to randomly switch off, factory reset 2 times to get to work. \n7/14 - new security update crashes the phone again and does not boot up. finally managed to get it boot up after an hour but the security update still keeps popping up. the device hangs again after security update. \n\nGoogle Support says, it cannot do anything and asks me to claim my Preferred Care Warranty where i have to pay $129 to get a phone! \n\nAssurant guys sent me a refurbished phone as a replacement for a phone that has no damage! (took care of my phone for 2 years like a baby! no scratches!) \n\nFrom Assurant Support: I understand that we sent a recertified device that is what we send out! We send both new and recertified devices we did not have an new one so we sent the recertified device that is part of our policy.\n\nIt's extremely frustrating that i have to pay $129 on a \"Preferred Care\" to get a second/third hand refurbished phone as a replacement for my phone which is not working due to an Android update!\n\nWhat are my options here? this is extremely frustrating!",
