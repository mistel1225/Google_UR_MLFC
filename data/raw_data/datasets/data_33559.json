    "content": "I tried several Wifi hotspots. In all cases it is running in an endless loop saying \"connecting\", \"saved\", \"deactivated\". I deleted the Wifi hotspot completely and started again. Other devices work w/out any issue on these hotspots I tested. This happened \"out of the blue\" from one second to the other. Factory resetting the devices was not helping. Is that a HW problem?",
