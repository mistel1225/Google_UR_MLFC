    "content": "I just bought a Pixel 3.  Consistently I am unable to make a phone call.  It tries to dial but there is no ringing sound and eventually I get an error message that says \"Mobile network not available\".  \n\nRestarting the phone allows me to make a call every time.   This, to me, implies it is not a setting or configuration issue since it works on restart.\n\nIs there a known problem with Pixel 3's?",
