    "title": "Camera makes some photos low res",
    "content": "My camera saves occasional photos in low res. It happens when I take a bunch of photos in a quick succession. Most of the photos will look good but there will be like 3 or 4 of them that are low quality. The device warms up a little bit when doing this so it seems that the processor is being taxed a bit. I am using a Pixel 3 with the Google Camera app. I am using the latest version of the app and I am on the most recent version of Android Pie with the most recent security updates. This camera app is super buggy but this issue is fairly recent.",
