    "title": "Fling Velocity Reduced (4a)",
    "content": "The overall fling velocity on the UI seems to have been reduced. It now takes more effort to get the screen to move at the same place once the fling gesture is complete. \n\nI didn't have this issue in Android 10, but it seems to have arisen in Android 11. It is an unwelcome adjustment, and leads to a \"less fluid\" feeling device.",
