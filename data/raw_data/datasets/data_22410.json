    "content": "I charge the pixel 4 XL using a wire or the pixel dock, but half the time when I unplug it I noticed the percentage changes, if I stop charging at 90% and unplug as soon as I unplug the phone it changes to 95% for example, then I'll restart the phone and the percentage will go back to 90. I have two pixel 4 xls and this has happened to both of them, which makes me think it's a bug that everybody's experiencing. \nHas this happened to you?",
