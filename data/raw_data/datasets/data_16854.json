    "content": "When I make calls and switch to speakerphone the other person can't hear me at all. They get no sound coming through. I tested my microphones using the camera to record video and the recorder app. Both record sound and can play back, so I don't think it's a hardware issue.\nHow can I get speakerphone to work properly?\nThanks, Sean",
