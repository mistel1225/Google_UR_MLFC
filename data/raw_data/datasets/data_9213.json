    "content": "On my Pixel 4a, conference (3-way) calls donâ€™t work as for other phones.\n\nInitiate the 1st call.\nAdd the 2nd call.\nMerge the calls.\nExpect 3-way conversation.\n\nThe 1st call cannot hear or be heard.\n\nOn the conference screen, press Hold twice.\n\nNow, all of us can hear and be heard.\n\nI'm glad I found that workaround, but I'd rather skip step 5. Is there something I can change?",
