    "content": "I think I found a bug on the website. When you navigate to the Google Store/Compare Phone page, I noticed that the Pixel 3 and Pixel 3XL show the same price ($799). I don't think this is correct. When you go to purchase the device it shows the correct price points (see image attached). This also appears when you select Pixel 2 and Pixel 2XL.",
