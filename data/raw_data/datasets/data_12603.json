    "content": "Iv been an android user my whole life. Currently the note 8 for the last 3 years. I told myself last year the pixel 4xl.i work for amazon warehouse and am always on my phone. I mainly like the body design of the matte glass back. Now I just want to male sure if I go with the pixel 5 would it be worth the next 2 years of keeping if I occasionally play cod  Surf youtube and have a GPS constantly run. I just want to make sure on this investment it would be the right move as it would be my first pixel phone ever. Any advice on weather to get the pixel 5 or something else? I also really would like to join team pixel and become sponsored my promoting there latest phones throughout the many people I come in contact. Any advice on how to do so?",
