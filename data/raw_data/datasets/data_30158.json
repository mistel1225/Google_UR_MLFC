    "content": "A couple of weeks ago, I noticed my Pixel 3 would not connect with my Honda Android auto. My wife's pixel 3 could so I know it's not the cord. Then I got a Pixel stand for my birthday. Again, my phone can't connect to it but my wife's can. I tried soft restart and safe mode. Neither worked.  Bluetooth for Fitbit and headphones still works and the phone obviously still charges via USB. What could be the problem? Running Android 9. Bought phone in November. On Fi Network.",
