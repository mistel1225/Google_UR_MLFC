    "content": "Earlier today my phone froze and turned off. When I turned it back on, it would reset about 90% of the time before it even got to the home screen, but the other 10% of the time I could use the phone for about 30 seconds before it would reset. I managed to backup the phone, do a factory reset, and install updates. That seemed to fix it until about 12 hours later when it froze again and turned off. It won't even attempt to turn on now and I'm unsure of what to do. It was plugged in and had battery both times when it froze.",
