    "content": "Pixel 4a availability in India through Flipkart retail chain is a bad idea rather unlike other countries, google should sell their product online at google store will help them to save cost and win more customer footfall as these online seller platform like Flipkart are not able to match up to customer expectations and google as a brand is missing out in the most crucial price sensitive price range phone between 25k-30k seriously google do some brainstorming you can capture the market like u guys did with nexus series its time to repeat the history.",
