    "content": "I've brought a new Google Pixel 4a through Flipkart (India) and within 20 days the top right corner of the back cover got a crack!!! and I didn't dropped my Phone since I brought. So I got a doubt and I've searched the internet and I've found a Reddit post (https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/m12j16/pixel_4a_crack_top_right_corner/) in which the same problem occurred to so many people who brought the pixel 4a and got a crack at top right corner of the back cover after using some days.  So what should I do now will I get Warranty for this..?",
