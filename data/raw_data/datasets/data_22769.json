    "content": "Hello, and thanks in advance for any help.\n\nI have only had my phone, the Pixel 3a XL for about 4 months now, and I have always been extremely careful with it (I didn't even take it out of the box until I had a case and screen cover) because I do not want any damage done to my phone. Anyways, within the past week or two, I have noticed a strange crackle/pop/static sound coming from my bottom speakers, especially when playing games. Animal Crossing and Azur Lane are pretty much the only games I play, and what I noticed is when the games have higher-pitched sounds such as talking, coin sounds, etc, it will trigger the static/pop/crackle, but maybe that is just coincidence. \nI do not drop my phone and I am very gentle with placing it down and I haven't gotten it wet so I thought I would put that out there too. \nI have had people call me to test if the ear speaker makes the sounds and I haven't noticed that. \nI have tried to play Youtube videos and Spotify but I also don't notice the sound there either. \n\nIt's just driving me crazy and making me worry about my phone if it's broken or not or if this could be some strange software issue? I hope it can be resolved.\n\nCheers,\n\nAmber.\n\n***EDIT - The sound does come out of the ear speaker, but much softer than the bottom.",
