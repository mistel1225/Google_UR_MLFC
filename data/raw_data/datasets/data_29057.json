    "title": "No IMEI Number, How do I RMA my Pixel 2 XL? (Stuck Power Button, Infinte Loop)",
    "content": "The power button on my phone has caused it to be stuck in an infinte loop.  I've attempted to remove it, clean it, etc, but nothing works. The next step is phone service.\n\nHowever, to start a request, I am asked to fill out an IMEI number.  The three ways to find it out are: 1.  Look on the original box, which I do not have.  2.  Look on the SIM card tray, but the number is not there.  and 3: Look in the phone settings, which is impossible, because it's stuck in an infinite loop.\n\nI have the original order number and everything.  It seems reasonable to me that a support link would be provided right there.  But there is no option.\n\nSo how do I get my IMEI number?",
