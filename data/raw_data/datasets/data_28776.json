    "content": "My 6 month old phone started turning itself on when plugged into the original charger.  I was able to power it back on, but it meant that I missed any calls or alarms. \n\nFast forward a few days, and tonight it tuned off immediately upon plugging it in. The screen showed a battery percentage, so it was charging.  I tried it with a different cable and charger with the same result. I could restart the phone by holding down the power button, but it turned itself off after a few minutes. \n\nI have tried holding the power and volume down button, etc but nothing helps.  I see others with similar problems.  I believe there is some kind of hardware issue. \n\nI am now leaving it to charge, hoping it come on and stays on when I wake up.  To make matters worse, I am leaving on a family vacation in 6 days and need a working phone.   What are the chances that google will send me a replacement in time?  I am not even sure how to contact them without a working phone.",
