    "title": "Pixel 2 black screen suddenly & no solution from Google support",
    "content": "My Pixel 2 went into a black screen when I plugged it into my car one day for Android auto. Ever since, I've tried many methods to restart it but to no avail. Been contacting Google several times since then to get a solution but have never gotten anything apart from transferring me to the \"right\" department. I have moved away from the UK since I bought the phone and am in a country where there isn't any Google store or authorised retailers. I think the hardware may have failed suddenly as I've been reading many similar cases online, all with varied results. Can anyone help me with this issue because I don't think my phone (or the many others online) which was slightly more than a year old should suddenly shutdown and become reduced to a paper weight.",
