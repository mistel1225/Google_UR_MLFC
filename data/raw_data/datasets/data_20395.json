    "content": "Recently my Google Pixel 2 has started behaving oddly when I try and use earbuds. At first I thought it was cause the pair I had been using for over a year was going bad. One side was already out so I got a new pair. This didn't fix the problem. So I tried using my Bluetooth earbuds and it still does the same thing. Whenever any earbuds are connected to the phone the volume starts going up and down on its own and the Google assistant is constantly popping up, even though it's disabled. If I am in an app like YouTube or if I'm using Facebook it also pauses and unpauses videos, and will occasionally click things.",
