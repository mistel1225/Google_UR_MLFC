    "title": "Pixel 5 dropping calls immediately after dialing",
    "content": "I am on Mint Mobile and ever since receiving my pixel 5 I have to reboot it daily because when making a call it immediately ends the call with either \"call failed\" or \"call ended\".  I have found this issue happens when on WIFI calling and also on mobile data.  I had my wife try to call me and there was no ring and after about 10-15 seconds my voicemail picked up.  I have 2 friends that also purchased Pixel 5s and they are both on Mint Mobile as well and they both have the same issue.  I am not sure if the issue is isolated to Mint or if it is an overall T-Mobile issue.",
