    "content": "Hello, I hope someone can help. \n\nI  have a google pixel 3 that is still under warranty. I received the labels for it to be replaced under a Standard claim, which means I'll send the phone, they'll check for not better specified \"damage\" and if they don't find any damage they'll send me a replacement phone. \nI asked Google support what happens if they claim to find damage and they initially said they'll charge me for a new phone and I found that ridiculous. They double checked and said that I wouldn't be charged but I also couldn't have my own phone back, which I also find ridiculous as it is my property and I should be able to get it back.  \nMy phone is in excellent conditions and I'm concerned that if it gets damaged during shipping, or even at the warehouse, I'll have no way to prove that it was fine when I sent it and I will lose my phone and have to buy a new one. \n\nThis seems completely unreasonable to me, why would Google not return my own phone to me if they find they can't fix it or replace it under warranty? And why is it that I have no way to prove that my phone has no damage before I sent it? I'd be even willing to bring the phone to be inspected myself.\n\nMany thanks !",
