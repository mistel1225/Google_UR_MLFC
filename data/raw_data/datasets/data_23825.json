    "content": "I have a pixel 3 XL and am having issues with my Outlook emails. Only happens in Outlook and only on my pixel. Gmail and Outlook on chrome work fine. The emails (only certain ones) do not load all the way when you open it up unless I rotate the phone, once rotated back verticle the bottom section disappears again. I have cleared the cache and data, deleted the app and reinstalled but still have the issue. Again not all emails do this but certain ones always do. It's getting real annoying and would love some help to get it resolved.",
