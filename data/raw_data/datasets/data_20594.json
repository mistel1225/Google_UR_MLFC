    "content": "SeeI was camping all weekend. June 13 to june 15. I took many many photos every day.  Nearly all of the photos from june 14 are missing. There was no or limited Network access during the trip.\n\nI noticed on June 14 (evening) when i went to share a photo through WhatsApp that i had only photos from June 13 available. We had climbed a hill and had 3G signal available. WhatsApp gave me a \"time and date error\" and asked me to change my time and date settings. (And my clock was indeed completely wrong. The network signal changed the time to 2 hours later).\n\nI took some new photos to see if maybe there was just a delay between the camera app and google photos but the newest photo was instantaneously there. I knew something was wrong. \n\nWhat happened to my photos?  \nThey are very important. We only took one camera and this is the only camping trip i have had with my daughter before her surgery!\n\nIf they have the wrong time and date where do the photos go? \n\nWhy was my time and date wrong?\n\nIs this common with Pixels? \n\nPlease help..i just really want the pictures back...\n\nUpdate: \nThere is an animation with some of the pictures in my google photos \"for you\" tab. So the pictures do exist.. but I still cannot find them (and yes I tried looking in the device folders).",
