    "content": "Pixel started rebooting yesterday morning. Tried restart - got to white screen with \"Google\" on it, then turned off and rebooted, back to white screen with \"Google\" on it. Happened 8-9 times. Got through to main screen but froze and rebooted back to white screen with Google sign. Happened again for a dozen times. Managed to get to main menu again but then it restarted again. Got to main menu so did a backup and did a factory reset. Now it wouldn't get past the white screen with the Google screen until I charged it till got hot. So I let it cool down at which point I tried again and it loaded on to the main menu. I set it up without connecting to my gmail account. Seemed ok so left over night\nThis morning tried to connect to my gmail account but froze and rebooted repeatedly...now doesn't get past the white screen with Google on it.\nI've had to use an old mobile to access my gmail account so thank god for that but wtf? This all started after I updated to the latest security update from a few days ago!\nAny suggestions to fix this as there's no nearby Google repair shop here.",
