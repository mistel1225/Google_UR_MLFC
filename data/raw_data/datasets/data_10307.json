    "title": "Why does my sim card work in my unlocked pixel 2 but not my unlocked pixel 4a?",
    "content": "I'm switching from a pixel 2 to a pixel 4a. Both I ordered unlocked. I double checked my pixel 4a receipt and it does say unlocked. I tried googling how to tell if your phone is unlocked and one way said to put in the sim card and try to make a call. The call didn't go through. It's so odd because I can swap the SIM card between both phones and it works perfectly fine with my pixel 2 but not the pixel 4a.\n\nI may just be an idiot who doesn't understand how this works and I'm hoping that's all it is. I do also understand mistakes happen and if it's not my lack of understanding maybe I was accidentally sent a locked phone. \n\nI attached a picture of when I initially put a SIM card in the pixel 4a and then what it says after it has been in a few minutes.",
