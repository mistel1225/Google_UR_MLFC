    "content": "Is there any alternative to Soli sensor (I mean, can google bring in all the features of soli through any other thing and also with a low frequency? So that frequency also will be low and users will have all the features?)\nIf there was an alternative to Soli with low frequency Google will be able to launch it in India. Is google planning of an alternative to soli? Or trying to continue without Soli? Soli is such a great feature but it is not available in India. I just want to know Google is building an alternative or not. Please. \nI have not yet purchased the Pixel 4xl but i want to know about it.",
