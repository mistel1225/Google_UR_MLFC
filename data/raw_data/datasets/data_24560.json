    "title": "Pixel 3 - Unable to select anything when websites ask to access device location",
    "content": "Past few weeks I have been unable to select either \"allow\" or \"block\" when a website in Chrome is asking to use my device's location. Happens on multiple websites. The pop up appears on the screen but I try to push block or accept and nothing is responsive. I have restarted, have no updates waiting for installation, and I haven't changed any location settings in the recent past. \n\nAny help would be great, it can be a bit annoying as I've only had the phone for like 5 months. \n\nThank you!",
