    "content": "Hi everyone, just a small help. When I say \"Hey Google\" I'm getting an answer as a floating notification at the bottom, instead the assistance should speak. \n\nHi msd,\n First, please go to Settings > Sound and ensure that the Media volume is set to an audible level. \n Then, activate Assistant, tap the compass icon at the bottom right of the screen that pops up, and then navigate to Menu > Settings > Assistant > Assistant devices > Phone. From there, scroll down to the Voice and speech section and verify that Speech output is On. \n Please let me know how it goes,\nJohn\nGold Product Expert\n bG\n recommended this\n\nLink: https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/1252920?hl=en\n\n\nI tried to follow the post It didn't work for me also I can't find the option as mentioned above. I'll thankful for any reply and I'm using my pixel 4a.\n\n- Ram",
