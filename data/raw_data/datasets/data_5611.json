    "content": "So I have a Pixel 3a XL. Recently, I began to notice more that at the bottom right area of the screen, there's this strange issue. It often feels like it's pressing against something on the inside of the device. You can feel it touch the inside and hear it un-sticking, kinda like pressing something together that sticks for a second before un-sticking. It's very hard to describe but it's noticeable. The screen doesn't feel loose and the device works fully, it's just an odd thing that mildly concerns me.\nI tried to contact Google but they really didn't have a clue what I was on about. What could this be? Should I be concerned? I will be getting a new device in a year as the security updates end around then so I could do with it lasting that long.",
