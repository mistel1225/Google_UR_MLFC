    "content": "I have noticed that when my Pixel 3 XL is unlocked and I receive a notification, I do not get the banner drop down at the top of the screen.  The notification icon appears at the top of the screen, but I do not get any more information than that.  Do Not Disturb is turned off, and I have all of the settings I can find set to show notifications.  \n\nI have seen online that there were some issues while using the Pixel Stand when it comes to this issue. I do have the Stand, and it appears that my issue falls in line with what others had described. I have rebooted my phone and the behavior doesn't seem to correct itself.\n\nAny ideas on how I can get this function to work properly?",
