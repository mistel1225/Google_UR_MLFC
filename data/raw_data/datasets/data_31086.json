    "content": "I just upgraded from a Pixel to a Pixel 3A XL and it replicated everything including icon layout and app icon layout - everything. When I upgraded to a 3A XL from my Asus it replicated nothing. Also when transferring from the Asus I saw an option I didn't remember when transferring, and that was the question if I wanted to use a Microsoft Launcher or a Google Launcher - I chose Google because I wasn't sure - was that a mistake and the reason it didn't replicate everything ? Thanks",
