    "content": "I got my Pixel 5 Friday, and I need to dual sim. Fi is activated. I have a VZW 5G sim and account. When I enter my imei in my account to move my VZW line it says that it is not a supported device. LONG phone call with VZW and they say, \"no way, we won't do it for an unlocked phone\". Google of course says they will. It does not matter how many times I point out their BYOD policy. Anyone else seeing this, or getting it fixed? Thanks.",
