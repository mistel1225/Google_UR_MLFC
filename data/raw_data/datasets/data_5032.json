    "content": "My phone stopped working completely.  Google support sent me an RMA and shipping labels and I sent my phone in its original box back to Google.\nThey now tell me I sent the wrong device.  This is not possible. I only had one Pixel phone.  They asked me for a number before, I read a number off the SIM card tray. Either that was not the number they were looking for our I misread the number (it is incredibly fine print).\nI'm not sure how to proceed as I have mailed them my phone in the box it came in.  \nThey are quite slow to respond by email.   The customer support is terrible.  \nAny ideas?",
