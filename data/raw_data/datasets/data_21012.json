    "content": "I had voicemails that I had saved. The voicemail service says they are saved for 30 days. It never prompted me or told me that I had voicemails that were expiring or needed to be re-saved. I tried listening to them and they are gone. I called my service provider and they said that voicemails are saved in the phone so they don't have any way to recover them. My phone does not have the option of retrieving deleted voicemails. I have found a couple of software applications that can do data recovery, but they require you to root your phone and I don't want to do that. Is there anything else I can do? These voicemails after extremely important and sentimental to me.",
