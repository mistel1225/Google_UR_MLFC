    "content": "I have been dealing with Google customer support for over six months. I believe they are intentionally dragging their feet until my warranty expires. I purchased a brand new Pixel 3 from the Google store. After a couple of months the static buzzing noise became so bad I reached out to Google support. They determined my device was defective. Rather than allow me to return the device for a refund (as per the warranty policy) they told me my only option was a refurbished replacement. The replacement had the exact same defect. After more time with support they sent another refurbished replacement. It has the exact same problem. I have wasted so much time over the phone, on chat, and via email. They refuse to escalate my issue. They just respond with the same stock responses over and over. They refuse to refund my purchase. It is by far the worst customer support I have ever received. I don't know how they can get away with this. Without being able to speak to any other agent I am trapped and then my warranty will run out. There must be some way to get through to a manager or something. I've filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureau. What else can I do?",
