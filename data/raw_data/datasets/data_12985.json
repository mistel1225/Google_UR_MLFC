    "content": "It is not even a full week since I bought Pixel 4a and it is starting to show dead pixels already there are three of them now, heck even screen of cheap Rs. 5000 (~70 dollars) phones are better quality, I wonder if Google just want profit by selling phone made out of cheap parts at higher price, there were many alternatives with better processors, higher ram, higher storage etc. but I bought the more expensive Pixel 4a expecting better quality.\nI'm not a heavy user either to cause screen to break or whatever. This was my first and the last google phone.\n\nEDIT: Added Pictures\nIt was very hard to capture on white background but on black background dead pixels are very visible in camera. One was hardly noticeable and was not a problem to me but after that two more popped up, worst screen I've ever seen on a mobile phone.",
