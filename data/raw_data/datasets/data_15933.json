    "title": "Pixel 3a having troubles playing music / podcasts in the background after the update to Android 11.",
    "content": "Whenever I stream a podcast through Google Podcasts or play music through Spotify, after few minutes stream gets interrupted as if I have slow internet. It keeps playing but with constant micro pauses as if it can't download media completely. But as soon as I unlock my phone it plays everything nice and smooth right until Pixel locks the screen again. Tested with phone speaker, bluetooth speaker, car bluetooth system - same results. I want android 10 back....",
