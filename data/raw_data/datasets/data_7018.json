    "content": "Sometimes when my  phone is not plugged into charging cable - it  try to wake it up [ get to home screen ] either by   using finger sensor on back or   briefly hitting the power button. sometimes the screen stays black - then I reboot [hold power button for  longer time]- google animation starts but then phone shuts down right away - I can restart it but it never finishes booting - as if it has no charge - teh only fix is to   attach it to charging cable [but  battery  shows as  way above 50%]",
