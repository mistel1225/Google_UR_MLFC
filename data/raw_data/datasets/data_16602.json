    "title": "Sound level starts at maximum during video call",
    "content": "My pixel 4xl was recently upgraded to Android 11. I noticed the sound level during video calls (Duo and Viber) always starts at maximum volume even though the slider volume is at minimum. This only happens when I am on loud speaker. The sound level will only normalize if I manually set the volume slider to maximum and slide it back to minimum. Anybody else experienceing this issue? I do a lot of video calls everyday and did not notice this issue when I was on Android 10. Only happened  after the update to Android 11.\n\nAny help would be highly appreciated. Thanks.",
