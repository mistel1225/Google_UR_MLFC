    "content": "One of the most advertised new features of the new Pixel 4 is the Pokemon live wallpapers.  My Pixel 4 arrived today, however they are not listed.  My understanding is they should appear in Styles & Wallpapers under \"Live Wallpapers\" but there is nothing there.  I've also looked in \"Coming Alive\" and it's not listed there either.\n\nI've researched online and tried a few things with no success:\n\n- Confirmed I'm running the latest version of Android.\n- Upgraded Motion Sense Bridge app in Google Play.\n- Installed \"Pokemon Wave Hello\" App in Google Play.\n- Completed the tutorial in the \"Pokemon Wave Hello\" App.\n- Restarted the phone several times.\n\nCan anyone help?",
