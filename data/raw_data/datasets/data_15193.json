    "title": "Motion Sense Randomly Stops Working Since Android 11; Reboot Fixes It",
    "content": "Since upgrading my Pixel 4 XL to Android 11 motion sense has randomly stopped working every so often (e.g.; face unlock, gesture control, reach to wake, etc).  Rebooting my phone fixes the issue for a while.  Anyone else seeing this?\n\nEdit: I should also note that I have recently factory reset my phone after upgrading to Android 11, but the Motion Sense issue persists.",
