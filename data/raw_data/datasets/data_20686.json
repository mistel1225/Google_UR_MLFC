    "content": "My pixel 2 keeps freezing, sometimes the screen will look like it was dropped hard and it gets all distorted and freeze on that screen. Then sometimes instantly and sometimes after a minute or two it will power off and attempt to restart. When it attempts to restart it can sometimes take several tries for it to successfully power up. Once it does power up the phone is very slow and then works normal for sometimes a minute and once up to about 30 minutes and do the exact same thing where it freezes and crashes. Repeat. \n\nIt just started doing this morning.",
