    "content": "Without seeming provocation my camera started lagging very badly today. It takes a long time to start, lags and skips and doesn't focus. Have tried the following: restarting, power off for extended time, cleared cache, have NOT cleared storage as I'm paranoid about losing my pics but I checked phone & app storage & I have plenty of space. Used phone cleaner to reduce files just in case that might help. I tried switching styles within the app (camera, portrait) & no improvement. Have not downloaded any new apps. I've restarted 3 or 4 times now. Could this be the latest version upgrade? If so, can I uninstall somehow? Halp...?",
