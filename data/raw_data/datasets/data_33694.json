    "content": "I recently just sent my old Pixel phone in to get a replacement phone. It says for me to put in a SIM card, and I remembered that I totally forgot to get rid of the SIM card in my last phone. So, I don't have that phone anymore since I shipped it in to get a new one, and now my new phone doesn''t have a SIM card.",
