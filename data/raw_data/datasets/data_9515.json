    "content": "When listening to music via bluetooth headsets, it gets disconnected automatically.\nLater, on manually connecting it again, it would work.\n\nUpdate : I have 2 wifi routers, one on ground floor and another of second floor. I have noticed it happens when phone automatically disconnects from one Wifi network and connects to another. Bluetooth too get disconnected but never reconnects.\n\nThis is super annoying.",
