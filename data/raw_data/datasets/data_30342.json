    "title": "I receive (3-6) overlapping notifications dings for each push notification .",
    "content": "I'm not sure when this started exactly, maybe two months ago, I receive many dings for each notification. There's no debounce on this, every notification causes it. I've not tweaked any settings or done any factory restoration. I wish you could hear this because it's annoying. Any ideas? I read about a recent bug related to Bluetooth causing multiple notications but disabling my Bluetooth hasn't remedied this. It's also worth noting that with the notifications on vibrate I only receive a single vibration but this may not really mean anything. I have also just now discovered that dnd is being ignored by at least one app but it's the only I've I got a notification on before updating this thread.",
