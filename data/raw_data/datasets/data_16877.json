    "content": "Hello, I recently made a post about a different concern I had which I was told is normal, so I apologise if this is considered spam because I posted recently. This is an entirely separate issue I found that I'm sure is not normal in Android 11. When there are notifications on the lock screen and the phone is unlocked to expand them, the animation (or lack thereof) is not fluid like Android 10 was, and they just instantly pop open instead of expanding. It looks very janky so I'm confident is it not supposed to be this way, especially because it was fluid and smooth in Android 10. I have attached a screen recording of it using test notifications. I hope the link works.\n\nVideo:\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/19IaCjHPV36G2z2VsKoc8IRlsz4SpVDTq/view?usp=drivesdk",
