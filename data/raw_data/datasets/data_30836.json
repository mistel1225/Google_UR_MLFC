    "content": "When using Google maps (and every other GPS app I have) for directions I am able to calculate a route and as soon as I get going it loses signal. Phone shows I am driving at highway speeds when sitting at red lights, shows incorrect location relative to my physical location, and fails to accurately route / recalculate route to a destination. \n\nThis is my second pixel 2 with the issue the first one was replaced saying the GPS antenna was defective.",
