    "content": "Hey Guys,\nI bought a Renewed PIXEL  2XL from amazon on 11/03/2020 , it was delivered on 16/03/2020.\nIt was beautiful one, i was very happy with the purchase. \nIronically yesterday was the last day of warranty & around 9PM the screen started to flicker on the left side & i immediately contacted Amazon. They were unable to trace the sellers number & asked to contact GOOGLE team.\n\n I have the Invoice & the seller seems to be LEGIT . I Tracked him through GST number but i could not find his contact details & amazon is Clueless as USUAL  \n\nSo will google consider this as IN warranty product or no ?\n\nPlease Guide\n\nThanks \nSravan",
