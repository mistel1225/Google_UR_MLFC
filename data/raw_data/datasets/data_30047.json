    "content": "My pixel 3xl will crash a few times a day. The screen goes black, won't respond to any pushing buttons or pluging in to charge, nothing. I hard reset the phone with the power and lower volume buttons, choose the power off option, and the phone restarts and works normally. Anyone else having similar problems or know of a solution or why this is happening?",
