    "title": "Pixel 4XL - Screen Timing Out almost immediately",
    "content": "Hi,\n\nThe last few days, my Pixel screen has been timing out within about 5 seconds of me stopping typing/pressing things on the screen. I will pause to read something or show something to a friend and within seconds the screen will go dim and then to the black lock screen.\n\nI have tried updating screen timeout in the display settings - it extends the lockout the first time but then just goes right back to timing out after a few seconds. I have tried restarting as well as added the latest update and no luck. \n\nAny ideas?? It's getting super frustrating!",
