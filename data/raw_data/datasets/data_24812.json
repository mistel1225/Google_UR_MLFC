    "content": "I just bought a Pixel 3a XL.  On the Home Screen at the top the Day of the Week, the Date, and Weather are shown.  This is not in the status/notification bar at the very top but rather the top of the Home Screen in a place where I would normally be able to put a widget or app.  If I long press on the widget, a box comes up that says \"Preferences\" but when I click on it nothing pulls up.  I cannot move, delete, or change this widget and I would prefer to use something different in its location.  Is there anyway to change this?  It is driving me nuts.",
