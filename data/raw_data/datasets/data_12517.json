    "content": "This is so disappointing and feels insulting for not getting latest pixel phones launched in India. Pixel 5 could have been a great hit in India due to price segment. Then why it is not launched in India???? I have decided to move on from @google and settle with iPhones. Seems Google no more cares for Indian consumers.",
