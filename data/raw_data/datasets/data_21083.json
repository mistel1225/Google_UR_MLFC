    "title": "Pixel 4XL NFC scanning really unreliable for Freestyle Libre",
    "content": "It is virtually impossible for me to scan my FreeStyle Libre sensors with my Pixel 4XL. No matter what way I position the phone I cannot reliably scan the sensor, it is really hit and miss, about a 1 in 20 success rate. It works perfect for Google Pay so NFC function seems to be OK. I've used Pixel 2XL for my FreeStyle Libre without problems, this issue has only started since changing to Pixel 4XL but because this is for medical reasons I will have to return if Google can't fix ☹️",
