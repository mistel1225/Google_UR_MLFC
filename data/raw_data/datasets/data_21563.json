    "content": "My phone keeps crashing and restarting as the wifi flicks on and off. It also creates problems with my mobile data not connecting. \nMy phone does this for 2-4 days every 3 weeks or so. I have deleted all wifi data multiple times, completed all current updates, tried factory resets and the problem persists. Its not for a specific wifi connection, and will happen whether i'm on the home wifi or on an external wifi at university for example.",
