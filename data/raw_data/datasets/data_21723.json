    "content": "I have a regular need to be both charging my phone on the go AND using a plug-in external microphone ..... problem being that I can only plug either the mic or the charger cable in and I need both !\n\nBecause I usually have my phone in a Gimble (Zhiyun Smooth 4), I really don't want too much sticking directly out from the USB-C port. I've seen some \"T\" shaped USB-C adapters that throw out a 3.5mm port one end and a USB-C port the other and they look perfect but, so far, they don't seem to work with the phone failing to deal with whatever the adapter is doing ( https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/Baseus-L41-Charging-and-Audio-Adapter-Type-C-Male-to-Type-C-Female-3-5mm-Aux/401984111506?ssPageName=STRK%3AMEBIDX%3AIT&var=671843094030&_trksid=p2057872.m2749.l2649 )   !\n\nHas anybody got a proven solution for handling charging and external mic at the same time ?",
