    "content": "hi. I just bought a new pixel phone (4XL). and I notice something weird about the battery. at the \"last full charge\" it said 42 days ago. I'm just curious, if it's a new phone and factory sealed, why does it have duration. shouldn't it be 0 days? please explain. thank you so much",
