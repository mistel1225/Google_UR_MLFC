    "content": "hi! 3-4 days ago my phone screen starting going all black. i googled the issue and  i did recovery mode reset that night, and it fixed the black screen issue for that night. the screen went black again the next day, but then i figured, if i only click power button once and be patient about it, the screen will light up is like 10 sec then i can use fingerprint to unlock. but it died again now i cant get it back on.\nnow i cant hold power button and volume down to reset no matter how long i hold the buttons.\nthe google assistant squeezy is still vibrating back (but really slow)\ni think i notice the phone vibrates when i got a messenger text\nit still wanna connect to my laptop via cable\nthere is no screen flashes\ni cant ring the phone through find my phone app (i'm not sure if my wifi setting is on or off)\ni'm a little clumsy i drop my phone sometimes and some water might got splashed and got in the phone from the speaker holes. is there any way to fix a black screen though :( thanks for reading all the way here!",
