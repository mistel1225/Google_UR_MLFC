    "title": "phone CS not saved in notes",
    "content": "We sent it via USPS which was the real mistake but when we called about a month later, they said they found it and had to return it to us because it didn't have an RMA attached to it.  That is stupid enough but then when the phone is now missing, the CS agent we spoke with didn't put any of that call in the notes so we have no proof they located the phone.  So....the supervisor says they can't do anything for us.  My son bought the phone with his own money saved from his job.  Now I have to buy him a replacement because of the useless CS which is out of the country doubling their ineptitude.  We don't have any way to fix this and I feel Google should send at least a refurbished unit to us especially since it is an older model.  I am not asking for a brand new Pixel 5, only an equivalent to what was lost by them.",
