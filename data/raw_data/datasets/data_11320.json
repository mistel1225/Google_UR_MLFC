    "title": "Bluetooth share unsuccessful",
    "content": "I can't share photos to my computer unless I restart my phone. No error message or anything pops up, it just doesn't work. Then if I pull down the notifications it says bluetooth share 0 successful, 1 unsuccessful. But then it works fine if I restart the phone and works for a while but i don't know how long before it doesn't as I restart my phone a few times a week. But it never works when I want to move images. It used to work, but i don't know which update was loaded when the problem started, so it might be a bug or a feature.\nAttempts to fix: Turn bluetooth off and on",
