    "content": "On my Pixel 5 I can launch Android Auto ok if it is not connected to my motorcycle display. When the display is connected to my phone., Android Auto will no show on the phone screen. If I tap the icon or open from running apps, it momentarily shows but disappears immediately. This means I cannot interact with AA to set a route, play music or anything else. It also disables the always on clock and phone and message notifications (it rings but I cannot answer or reject calls as these buttons no longer display). Has anybody else experienced this and is there a fix?",
