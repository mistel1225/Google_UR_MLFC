    "content": "Hi,\n\nI have recently bought new Pixel 4 phone and overall I am satisfied with the device so far. Although there is an issue which is really annoying, my notifications are overlapping with the calendar on locked screen. \nDoes anyone have similar problem?\nI am attaching the Imgur link to the screenshot of that issue.\n\nhttp://imgur.com/gallery/rzoeCcp\n\nThanks",
