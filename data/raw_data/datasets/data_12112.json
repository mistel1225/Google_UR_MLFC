    "content": "I have a pixel 5 and want a smart watch that's compatible I've had 3 pixel phones now and wouldn't chose another brand as I've loved them all! I miss the squeeze for assistant function of the pixel 3 but otherwise I'm very happy with the 5!! \nI am looking for a smart watch that is compatible with the pixel 5 and there is a paucity of information online!! I ordered a samsung galaxy watch from EE but I am returning it, as I don't receive message notifications! \nI have a cheap smartwatch off of aliexpress which works fine but I'm looking to upgrade for Christmas and I am hoping to receive recommendations! Thanking you in advance",
