    "content": "I'm trying to get an RMA on my Pixel 4 XL which will not turn on. After 12 days of trying to get help from Pixel Support Team, all that they will tell me is, \"We have been informed that due to illicit activity with one of the Google services that you have opted for the RMA's on the device has been blocked.\"\n\nThey first told me the \"service\" was Google Pay. I contacted Pay Support and they said, \"no problem\". Back to Pixel Support and the quote above is all they'll tell me. How am I supposed to know what service from Google has illicit activity? \n\nCan anyone help point me in some direction to investigate on my own? Seems Pixel Support is not interested in telling me what service this could be. Seems ridiculous to have to research and fix this problem on my own. The phone had an RMA in April 2020 and I'm not aware of any service I changed that would block an RMA.",
