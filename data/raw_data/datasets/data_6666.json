    "content": "Hello There\n\nIs anyone knows why the phone \"Use system certificates\" menu disabled? Alternatively, How Can I enable the menu?\n\n\nAfter upgrade version 11, the phone can not authenticate with WPA2 Enterprise mode \"Do not validate\" option. so try to use a certificate, However the menu itself, not able to choose. Greyed out. \n\nI also test with Samsung S20 and Andriod 11/One UI 3.0, it can choose a \"Use system certificates\" option, it works fine. \n\nThanks",
