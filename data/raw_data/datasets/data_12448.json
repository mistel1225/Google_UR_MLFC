    "title": "Android 11. Factory reset. DND on. Phone only vibrates.",
    "content": "After the November security patch the DND options are fixed for messages etc.  But the phone only vibrates no matter what exclusions I set.  With the weak vibration I regularly miss calls.  \n\nSo until Google can get their spam filter on point or decide to get better haptics, it would be nice if they could straighten out this setting that for the longest time had no problems.  \n\nAnd I already did a factory reset.",
