    "content": "Hello,\n\nSince Android 10, Airplane mode simply isn't working. When I click the quick toggle or the toggle in Settings, the icon in the status bar replaces the network icon. But if I pull down the notif/QS tray the network icon is back there. \n\nThe 4G QS toggle is greyed out, but my 4G connexion is still active and I can place calls and send SMS. After a long time (don't know how long, >20 minutes) or an unknown event, airplane works finally works and shuts down connexions.",
