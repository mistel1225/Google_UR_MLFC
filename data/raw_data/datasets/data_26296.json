    "content": "I'm mirroring from a Pixel 3a to a chromecast 2. \n\nPhone mirrors with black bars all around video on Youtube app, doesn't fill screen like on my previous phone (Moto g5 plus). Netflix app does not show video, sound is fine but video does not show, I can see play/pause buttons, as well as other options like forward/rewind 10 seconds, and the video scroll bar on the bottom. If I scroll with the bar I see the still image, but once I release it, screen goes black again and only sound is mirrored.\n\nNo trouble casting, but I'm having trouble with the mirroring. Any help would be appreciated.",
