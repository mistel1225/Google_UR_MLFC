    "content": "Since the January 2021 security update (I am not saying it is caused by this) my pixel 3 randomly stops all vibrating, first noticeable in the haptic vibrations, however it does appear to include vibrations when receiving a phone call as well.\n\nA reboot resolves the issue however it is only a temporary solution.  About 2 hours after I last rebooted it stopped working again.",
