    "content": "I noticed that my Pixel 4 SoT decreased heavily recently, only 4.5 hours approximately. And AIDA64 told me Charge Counter was only 2587 mAh when battery was 'full' while capacity is 2800 mAh. I don't think battery is not health because sometimes it can be charged to 2628mAh or higher. I have an idle Pixel 2 which SoT is only 3 hours but Charge Counter is almost equal to capacity (2700mAh) when battery is full. My Pixel 4 has been used for 10 month. Is that a system problem?",
