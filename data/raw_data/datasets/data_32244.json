    "content": "Hi,\n\nI am unable to pick up a call or even call from my google pixel. When someone calls me I click on the answer button but it doesn't do anything. At the same time if I try to make a call the screen just freezes. I tried to make a call in the safe mode but that didn't work either. Audio of any sort also seems to have stopped working as I am not able to play any music and I am also not able to play youtube videos.\nI am not sure how to fix this issue.",
