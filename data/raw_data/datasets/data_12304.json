    "title": "Pixel phone defaults to \"Cast\" volume when playing Spotify at home on Alexa devices.",
    "content": "I tell Alexa to play night-time music on my childrens' echo (via Spotify), and after that, the Pixel makes my volume buttons control THAT volume by default.  I can't find a way to disable, or even see that volume control except when I tap the hardware buttons.  Why would I want to control the echo's volume, I have Alexa for that, more importantly, how do I make it stop?",
