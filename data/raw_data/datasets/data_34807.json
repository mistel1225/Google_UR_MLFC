    "title": "Resizing portrait mode photographs with ImageMagick -- almost no reduction in file size.",
    "content": "I'm trying to reduce the size of some photographs for publication online.\n\nI'm using this command with ImageMagick:\nconvert -resize 800 -quality 50 $p $p-small.jpg\n\nThis yields an image approximately 10% of original's file size -- with the exception of portrait mode images. Those images have a size and quality reduction, but their overall file size is still massive -- around 8MB for a low quality 800x600 shot.\n\nIs there a recommended way to strip the extra data that these kinds images must be storing?",
