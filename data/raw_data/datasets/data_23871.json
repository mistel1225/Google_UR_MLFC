    "content": "I have had the Google Pixel 3 for around a year now, and this issue has been around for what seems like forever. \nI download flacs to listen to music. I love the sound quality, and it makes for good songs to wake up to (since you can only use downloaded songs for your alarm). But for some reason, it seems like the music that I download, and listen to daily randomly gets deleted.\nI don't have any \"cleaner\" app. I'm not running out of storage. I don't see why this is an issue. Is there a setting that turns this off? Because I couldn't find one.",
