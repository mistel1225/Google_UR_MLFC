    "content": "When listening the videos through the speakers, the under screen speaker randomly cuts out. The loudspeaker at bottom of the phone continues, but it really ruins the experience as the left channel cuts out from time to time. Had anyone else experienced this, or is it just my phone\n\nI've only noticed this on YouTube",
