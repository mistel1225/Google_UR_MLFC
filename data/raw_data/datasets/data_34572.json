    "content": "I recently got the pixel 3 and I have noticed that at a specific part of the screen the screen doesn't respond properly. I can't click on things properly so Idrew on the android pie easter egg and the areas where there is no black are areas where the screen doesn't respond when I have tried to draw there (photo is attached).\nI have followed all the advice on the help page and I have factory reset but nothing has worked. Is there anything that can be done? ",
