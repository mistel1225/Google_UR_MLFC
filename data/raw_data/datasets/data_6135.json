    "content": "My phone doesn't work. Google agreed and said they will send a new one. However they keep sending links to order that don't work. When I let them know, they keep sending emails that say they will get back within 24 hours and they never do. I'm out of time. How do I actually get real help from Google. This support is awful.",
