    "content": "I forgot the screen lock to my pixel 3 xl and i contacted pixel support and they said the only way to get my phone/data back would be to factory reset so that's what I did. When I reset and went to restore my backup it asked me for the lock screen pattern I forgot. Is there absolutely any way I can prove that this is my phone and my google account and get my old backup back before it is overwritten or deleted?",
