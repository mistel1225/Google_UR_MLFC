    "title": "Screen not responding - mainly around the edges",
    "content": "Hi, Yesterday morning my phone started going crazy, randomly flicking between apps and pulling down the top notification bar without being asked. Since then, it has calmed down but the screen is not responding properly, especially round the edges. Because the pixel is controlled by side swipes and apps clsed from the very top or bottom of the screen, it is pretty much useless. The only way to get out of one app and into another is to switch the phone off and select the new app once it restarts, which isn't practical and often doesn't work. Can anyone advise please?",
