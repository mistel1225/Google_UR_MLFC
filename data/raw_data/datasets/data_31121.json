    "content": "I've just moved over from an iPhone and I've noticed that WhatsApp works slightly differently on the Pixel. \nI prefer to have the autosave turned off on WhatsApp so that the hundreds of photos that come through never make it into my photos folders. However, when I do receive an image I would like to save I used to tap and hold the image and save it. This doesn't seem to work on Pixel. Frustratingly the only way I can find to save photos sent by WhatsApp on Pixel is to have them ALL automatically saved. I then have to go through deleting hundreds that I don't want to keep. Very annoying. \nAm I missing an option here?",
