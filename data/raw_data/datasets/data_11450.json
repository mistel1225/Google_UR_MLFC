    "content": "I'm upgrading from a Pixel 2 to the Pixel 5. I can't seem to find a way to transfer/sync my text messages to the new phone. My recent call history is also missing, but this isn't as important to me as the text messages. I have changed from Pixel 2 to Pixel 2 before when I received a refurbished unit long ago and I didn't have any issues then. Is there something I need to do on my new Pixel 5 to get this data?",
