    "title": "Anyway to fix a dented Pixel 5?",
    "content": "Recently two corners of my new Pixel 5 have been dented. This happened after the phone fell out of my pocket and landed on a parking lot ground as I got out of a car. It had a screen protector on (the screen was undamaged), but it didn't have a phone case. I had ordered a phone case almost two months ago, but it still hasn't come, which is upsetting to think there was nothing I could really do to protect my phone. The top right corner/edge has a large and noticeable dent, that I can irritatingly feel anytime I hold the phone horizontally, which is pretty often. The bottom left has a dent as well, which is smaller, but sharper and can be felt whenever I hold my phone. While I really don't think there's any way too help it, could there still be some solution or fix to help this, besides getting a case to cover the dents? Or at least while I wait for my phone case to come? I don't know when the case I ordered will come, and the company I ordered it from hasn't responded to any emails, so I was hoping I wouldn't have to buy another temporary one or just another case for it. I understand if there's nothing I can do about it, and don't think there's much I can do now anyways. My old Pixel 2 XL had an otterbox case that protected it well even without a screen protector, though I never really recall ever dropping my phone anyways, so if I don't get the one I currently have ordered for my Pixel 5 soon, I'll probably just go with that and get another otterbox to keep it safe and prevent any further damage, if it were to happen again. Apologies if I made this post too long or formatted it wrong in anyway.",
