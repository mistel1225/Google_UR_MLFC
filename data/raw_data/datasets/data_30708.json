    "content": "This morning I was taking many\n pictures in a row (with my pixel 2, only 6 months old) and suddenly my screen became static (see attachment - like a TV screen). I have tried all the tips and tricks I found on the web but it isn't solved.\nIs there anyone who knows how I can save my data? When I plug my pixel in my laptop, there is no reaction either ðŸ˜­\nThank you so much in advance!!",
