    "content": "Upgraded to Android 11 yesterday, but Bubbles are not working. Have activated them from all options in settings and within messaging apps like WhatsApp, Messages, FB Messenger; and have cleared cache and restarted the phone several times, but nothing works. I don't get the option to condense the conversation/app into Bubbles in the notification shade. Using all default Pixel launcher settings",
