    "content": "Every time I open the Gmail app or navigate to it, it stays on screen for about 1 second and then minimizes.  I can't do anything functional on the app.  I don't know if this is part of the problem or is there because I cleared the data, but there is a Google Meets dialog that is popped up.  I can't close that either.  \n\nI have restarted, force stopped the app, cleared cache, and cleared data.  Out of options since I can't uninstall/reinstall the app.  What should I try next?",
