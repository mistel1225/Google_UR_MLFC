    "title": "ADVICE NEEDED! Pixel 4 external microphone",
    "content": "I've got myself an external mic for my Pixel 4 and it won't connect via the usb-c to 3.5mm adapter I have, just tells me it's not compatible. I've read that this is because the adapter isn't an official Google product. Will purchasing one fix the issue? I don't want to spend Â£12 on one to find myself in the same situation. Any videos I've watched all seem to cover the Pixel 2/3 and nothing on the 4... \nAny help would be greatly appreciated,\nSee attached image of the notification I get...\nThanks. ",
