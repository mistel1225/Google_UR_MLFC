    "content": "Ok, so my screen display is basically impossible to see clearly in daylight. Even at 100%. It’s just soooooooooo dim. Not talking bright sunlight, just pretty much any outside daylight. I find myself having to find some shade to be able to write a text or read an email!\n\nI’ve experimented with turning off adaptive brightness to no avail. Restarting, downloading latest updates and trying it out in safe mode have not improved the situation. A factory reset did nothing. I’m not using a screen protector. I’ve contacted customer support and their advice was simply to leave feedback via the device. The idea being, as I understand it, to wait and hope that the development team will eventually release a fix. Until then, I’m stuck with a device that I can only really use indoors.\n\nDoes anyone have any other suggestions? Is this normal for Pixels? It feels like a mobile issue from like 10 years ago. But I’m traditionally a Samsung Galaxy guy, so maybe it’s just an area Samsung had sorted and others are lagging behind. Nevertheless, slightly gobsmacked to encounter this issue on a premium flagship device in 2019!  \n\nAny help soooooooo appreciated. Customer support have been useless so maybe you guys can do a better job.",
