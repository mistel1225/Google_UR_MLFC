    "content": "My wife has a Pixel 2 phone and I have iPhone 11, and our home Wifi has one SSID and two Access Points. My iPhone 11 will automatically switch to the AP with stronger signal. However, the Pixel 2 cannot do that. It sometimes attaches to the weak AP at -80dBm. Sometimes, it loses connection for a long time. This seems to be a bug in Android phone. What are the reliable ways for fixing it?",
