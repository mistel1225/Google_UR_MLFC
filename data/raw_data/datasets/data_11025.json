    "content": "Hi all !\nI've a google pixel 3 for about a year.\nTwo weeks ago the camera app started to collapse and currently i can't activate it regularly.\nThe only option is to long press the app button and than only the front camera is on (video and rear camera are not functioning and causing the camera app to collapse).\n\nI've tried the following:\n1) Restarting the phone many times (also power off and also by ending the battery) - No change\n2) Cleared cache memory of the camera app - No change\n3) Cleared camera data and forced stop - No change\n4) Updated the app version - No change\n5) Performed Factory reset - No change\n\nWhat else can be done ? I really need your help here, i've tried to connect google but got no reply and seems they completely ignore it.\n\nI'll also mention that i'm in a country where there is no official google pixel service, i bought the phone in the US last year so i don't know if any return is even possible.\n\nI'll also mention that except it i enjoyed the phone and it is EXTREMELY disappointing that this bug just ruins the whole phone experience.\n\nWould love to here any good advise here...",
