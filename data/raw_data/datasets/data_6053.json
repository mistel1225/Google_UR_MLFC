    "content": "i loved my pixel 4; had the best camera and was super responsive.  but it became outdated. worse yet, the newer pixels just lagged behind samsung and apple in hardware. a phone is something we use on a daily basis; we look at the display constantly. so why skimp on the display and chip? i remember being unable to use my pixel at the beach. with a nit brightness of 500 where apple and samsungs are at the 1000+ nits. why?\ncurrently i own a galaxy s21. but i miss my pixel (i like to have the best of the best; technology is everything theses days) Google could have had the best phone on the market....Please google even if you make a premium line call it pixel premium???? but until then, ill hold on the the phones with the latest and greatest.",
