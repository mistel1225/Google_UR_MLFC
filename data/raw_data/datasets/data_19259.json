    "content": "My phone has got a lot of issues after June's update:\n\nBattery takes longer to charge wired and wirelessly (pixel stand) to almost double the time. Also it drains faster, sometimes the phone gets hot.\n\nCall audio is choppy although not with all callers.\n\nTexts get a big delay or sometimes would not come in at all.\n\nPhone gets laggy or unresponsive. This is the most annoying issue. After a restart the screen takes long to turn on. Even the battery animation has a lag when the phone is off and charging.\n\nI've tried everything from installing app updates to safe mode to factory reset the phone but no result. Phone is a Pixel 3XL on July's update.",
