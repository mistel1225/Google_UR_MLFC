    "content": "I'm having an issue with the front facing camera. Whenever I open it, the image looks distorted for a few seconds, until it settles. If I move the phone back and forth, the issue occurs. Attached is a link with a screen capture showing you what I mean. \n\nI'd like to know if it's a hardware or software problem and whether anyone else noticed this.\n\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/12ThtTyJKg0i9qzfz8zituaAZ_-puNeWo/view?usp=drivesdk",
