    "content": "Hi, over the past few weeks, I've noticed several screen functions stop working on my Pixel 3.\nFirst was adaptive brightness, then double tap/lift to wake, and auto screen lock when talking on the phone.\nAlso, last week I noticed \"Flip to shh\" was off, so I tried turning it on, but got an error saying \"Flip to shh can't be enabled\". Restarted phone to try to solve, was able to toggle Flip to shh on, but then the option disappeared completely from the Gestures menu.\nAnyone else seen something like this? Is it some crazy bug a phone reset would fix, or should I send it in?\nThanks",
