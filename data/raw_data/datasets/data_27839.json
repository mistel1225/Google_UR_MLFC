    "content": "Earlier today my pixel started rebooting randomly. Sometimes I'd be able to use it for half an hour or so and other times it would start rebooting before I even got a chance to enter my pin.\nI first tried safe mode and it worked for a while before it happened again! I decided to cut my losses and try a factory reset but it reset just before I could enter the wifi password and now it won't even start. \nI'm so frustrated because it was working fine yesterday. I've never gotten it wet and only ever dropped it once which was onto carpet. The warranty just expired too so I can't even return it. PLEASE HELP ME FIX THIS",
