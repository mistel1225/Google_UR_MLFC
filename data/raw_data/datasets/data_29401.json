    "content": "Hi everyone,\nI have had my pixel 3a XL for a while now without any problems untill yesterday.\nOut of the blue my signal stopped. Found out my cell radio won't turn on. When i toggle it it goes back to off. my IEMI is not blocked and theres nothing wrong according to my providers app.\nWhat have it tried:\nrebooting the phone\nresetting the network settings\nfactory resetted the whole phone\nbooted into safe mode and pressed the toggle\nremoved SIM (and reinserted it after a clean)\nrolled back to the march and the june update\nreflashed the july update\n\nAnyone any idea's\n\nKind Regards",
