    "content": "This issue started with Android 10 and Pixel 3 XL. I have night time mode to automatically enable at sunset.  When I place phone on the stand, the colors are still correct but in a few random seconds it will revert to regular blue hue and then in a few seconds switch back.  It continues this process over and over.  Anyone else noticed this or possibly a fix?",
