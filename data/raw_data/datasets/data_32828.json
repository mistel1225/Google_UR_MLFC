    "content": "I love my Pixel 1 and I'm considering an upgrade to the Pixel 3.\nThe camera performance is the most important aspect I'm looking at, so I want to make sure I'm not making the wrong move here. I read in a number of different forums that the Pixel 3 camera app sometimes takes a few seconds to start, which will often make you miss a shot involving  kids moving rapidly. Another issue I've read about is that once you tap the \"shoot\" button, the actual shot is not instantaneous, but it happens a few hundreds milliseconds later. Again, when you have a moving kid, a ~200ms lag can too much.\nHas anyone here experienced these issues? Would you recommend the Pixel 3 to someone who has such strict performance requirements for the camera app?\nThank you!",
