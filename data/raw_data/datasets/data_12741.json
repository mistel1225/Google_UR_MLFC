    "content": "I recently upgraded from a 3a which also shared the exact same issue after the last security update.\n\nWhen the phone has been re started the notifications and ringtones are fine, after a few hours any notifications or the ringtone on incoming calls become severely distorted, crackling. (Its like a bad audio driver on a pc)\n\nHas anyone else experienced this?",
