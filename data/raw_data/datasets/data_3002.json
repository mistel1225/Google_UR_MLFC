    "content": "Hello. I cannot connect to my Chromecast after the phone was updated to Android 11. Nothing wrong with the chromecast or wifi because other phones using Android 10 and below can connect successfully using the same wifi. Only my phone cannot connect after updating to Android 11. Restarting phone doesn't work. Reinstalling Home also doesn't work. Please help",
