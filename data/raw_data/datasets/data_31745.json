    "title": "My back camera works fine but I know longer can take front selfies due to my front camera not working. I can bring it up and on but it shos an all black photo. Nothing shows up. Also I no longer can send or receive photos and such when text messaging. I can attach but when I hit to send the message and attachment just keep circling until my phone will say try again, when one comes in with a photo it wont download.",
    "content": "To take any kind of a picture with the front camera mostly a selfie. When I have the front camera on I could sort of tell it is I don't know what the word is active maybe but the screen is totally black doesn't show anything no matter what I try to do it will let me click the picture but it takes a picture in black just as I see the whole screen black I don't know what's going on and never used to do this but for the last 6 months now I've tried just about everything and I just wish I could take a selfie again",
