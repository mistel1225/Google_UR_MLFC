    "content": "All of a sudden this afternoon, I started getting a message from my Pixel that there was an \"analog audio device detected\" that was incompatible. It seems to think something is attached to the phone when there is nothing attached at all. It keeps pinging over and over, it's annoying. Anyone else have this issue? I tried restarting but that didn't help.\n\nEdited to add: I'm now getting a notification that my Pixel is charging via USB when nothing is connected and usb is controlled by the connected item (which doesn't exist).",
