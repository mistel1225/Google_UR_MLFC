    "content": "I have a Google Pixel 2 XL Panda. Last night, for no apparent reason, it began malfunctioning when I plugged my phone charger into it. At first it would recognize the charger for a moment, charge, then it wouldn't recognize it. My phone gives me the error that my charger is \"incompatible with [my] device,\" however I've used the charger that came with my phone, the charger that came with my boyfriend's phone (he also has a Google Pixel 2 XL, except not a Panda), and I've also used the same generation and type of phone charger as the standard one, that was ordered via amazon. Nothing works, and my phone no longer recognizes a charger even for a moment, nor will it charge at all. I've restarted my phone, I've done a soft-reset, I've turned it off and on, I've plugged the charger into the wall and into a power strip, I've enabled the battery life saver feature, I've removed my phone from it's case and tried charging it that way, I've blown into both the USB port and also both ends of the charger cord,  I've even cleared the cache and data in several apps as well as removing a few---out of desperation---and still nothing. I now have a 3% charge and my only means of communication with anyone is through social media. I didn't pay $1000 for a phone to do this crap.",
