    "content": "My Pixel 3a updated to Android 11 a few days ago (April, 2021) and my speaker went squirrely. Could NOT listen to YouTube music at all... I see this has happened in the past, safe mode did not help, but (so far) turning off \"Hey Google\" may have. If it continues to be good I will confirm or report any changes.",
