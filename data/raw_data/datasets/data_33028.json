    "content": "I got a Pixel 3 a few weeks ago, did the whole setup, and it says it transferred the data from my old phone (MotoZ XT1650) to the new one. I'm only now just realizing I can't find my Pokemon saves anywhere, and my wife is gonna be pissed. Should that have transferred? Where would it have transferred to? If not, they why not?!? What's the point of transferring data if it doesn't transfer the data?? I've also got a backup from the old phone on Google Drive, but I can't seem to access any of the data within. If there's a way to either get into the backup, or if it transferred, knowing about it would be much appreciated.",
