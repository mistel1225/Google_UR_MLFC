    "content": "Pixel 2 phone can't find my 5GHz networks at all, other devices can find and connect without issues. I discovered that if I put phone in airplane mode and turn wifi on, it can find and connect such 5GHz networks without issues.\n\nAs soon as I turn airplane mode off and restart wifi, 5GHz networks can't be found again.\n\nAny ideas?\n\n(5GHz network is using channel 40, I have tried 36, 40, 44, 48 channels and the issue remains)",
