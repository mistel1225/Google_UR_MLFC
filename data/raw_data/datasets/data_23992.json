    "content": "Why pixel XL is not supporting voWiFi calls on Jio or Airtel Network?  Is that a problem with Google or with the carrier?\n\nWhen I check *#*#4636#*#* from the dialer, I could see inside the phone information section, voWiFi enabled toggle button is greyed out. From which I guess, at least the phone supports the technology.\n\nWho has to take the next step..?? Is it the carrier or the device manufacturer.!!!",
