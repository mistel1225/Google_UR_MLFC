    "content": "The new google chrome grid layout is horrible! So many unnecessary steps just to close tabs, and I dont even know how my tabs are combined and uncombined. It makes no sense. \n\nI cannot change it back to the previous vertical layout.\n\nYes i tried change the settings via :flags, but that only changes it until i close/open chrome the next time.",
