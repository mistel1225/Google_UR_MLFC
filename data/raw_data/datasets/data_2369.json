    "content": "I am not able to set my fingerprint up on my Pixel 5. The tapping is unrecognized for fingerprint, but I can use the sensor to swipe for notifications on and off. I've cleaned the sensor and tried getting the fingerprint registered while in the case and without the case. The only thing that happens when I try to set up fingerprint access is the demo animation just cycles over and over.",
