    "content": "So ever since adaptive charging dropped, I've had no issues getting it to work on my 4XL. Would kick in every day no problem when I plugged it in after 9pm and an alarm set for 10am everyday.\n\nSuddenly a week or two ago, it just refused to adaptively charge when I plugged it in under the correct parameters for it to trigger. No matter what I've tried. Turning the alarm off and back on again, toggling the adaptive charging feature on and off again, rebooting the phone. Absolutely nothing works. Rapidly charges every single time. I've even tried uninstalling and reinstalling the Device Health Services app. No dice. Any suggestions?",
