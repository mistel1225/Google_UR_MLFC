    "content": "The documentation Google has for the Pixel 4a 5g identifies the LED flash (top) and the main and wide angle lenses (left and right). But there's a fourth aperture there, at the bottom. What is it? An autofocus light? A depth sensor? Nothing, and it's just there to provide symmetry?\n\nI noticed this because a lot of the third party cases use renders that have it as a third camera lens, and it's clearly not that.",
