    "title": "3 button navigation hard to get when watching video on android 11",
    "content": "Firstly i very much prefer 3 button over gesture controls so the answer is not to use gesture. Basically if you watch a video on youtube for ex. it usually hides the 3 buttons and if you want them back you just swipe up and youre good. Now that I've updated to android 11 it no longer does this, it only vibrates when you swipe up, you have to flip the phone or access notifications to get it to act normally again.",
