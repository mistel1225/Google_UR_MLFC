    "content": "Google Nest Hub and Android phone (Note 9) are both responding to Hey Google command at the same time. Tried all of supports recommendations, including checking version. Tried resetting both hub and phone. Nothing is working.\nTo note, I had a home mini set up previously (which has been reset and moved), and that worked flawlessly with the same phone prior to changing to new hub.\nAny recommendations would be very much appreciated on how to fix! Thanks!",
