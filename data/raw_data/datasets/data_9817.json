    "content": "Having issues with new Google Pixel 4a 5G. Unable to open many apps. Quick codes/links not coming through in text. Not receiving mms. Connection to WiFi in and out. \nAttempted to reset FB password. Sent link multiple times through text and email. Link never shows. Worst phone experience ever. Called into phone carrier tech dept. told that auto updates are corrupt. Have initiated warranty exchange. Need advice how to turn off auto updates so corruption does not continue to happen again. I manage an assisted living and need my phone to work properly. \nAny assistance is greatly appreciated",
