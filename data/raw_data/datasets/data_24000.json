    "content": "Hi Google, my pixel 3, perhaps after the recent system upgrade, started to making beep sound at random occasions. For example, when watching videos, I was not even touching screen, but it made the sound several times at very short interval, which was very disturbing. \nWould you know what could be the cause of this malfunctioning?\nThanks,\nYiran",
