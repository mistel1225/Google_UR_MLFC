    "content": "I POFF ( power off ) the phone the other night and it appears it was for the final and last time. None of \"help\" forums suggestions have managed to resuscitate it from the cellphone impending black hole. It is evident from prior posts, that the Pixel motherboard has latent defect issues. Has anyone got any type of answer as why these motherboards suddenly stop functioning ? Does anyone even know if the repair centers RMA the defective product back for root cause analysis or do they just get tossed into a scrap heap of \"I DON'T GIVE A SH!!!T\"  ???  I am now faced with the conundrum of paying a repair center approx 2/3 the original cost of the phone to fix it ( I still owe 6 months on the phone ) w/ a 90 day warranty  and \"keep my fingers crossed hope not to die\" ,  the new motherboard has a happy and prosperous life. OR eat the cost of the 6 months still owed and purchase another brand of cellphone.",
