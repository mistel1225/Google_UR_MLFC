    "title": "No sound when recording a video with Pixel 2XL",
    "content": "Whenever I try to record a video, whether using the default camera app or any other app such as Instagram or Snapchat. There is completely no audio, it's a loud hiss and you can only hear yourself if you shout or something which is also very minimal. \n Here's what I have tried so far:\n\n• I have tried safe mode but no results so far, also do not suggest factory reset as many other users with the same issue have not found the solution despite \n\n•The microphone works completely fine in calls and Google assistant\n\n• All permissions have been granted to all apps but no result, cache was cleared as well. The app was also reinstalled as per Google help assistant's suggestion\n\n• The phone has been restarted and everything along with the grills being cleaned to clean off any dust particles.\n\nNOTE: there is a skin that covers the third microphone on the top edge but no audio still if you talk to it.\n\nAny advice? As this cuts me off from capturing videos and memories which is very frustrating",
