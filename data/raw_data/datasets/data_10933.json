    "content": "I recently got a google home hub & the home hub max, Which both of them are great devices. While setting them up I noticed that there was a settings to control the ambient light sensor (ambienteq) integrated in these devices. If that is possible to do on the hub home. It is possible to bring it to the pixel 4 (xl) for better color accuracy. I believe that this should had been there from the beginning.",
