    "content": "im a proud owner of a new pixel 5!\nso far im really enjoying it, having owned a 5 year old asus for so long\n\none issue im having is apps that dont fit the screen , which isnt THE issue, i get it, app size res might not match up with the pixel's longer screen, but when i turn the phone on its side to play games or use apps that work horizontally only.\n\nthe 2 ends of the 'deadzone' are uneven, the side with the front-facing camera is nearly twice the width of the other end, which is probably around just under 1cm where the charging port is.\n\nim wondering if theres a way to shift the app left or right so it sits in the middle relative to the physical phone itself so i dont have to hold it offset center in my tiny hands to use horizontally locked apps.\n\nor vice versa\nis there a way i can make horizontally locked apps fill and use my entire pixel 5's screen (or most of it)\n\n\nthank you all in advance for the help!",
