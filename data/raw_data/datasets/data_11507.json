    "content": "I found a strange issue with pixel 5. I use a power bank with wireless charging. If I wireless charge the phone with the power bank and leave them flat on the table, Pixel 5 will not respond to finger clicks. It still works for sliding from sides, like pulling down the notification or going back, etc. But if I hold the phone and power bank in my hand, everything works fine. Anyone else have this issue?",
