    "title": "Feature Request: Set color of Bluetooth Device Icon",
    "content": "It would be great to be able to select the color of the Bluetooth device icon. I have two pairs of the same model headphones with different colors, red and green. The green set has a red icon and the red set has a green icon. The device icon color is randomly assigned. It would be great to be able to switch the icon color with out having to \"Forget the device\" and reconnect until the color I want shows up.",
