    "content": "My pixel 4a 5g is refusing to respect the WIFI preferred option and continues to use mobile network.  If I go to airplane mode and re-enable wifi, it makes wifi calls as expected, but when the mobile network is enabled the phone chooses to use the mobile network EVERY time!\n\nAt the same time, my Pixel 3 works just fine at choosing WIFI over Mobile - for me eliminating my local network configuration as an issue.  What's UP?",
