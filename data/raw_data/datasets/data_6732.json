    "content": "My pixel 4 shutdown and the error message reads \"your device is corrupted and can not be trusted\" I tried hitting the power button to start it and nothing happened. Then I tried the factory reset (power + down) and when I chose restore nothing happened. It just keeps looping back to the original error message. What do I do if it won't even let me factory reset? Please help I've tried my best to resolve this.",
