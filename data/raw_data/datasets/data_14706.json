    "content": "After updating to Android 11 on my Pixel 2XL, I am no longer able to use the bottom swipe gesture to exit whatever app I am in, bring up all the apps I'm running, or switch between apps that are running. I have tried to reboot and it works for a few minutes then doesn't work again. Almost as if the screen is frozen. The gestures from the sides of the phone work fine. Any idea as to what's going on?",
