    "content": "Just shifted to a Google Pixel XL from an iphone and one week later hells breaking loose.\nInitial problem: Cant unlock the phone via Pattern- Tried unlocking many times but does not work. It recolonizes if a wrong pattern is input but wont unlock on the right pattern. \nRestarted the phone - It does not  work DUH.. the phone needs the pattern compulsorily after a restart and that was the problem. \nNow panicking -  tried a factory reset - THis does not work\nTried locking device and erasing device - does not work.\n\nPS: bought 2 devices and problem started 12 hours ago for both the devices together.",
