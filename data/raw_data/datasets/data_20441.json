    "title": "Several apps are not working on my phone, including the play store app, chrome, Marco Polo, Rosetta",
    "content": "Some apps aren't working. Chrome won't load any website, the play store won't load, Marco Polo won't load videos, and Rosetta Stone won't login but Instagram and YouTube appear to be working fine. I'm hesitant to try to uninstall and reinstall apps because the play store isn't working either so I'm not sure how I would go about reinstalling them.",
