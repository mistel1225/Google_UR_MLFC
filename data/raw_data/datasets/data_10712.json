    "content": "My Pixel 1 just stopped working. It was working one minute, then I looked over and the screen was black. It won't turn on - no sounds, nothing appears on the screen. I plug it into the wall charger / charge by laptop but nothing happens. \n\nI hear the phone mount on my laptop but of course with the phone switched off I can't see the drive.\n\nI try calling the phone and call goes to answer phone.\n\nI tried pushing / holding power button, down arrow (together and separate). I try plugging / unplugging quickly. And have just put it inside a ziplock bag in the freezer,\n\nI installed a new battery a few months ago - did it myself without any issues. The old battery wasn't holding a charge.\n\nAny thoughts on what it might be?",
