    "content": "My pixel 2 updated today and now, every time I take a screenshot, I get a little tiny version of it in the corner of my screen along with an edit bar. I don't want either of these and can't find a way to get rid of them. How do I keep these from popping up? I take a lot of screenshots and don't really want to deal with trying to hit that micro-sized x every time.",
