    "title": "Messages 'header' notifications 'resend' when opening Messages app",
    "content": "This might be a tough thing to describe...We've all gotten our header notifications from Messages, previewing the message and providing a chance to reply without opening the application. For the past 3(ish) weeks, whenever I open the Messages app with unread messages, I get spammed with all the header notifications from these unread messages (my phone vibrates as if I'm receiving them for the first time too). It's almost like they're resending when I open the app (and it only happens when I'm opening the Messages app - no other app does this)\nIt's not debilitating, but it's a pretty big distraction that I don't think should be happening. I've restarted my phone, double-checked my settings, but to no avail.",
