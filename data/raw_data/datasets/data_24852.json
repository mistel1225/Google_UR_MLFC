    "content": "Hi,\n\nI bought a Pixel 3 in July this year and it in died 2days ago while it was working fine before. I have tried different chargers and waited for some time (one being the original). How do I proceed with the warranty?\n\nI bought it online while living in Spain a few months back online via the Phone House and the seller by the name of Electropolis that seems to be based in Spain, When I asked them about warranty I got two different answers, one said that I should make a case via them and the other one said that I should contact google directly since it's only a few months, which is correct?\n\nIm currently based in Sweden and I'm wondering which is the best and easiest way for me to proceed with a warranty claim?\n\nThanks in advance.\n\n-Christian",
