    "content": "I'm trying to figure out how to adust the wifi settings from the swipe down menu on my Pixel 3a. My phone is currently running on android 11, but on a previous OS I could quickly switch different wifi routers just from the swipe down menu, without having to go through the settings panel. The current route of clicking the gear icon, then network & internet, then wifi and then selecting the wifi is very cumbersome and slow. Since I live in a 100 year old brick house, every time I go to a different room I am needing to switch to a faster signal. Any help is appreciated.",
