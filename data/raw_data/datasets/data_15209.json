    "title": "Issues with Pixel Swipe Commands",
    "content": "So I like the swipe actions for back, home, and show apps, but I'm having some issues with them that go away when I use the buttons instead. \n\nNumber one I've had for a while is the youtube mini player won't show up. If I navigate from youtube using a swipe command it doesn't activate the mini player for some reason. \n\nSecond issue only showed up after the Android 11 update. now I want to try to return to home using a swipe command, it takes me to the Pixel launcher instead of my Nova launcher. Double checked and Nova is still set to my default launcer. \n\nAny advice would be appreciated.",
