However, whenever I put the phone on the pixel stand, the clock automatically appears. \nAlso, I have tried downloading screen savers from the Play store but cannot get them to appear as a choice of screen saver under settings.\nWhenever my phone goes into sleep mode, the screen is blank,  no screen saver.",
