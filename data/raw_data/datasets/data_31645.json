    "content": "Well, my Pixel was lagging for 2 days straight till a point, where it wasnt useable anymore, so i restarted it by holding the power button and clicking on the reset option\n\nso it was restarting and then right before booting up, the screen turned pitch black and now im stuck with a perfectly fine pixel, which isnt charging, nor booting up anymore, what can i do to save it? \nIve tried to charge it now for the last 30 minutes, and tried to boot it up in safe mode but nothing seems to work, i wanted to contact google, but cant find the option to contact them on any of their websites.\n\nI love my Pixel 2 and a cant believe that it has to leave me this way, i loved every part of this phone and i hope that somebody outhere has expierienced the same problem and has come up with a solution.\n\nPlenty of Love, \nSoner",
