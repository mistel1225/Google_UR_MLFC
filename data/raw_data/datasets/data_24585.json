    "title": "Pixel 2 issues pairing with Jaguar XE",
    "content": "My Pixel 2 will pair with my car then cuts out and cycles over and over never having a solid pairing.  This is a huge issue with me even making me think I need to get an iPhone.  I have also escalated this with Jaguar as I don't know if it is google's issue or theirs. I did see someone say it had to do with bluetooth 5.0 (not really sure what that is but shouldn't it be backward compatible)  I am on the very most current version 9 March 5th release.  I have forgotten and re-paired my phone literally 20 or 30 times.  I have enabled dev and changed the AVRCP version etc.  absolutely nothing works.",
