    "content": "Hi,\n\nI've just owned a Pixel 3 and, I'm having problems with my current headphone (Bose QC3). When I plug it with the 3.5 to USB-C adapter I hear some background noise. It actually works fine with standard earphones so, I assume that the problem comes from the active noise reduction. I tried with both TRS and TRRS cables but it doesn't change anything.\n\nI've also tested with another adapter (https://www.amazon.co.uk/Adapter-UWECAN-Headphone-Splitter-Essential-1-USB-C-Port-3-5mm-Jack/dp/B07M5ZXGYT) but, it doesn't solve the problem: the noise is reduced but still exists.\n\nI've tried to plug it on my computer as well and, it works fine with the second adapter but not with the provided one.\n\nSo now I'm kind of lost and, I don't know what to do. Has anyone had a similar issue?",
