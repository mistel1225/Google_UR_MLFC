    "content": "I have lost all the functions of auto rotate, auto brightness, tap and raise to wake on my Pixel 5. I have contacted support and was informed it was software to be addressed in the Dec2020 update. I have already ran it in safe mode after a factory reboot. Have checked and assured all items are in proper setting in the settings menu. Anyone with same ish issues speak up. Would like to hear what was found if fixed or if support has a answer given similar to the one given to me.",
