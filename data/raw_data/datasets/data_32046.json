    "content": "I have posted my phone as it was having a camera issue on the 5th of April. I have received no correspondence from google at all. At least send me a customer care number so I can chat to someone. I have been trying to talk to the shipment company and they are giving me a runaround. I am very frustrated with the situation. Need some urgent help.",
