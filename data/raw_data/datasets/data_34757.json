    "content": "My pixel 3 drops calls, won't make calls. It will dial and stay silent and not connect to the network for sometimes over 40 seconds. When I receive calls sometimes my phone will only ring once, I answer and the call is dropped. Sometimes I'll be having a conversation with someone and the phone will drop after a couple minutes. Sometimes I can not even complete making a call and I have to ask to use someone's phone because mine won't work.",
