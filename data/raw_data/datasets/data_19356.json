    "title": "Bluetooth Automatically Pairs With Previously Connected Devices, Even When Already Paired Elsewhere",
    "content": "I'm starting to get extremely frustrated with this, I can be connected to a Bluetooth device playing music, and as soon as another device is turned on in range (for example my roommate turning on a device), it will jump over to that new device and immediately start playing at the same volume level, which, can be problematic. \n\nIs there no way to turn this off without tediously forgetting each device every time? I just don't understand who possibly thought that whenever you come in range of a different device that's turned on that you'd always prefer to switch to it without even being prompted. I would 100% prefer to have to manually select which device I want to connect to so that this stops.  I'm assuming there's no solution yet, but, if there is I'd love to hear it. Thank you.",
