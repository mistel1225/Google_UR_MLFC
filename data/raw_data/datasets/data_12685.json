    "content": "Weather temperature is ALWAYS for a different location. When I select it, it opens the weather app with the correct location and temperature. That does not update the home screen. I would rather it be gone than incorrect... But understand that it is naked in.  Is there a way to correct this other than installing a 3rd party launcher?\n\nThis question had been asked before with no resolution so I am not the only one experiencing this.\n\nThanks in advance for any help.",
