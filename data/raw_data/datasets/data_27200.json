    "content": "Several times when i am using my phone (pixel 3a ) and someone calls me i am not able to open the call because nothing appears in the screen except the melody of ringing , while the phone is ringing i am able to open viber but there appears nothing related to the call , i am forced to activate airplane mode to stop the call then find the caller at call history . This has happened a lot to me both on lock and unlock screen . I tried to re install it but the error wont fix . While the phone is ringing and i swipe down the notification bar it says Viber Reconnecting but even when i click that it wont open the call. \n\nCheck the video https://bit.ly/2nZTgZ0",
