    "content": "My Gmail isn't refreshing and getting emails that have already showed up on my computer. I can't share pictures and save them to my Google Drive anymore, and no emails will send either. I tried to uninstall Google Classroom because it wasn't working, now it says I don't have access to Classroom through my association. My phone did an update or something recently where it restarted, but something went wrong and it told me to either try again or do a factory reset and loose all of my data. It's been generally slow lately so I thought it might have a bug or virus, but none of my antivirus apps detected anything. Is my phone just dying or is there some other issue with google apps right now?",
