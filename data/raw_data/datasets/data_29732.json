    "content": "4 days ago I updated my phone for the android 9 and i realised some problems. My phone is not touched every 2 minutes will freeze at the screen it is at. The temporary way to fix this is to charge my phone briefly. Next, my battery is supposed to last more than 6 hours I thought doing everyday stuff ,but i was wrong. Finally, my earphones look perfectly fine but do not work when plugged in. Please help",
