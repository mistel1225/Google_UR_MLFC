    "content": "There's some major issues in my pixel 2 phone. Whenever I turn my device lock, phone gets a notification or I try to minimize the screen brightness, the phone screen flickers. Not just once, every single time. Even when the phone is \"not in use\" mode, the screen flickers after fixed interval (say 15 sec)\n\nKindly guide me with a proper solution. It's been more than 6 months dealing with this Issue",
