    "content": "I prefer Signal as Text message, I have used Messenger as default, also hangouts, I check manually and text are visible, just no sound alert  to new message, If I'm texting or responding and a new message comes in, I receive sound, but outside of that nothing, I have all sound notifications checked in system, nothing is silenced or disabled.",
