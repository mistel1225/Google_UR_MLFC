    "content": "I am working on a technology that uses WiFi and LTE connectivity simultaneously. While testing on my Pixel 3a, I am seeing that LTE is put to sleep when there is a wifi network available. \n\nLTE being on sleep stops our technology to perform on pixel devices the same as other Android phones.\n\nIs there a work around to this where I can keep both connections active?",
