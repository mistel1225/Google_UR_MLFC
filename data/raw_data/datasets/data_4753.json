    "content": "When trying to use google assistant for home control (turning lights on...etc) while the phone is docked on pixel stand, it keeps asking for the phone to be unlocked which makes the voice assistant feature useless, if I have to unlock it for every action. Previously (a year ago or so) this wasn't the case so I am not sure what changed",
