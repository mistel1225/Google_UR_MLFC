    "title": "Pixel 3: Intermittently can't play videos on any app, it's like it's stuck on pause",
    "content": "Hello,\nI am getting this intermittent issues where I can't play videos on any app (YouTube, Reddit, WhatsApp etc.). The video will load and just show a still image like it's paused, you can pause and unpause but nothing plays. You can scroll through the video and see different still images.\n\nIt may happen twice in a day, once in a week, every other day - it's so intermittent and I can't figure out what causes it. The only way to resolve it is to restart the device.\n\nI have done a factory reset twice and I have now only got the bear minimum apps running, no games or anything just the Google apps, social media, Netflix and my banking apps but I still get the issue.\nTrying to replicate in safe mode isn't really an option as I can't have my phone running like this for a week and the affected apps would be disabled.\n\nAny ideas on what it could be?\n\nThanks",
