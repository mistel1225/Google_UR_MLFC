    "content": "I've had my Google pixel 5 for 2 months and the battery section on settings now says \"Battery may run out earlier than usual\". The only \"heavy use\" I use is watching games on Twitch, but that's maybe for an hour every few days?\nI've turned my Bluetooth off. \nI don't have many apps installed. \nDark mode is enabled. \nI use a genuine charger. \n\nI've read the Google help page on Battery drainage but can't identify the issue. \nPlease could someone help me?\n\nMany thanks",
