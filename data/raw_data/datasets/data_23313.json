    "content": "When I bought a pixel 3 device, it was working fine for about first 6 months and then there were some charging issues. I tried contacting Google support and was assured that my phone will be replaced and that I will receive an email with all the replacement procedure. For consecutive 3 attempts I just received \"Thanks for contacting Google\" mail. After struggling for almost 4-5 months, one day I called support and told them that I'm not hanging up until I receive a mail. It took them about an hour and a half to send a single email. I was assured on the phone call that I will receive my phone back within 12-14 business days. Well I have dispatched my phone on 8th January 2020 and it has been received at the facility on 14th January 2020. It has been more than a month that I don't have my phone with me and Google has not responded to my query. All I hear from Google is the phone is in testing phase and will be dispatched when the testing is done. Well, Google, if you had done enough testing before selling us the phones, this inconvenience wouldn't have occurred. It is a shameful service provided by one of the most trustworthy company. I believe Xiaomi, Oppo has better service standards than what I am experiencing with Google. I need an update on the replacement device and a solid evidence on when it will arrive. If this doesn't work then I haven't left any choice but to spam Twitter or proceed through consumer rights protection. I haven't paid hefty money to experience nothing but a disappointment.",
