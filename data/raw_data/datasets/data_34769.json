    "title": "My pixel 2 frequently loses connection to mobile data so I cannot receive phone calls or text messages. This is very annoying because there is no indication of the problem until I try to make a call or send a text, so sometimes I miss important calls or texts without realizing it. When I do try to make a call or text it says something like no SMS data or no simcard found. A restart of the phone will fix the problem , but then without any indication I will lose the ability to send or receive calls and texts.",
