    "content": "Yes, I use Do Not Disturb so please do not ask me to turn it off and read all of the following words before replying (thanks!). I have Do Not Disturb set to ring for contacts and it has been working well since that feature came out but after the update to Android 11 it will no longer ring with a built in ring tone. If I add my own ring tone and set that either as default or to an individual contact it will ring for everyone or that one number accordingly. If I turn off Do Not Disturb everything makes noise as it should but I dont want this, I want to filter my calls so only contacts ring. I am not interesting in any solutions which involve 3rd party apps or something else. My Sounds > Do Not Disturb settings allow contacts to interrupt (under people), alarms & other interruptions are all on, and advanced > display options for hidden notifications are custom and all unchecked. For now I have an a custom ring tone set as default but I think this is a bug and wanted someone to see it, but the chat support is not available. Thanks1",
