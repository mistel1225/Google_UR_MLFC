    "content": "All the sudden, I can't connect to my work enterprise wi-fi. I contacted my IT department. They said that out of 15,000 employees nobody else have problem but me. I told them that I may be the only one with Pixel 3 with 'Google Fi' then. I was told to contact Google as Google is trying to enforce a stringent  'Wireless Security Policy\" on the organization like ours. I was also told by my IT department to switch to non-Android phone as Apple has dedicated server to do all 'these type of stuff' I can eliminate an Android headaches, especially caused by Google Pixel 3 and other Google Fi phones, by switching to Apple or something similar.",
