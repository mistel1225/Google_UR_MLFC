    "content": "I have run through the red led flashing troubleshooting guides here and elsewhere to no avail. It seems that the cable on my Pixel 2 charge is bad, as it would not even display the red light when plugged in.  I since (during troubleshooting) swapped the cable with one from my Pixel 3 (using the same original Pixel 2 adapter with it), and now it flashes red, but even after charging for hours, it never responds to the power button more than to vibrate once, show the B&W charging symbol, and flashing red light.  Help I have hardly had this phone for a year.",
