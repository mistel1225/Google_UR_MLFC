    "content": "My usbc port is loose and keeps dropping android auto connection.  Several techs suggested new cables, I have tried 5 different new cables.  The port is not dirty because I use a lifeproof case that is water and dust proof.  The charging cable never has a problem.  Head phones always work.  The car seems to be more sensitive.  The cable can be moved slightly left, right and up and down.  Suggestions?",
