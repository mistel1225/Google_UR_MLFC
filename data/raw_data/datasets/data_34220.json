    "content": "My pixel 3 XL has started being unreliable while talking on the phone. It will have connection problems where the audio drops out either at my end or their end. Usually one can hear the other but not vice versa. The cause could be many things... but I have had the same carrier and lived in the same place for years and never had this happen before. What I noticed helps, is if I press the hold button and then press it again to deactivate...the call return to normal...which leads me to think it is some software thing?",
