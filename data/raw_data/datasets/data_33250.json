    "title": "The clock on my phone and all of my calendar events are messed up after daylight savings",
    "content": "Well, I had to manually change my timezone to Arizona time, because for some reason the device refuses to pick up the correct timezone and is incorrectly applying daylight savings when it shouldn't be. To add insult to injury, it incorrectly changed the time on all of my appointments in my calendar, and is wreaking havoc on things like having the correct time off from work for my dentist appointment. As a programmer who worked in time and attendance, I understand the difficulties that day light savings poses, but I live somewhere where there isn't DST, so it should have been a non-issue.",
