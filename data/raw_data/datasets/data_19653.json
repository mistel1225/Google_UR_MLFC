    "content": "I had made a post complaining about how my Pixel XL's battery performance was bad, but i investigated the issue on my own and came up with this conclusion i think this may help all of us!\nSo i noticed that the pixel \"shutting off\" issue is caused by the battery's temperature. lithium batteries are known for having poor performance issues in the cold, and i noticed that when i keep my phone warm (30c+) it can go all the way down to 5% battery before \"shutting down\", and if my phone is cold (below 20c) the battery \"gives up\" and shuts down around 30~50% battery indicator. \n\nTIP: Keep your old google pixel in your pocket or near your skin in cold weather because the heat will help the battery last longer! :D\n\nAs far as i know this probably affects most modern battery packs based off Li-Ion tech, so as a general rule of thumb it's good to keep them lioon battery packs \"warm\"!\nIs there a way i could get more involved in making the pixel experience even better than it already is?",
