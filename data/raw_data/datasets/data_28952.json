    "content": "Under my devices in google mine is named lg fortune 2 and is \"this device\" but there is another named lm-x210cm. I know they are the same phone but does that mean that someone has access to my google account?  Side note: my bf likes to hack into my stuff and he until very recently had the same phone as me. If it is him, is there a way to keep him from doing it? He's much more tech savvy than i am",
