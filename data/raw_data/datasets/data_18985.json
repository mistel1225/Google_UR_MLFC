    "content": "My Pixel 4 got the July 2020 security update this morning. After the update LTE no longer works and I am forced to manually switch to 3G in order to be able to make calls.\n\nTurning off WiFi and removing then re-inserting the sim card appears to allow LTE to connect again in the status bar, but when I attempt to make a call I get a pop up stating 'Mobile network is not available'.\nWiFi calling also does not work unless I am connected to 3G.\n\nThis doesn't appear to be a network issue with TMobile as I have another identical Pixel 4 that has not been updated with the latest security patch and LTE works fine.\n\nAny resolutions to this?\nAm I going to have to wait for another security patch for this to get fixed?",
