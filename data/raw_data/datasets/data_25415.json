    "content": "I'm unable to turn on wifi hotspot. Each time i want to enable it from settings panel, it crashes whole settings panel and closes it. If i try to enable it from other places it just does nothing and shows \"Error\" text underneath a button.\n\nI've already tried to reset network settings and setup from scratch my wifi connections. I've tried to test it with both mobile data and wifi enabled. I've tested both 2.4 ghz and 5 ghz wifi networks. \n\nI'm also unable to go to hotspot settings, it crashes settings as well.\n\nPhone is brand new, bought few days ago.",
