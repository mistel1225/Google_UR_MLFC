    "content": "My wife's pixel XL just stopped working.  O e minute it was fine, then it was dead.  Tied to soft and hard reboot, but the phone is unresponsive.  Did try with phone plugged up to supplied wall charger and with it to a computer(computer did not see phone at any time during my attempts to boot).  I confirmed all this stuff was working with my pixel XL.  What are my next steps?  Anyway I can factory reset the wife's phone so I can at least trade it in on a new phone?  Thanks in advance!",
