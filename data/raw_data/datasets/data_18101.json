    "content": "I have had to upload the YouMail app b/c visual voicemail, while it can be installed, doesn't work. YouMail is glitchy for me. I am constantly losing calls. If it rings one too many times and I search my phone for the call - it cannot be found. The call is gone. Sometimes I swipe up to receive the call and it disappears. This happens at least once per week which is very frustrating. Friends have the Pixel 3a and use Verizon and Visual Voicemail works just fine. I don't get it. Anybody have a solution? Thinking about going back to iphone.",
