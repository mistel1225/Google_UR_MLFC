    "title": "Phone overheats frequently, even when not charging. Paid full price and continuing to pay the price.",
    "content": "I have tried everything short of a full reset b/c there is no indication that the issue is corrupt software. Updates since receiving it shortly after launch still have shown no improvement. The most expensive phone I've ever bought and the most regret. Other issues such as camera crashing during recording, sometimes due to the overheating (indoors at a short performance) just add to the frustration. I've lost a number of recordings of my kids due to an issue I've never experienced with any other phone.",
