    "title": "camera blacks out in low light",
    "content": "My camera blacks out (sometimes starting with a fuchsia fade) whenever I try to use it in low light.  Once it blacks out, I usually have to exit and reenter the app to get camera functionality at all.  This means that I can only count on my camera (using native app or through another) in bright situations; night sight is essentially nonexistent.",
