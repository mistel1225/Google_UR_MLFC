    "content": "So I bought a pixel 4 through att last year in June 2020 and it recently broke early this year in January. The screen went black but I could tell it still functioned because my morning alarms would go off. There was nothing you can do but lower the volume. I contact att and was told since it's still under a year you should file a warranty replacement with google so I wouldn't have to pay out of pocket. So that's what I do. I contact google they tell me to send my device first or go to a local ubreakifix store so that they can repair it. I take it to the store to get fixed a day later I get call saying they can't repair to contact google again so they can send a replacement. So I contact google and they tell me to send my device  first which I thought was weird but I went ahead and did it.  Took about a week later and I get the replacement. Turns out it's a refurbished phone and on day 1 of the refurbished device my service cuts in and out through out the day. Can't text or call or use data for the internet. At this point I'm furious and contact google again and was told the same options. I was very upset and managed to get them to send me a \"pristine \" device. 3 days later now we're in February I get an email saying they don't have any pristine devices in stock so they can only resend me another refurbished device. I'm outraged and said I'm owed a new device since I'm still paying off the new device with att. I shouldn't be sent refurbished phones. If I'm paying for a 800 dollar phone I should get an 800 dollar phone. Currently waiting for a supervisor to email me. I don't understand this!",
