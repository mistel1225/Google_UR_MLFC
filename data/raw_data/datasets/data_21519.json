    "content": "This has been an ongoing problem for me. I might be listening to Spotify then suddenly it cuts out; the sound won't work at all whether I have earbubs plugged in or not. Then sometimes when I go back to the home screen it freezes. It's really weird because if I double tap the power button the camera will come up, but my phone is still frozen. Then I restart my phone and sometimes it boots up still without sound, other times sound might work for a little bit before cutting out.\n\nI don't think any of my apps cuased this, and im on up to date on Android.\nI'll provide more information if you need it thanks",
