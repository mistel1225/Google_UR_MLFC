    "title": "OG Pixel Video Error \"Something went wrong - part of this video may not be saved\"",
    "content": "Recently, for the last few weeks or so, I get this error message when trying to record video. The issue doesn't come up until I have been recording for about 2-3 minutes. I get two sequential error messages. First, it says \" Can't record audio, another app is using the mic.\" Then it quickly switches to \"Something went wrong - part of this video may not be saved.\" Then the video fails. I tried in safe mode and encountered the same issue. Only major changes Ive made to my phone lately are the standard OTA updates and getting a new battery professionally installed. The issue started before the latest April OTA update, and that update did not fix the issue.",
