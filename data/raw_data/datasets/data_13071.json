    "content": "I just got my Pixel 5 yesterday and really like it, but have noticed that there is about a 10-15 second lag between making a call and the line ringing. I have this regardless of whom I'm calling (even my own voicemail #). Has anyone else noticed this? I'm in an area with reasonably good coverage, using T-Mobile's network via Ting.",
