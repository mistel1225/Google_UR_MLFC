    "content": "I've no idea where it's come from and I certainly didn't ask for it not set it up . The experience is just awfull . Like looking at old style negatives but with a metallic element! To me this phone is THE BEST, or was. Now it's a living nightmare and I can't afford to just ditch it and buy a new one. Plus I've\" upgraded it to an 11 status. Please someone help me . I'm truly desperate! Cheers. Steve .",
