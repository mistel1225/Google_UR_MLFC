    "title": "Why would my Pixel 2 screen be black and only have a few pixels illuminating? No known damage.",
    "content": "My phone worked fine; I set it on the coffee table for roughly an hour, and next time I tried to use it the screen would not illuminate. I can still feel the feedback when I try to unlock or manually restart it. There were a few pixels illuminating near the bottom right corner of the screen when this issue began. I left my phone undisturbed for a while and just tried again, and those few pixels are no longer illuminating. When I hold the unlock button for ~30 seconds, the bottom Â¼ of the screen will flicker white.",
