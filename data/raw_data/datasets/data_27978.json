    "content": "I'm having two issues with my Pixel 3a, that are relating to the Bluetooth adapter I have in my car. \nI've set my Pixel 3a up to auto-launch Driving Mode when connecting to the Bluetooth adapter in my car, however I have to manually connect it to said Bluetooth adapter whenever I drive, which is annoying. I can't seem to get it to autoconnect. But, what is more annoying, is that:\nThe phone has now started trying to launch Driving Mode when I'm not even in my car, and the adapter is off. Something else seems to be triggering it.\n\nFor now I've turned off the auto launch feature, but has anyone else experienced either issue?",
