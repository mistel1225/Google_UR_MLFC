    "content": "I was used the Pixel 3 XL, it reboot suddenly when I used the phone. After rebooting, I can use it normally for a time, and it reboot again. Then I buy the Pixel 4 XL, but it still has same issue. Due to both the Pixel 3 XL and Pixel 4 XL has same issue, I think that is not a hardware issue, and maybe cause by some application that I installed on both phone, but I don't know which.\nBoth phone, my system is update to newest version system, and all application is updated, too. The disk space of phone has over 80GB space. I think if I enter the safe mode, the phone will normal, but I can't find with application is the root cause.\nI am a software engineer, can I find which application cause the system reboot from the system log (for example, kernel message or logcat)?",
