    "content": "Dear team,\n\nI am deeply wounded by the pixel customer care support team.\n\nI am pixel lover and impressed about google products everytime and I convinced myself customer support will be given in future.so that I brought pixel 2 mobile.\n\nBut unfortunately my first ever experience with customer care and customer satisfaction made me depressed. \n\nI brought the device on 10/Dec/2017.At that time the device is running in Android Oreo 8.0,after that android 9.0 pie came and with more excitement with cool feature I upgraded to android pie 9.0 from the first day after upgrade I'm facing low volume in speaker during in call as well as normal usage of YouTube and other media. After that I searched I forum there also most of the pixel 2 user facing the same issues as I mentioned above.Then I waited for next update so that bug will be fixed even after android 10.0 the bug is not fixed.\n\nActually I want to help technical ,research and development team to look forward this issues so that it has to be fixed in next update of software.so that next pixel customer should not get disappointed like me.",
