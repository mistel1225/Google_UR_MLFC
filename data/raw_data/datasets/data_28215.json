    "content": "My Pixel 3 has all of a sudden stopped vibrating. I have done safe restarts and the problem is still there. I downloaded a vibration test app and it works but despite all.my settings being correct there is still no vibrate for apps or messages. I've seen this has been asked many times before but no one seems to have got an answer. Im in the process of making sure everything is backed up to do a factory reset.\n\nAny other advice would be greatly appreciated",
