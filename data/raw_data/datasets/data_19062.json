    "title": "Pixel 3a - Messaging App Really Slow",
    "content": "I just bought a Pixel 3a from Best Buy and have Cricket for carrier. The messaging app is really slow to open and when I read a text it often takes over a minute to show it as read. Similarly, when I send a text, even after the receiver gets the message on their phone, my messaging app still won't show it as the last message until about 30 seconds later. I know Cricket isn't compatible with Chat Features so I did try shutting that off but I'm still really frustrated by how slow this app is performing given all the raving reviews I read about this phone.",
