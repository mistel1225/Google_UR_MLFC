    "content": "Has Google made it possible to remove the search bar and the at a glance widgets? I know about the alternative launcher hacks, but I feel like this should be an option on the stock android. The screen is already kinda small, and there's no need for the search bar since chrome is a click a way. It's so annoying to have that bar eating up valuable screen space, I might even return the phone.",
