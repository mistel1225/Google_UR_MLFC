    "content": "I'm trying to clean storage by deleting pics n vids but they seem to stay on my phone even though they are already uploaded n space is already freed up. How do I delete pics n vids still stuck in my phone? My phone is full to the max n my phone is not working properly. Please help? I also started having issues after android 11 changed things around on my phone. Is android 11 the last update? Are there going to be any more updates?",
