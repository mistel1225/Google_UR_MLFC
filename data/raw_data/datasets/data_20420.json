    "content": "My Pixel 4 will randomly just go black and become unresponsive. I've tried holding the power button, which only occasionally will produce results with the screen lighting up, but then will just go back out again. The facial recognition will work for a split moment, because I can hear the video I was watching resume, but the screen stays off. After a few minutes the screen comes back on. What do I do?",
