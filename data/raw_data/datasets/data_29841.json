    "content": "My Pixel is slowing self-destructing.\nI've noticed the battery life deteriorate over time but for the past month or so it can only last less than 5 minutes not plugged into a charger. \nIt has been repeatedly freezing (including during phone calls) and sometimes it will freeze, I will switch it off, turn it back on and it will freeze again up to 10 times.  \nThe newest issue has been with the speakers, particularly during calls where I either can't hear my phone ringing as I try and call someone or they can't hear me talking - it also affected media and alarms.\n\nI expect more from a phone I paid over $1000 for which is less than 2 years and 3 months old!",
