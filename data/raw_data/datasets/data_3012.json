    "content": "I upgraded from a pixel 2 to a pixel 4a whenever it came out, and since day 1 I have had nothing but problems with bluetooth connections. While in my car or using bluetooth headsets, any sort of notification (email, text, snapchat) or unlocking/locking the phone will drop all bluetooth connections. \n\nI talked to support a few times and completed all steps with no avail. Anyone else have issues like this?",
