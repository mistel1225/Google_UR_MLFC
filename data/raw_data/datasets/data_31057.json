    "title": "Account lockout and family link",
    "content": "I was setting up a pixel for my son, we set up his account and put his age in as ten, then linked it to my phone via the family link app. Then his account got deleted I think because it was new and inactive for a week or so, and now we can use his phone or reset it due to the family link set on the phone. It asked for him to log in with his account that is now deleted. If I try and log in with his account on a chrome book it says it doesn't exist but if I try a create it with the same log in I'm told it's in use. His phone is now not usable. I have tried a hard reset but the option doesn't come up but this might be due to the phone not being plugged into a charger at the time. But some help is needed to try and remove his deleted account from the phone.",
