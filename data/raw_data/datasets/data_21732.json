    "content": "Hi, I own Pixel 3a device which was bought online on Google store US. My device screen lately has area without touch sense like an untouchable vertical line. I tried to use my warranty (will expiere on June 1st 2020). I went to https://store.google.com/us/repair and started a repair procedure but then i recieved error OR-CAC-20 with the following string: f1b40f41246b2d80. It seems like the phone support and chat support from Google store are not availible due to COVID-19. I'm very concerned because this phone cost me a fortune, now it isn't working well and my warranty will end in 2 months. What should I do?",
