    "content": "My Pixel was running slow so I decided to restart it by holding down the power button, then selecting \"Restart\" while in Pkmn GO. My phone didn't reboot successfully afterwards. Instead, it brings me to \"Android recovery, states the version 8.1.0, and that it can't load the Android systems. I have tried multiple times using the \"Try again\" option, I am not able to boot it into safe mode either. I have been looking for potential 3rd party apps to recover data before factory resetting but am not finding anything that is helpful to me. Any ideas or options before I factory reset my device? Thanks! - Hope",
