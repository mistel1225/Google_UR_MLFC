    "content": "My Pixel 3 is 1.5 years old and got stuck in a bootloop that I wasn't even to get it to factory reset. I took it to UbreakIFix and they initially put in a new battery and that didn't work, but they were able to get it to factory reset and they said they have no idea what the issue is but at least for now it works. Two weeks later my phone got stuck in the bootloop again. Any ideas how to fix it?",
