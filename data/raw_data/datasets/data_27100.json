    "content": "I have noticed that my rear videos my Pixel shoots are jumpy and glitchy. You can hear the lens making a noise when it happens.  I have changed between 4k and 1080, disabled stability and a few other things and it still happens.  It still happens after the March update.\n\nPlease see this clip of it.\nhttps://photos.app.goo.gl/CbTkpgbDFweP4XMc9",
