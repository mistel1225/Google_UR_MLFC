    "content": "I am having issues with the notches in games. I want the to turn off while in games that need a full screen. Also maybe making it easier to do change the settings without entering developer mode would also help. The notch covers things to either side when in this game for example... this screen shot just showed me a button I did not know was there because of notch. I like the notch when I am not in a fullscreen app. ",
