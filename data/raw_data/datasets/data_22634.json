    "content": "Phone refuses to charge. Constantly reports 50% battery. I know the charger and cable are good, because I've used them on another Pixel phone and my Pixelbook.\n\nUpdate:\nAfter a factory reset and several reboots, the battery % started reporting correctly. After another week of use, with the battery intermitently misreporting again,  I'm fairly sure that the battery itself is fine, and the charging is actually working, it's only the reporting that is broken. I don't know if this is a hardware issue or a software issue, but it's frustrating and clearly an unacceptable condition.\n\nI had the phone for months before this problem occured, I have since RMAed the phone, and the replacement is working perfectly, thus far.",
