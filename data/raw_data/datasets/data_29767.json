    "content": "I'm on the latest Android Q beta. I'm on the June 5th 2019 security patch. I have tried updating to the July 5th 2019 security patch but it just says \"your device is up to date'. It's not. It's July 8th and I still can't update to the July 5th 2019 security patch, I'm stuck on the June 5th 2019 security patch. I'm on a Google Pixel 2. Thanks.",
