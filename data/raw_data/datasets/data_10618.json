    "content": "Most times I record audio with my 4A, I play it back and it plays back choppy and as if on 2x speed. It is not just on a specific app it is across all voice recording apps. However call voices are fine.\nI have tried uninstalling and reinstalling voice recording apps but it persists.\nI have not been able to find others with this bug and it has been consistent since I've received the phone.",
