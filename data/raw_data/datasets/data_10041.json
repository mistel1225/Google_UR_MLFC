    "title": "Google Recorder not playing audio",
    "content": "I made a recording using Google Recorder, about 15 minutes, I can see that there should be audio, but there is no sound. Also the transcript ends about 4:45. I exported the audio file and I can hear the whole thing on my computer. I'm not hearing audio in any of my recordings, even those I've reviewed before on the phone. I've cleared cache, turned off Bluetooth, checked every other setting I can find. Other audio apps work fine.",
