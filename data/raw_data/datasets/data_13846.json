    "content": "Hello,\n\nI (think I) preordered the Fi Pixel 5 about a week and a half ago. Went through the whole process of adding the Fi version of the pixel 5 sage to my cart, adding the trade in, and selecting the 24m payments. Upon doing so, I was brought to the Synchrony website to apply for their credit card. Went through that process, and received an email from Synchrony saying that I was approved and will be snail-mailed a welcome letter in 7-10 days to setup my online account. After getting Synchrony's initial email, I finished checking out on the Google website, but never got any communications from Google confirming my preorder. After setting up my Synchrony account 7-10 days later, there was no balance on it either.\n\nSo unsure if the preorder even took or not. Anyone else ever have this issue?\n\nTried chatting with customer service in the google store help center, but was put in touch with the Buds team, and they couldn't help find any records. And now there is a ticket still open and I'm not given the option to chat with anyone else.",
