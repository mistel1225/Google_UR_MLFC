    "content": "I just received my Google pixel 4a today. It showed me it had android updates available, android 11. When I clicked on starting the updates, the screen just shows the google G and a progress bar underneath that does nothing. I just got this phone, this is unacceptable. \n\nCan anyone help me?",
