    "content": "I'm using an app called HfunPro to control a drone.  This has the capacity to take photos and record video from the drone camera.\n\nPhotos are fine and the live video feed displays without issue, but when videos a recorded they are corrupted, blocky, large grey artefacts etc.\n\nI've tested on a Galaxy S7 running Android 8 and videos record without issue, so I know the drone camera is working fine.",
