    "content": "Hello,\n\nAfter some recent update when trying to select a contact to call through phone \"keypad\" my Pixel 3a no longer shows close contact matches but only a single match, alphabetically first. If I have two contacts with similar names (only last letter is different) I can only reach and dial the first one. The second one is available when searching through contacts list with standard keyboard but this not convenient at all. Any ideas on what could be wrong here and how to revert to the old style?\n\nBR,\nVesselin.",
