    "content": "When using the front camera for video calls in WhatsApp, Skype and messenger the front camera is very blurry. No details are visible. It requires a lot of light for it to focus. Very problematic, I can't do video calls properly.\nWhen I used Google's Duo, the picture is different kind of problematic, it becomes very grainy, like distorted/pixelated.\nWith the inbuilt camera, it's perfectly fine.\nPlease provide a fix for this. What is the issue here, I bought this phone a month ago.",
