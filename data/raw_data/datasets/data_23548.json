    "title": "Android 10 upgrade -- Bluetooth headphones not working for phone calls",
    "content": "After the upgrade to Android 10 on my Pixel 2 XL, my Bluetooth headphones do not work for phone calls. \n\nI can use them to listen to music (e.g. Spotify), but when I make a phone call, the sound does not go to the BT device; it doesn't appear as one of the possible devices either, just the speaker. \n\nI have checked on the phone BT options for the headphones that \"Phone calls\" is enabled. Tried disabling + reenabling, but hasn't worked. \n\nMy headphones are Plantronics Voyager Focus UC, and have worked flawlessly with all the previous Android versions until I upgraded to v10.  :-/\n\nAnyone else affected? Any possible solutions?\n\nThanks!",
