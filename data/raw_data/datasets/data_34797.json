    "content": "Google fit keeps giving me an error of \"Can't verify your account\" when I'm trying to sign in.\nI have a FULL wifi signal and have tried the same thing using just LTE, and get the same result.\nI even went so far as to factory reset my Pixel 3xl, deleted the app, cleared cache and forced stop, tried ALL of those, and on a fully fresh load, I'm getting the SAME error message.  Is Google Fit having issues???",
