    "content": "After updating to android 11 i started seeing many bugs. High battery drain, bluetooth connection issues when receiving a phone call while listening to audio. SMS app displaying a blank screen except for the notification bar. But last night i plugged into charger and after about 10 mins the phone had turned off. It wasn't warm or wet, it was the same charger and cord i've used since i bought the phone 6-7 months ago. But now it wont turn on. after holding the power button for between 15-20 seconds it displays the google title the shuts off again. If i try to go into recovery mode it displays it for about a second then shuts off again. I suspect its the battery but its less than 12 months old and i have no idea where the reciept is. it used to be in the box which i still have but now its missing. Will i still get covered by waranty since its obviously an issue caused by either google or the manufacturer.",
