    "content": "I have been through all the notification settings but can't pin point which is causing the issue. I receive many messages through the day for work and used to just swipe it from home screen after reading it and that's all I needed to do. Now it resends those unread texts and I'm not interested in that feature. This only started to happen maybe a month ago and I'd like to stop it. Thanks for any help",
