    "content": "I received my Pixel 3a from Google yesterday and set it up. Down loaded my apps and everything was working fine. Then it shut down and would not boot up when I pressed the fingerprint sensor. It has done it two more times and I have to do a hard reset to get it to reboot.\nAny solution?",
