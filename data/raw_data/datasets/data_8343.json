    "content": "I bought a google Pixel 4a in Germany this december since they don't sell it in Norway where I live. All of a sudden the phone is no longer registering the sim card. I have tried everything, factory reset, network reset, not used the phone for days, different sim cards ecetra.... Since I live on Norway, there is no provider I can send it to here. What can I do? Where can I send it to get it fixed?",
