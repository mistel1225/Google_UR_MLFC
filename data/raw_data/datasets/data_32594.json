    "content": "My pixel 2 will not stay Bluetooth connected to my devices. I started to notice it about a month ago when I was having to frequently reconnect my Fitbit, I’ve recently been having to reconnect about twice a week and as of two days ago it’s not connecting at all. I can find it in my previously connected drop down but when it tap the Fitbit it doesn’t even try to connect. This has been happening with my wireless light switches, switchmate, and today my Bluetooth FM transmitter. I’ve restarted my phone, made sure everything is updated.",
