    "content": "I want to use an external microphone with a Pixel 4XL.\n\nIt is a BOYA BY-M1 and I have connected it to the official Google USB-C to 3.5mm adapter (although maybe this is for headphones with a microphone, not only a microphone).\n\nBut when I plug in it to the smartphone, I see a notification with this message:\nAnalog audio accessory detected\nThe attached device is not compatible with this phone. Tap to learn more.\n\n\n\nCan I use this microphone with the Pixel 4XL somehow?\n\nIf not, can I use this smartphone with a similar microphone?\n\n\nThanks!",
