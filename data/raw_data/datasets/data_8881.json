    "title": "Pixel 4 XL cycles through different states while charging wirelessly",
    "content": "My Pixel 4 XL has started having problems with wireless charging over the past few weeks. While on different chargers (including two separate Pixel stands), it will alternately show the battery percentage alone, the battery percentage with \"Charging wirelessly (X hr. X min. until full)\", \"Realign phone for faster charging,\" and a blank screen. It will eventually charge in spite of this, but the screen constantly changing while charging is a major distraction, especially at night. Plugging it in is a way around the problem, but I'd like to continue using the wireless charging if possible; it's one of my favorite features of the phone.",
