    "content": "I'm setting up reminders but most of the time the reminders do not work unless I unlock my phone and the past reminder will pop. Like this morning I had set few reminders at 8:00 a.m. and it did not ring until I woke up and unlocked my phone and all of the reminders started popping up. I've been checking on internet and a lot of people even on another handset has the same issue is there any way I can fix it is it related to the battery optimization I'm not sure if someone else has come across this I was using a life reminders app actually only for the battery reason I wanted to give Google reminders a try. Please advise.",
