    "content": "I bought my first pixel device (pixel 4a) from amazon. After using it for 5 days, i was starting to get some issue with the front facing camera. It is getting freezed and the images are getting distorted. I tried troubleshooting in everyway but still the problem occurs. I had no other option other than returning the product to amazon as they can't replace the product as there was no other device on stock. I felt really sad. Because, i kinda liked the device a lot. But at the same time google has disappointed me in the way they give support to these devices and the availability. If i buy a device and it's having camera issues right after one week, camera which is a primary component of such google device getting such issues are unacceptable. And it's really bad that google haven't reported this issue officially, because combing through a lot of Reddit threads i came to the many people are facing the same. I don't think i can afford such device even when i like it so much. It's really sad.",
