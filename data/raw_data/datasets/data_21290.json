    "content": "My pixel 3 XL camera suddenly stopped focusing. It's only possible to take pictures very close to the objects. I saw that a few people had the same problem and they solved it sending back to the manufacturer. The problem is that I bought this phone from a refurbished store and they told me they can only refound me. I'm currently living in Brazil and seems like there is no kind of support from Google around here. I'm starting to think about giving this phone back and going back to the iOS, buying the new iPhone 11 seems to be the correct move.",
