    "content": "My pixel 2xl has been restarting on it's own for about 2 weeks now. I tried starting it in recovery mode, but no avail. Also tried safe mode but nothing.\nSometimes when it shuts off, I have to charge it before it boots\nNext step is to reset, I want to know if that will work\nI don't know what is causing all of thisðŸ˜­",
