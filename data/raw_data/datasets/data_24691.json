    "content": "For the love of my sanity. Someone please tell me how to turn off ANY form of automatically activated Bluetooth! I don't care about any of the extra driving mode crap. I have short cuts with destinations. I want to manually turn on and turn off Bluetooth ONLY. It just keeps turning on and I can not stop it. I have been through 10 different ways trying figure this out. \n\nHelp please...\n\nA frustrated user",
