    "content": "I just got a new pixel 3xl, and i was switching fro iphone 6 plus, which i am having for 4 years now. i notice the battery is draining so fast, even while i am sleeping like 6 or 8 hours this can make the battery go down like 10% or more, and i think this is unusual, also the youtube application seems to be draining the battery, it is shown that over 50% of battery used by youtube app in just 26 minutes of usuage.",
