    "content": "Any headphones plugged into my pixel 4a no longer have the ability to stop/pause what's playing via the switch. \n\nI thought it was headphones first but a new pair gave the same results. \n\nRebooting didn't help and I haven't changed any settings or installed any new apps. \n\nThe only thing was a software update.",
