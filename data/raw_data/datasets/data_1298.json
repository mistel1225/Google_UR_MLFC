    "content": "I have had a Pixel 5 since December 2020. It’s worked very well and I’ve had no issues with it. However, wireless charging has suddenly become extremely slow. I use a Pixel Stand at my computer desk and a 3rd party wireless charger bedside and charging at both locations has slowed down significantly. However, direct USB-C charging is as fast as ever.\n\nI’m not sure what has caused this slow wireless charging all of a sudden. I’ve done everything to troubleshoot. I have removed the thin phone case to try again (previous, there was no issues with leaving the case on) and have also rebooted the phone twice. I’ve called Google support and they are less than helpful. They just give me very generic steps to try.\n\nI believe this change in wireless charging behaviour came about after the May 2021 security update. However, I admit that this problem might date back a couple of months. Since a couple of months ago, I sometimes wake up in the morning and take my phone off the bedside wireless charger and noticed it was not at 100%. This was intermittent behaviour and I had attributed to possibly not having my Pixel 5 aligned properly overnight. But since the May update, it seems like it is a constant behaviour.\n\nAnyone with any ideas or has observed similar issues with their charging?",
