    "title": "Notification drawer - delayed response & blank notifications",
    "content": "For at least two or three months I have been having problems with the Pixel Launcher on my P4 XL 128 GB.  The notifications are very delayed but only sometimes (more often then not though).  The prime examples of this are as follows:\n\n1) YouTube Music - When I have been listening to music and I swipe up to close the app YouTube Music still appears in the notification drawer for up to 10 seconds after the app has been closed.  \n2)  Phone Calls - After I end a phone call it will still appear in the notification drawer for up to 10 seconds afterward as if the call is still in progress even after the call has ended and the phone app has been closed.\n\nLast night a new issue also appeared.  I swiped down my notification drawer and all the items were blank (see picture).  I have already tried a factory reset and the issue still persists.  I tried booting into safe mode and it didn't do it, then I booted back into regular mode and it didn't do it either, but after a day or so it is back to doing the same thing again.  This is not a memory issue and the only apps running in the background are Reddit and the Ring app.\n\nThis is extremely annoying.  Any advice would be greatly appreciated.  The device has the latest March 2020 update applied.",
