    "content": "Some photos (maybe 1 of 20) end up with this corruption. The image initially displays fine on the screen but once the \"processing\" finishes it changes to a partially corrupt image. I'd normally associate this with a bad SD card but given there is no SD card that wouldn't be it. An issue with the phone's storage perhaps?",
