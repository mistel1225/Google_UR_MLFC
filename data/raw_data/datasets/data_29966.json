    "content": "The network security key is not working. Am trying to connect my phone to my pc to use the data. Have restarted the phone, cleared the cache, battery saving is disabled, plenty of data to work with and have changed the password.\nAm able to use a Samsung phone to hotspot to the same device with no issues.\nAny assistance would be appreciated.",
