    "content": "Yesterday when I was using my Pixel 3 as usual I realized it didn't turn on, even though it was charged. I tried holding on the power button more than 30 seconds. I also plugged my phone in to the original charger. When I hold down the power button when the phone is on charge the google image pops up only for a second and goes black again, sometimes flashing the charging symbol.\nI looked up the problem online and tried to reboot the phone. I held down the power button and the volume down button and entered to the fastboot mode. I tried every option and it didn't work. When the phone is in this mode, I also tried to troubleshoot it on my computer. I got an error saying Android Bootloader Interface is an older USC device and might not work with USB 3.0.",
