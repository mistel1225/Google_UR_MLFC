    "title": "Photo gallery is completely jumbled and out of order when using apps starting yesterday.",
    "content": "Photos in all app selection menus are out of order and different folders combined- very difficult to find recent photos, such as when trying to send a picture through text app or upload on Instagram. Photos remain in chronological order when viewed on Google Photos and the camera's gallery. I did not update or edit any apps or photos, this started happening last night and was never an issue before. Have found no relevant help online in forums.  Have tried updating apps and the phone to fix this issue but it did not help. Certain photos keep popping up to the top of the selection in apps despite deleting them. \n\nPlease advise.",
