    "content": "I have seen a similar post but that solution is not working for us. My spouse recently gave his old 3a to our child. The Family Link app on our devices will not show the location of our child's phone nor will it ring the phone. However, he can share his location via Google Maps with the location sharing feature too us. When we access Google's find my device function via our PC the phone can be located and rung. It just does not work on Family Link I just get the \"can not connect. _____'s device may be offline message\"",
