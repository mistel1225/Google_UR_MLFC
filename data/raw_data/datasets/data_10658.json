    "content": "When I change the wallpaper for the lock screen, it zooms super far into the image. It did the same thing on my Pixel 3XL and no amount of resizing changes it. The only time it was properly sized was when I transferred my data from my old 3XL to my new 5. Then I went and changed it and now it won't size it properly, even if I switch back to the old wallpaper that worked. in the preview it shows the proper size, but in implementation it doesn't work. \n\nFor reference, here is what it looks like. (sorry for the screen recorder bar, it was the only way I could get a screenshot).\n\nAny suggestions?",
