    "content": "Hello,\n\nI purchased my original Google Pixel XL from Amazon back in June of 2018, it's a certifited refurbished product, 2 days ago while I was using the facebook messenger app and just trying to click elswhere, the phone hanged first and then the screen shut down.\n\nSince then the phone is not restarting. I've tried to hold the power button down for 30 seconds. I also tried to hold the power+ volume button down for another 30 seconds. Still the phone seems to be dead.\nI also tried to charge the phone for a whole night and try again but it still does not work.",
