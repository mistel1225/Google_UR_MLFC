    "content": "I purchased a genuine Pixel 3a screen and fitted it but it has developed a fault some 4 months down the line, with a small area of the screen having touch problems, using the onscreen keyboard certain letters on the right side are activating the two letters either side, although those letters work perfectly. The area is restricted to about 3 lines of the keyboard",
