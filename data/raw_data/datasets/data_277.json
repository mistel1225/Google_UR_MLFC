    "title": "local audiobook files being auto-deleted sporadically",
    "content": "I have a folder where I keep local audiobook files (usually mp3) that I listen to using an audiobook app (I've tried a few different ones all with the same result so it's not the app doing the deleting). There are some books that just disappear every other week or so. Some books never disappear, and others disappear over and over. I know it isn't the app doing it because I have changed apps. I read somewhere that there might be some security setups that remove perceived \"illegal\" files. These are just mp3 files ripped from CDs and there isn't any difference I can tell between the ones getting deleted and the ones not getting deleted. And I don't have any special security or anything setup for work or anything like that. I don't run any sort of clean up apps or optimizing apps or anything like that. I had this exact same issue with my Pixel 2 before I upgraded to the Pixel 5. So it must be an OS thing but I have no clue what it might be or why. Any thoughts? Thanks.",
