    "content": "I have a pixel 4 xl and a 2019 Jetta. When it connects to my car Spotify (my regular music service) connects automatically and plays normally. I sit in my car a lot in parking lots working and sometimes I try to load an IG story or FB story. Or even play a YouTube video. When I do this it will play about 1 second of the audio then go mute. The display screen on my Jetta is still showing Spotify. I have tried closing Spotify, force stopping it, disconnecting my Bluetooth etc. I have also tried this in my Audi Q5 and have the same issue. I did not have this issue with my Galaxy S9+. Basically it doesn't switch audio between apps. Even has issues with SoundCloud and Bandcamp. Not sure what to do but I'm certain it's an issue with my Pixel 4",
