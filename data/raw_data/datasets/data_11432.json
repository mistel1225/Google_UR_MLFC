    "content": "Anyone experiencing issues with their Pixel 4a 5g camera?  I got 2 new ones and they both have the same issue.  Videos and camera is grainy/noise.  It looks like software issue, but not sure.  I contacted Google and they tried some more troubleshooting steps.  Long story short, none worked.  They advised to contact the carrier to see if I can return them or exchange them.  Certainly not the solution I was looking for.  \nThis is extremely disappointing and the 1st time we experience something like that with any of the Pixels we have owned.  \nIf anyone has the same issue please share.  If anyone found a solution or has an idea what is happening....I would appreciate it.\nThank you.",
