    "title": "Notifications stop until charging or switching between WiFi and cell and then come en mass",
    "content": "I often get a whole batch of notifications delivered when putting my phone to charge or if it connects to WiFi or disconnects back to cellular data. These triggers seem to cause the notifications to unfreeze and they all get delivered at once. Frustrating as it means they are often delayed by many minutes.  \n\nI have tried adjusting battery optimisation settings both in general and also on specific apps - no change. Have also factory reset but this did not fix. \n\nIt is not specific to a particular app, seems to affect all.  I am not out of data service when they are paused.  Wondering if it is something to do with sleep settings.\n\nAny ideas? It is driving me nuts as I keep missing stuff.",
