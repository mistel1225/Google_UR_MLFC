    "content": "Hi! I recently purchased a refurbished Google Pixel 2 and while I've been able to get my headphones to play through the USB c - aux connector I bought alongside the phone, when I connect to an aux cable there's no sound (I've tried both in my car and on a speaker). I've tried a few different brands of USB C - aux connectors and aux cables to no avail. Does anyone have any advice about this issue? I appreciate it! Thanks :)",
