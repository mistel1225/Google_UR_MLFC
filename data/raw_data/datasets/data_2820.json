    "content": "I am using a wired headphone with volume controls that worked fine on an older Android Device. On the Pixel 4a, volume up and pause/play don't work (in all the apps I have tried). They don't do anything. One of the buttons was configured to activate the Google Assistant, I deactivated it (also deactivated google support for the wired headphone device).\n\nThere was a similar question here: https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/97173531?hl=en\nand a simliar comment here:\nhttps://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/85636703?hl=en&msgid=91776002",
