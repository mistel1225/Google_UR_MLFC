    "title": "Google Pixel 5 not delivering texts in a timely fashion",
    "content": "I got the Pixel 5 several days ago and beyond working out the differences between it and my Galaxy S9 things are working fine with the exception of text.\n\nI am receiving texts many hours after they were sent.  At 3:17pm I received texts from my daughter that had been sent at 7:55 the previous evening.  While I know that this \"sometimes\" happens, this has been the case with most texts I have received.\n\nTo make sure that the problem was not associated with the app I downloaded Textra and the same thing is happening.\n\nThis is a non-starter for me as my daughter uses text to let me know that she is ready for our Skype sessions with our grandchildren, so I have to either get this fixed or send the phone back.  I have the same carrier so that has not changed.\n\nIs there some setting I do not know about (quite possible, as I do not know much about these things) or anything I can try to get this working?  I really want to keep this phone but if this does not work then it has to go back.\n\nThanks -\n\ngeorge",
