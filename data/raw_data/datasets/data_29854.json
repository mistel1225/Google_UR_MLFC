    "content": "A few days ago phone was working normal. Went to make a phone call in the middle of the day and no sound  and mic wasn't picking up sound either, whom I called heard nothing. I was able to use my apps and everything else normally.  A couple of days ago my phone would crash randomly while listening to Google music. Sometimes after a long while sometimes as I tried to start a song. Or instead of crashing would play no audio or register my headphones. I noticed I needed a security update so I did that. Read up on some trouble shooting that said maybe it was digital well being so I cleared that cache and storage per suggestion. That didn't do anything. Today a few different apps we're crashing so I factory reset.... Now only my chrome is working and everything else crashes...my chrome does too sometimes but works most of the time.... I have done everything I can find suggestions and all of them ended well that's factory reset.... But that didn't help. Anyone know what might help?",
