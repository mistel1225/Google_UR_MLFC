    "content": "I got a Google Pixel 4XL on release day (Oct 2019).  It failed with the 50% battery issue in May of this year and was replaced.  So far, so good.\n\nIt's just failed again - same problem with the battery stuck at 50% and won't charge.  This time Google are telling me my 2 year warranty expired in a year.  They accept this is a problem, since Sunday it has been 'escalated to another team'.\n\nThey seem to be utterly secretive about what is going on.  Does anyone know of any processes or ways of communicating with Google support outside of the chat channel?\n\nOr even how long these sort of incidents last?  I don;t have a spare handset - and no indication of what is going on, should I buy a cheap refurb to see me through, or will they sort this out tomorrow?\n\nAny clues what to do next - the brick wall of secrecy they put up is very draining.",
