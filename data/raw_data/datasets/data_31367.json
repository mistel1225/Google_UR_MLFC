    "content": "Hello!  My google pixel screen reads inputs that are nonexistent.  For example, I'll be typing out a text message, and my phone will suddenly call that person.  Or I'll be typing out a response on facebook, and my notifications screen will suddenly pull down on its own and random apps will open.   Sometimes this happens when I'm reading an article on my phone and when I put a finger down to swipe up or down, a random app will open instead.  This happens when my finger is touching the screen, never when there's nothing touching the screen.  How do I fix this?",
