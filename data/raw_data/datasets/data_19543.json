    "content": "Like others my battery is draining.  When I try to check which apps are using battery I get \"battery usage data isn't available\" .  I've cleared the cache on apps, restarted, have the most recent OS. I would like to at least know what apps are contributing to the extreme drain on the battery. I apologize if this has been posted before but I tried searching and couldn't find the issue.",
