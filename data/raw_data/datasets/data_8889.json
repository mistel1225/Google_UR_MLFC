    "content": "Completed a update OTA today and after taking a photo or video, the very useful pop up box to share via WhatsApp has gone !! Instead, there's Duo, Youtube and Message, so I unticked YouTube and now the pop up box has completely gone.\n\nDoes anyone know how to get it back and include WhatsApp as a sharing option ?\n\nThanks",
