    "content": "Apps such as met office I had previously had on pixel3 with no advertising as I had paid.  Moved device  to pixel 5 and advertising is appearing.  I don't mind paying again if I have to but message says ' please make sure your device is setup with a  Google account and signed into playstore'.  Same with other apps.  I have cleared cache on Google and play store and reinstalled the apps.  ",
