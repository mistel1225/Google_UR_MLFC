    "content": " First time I try to transfer files to my laptop. When I switch to data transfer on my phone, I hear the computer make a sound as if it recognizes new material, but I don't see anything: no window appears. The device manager displays a \"Google Nexus ADB Interface\" on an Android device ... but nothing on File explorer...  Any idea, please?",
