    "content": "Hi,\n\nI have a hiss/white noise in all my audio recordings with the Pixel 5. Makes no difference if its a video with the default camera app, snapchat etc. The same when using the Recorder app.\n\nGoogle assistant \"voice match\" and \"now playing\" are off.\n\nPixel 5 audio example: http://clyp.it/2lddom40\n\nPixel 2XL audio example (same room, same time): http://clyp.it/sz3zgiqm\n\nWhat could be the problem?\n\nThanks",
