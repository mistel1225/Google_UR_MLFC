    "content": "Turned off all calendar notifications on my (this) device, removed notifications from the specific calendars (problem is that I have many shared calendars of other people so I keep seeing all of their events). There are no device notifications but the discovery page and the home screen title (date/time/weather) keeps showing them, regardless of any phone calendar notification setting. I do want all shared calendars to be displayed on my phone, just not the notifications in the home screen title (must have a better name...) nor in the discover page. Ideally I coud control which calendars' notifications do show (mine..) and which don't.",
