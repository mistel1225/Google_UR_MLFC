    "content": "For the last four months, I've noticed a decline in my phone's battery life. Some apps draining it more then others, but recently, my phone gets to 70% life and turns off like clock work. When I boot it back up, it's at 1% life. My phone she be living way longer then that, I at most get 10 minutes of life out of it before it dies. I've done the factory reset twice and tried limiting apps but nothing has changed. I have to carry around a charging back and keeping it plugged it to use it through the day. Is there any options or should I just get a new phone?",
