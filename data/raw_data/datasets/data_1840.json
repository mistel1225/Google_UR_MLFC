    "content": "Rebooted my device got a bogus system update request after reboot. Clearly was not a legit android update. I did some research and could be a very dangerous spyw discovered by zpid , it can surveil and exfjltrate anything. I did not press install i just exited the window. Is there a way to check logs? Did may 5th system update fix this? I need to make sure my device is not compromised. You don't catch this on PlayStore, how the hell i almost got it? Was my device targeted or could just be a website where i got it? Thank s",
