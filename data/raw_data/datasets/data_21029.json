    "content": "Hi Google, \n\nThe bottom speaker stopped working and I cannot find a way to contact your support center or claim for a refund. \n\nWith COVID-19 situation, I'm currently stuck in Russia with no way to make it to North America or Europe in the coming months as the borders are on the lockdown. \n\nCan someone assist me to get a refund for a phone that was purchased on December 19, 2019?\n\nPlease help.",
