    "content": "I have restarted the phone, and uninstalled and reinstalled the Live Case app.   The Google Earth image has not changed for a week and the NFC button shortcut to Google maps does not do anything. The NFC button works normally for other shortcuts. I searched the Google Help website but could find no relevant information. I called tech support but all I got from them was the email address to a support mailbox which replied with a link back to the Google Help website.",
