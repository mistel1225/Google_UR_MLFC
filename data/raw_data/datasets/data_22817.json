    "content": "My phone, completely out of the blue, has starting randomly rebooting and has adopted tons of little glitches. The home button has stopped working, it's reset all my wallpapers, it's not showing any notifications, all my contacts in WhatsApp have had their names wiped and it's just their numbers. I really don't understand. Even when I manually shut the phone down myself it still turns it self on, just to turn itself off again. Anyone had anything similar and know what to do?",
