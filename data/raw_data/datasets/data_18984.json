    "content": "I've had my phone for 2 and 1/2 years. My Google pixel 3 XL is in amazing condition. All of a sudden while playing a game not realizing battery was low the phone died. I turned on my phone after charging and the Google logo open screen kept reappearing. Is this a motherboard issue and is Google responsible for this? Thank you",
