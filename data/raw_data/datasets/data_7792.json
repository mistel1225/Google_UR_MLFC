    "content": "I just switched over from an iPhone, so I am new to Android functionality.  With the iPhone, I would get text alerts through the car speakers and I had the option of the car reading the text to me.  With my Pixel, I get no notification through either the car's bluetooth nor from the phone's speaker itself.\n\nIs there a way for me to be notified of incoming text messages when I am connected to my car's bluetooth?  I do not see any option to enable this in the Pixel's bluetooth settings related to my car's connection.",
