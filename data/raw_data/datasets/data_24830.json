    "content": "When setting up my new Pixel 4 XL, I copied all data over from my previous phone (HTC One M9). Everything seems to have come through except for my call history. I've reset my Pixel 4 XL and gone through the setup process again just to make sure I didn't accidentally untick \"Call History\" from the list, and the same result happened the second time. For some reason it showed that my data came through for call history but when looking at the call history on my Pixel 4 XL it is empty. Is there another way to transfer this data?",
