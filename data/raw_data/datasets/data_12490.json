    "content": "When I click on the YouTube icon, on my phone, I cannot log onto youtube!  It has nothing to do with my phone!  Am I blocked or something???  I know that with this political nonsense, there's a lot of hatred.  Yes, sometimes I respond in kind, IF someone attacks me.  But, like I said, I was able to get on YouTube last night...no problem.  Thank you.",
