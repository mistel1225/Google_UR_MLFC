    "title": "Pixel 3 XL problems (android auto among others) since updating to A10",
    "content": "So, my device updated nicely to A10. Works like a champ. But I've noticed a couple of problems while traveling (I've confirmed both things work fine on my wife's Pixel 3).\n\nAndroid auto just hangs. I got a rental car, plugged it in, and it, and I get a dialog telling me to unlock to continue. When I do I just get a completely white screen. It basically looks like it is hung.\nWhen I tried to use in-flight wifi, I would get the \"captive authentication\" (or whatever it's called) screen to be able to accept terms and conditions, but it also it completely white as if it is crashed.\nThe behavior seems the same, but I kinda doubt they are really related.\nI have tried rebooting the phone with no luck.\n\nAny ideas?",
