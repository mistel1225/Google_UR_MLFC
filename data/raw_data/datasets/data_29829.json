    "title": "Why doens't Microphone work while using a 2n1 charger/audio dongle",
    "content": "If I am using the 2n1 USB charger / audio jack and receive a phone call I have to unplug the dongle or the microphone wont work. I can hear the person on the phone however they cannot hear me. Same if I dial out, try to use google assistant or a voice recording app. If that dongle is plugged in the mic on my phone will not work. Very frustrating. Any help would be great.",
