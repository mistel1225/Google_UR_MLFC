    "content": "So I got my new Phone and set tried to set it up as i wanted. All was good for a day then the Voice recognition stopped working and i tried to set that up again, but it just went into a endless loading screen, i waited for half an hour at a time, and nothing happened.\nSo i thought to myself ok the phone is pretty new i can reset it, no important data on it yet and the apps will be fast to reinstall, So i did.\nBut now i get \"your device is corrupted and cannot be trusted and may not work properly\" message.\nNow i can restart my phone and it lands into a endless boot attempt. Google Logo is showing and the grey bar underneath it just goes forever.\nAfter some research i found out how to do a factory reset, in the recovery mode. So i did that, several times but still no luck. It just goes on forever.\nIm no expert on phones and im at the end of my wits, please help me.",
