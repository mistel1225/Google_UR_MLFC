    "title": "Is there a central guide for speech-to-text voice commands?",
    "content": "I use speech-to-text when sending text messages and emails. I'm coming from iOS, and I don't know what commands to use for formatting and punctuation. Is there an all-in-one guide online somewhere for such a thing?\n\nSpecifically, I'd like to know what to say to:\n\n- capitalize the first letter of a word ( I've tried saying 'cap' and 'capitalize,' but it just writes 'cap' and 'capitalize')\n\n- write a word in all-caps (I've tried saying 'all caps'-- same results as above)\n\n- put quotes around a word or phrase (I've tried saying 'quote', 'quotes', and 'open quote'/'close quote' unsuccessfully)\n\n- write an ellipsis (...) (sometimes it actually will put an ellipsis when I say 'ellipsis', but it's very inconsistent)\n\nThanks in advance for any help and for reading my question!",
