    "title": "Messages app regularly stops working and needs the data store cleared to get working again",
    "content": "The messages application locks up and I am unable to send or receive SMS text messages.  I looked up the community forum and it suggested I should clear the cache and the data store.  This temporarily fixes it, but eventually the problem returns.  A restart of the device clears it temporarily as well.\n\nMy problem relates to Google Pixel 4 and 5.  I had a Pixel 4 previously and the problem started with that, about 10 months into its use.  I upgraded to Pixel 5 recently hoping the problem would be resolved and for a month or so, it was.  Then the problem returned and it is now doing it several times a day.  I have  even uninstalled and reinstalled the app and again it solves it very temporarily.  I have installed all the latest patches.\n\nI believe the problem may be related to the fact that I have years worth of text messages being automatically saved on the internet and clearing the Data does not remove the stored data as the Pixel automatically re-downloads all the messages.  It may be something in those years of stored messages which is causing it to keep re-occurring.  \n\nI am wondering why I seem to be the only one with this problem and why the software is so poor in handling my messages.  Maybe i need to just buy an i-phone.",
