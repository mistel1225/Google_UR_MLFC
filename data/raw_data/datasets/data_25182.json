    "content": "Before updating to Android 10 my Pixel 3a got around 18-20 hours of battery life. After the update, it dropped to 15-14 hours with the same level of usage which is disappointing. No, apps are not using more power than expected (according to battery usage) and no, I have not factory reset my phone. Wiping my phone would be the last option.",
