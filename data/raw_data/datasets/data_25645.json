    "title": "Pixel 3a - can't add torch widget to homepage?",
    "content": "Why can I not add a one-click shortcut to flashlight/torch on my homepage? It's not in the widget or apps like. I understand I can swipe the menu open or do a hand gesture to get the integrated flashlight/torch working, but I do not want either.\n\nAlso why can't I do the same with the settings shortcut? Specifically it only lets me add a settings shortcut for a single setting (WIFI only, Battery only, etc) rather than the main menu.\n\nWhy are the most basic things leap-frogged in this operating system??? I'm at the point where I want to create an app that's just a glorified shortcut for these.",
