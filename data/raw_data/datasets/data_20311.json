    "content": "Whenever I make a phone call the person on the receiving end cannot hear me. My google pixel is just a few weeks old.\nI have reported this issue few days ago and have done troubleshooting, resetting the phone,etc.  As adviced by you\nBut the problem still persists. You have mentioned that your service centers are not working fully due to covid crisis.\nBut in these hard times, especially when all work is done from home, I really need a phone that I could rely on. \nI humbly request you to either refund me the phone's amount or replace this with a new phone that works perfectly fine from all aspects\nThank you for your consideration",
