    "content": "I've recently encountered a strange problem with my Pixel 3a where the screen becomes discolored, but only when I touch certain parts of the screen. Any contact in the top 1/3 of the screen causes the screen the appear washed out and yellowish. Sometimes the washed out appearance goes away after stopping contact, but other times it hangs around for awhile. Since this is a bit difficult to describe I've also taken a video of what the discoloration look like (https://youtu.be/Zj3kb66Af-U). Anyone else ever seen this problem?\n\nI've turned off night light, tried booting into safe mode (video above is in safe mode) and a full hardware reset.\n\nAny thoughts? Warranty replacement?",
