    "title": "No service following android 11 update. Pixel 3a. Customer service refusing to help.",
    "content": "I did all the usual efforts to try and fix. Reboot, factory reset, clear caches and reset network items. Right after it finished updating it told me no SIM card inserted and no ringtones would play from the bottom speaker. I have tried multiple other SIM cards with no effect. All these SIM cards work in other phones. Customer service is entirely unhelpful and refuse to acknowledge the issue. They claim it’s not a known issue despite threads existing going back to April when the updates first started filling out. It seems each major update destroys a number of pixel phones. This is an obvious bug and I’ve now been without a phone for  about a week due to google refusing to acknowledge the issue. The only offer so far has been to send it in, pay for repair and wait 10 business days where they “might” fix it. Or take it to ubreakifix and pay to have it fixed despite the update breaking the phone. Rant over. \n\nDoes anyone have any idea what can be done to make the phone work again? Super disappointed in Google refusal to stand behind their product or offer a real solution.",
