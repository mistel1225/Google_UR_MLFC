    "content": "Hi. Here in Kuwait All Carriers support all services like VoLTE, eSIM, 5G ... etc The question is: Why is Apple interested in the Middle East and its support iPhone for call services and you are NOT!! I know that you one of the first companies supporting these services and you support Pixel phones with all technologies, But do not do it in most countries!! Purchase a phone worth $ 1000 services limited to a little of countries. This is a disappointed. I am big fan. 10 years i have use your phone since Nexus One\n\nSo Please just push update to support VoLTE, eSIM, Motion Sense",
