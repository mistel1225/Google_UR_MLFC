    "content": "The camera app on my Pixel 2 is constantly crashing, it boots up, shows a black screen for about 3 seconds, then crashes. I've tried the usual troubleshooting options offered and still nothing. Same crash happens when trying to use the camera with WhatsApp, instagram, Facebook. I downloaded a third party camera app and still the same issue. The phone is out of warranty, but from reading other posts this seems to be a software problem specific to Pixel 2, any help is appreciated.",
