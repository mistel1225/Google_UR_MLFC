    "content": "Since there are so many people who have severe problems caused by premature updates, a simple method of rolling back OS versions should be made available.  In researching my problem I've been made aware that there are several other people who's phones have been made almost entirely unusable by recent updates.  Mostly it seems that Google is trying to pretend that people's hardware aged several years overnight and that's why they get 50% of the battery life that they enjoyed last week.  Since that's obviously not the case, why not make it a built in option to download and install the OTA image from the previous 3 or so builds?  That way when serious problems occur users can easily make their devices usable again while the problems get sorted out.\n\nI feel like right now since no such roll back method is readily available (and people would hate to admit that they broke something when trying to implement an upgrade) support mostly denies that the problem exists.",
