    "title": "Pixel3 Back button / Home button unresponsive, unable to press buttons no input at bottom of screen",
    "content": "All of the sudden my home button started acting flaky.  I was unable to press it or the back button in any app.  It is definitely intermittent but becoming more prevalent.  I have removed case and clean screen and done a factory reset and the issue still remains.  I have enabled developer options to show finger touch input and path tracking and it shows that my fingers touch is not being read anywhere inside the home/back button bar.",
