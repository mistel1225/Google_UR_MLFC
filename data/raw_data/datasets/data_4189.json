    "content": "One month after its warranty was up, the sensors on my pixel 4xl decided to turn my phone off whenever I put it in my pocket, rendering it useless as a cell phone. Before this, on month 10-11 the battery wouldnt charge past 50% on random days. Thought I would be getting a quality product. Using my old Samsung S8+ and will be buying an iphone next.",
