    "content": "I recently been having issues with my phone's audio along with my top volume button not working and my closing button not working whatsoever. I realize I am still under warranty and can get my phone repaired. Google then referred a company that can fix my phone by the name of UbreakIFix. I called the company and they claim that they need a reference # for my phone in order to repair it. Unfortunately, the IMEI # and serial # are not enough for them to repair the phone. \n\nMy question is, how can I receive my Reference number in order to get my phone fixed? \n\nThank you",
