    "title": "Google photos app freezes when saving edited pictures on Pixel 3",
    "content": "The app freezes when I try to save photos that I've edited. I'm able to edit the photos but after I click save, the screen goes black and there is a spinning wheel. The only solution is to swipe up and force close the app. It does not save the edits. I have restarted my phone, cleared the cache, emptied the trash. I have the app set so that photos that have been backed up are automatically deleted from the device after 60 days. But the photo app continues to freeze. Please help!!! ",
