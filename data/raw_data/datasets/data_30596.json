    "content": "I have been using the Google USB-C Earbuds for a while now, but recently they, and my other USB-C earbuds have stopped working. I cleaned out my USB-C port, but it didn't solve the issue. The earbuds show up in the connection settings with \"Charging connected device\".\n\nThe weirdest thing is that the volume and media buttons all function normally. I have tried booting into safe mode, but it had the same effect. I am running Android Q beta 3 on my Pixel 2.",
