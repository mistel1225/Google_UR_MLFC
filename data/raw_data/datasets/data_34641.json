    "content": "Anyone have any solutions for the Pixel boot loop issue? I can't boot into recovery mode or safe mode. And adb does not recognize my device. I can access the bootloader, but recovery mode fails as well. Once I was able to get to the android on his back with a red warning sign and the text \"no command\" underneath. But all the other times it reboots before getting to that screen. When I had the screen up I tried to access it by adb devices, but was unable too. It rebooted automatically in under a minute.\n\nAny help is appreciated. Thank you.",
