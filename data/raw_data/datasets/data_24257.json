    "content": "Hi guys. I'm having the exact same problem with my Pixel 4 XL, on the latest January update followed by a factory reset, as this guy https://www.google.com/amp/s/forums.androidcentral.com/google-pixel-3-pixel-3-xl/932314-double-tap-wake-stops-working.html%3famp. I have it set not to bypass the lock screen and it happens once every day to every other day. It happens when the phone has been placed down for some time and it has gone to deep sleep. What happens is I tap on the screen over and over and nothing happens. It always works when I pull it out of my pocket. When it fails to work, I cover the proximity sensor with my hand, uncover it and it goes back to working again. I contacted Google support and they want me to go through a warranty replacement process. The rep is telling me it's possibly an issue with the proximity sensor. Seems to me it's a software bug as I checked the proximity sensor with one of those sensor test apps and everything seems to be fine. What do you guys think? Would you recommend exchanging the device if everything else is perfect? Do you think it's a hardware issue or a software bug? The guy in the post I linked exchanged his and the replacement device is doing the same thing. I would really appreciate the advice!",
