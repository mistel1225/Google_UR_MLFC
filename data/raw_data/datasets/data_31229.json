    "content": "I'll preface this post by saying my phone is in excellent condition. No water damage. Been in a case since day 1. Pristine. \n\nToday at work- I noticed it rebooted by itself. Didn't think anything of it. Went to pick it up a few minutes later and nothing. Black screen. \n\nSo I followed the steps here to see if my screen died - https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/7167687?hl=en\n\nThe problem is, I had my phone on DO NOT DISTURB while at work. So I wouldn't hear it ring even if the screen was died. \n\nI dont think the phone is completely dead. When I plug in my charger with the USB into my PC, I can hear that windows recognizes it. \n\nAre there any other ways to verify screen issues? Is there a way to factory reset without going through the prompts? Or should I just bring it to Ubreakifix and let them diagnose? \n\nThanks\n-Steve",
