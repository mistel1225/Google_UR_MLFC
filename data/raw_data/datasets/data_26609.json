    "title": "Extreme disappointment on Pixel 3 phone, Google Case, and Customer Service",
    "content": "As Google Store doesn't provide any way to provide public reviews, I will write my disappointment here as suggested by Customer Service.\n\nWith less than a month usage of the Pixel 3 phone inside the official Google Case, the screen cracked in one corner. I used my original Pixel phone for over 2 years and never had an issue. Under the same usage, of course occasionally dropping it from a couple of feet, everything was fine. With the same usage a the original Pixel, in less than a month the screen of the Pixel 3 is cracked. I have to express my utmost disappointment in the product. In no way, I can see this is normal for such a high-cost device.\n\nThe new Google Case made of fabric is also the most disappointing case ever. It provides no grip what so ever and slip so easily from my hand. And no I didn't crack the screen because of the slippiness of the case. In fact, it's virtually impossible to hold the phone with a single hand given how easy it wants to leave it. I fear losing my phone as I'm trying to take a picture while travelling.\n\nFinally, the customer service was extremely unhelpful in resolving this issue. This is a clear defect of high-cost piece of technology and can't believe a claim is required for this.\n\nNeitherless to say, I hope this will help someone make an educated choice of choosing a better Android phone. I'm sad to say that my faith and trust in Google device had a sour end with a streak of poor experience on all three front.",
