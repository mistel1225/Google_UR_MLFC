    "content": "I received the July 2020 Security Update and after restarting the phone, these gestures stopped working,\n- Double tap to check phone\n- Lift to check phone \n- Flip to shh\n\nAdditionally, the magnetometer seem to have stopped working, testing all the above sensors, gyro, accelerometer and proximity sensors are working fine except for the magnetometer, screenshot attached.\n\nI used to have this problem but it was fixed after the February 2020 update, is there any way to fixthis or maybe Downgrade to the previous security update?",
