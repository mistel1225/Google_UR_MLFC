    "content": "Let us change the order of the 3 buttons\nget rid of \"swipe right snapshot\" (or let us disable it)\nget rid of Google Assistant (or let us disable it)\nStop \"suggesting\" apps for the main app toolbar.\n\nvery simple.\nIts not like we did not \"pay dearly\" for this phone and our service plan.\n\"swipe right snapshot\" and  Google Assistant are basically BLOATWARE\nI do not want them on my phone\nThey suck up data. \nNothing should happen when I swipe right, or, let me choose what happens (like activate camera or some other app)\n\nThe order of the 3 buttons is a problem.\nI am right handed. I use the BACK button far more than the \"active apps\" button.\nLet us decide what we want the order of the 3 buttons to do, the same way the top menu works.\nIts also very simple: let us drag and drop the order of the buttons.\n\nStop \"suggesting\" apps for the main app toolbar.\nI only want 3 apps there, not 5\nI spent almost an hour today tapping \"do not suggest this app\" over and over. Still stuck with 5 apps there I do not want.",
