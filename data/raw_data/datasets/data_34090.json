    "content": "I've sent my phone to a Google repair center, SBE\n\nI had a damaged screen and asked them to replace the screen. Now all the sudden they are saying they need to replace the lower board because the charging port was faulty? I used the phone for a month with a broken screen, the port was working as intended.\n\nThis is their answer when I question them on why the lower board has to be replaced:\n\n\"Thank you for your email. According to the notes the USB charging port was found faulty as well and this port is part of the lower board we needed to quote for this component as well.\"\n\nI am asking that they only replace the screen, but they will not do that. Should I just get my phone back? What if the charging port is faulty when I get the phone back?",
