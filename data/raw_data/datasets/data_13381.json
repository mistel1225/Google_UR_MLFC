    "content": "I have a Pixel 2 which is over 3 years old, so took the plunge and bought the new 5. I've been putting off setting it up but finally got stuck in yesterday.  Seemed so straightforward - just connect my Pixel 2 to my Pixel 5 and hey presto.  Except now, every app I go into on my Pixel 5 is asking for registration/user details and passwords etc.  Some of these have been on there for a while so no way of remembering unfortunately.  I expected this with my banking apps, but not every other one.  Did I do something wrong? Is it worth doing a factory re-set on my 5 and starting again? I knew there was a reason I was putting it off .........................  Thanks.",
