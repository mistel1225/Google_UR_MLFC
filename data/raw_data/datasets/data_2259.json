    "content": "Google assistant is interfering with all of my phone calls.  It blocks numbers that are legitimate. \n\nIt's not giving me the opportunity to decide when a number is legit or not.\n\nWhen screening calls the number doesn't stay up on the screen long enough for me to answer when I am waiting for a call. \n\nI want to be able to adjust Google assistant settings to level I want to control.  I'm unemployed. I don't want to miss any call or have an employer be screened by Google assistant.",
