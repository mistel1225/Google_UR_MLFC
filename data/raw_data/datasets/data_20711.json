    "content": " I have purchased a Pixel 2 Phone on Google store  when I was living in Miami but moved to Brazil few months later, this week my screen accidentally broked and turned black.  I need an assistant to repair it but the country  that I am living in does not have one.   This is my third Google phone.  I wish to keep using Google phone because  Is the best phone I've been using  so far and I advertise it to everybody.   The only issue I am facing now is to find any support assistance from Google here. Could  I send my phone by post office for US to get it repaired?  I already try to call but nobody have answered me. The chat is not working and I cant not find any e-mail adress. \nMy device is a Pixel 2 (64 GB, Just Black)\n\nPlease, help me out.\n\n\nNatan",
