    "title": "What replacement battery (model, etc.) should I get for my bulging battery in my mint Pixel 3 phone?",
    "content": "My 21-month old Pixel 3 is in mint condition.  Inexplicably, its battery (perhaps from overheating) appears to be swollen, applying pressure on the \"glued-on\" rear panel, such that this rear panel is separating from the phone body--exposing the phone's inner circuitry.  I'm looking for a replacement battery, which perhaps is an improved version of the original.\n\nI'd appreciate helpful recommendations as to specific battery replacement particulars (model #, id, etc.) for my Pixel 3 phone.  Thanks.",
