    "content": "Did not update or install any apps recently. Phone did not overheat. Battery in very good condition, swelling out of question. Wired charging works as expected. Tried restarting phone. Tried pressing the center of screen while on Pixel Stand and it looked like charging for a little while, but then stopped. Disabled Pixel Stand app did not help.",
