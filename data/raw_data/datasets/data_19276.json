    "content": "When opening the camera app i can hear the phone making a clicking noise. This clicking causes photo's to be blurry and video recordings as well. Moving the phone to my ear and shaking it a little clearly makes a noise like something i moving inside\n\nfun fact: when i close the camera app the noise is gone, even when shaking the phone.",
