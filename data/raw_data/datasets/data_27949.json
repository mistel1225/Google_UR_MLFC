    "content": "My work requires me to sign into the wi-fi, but whenever I tap on \"Tap here to sign in to network,\" the sign-in page won't load. A couple of months ago someone at work mentioned that they fixed the issue by opening the sign-in page in Chrome. How do I make sign-in pages open in Chrome and not the other native wifi browser (not sure what it's called)?",
