    "title": "Android 11 on Pixel - Notification settings for Gmail chats not allowing \"priority\" or \"bubble\"",
    "content": "My wife and I have the exact same model (Pixel 4a 5G), same Andriod version and same Gmail app version. However, for some reason she has different notification settings for her Gmail app.\nShe is able to use Conversation and Bubble features for our Google Chat notifications (Chat notifications through Gmail, we use G Workspace) both in Settings app and Gmail app settings. On the other hand, when I go to the same settings for Gmail, I have a message saying \"Gmail doesn't support most conversation features. You can't set a conversation as priority, and conversations won't appear as floating bubbles\".\nI add get that message if it were consistent across our devices, but it is not.\n\nIs there some settings somewhere that would allow Gmail Chats to make use of the Notification, Conversation, Bubble features no Android 11?",
