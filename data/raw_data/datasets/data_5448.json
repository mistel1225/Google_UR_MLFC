    "content": "Very Strange thing happen to my phone. I do not block any number, the list is empty. While everybody / anybody can call me, only my wife cannot call to me. I took out my SIM card and fit in Samsung S7 edge, she can call my number without any problem. I put my daughter's SIM in my Pixel 4a phone, then also there is no problem to make call to my phone from my wife's phone.  I have done Factory-Reset but the same problem. Please Help!",
