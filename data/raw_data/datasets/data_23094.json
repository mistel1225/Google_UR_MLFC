    "content": "Hi,\n\nI'm facing an interesting issue: Google support refuses to assist me, unless I provide answers to below questions:\n\n1. Where I bought the phone?\n2. Email address of original owner.\n\nIs this normal? Is my phone stolen? Is there some obscure contractual language that doesn't carry warranty over if the phone is sold privately? Is the phone still registered to original owner in some back office system? \n\nSome extra details:\nI purchased an unlocked Pixel 3 via OfferUp with 2 months left on the warranty. Factory reset it again just in case, and went on my marry way. Fast forward to a few weeks ago - some time after Jan update, my phones' battery decreased to 25 minutes total. I've emailed google support regarding a battery issuea, and above gymnastics started.\n\nps: of course I asked seller for his email, but it's radio silence.",
