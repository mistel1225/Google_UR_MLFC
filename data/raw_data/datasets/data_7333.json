    "title": "How to fix a delay of several seconds between when speaking and when heard?",
    "content": "When making phone calls, I frequently have a delay of several seconds after speaking before the person on the other line can hear me.  I can also hear a slight echo of what I said when it finally is delivered to the recipient.  I have tried turning the speaker on and off and muting and unmuting myself, but neither has had any effect.  The problem does not happen during every phone call, and I haven't been able to figure out what triggers it, but it only seems to happen when I'm calling businesses.  (Maybe it has to do with landlines?)  I even had a phone call that was perfectly normal until the call was transferred to a new person in a different company than the initial call was made to.",
