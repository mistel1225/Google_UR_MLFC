    "title": "4 XL Camera Not Working - Google Support Very Slow",
    "content": "My Pixel 4 XL camera stopped working suddenly 11 days ago. I was using it one minute then tried again and the camera app would no longer open (same for the torch).\n\nI went through all the factory reset/safe mode stuff with Google Support but it did not help.\n\n11 days later I still have the case open with Google Support, but not been given any further advice or a RMA. I just keep getting told it has been escalated to a \"dedicated team\".\n\nWhat can be done to speed things up here?",
