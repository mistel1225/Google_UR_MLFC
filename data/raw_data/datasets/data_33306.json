    "content": "My Pixel 2 seems to have an issue regarding security updates. Every month now since September last year it takes ages to actually download and apply the update. In the previous updates, it's taken another 5-6 days from the release of the update to allow me to install it. This months update finally went through last night, but only via 4G data! I spoke to Google support yesterday about this they think I should think about sending it in for repair. Apart from this problem the phone works 100%, no other issues. Anyone else had this problem on their Pixel 2 128GB, sim free??",
