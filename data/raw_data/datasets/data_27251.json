    "title": "Voicemail icon persists even when cleared",
    "content": "On U.S. Verizon network: as of last week the new voicemail icon appears even if I have zero new voicemails. To clear it, I have to check my v.m.,  then open the Phone App and clear the storage manually, but the icon  reappears again and I have to go through the process all over a few times a day. ( not using Visual Voicemail, just regular) Could this be related to any security updates or because I went to Europe in January and that changed something? How best to report this issue?",
