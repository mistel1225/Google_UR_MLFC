    "content": "Dear team, \n\nThis is regarding an issue I have faced with pixel 2 xl phone from past one year..\n\nI'm facing intermittent charging issue from starting of the phone.. i gave mobile for repair in nov2018 and then it got resolved... After the 4 months it started again ... Recently before a month .. i lost all the data on phone for a software update .. \n\nThen recently I gave my phone for repair with ticket number GL00079764 for same charging issue .. they kept my phone for 15 days and returned the phone today .. and unfortunately the issue is not resolved now too..\n\n\nThis is so frustrating and I lost all my patience .. tried talking with customer support team .. for around 60 times in this month .. but no proper resolution yet.. for third time gave the phone on Sep3.. issue resolved \n\nNow again after a month .. same issue is coming ... What is this ... This is the 4th time in an year .. raised a new service ticket GL0077888.. they took my phone again ..\n\nSo bad of Google .. please take my phone back and replace it with a new one .. same issue 4th time in an year\n\n\nFinally decided ..\n\nGoogle cheated me like hell. Thanks:)",
