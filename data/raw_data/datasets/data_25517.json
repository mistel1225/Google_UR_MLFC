    "content": "Please create a setting in Android to disable NFC sounds for specific NFC tags. Bazillion hits when you search for disabling NFC sounds. Sometimes it's a credit card, a passport, or in my case a medical device.\n\nYes I've read how there are security implications... So notify us most of the time, but give us the option to disable the silly sound on a per tag basis. Otherwise it's just annoying and we ignore it all the time. #securityFail",
