    "content": "I have a wireless charger that I use to recharge my phone. It always shows \"rapid charging\" when my phone is on the stand. The other day, I noticed I no longer see \"rapid charging\". I now see a time to full charge there instead. Right now, on the stand, it shows 98% -8 min until charged.\n\nIf I plug my phone directly into the factory charger with the factory cable, it shows the same info.\n\nHow do I fix this so it shows rapid charging again?",
