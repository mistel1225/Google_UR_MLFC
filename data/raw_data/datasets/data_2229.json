    "content": "The back case of my phone is bowing out. This eliminates the water resistance of my phone and I'm worried that it will now fail completely. This Pixel 3 xl is 2 years old almost to the day. Cost me $1000 from Amazon.ca Any suggestions or do I now need to go through the stress of getting a new phone? Since buying the phone I now live in Mexico.",
