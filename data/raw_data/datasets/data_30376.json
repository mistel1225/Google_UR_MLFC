    "content": "Hi, is it possible to change the down-swipe quick tools area to include the brightness slider?\nJust with one swipe instead of two?  It would be ideal to have that slider on the bottom of the tools;\nbeing able to access it and put it away with just one swipe.  I use that tool the most; I bet most people\nprobably do.  (The two swipe method works only half the time, and the auto-brightness is never accurate).\nOr even better, since left-to-right swipe has no function, just put the brightness slider there; tucked away on the left side of the screen instead of the top.",
