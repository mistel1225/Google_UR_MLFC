    "content": "Curious if this is a common issue?  I have a 3 day old Pixel 3 XL and just tried using the front facing camera for the first time and it was flickering a bunch of random colored stripes on the screen, and now it just doesn't work at all, the camera app crashes when you try and switch to the front facing camera.  I've already ordered a new phone for delivery tomorrow and put in a return request for this one.  I am trying to gauge if this is an isolated incident or if theirs a known hardware problem with the front facing cameras on these devices.  Thanks.",
