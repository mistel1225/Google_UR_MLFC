    "content": "Pixel 4a Display touchscreen not working properly. It is unresponsive to touch in some horizontal patches/bands in upper portion of the screen. Was fine when bought (Jan-2021), but some touch-dead-zones are there now. Cannot figure out whether this is a hardware issue or software issue. Refer screenshot, those blue lines are vertical swipes across the length of the screen, but they don't get registered fully in the upper areas (blank spaces). Please help to resolve.",
