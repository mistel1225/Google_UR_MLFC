    "title": "Updates Needed to Pixel 3 XL!",
    "content": "I have several problems with the Google Pixel 3 XL: 1) Out of nowhere it will seemingly stop connecting to WiFi or a tower and I have to restart it to get it to re-connect! That happens several times per week and sometimes, several times in a day!  It is a nuisance!  And, it also happened on my Pixel 2 XL and was supposed to be resolved by the 3 XL!  2) Why can't I choose to send a picture through individual messages for a group, rather than being required to send it in a group with everyone?  Otherwise, I have to send it one person by one person! 3) Moreover, why isn't there a feature to allow me to choose which way I want to send (individual messages with individual replies vs. group message with group reply) each message as I create it, as opposed to having to go back to settings each time? My smart phones from a decade ago had that ability!  4) Why is it so complicated to simply use my own music as my ringtone?  I should be able to see downloaded songs in my options for my ringtone on my phone!  Ideally, it would appear in the \"My Sounds\" box!  5) Why isn't there a ringtones store connected to the ringtones area?  Love everything else about my Pixel 3 XL, but these things are seriously a disappoinment and aggravating!",
