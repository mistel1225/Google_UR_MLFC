    "content": "I found that in pixel devices, we can't disable quick settings toggles in lock screen and the lack of this simple feature put our phones in danger! As you know \"find my phone\" relies on GPS and internet connections but because of easy access to quick settings toggles in the lock screen, thieves can disable GPS and wifi or data connections easily, Google must listen to us and do something! it is a serious security issue!",
