    "content": "For a long time now routines haven't worked properly. \n\n1. E.g. Good morning routine ends with \"for that you'll have to unlock your device\" and after unlocking i just get \"sorry i didn't understand\". And this despite it's really done everything already. \n\n2. Trying to make a routine that turns a smart plug on, gives me information on this and that and after that plays the radio on my chromecast, it just gets stuck to trying to send the command to play the radio, but nothing happens. If i send the command using my voice, there's no problem. \n\n3. This appears with voice commands. Very often the assistant just gets stuck in \"please wait\" and just gives up after a while. Then if i don't wait and say it again, it won't bring the assistant view on the display, but still does the command in the background. \n\nIt just generally works very poorly. It seems there have been times when it has worked, then an update breaks it for half a year, then something gets updated and perhaps a part of it functions again or for a while and then it's broken again. Very unreliable, unsatisfying and often unusable. Is there really any fix or is the whole system just so poorly designed that it will never work properly?",
