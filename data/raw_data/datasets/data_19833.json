    "content": "I complete the voice setup on Pixel 4 Assistant but the software never totally completes.  I get the \"Sounds Great\" screen with the big blue check mark, but when I try to use voice commands, it wants me to do the setup again.  Software = Android 10.  What do I need to do to get out of this loop?",
