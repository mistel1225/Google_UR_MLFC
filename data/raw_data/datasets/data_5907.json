    "content": "Is anyone having issues with Contactless Payments on a Pixel 5?\n\nI set up my new Pixel last week and when I attempt to make a payment I get a message saying \"That didn't work, Hold phone to terminal until you see a tick\".\n\nBefore anyone suggests that I hold the phone differently please note - I have been using contactless payments for several years, on multiple phones (OG Pixel, Pixel 2XL), and know how to hold a phone to get a read. \n\nAlso please note the following troubleshooting steps have already been tried. \nMultiple read attempts with phone in different position and orientation (approx 20 attempts so far)\n3 different cards from 2 x Banks (1 Credit card, 2 x Debit, Mixture of both VISA and Mastercard) \n5+ different merchants each with a different brand of reader and payment service provider\nDeleted and readded cards\nUninstalled and reinstalled Google Pay app\nCalled both banks to check their logs - no payments have been declined on any of my cards and I can pay fine with the physical cards. The logs don't show the payment attempts at all from the virtual cards. \n\nI have logged the issue with Google support and provided a Screen Recording of what happens and information on the messages appearing on the merchant teminals.  Have not had a response since Saturday from Google. \n\nWould love everyone's feedback on whether this is a wide spread issue or a specific problem with my new phone?\n\nAny suggestions, other than Factory Reset, would also be appreciated.",
