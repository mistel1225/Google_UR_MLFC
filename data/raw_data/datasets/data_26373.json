    "content": "I installed version 7.2.016.279154257 of the Camera app yesterday. I opened it and I'll be blowed if I know how to close it again! There's no lozenge at the bottom.\nI found that I have to take a pic and tap on the round image next to the shutter button. This opens the image and the bottom lozenge appears. I can then shut it down.\nThis is just a bit fiddly.",
