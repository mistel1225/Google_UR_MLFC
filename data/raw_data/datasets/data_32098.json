    "content": "I can't receive Google Voice calls b/c when I dial 1, nothing happens. \n\nClearing the cache in the app solves the problem temporarily, but very temporarily. I miss a LOT of phone calls because of this.\n\nI've uninstalled, reinstalled, restarted, cleared storage, etc. I'm not looking for that kind of solution because like I said, that fixes the problem for maybe 30 minutes.",
