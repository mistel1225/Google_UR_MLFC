    "content": "The phone randomly goes in to a non stop vibrating alert. Notification history is not picking up anything. Occasionally, if I close all the tabs in Chrome, the alerts stops. This is a paranoid if the phone goes into the non stop alert mode when in the middle of a call. Imagine non stop vibrating alerts at your ear. On another occasion, this alert/refresh prevented me from keying in my password to a webpage i was trying to login, as the tabs field kept getting cleared.",
