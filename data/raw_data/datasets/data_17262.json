    "content": "I've been using an iPhone for eons along with MacBook Pro's and iMessage across all the devices. \n\nAt the beginning of the week I migrated from an iPhone 8 Plus to Pixel 4a which went surprisingly well (all of my data transferred without issue during setup). \n\nI disabled iMessage as recommended before switching to the Pixel. Now, what I'm trying to sort out is how I can SMS messages to interoperate between macOS systems and the new phone. I found Android Messages Desktop which does an ok job however, retrieving message history is very slow.\n\nAny suggestions for how else to have SMS messages appear on both macOS (Catalina and Mojave) and Google Pixel 4a phone?",
