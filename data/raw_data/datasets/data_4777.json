    "content": "Restarting 3 different times. Uninstalling and reinstalling apps. When I do that it work once and let's me open the app and then when I close and go to open again, it crashes and disappears. Google search bar won't work. Gmail doesn't work. What is the point of all the Google features ona Google phone if they don't work? I have deliberately put off updating my phone. Yet it was forced on me anyway.",
