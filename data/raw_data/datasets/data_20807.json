    "content": "After doing a bit of googling I still can't figure out how to enable VoLTE or WiFi calling on my Pixel 3a (G020G, unlocked). Both are supported by my carrier (Freedom Mobile) for my device. When I type *#*#4636#*#* and select \"Phone Information,\" the VoLTE provisioned and WiFi Calling provisioned flags are greyed out and I can't select them. VoLTE and WiFi calling don't show up in network settings. \n\nI noticed a few people have asked this question before, but it still has not been answered and the threads are locked. Has anyone found a fix for this issue yet?",
