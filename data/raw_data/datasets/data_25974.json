    "content": "Dears,\nI've bought Pixel 3 XL from the US.\nI currently live in Kuwait and I can't use the VoLTE feature.\nWhen I contacted the carrier companies they said that the problem is from Google side and everything is fine from the companies side.\nAnd even said the Google doesn't support the companies in our area.\nIt's frustrating seeing other mobile brands such as Huawei, Samsung,Apple.. Etc \nAll using this feature while we can't use it.\nAny suggestions or help is appreciated.",
