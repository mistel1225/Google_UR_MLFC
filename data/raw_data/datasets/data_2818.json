    "content": "When I take a Screenshot by pressing together Power and Volume down buttons. It does take screenshot and show it in the quick preview down below, but at the same time I see the Volume bar pop's out from the right and automatically volume indicator slide down from Volume High to Mute.\n\nAnd that Volume bar just Stay there on screen, even thought if I touch any where on the screen it goes back and come back within a second.\n\nIf try to silde volume bar to up as High volume it comes back automatically to the mute. \n\nIt is frustrating when I try to share that screeshot from a quick preview to email or other source and that Volume bar doesn't go back and it bothers and it's blocks the views on some keys on keyboard when I type on keyboard or slide through the screen. \n\nThe only way I can get rid of that Volume bar by pressing the lock button to lock the screen and unlock it.\n\nPlease let me know what could be the issue here.",
