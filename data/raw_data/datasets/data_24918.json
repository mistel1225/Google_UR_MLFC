    "content": "I reset my network settings, hard reset the Pixel 3 XL, changed all settings on my modem (5G, 2.4GH, etc)\nBoth phones keep telling me \"connected to wifi, no internet\" on all wifi networks I've connected to. The only exception was hot_spotting to a phone and accessing 5G that way - clearly not a solution, however.",
