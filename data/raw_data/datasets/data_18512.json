    "content": "My phone will randomly crash after a few hours of use and often times have small graphical glitches like small little glitchy lines. The worse crashes are in the middle of a youtube video where it'll just crash and leave a very very very loud high pitch beep playing before restarting. It acts mostly normal and benchmarks show that it's performance is great so I don't know what exactly is wrong with it and if it's just an android 10 issue",
