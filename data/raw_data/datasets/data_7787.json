    "content": "Hello!\n\nSince updating my Pixel 4 to Android 11 I'm experiencing a few issues:\n\n1. My phone won't connect to mobile data\n2. My Bluetooth disconnects\n3. The lower part of my screen isn't working\n4. I don't receive any notifications at all, not even calls\n\nHelp!\n\nIf I need to factory reset, what's the best way to prepare for this? Will it wipe my phone? Do I need to back everything up? \n\nThanks",
