    "content": "The google repair center received my damaged Pixel 2 (under warranty) 6 weeks ago and I still haven't received a replacement phone. The representative from the department that is working my case has reached out to me once in the past month. Is there anything that can be done to speed up their slow process of sending a replacement phone? I have called customer service multiple times and there only function is to \"assure me that someone is working on my case\".",
