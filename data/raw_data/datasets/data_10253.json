    "content": "So, I was playing a game on my pixel 4 and boom, the phone was off (I am guessing due to heat as I could feel the phone extremely hot) and I let it cool and tried turning it on, but it didn't come to life... left it on charge for now to see if it works till morning! any ideas or suggestions on this? anything I could do to make it work? thank you",
