    "title": "(Pixel 4a) It thinks I'm on cellular even when connected to wi-fi",
    "content": "On Photos, Play Store, etc, it'll only let me through if I enable \"download/upload over data\", otherwise it'll say \"waiting for wi-fi/network\". It thinks it's on data, but it actually uses wi-fi data when doing their jobs. This problem didn't happen on my old phone, a Galaxy A20",
