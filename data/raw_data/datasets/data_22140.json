    "content": "I bought a Google Pixel 3 in November.  However, my photo's from my Google Pixel 3 appears to be impacting my storage limit.  The Pixel 3 was chosen due to the unlimited full quality storage.  Is there a setting that needs to be done to get the photo's to ensure they do not count towards the limit?",
