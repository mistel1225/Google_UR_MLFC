    "title": "Access App Drawer Over other Apps & Swipe Down for Notifications gone in Android 11?",
    "content": "After the Android 11 Update on the Pixel 3, I'm wondering how to do two things:\n\n1. \"Swipe Down For Notifications\" previously with any fingerprint enabled Pixel, you could swipe down on the fingerprint scanner at any time to drop down your notification bar. Now it seems to only work (by swiping down from the middle button when in Gesture Navigation) ONLY on the home screen.... Can this not be accomplished while Actually using apps (which is majority of the time) \n\n2. Access the App Drawer while in an app... You were once able to double-or long swipe up to access the app drawer from any app(as well as the quick app menu if you swiped up once) it seems like not only is the Quick App menu gone, but Im unable to access the app drawer from anywhere in the phone except the home screen???! Am I doing something wrong (Using Gesture Navigation) \n\nBoth are incredibly inconvenient and if you know a way of executing either or, please do inform me.",
