    "content": "Since the 11 update, AudioPolicyService crashes constantly, making any audio unlistenable and unusable.\n\nI guess there needs to be a question........\n\nCan you reset/reinstall/fix a component?\n\nThe obvious answer is to factory reset the phone, and take a weekend getting it back in working order, and plan to do that every 6 months or so.\n\nIs there a way to do that without spending hours of unpaid labor working for the developer/manufacturer of this extremely expensive device that they broke?\n\nThe obvious answer is, as ridiculous as it is, it's a minor frustration from any reasonable perspective.\n\nGoogle, you suck. Make your s7it better.",
