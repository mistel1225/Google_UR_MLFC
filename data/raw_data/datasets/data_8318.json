    "content": "I contacted Google support 5 days ago because my Pixel 4XL doesn't turn on. I see a white battery sign with a question mark. After some troubleshooting, I was told that I would get a replacement. I choose the advanced exchange replacement, so they would send the phone and the return label for the one not working. I still haven't received instructions on when it would be delivered. The chat is disabled and nobody replies to the emails I send either via the contact form or as a reply to previous conversations. \n\nCan anyone escalate this issue?",
