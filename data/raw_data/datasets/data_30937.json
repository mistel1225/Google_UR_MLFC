    "content": "I have a 1 day old Pixel 3a XL. It was working fine earlier today and now if I try to call someone they can't hear me (earpiece or speaker phone.) The mic is working because assistant works fine. I've rebooted with no change. I'd like to not hard reset as I really don't want to have to set up the whole phone again. Any thoughts?\n\nJR",
