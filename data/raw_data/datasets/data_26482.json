    "content": "I purchased my phone on Nov 2018 through Google Store from Singapore and for past 2 months, I'm facing flickering issue and now i'm facing the issue more regularly. atleast thrice in a day. When I contacted Google Support, they asked me to run the phone in Safe Mode and then factory reset. I still face the same problem.  and then Google Support replied as below,\n\n\" Thank you so much for following all the troubleshooting steps that I send to you and I really appreciate it a lot. It seems that the device already has a hardware failure then in that case you may get a free replacement device from us. Here is the store where you can get the said replacement.\"\n\nWhen go the Store, they said they can only repair and will not replace the phone. and then contacted Google Support again. This time they said, Store can only repair my phone and Singapore country doesn't have option for replacement.\n\nDid anyone on face the problem and got the replacement. I already spend a week in talking to Google Support and Store. nothing works. \n\nIs it a known hardware issue? if yes, will they able to repair it?",
