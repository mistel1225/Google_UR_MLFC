    "content": "The very reason to buy a Google Mobile is to get the update when released. I have been using Google mobiles only from last 9 years and never faced this issue. In 2019 Pixel 4 is not sold in India, Pixel 4a is also delayed sale in India. Now the Android 11 update is delayed. Why Google is delaying products in India? Don't you want customers from India?",
