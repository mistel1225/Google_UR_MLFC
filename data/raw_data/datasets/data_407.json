    "content": "My Pixel 5 is 4 days old. It keeps disconnecting from Wifi and the Verizon Network, I've tried everything I've found online, Network reset, Factory reset, resetting my router, but it disconnects at work and a buddy's house. I checked the SIM card and tray cause one time when I tried to send a text it said I needed a SIM card in order to be able to send texts. I've had nothing but droids since I got away from the Blackberry Storm.....yeah. They've been great till this thing. There doesn't seem to be a rhyme or reason to when it messes up. Doesn't matter which app, or if I'm on a phone call it just stops connecting to anything and some times it reconnects on its own and other times I have to reboot it to get it working again.",
