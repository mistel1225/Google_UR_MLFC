    "content": "I have recently bought a VW transporter T6 (2016). Ever since purchase my Google pixel 2 will connect to the van and everything appears normal. However, ever 30 seconds the entire stereo unit shuts down and restarts, turns back on, reconnects to the phone and 30 seconds later shuts down again. This process just repeats and repeats itself. It only resolves when the Pixel is disconnected from the Bluetooth. I have explored faults with the stereo, but the stereo connects to Iphone and other android phones with no probems, VW have been unable to find any problems also. \n\nThis is leading me to believe its a compatibility issue between the Pixel and stereo, but why? I have never had issues with the pixel and other car stereos. \n\nI have also tried turning off NFC as this was advised but still no joy. \n\nHas anyone got any ideas/help ?",
