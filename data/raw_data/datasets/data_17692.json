    "content": "Hi! Does anyone know why (and how to fix) a slow web navigation on a Pixel 4XL? I have very recently purchased the phone, so it's clean, without installed apps, muy internet works fine, all updstes are installed and my other Android phone (a Xiaomi) loads all pages quickly. For example, if I click a link from my Gmail, it takes over 30 seconds to load the page, or just loading this form took over 10 seconds. If I add a URL address it takes over 30 seconds to load the page, even Google searching takes a long time to load. Any ideas? \n\nThanks!",
