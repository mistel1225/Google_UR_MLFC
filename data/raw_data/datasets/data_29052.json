    "content": "Gmail on Pixel 2 is not turning off conversation view even though the setting is turned off.  \n\nI've called Pixel Help, but they only work with Hardware Issues.\n\nBackstory: On Wednesday Gmail stopped syncing on my Pixel.  I did a system up last night and also stopped GMail on the phone and restarted it. After about an hour, the account began syncing again, but the settings were all screwed up.  I reset my settings, but Gmail isn't playing nicely.\n\nAny help is appreciated.",
