    "content": "up to and including April everything worked. After the may update the notification for a text when connected to Bluetooth stopped working (the notification works if i am not connected to Bluetooth) the text showed up on the display and would read it to me. After the June update not only no notification the text will not show on the display  and be read. This only applies to texting the phone rings I get all my phone calls. Checked the do not disturb  option it is off . Do not know where to go from here. Tried googling the problem to no avail.",
