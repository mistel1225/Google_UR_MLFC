    "content": "My GP 3 recently began getting quite hot every time I use it.  It has only given me the error message once that the phone is too hot and will shut down.  The battery life is also draining much quicker than it has been.  I had this problem with a previous GP3 and Google ended up replacing the phone with a refurbished unit.  The phone has been working well for the most part from Nov -May, but in the last couple of months...horrible!  Anyone else experiencing these issues?  Any way to fix besides going through Google again?  I'm extremely disappointed with the performance of this phone (especially for the $$).  Love the pictures but it's by far the worst phone I've owned.  Guess I'm going back to Motorola.....and junky pics!  Uggh!",
