    "title": "android 11 update destroyed calling ability on pixel phone. speaker mutes phone and lots more",
    "content": "my Pixel updated to android 11 and now when I make calls, I cannot use the speaker (it acts as a mute button), I cannot hear the other person and he or she cannot hear me cannot hear me. or can only sometimes hear me.  voices are robotic and broken sounding.  the ring volume is practically unhearable,  the loudest now is equal to the softest before, even in the settings/test area.  same with other sounds, like alarms.  what good is an update when it takes a perfectly functional phone and turns it into a brick?  and there is nothing that I can find about how to fix this.",
