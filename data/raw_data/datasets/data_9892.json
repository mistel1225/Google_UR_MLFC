    "content": "I am trying to remove persistent kernel.  I have factory reset.  Didn't work.  I have bogus CAs on device.  This is just above my skill level.  It seems that I have multiple vms running on device each with its own virtual interface.  It seams to collect keystrokes, metadata, and send them of on uf8 files.  I don't know how to do a kernel dump but certainly would.  Any help would be appreciated.",
