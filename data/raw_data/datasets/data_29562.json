    "content": "when I misspell a word using Gboard, it will underline it in Blue.  I will receive the 3 suggested words at the top of the keyboard.  But it's impossible to (what would be right click on a PC) get the spell check's suggested words. Or add the word to the dictionary.  A long click only gives me the following options: cut, copy paste, Bold Italic, Strikethrough, Monospace, Share Translate.",
