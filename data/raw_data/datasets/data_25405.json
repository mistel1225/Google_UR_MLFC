    "title": "Is there a way to prevent \"Do not disturb\" from auto enabling when bluetooth turns on driving mode?",
    "content": "I would like for my device to do as it did prior to the Android 10 update, which was to have drive mode turn on, along with blue tooth when the pone detects my vehicle (which it is doing) but to not turn on do not disturb. I tried deselecting this action from the \"what triggers\" do not disturb but it keeps re-enabling itself after a few minutes.",
