    "title": "Pixel phone sends extremely compressed images through Facebook Messenger compared to iPhone",
    "content": "Whenever I send try to send a photo to someone on Facebook Messenger on the Pixel phone, the sent image ends up being majorly compressed (original is 4K, sent image is 1K). I don’t think this is a problem with the Messenger app as my old iPhone can send photos at 4K resolution through the app without any problems.\n\nI even downloaded a 4K image from the Messenger app to the Pixel phone, the saved resolution is still 4K. However, when I try to reupload the same image, it will compress it down to 1K.\n\nI cannot find any solution to this and it is very frustrating. I would really like to find a way to fix this otherwise I don’t see myself using Pixel phones in the future.\n\nAny help appreciated.",
