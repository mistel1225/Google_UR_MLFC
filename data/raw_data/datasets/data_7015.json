    "title": "After Android 11 update my pixel often has a hard time 'waking up' and soft reboot required",
    "content": "After the Android 11 update my device sometimes has a hard time waking up.  It does not happen when on the charger.  It does seem to happen after wifi status changes, either handoffs or leaving the house.  \n\nI have followed most solutions I have found here that consists of: I have factory reset it, I have removed most 3rd party apps, I have set it to keep the screen on all the time, and it is still happening at least once a day.  It was happening as much as 2x per day.  I did run safe mode for awhile and it did not happen, but probably would need to go longer than the 12 hours I did.  \n\nI am looking for more things to try.  Thanks.",
