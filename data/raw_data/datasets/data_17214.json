    "content": "Please add the ability to sort the app drawer by \"install date\" (new to old / old to new).\n\nLocating and organizing apps on Pixel devices is a really bad user experience. After install, Pixel dumps the app into the \"app drawer\". If you forgot the name or aren't referencing it correctly, it's lost and not easily findable. If you have many apps, you might not find it easily at all.\n\nRelated: in Google Play, you cannot simply sort applications by \"install date\" which would also make it much easier to locate apps. Most people know that they are \"looking for something they just installed\" rather than the specific app name.\n\nI don't know what's so hard about such a simple function, but basically every OS and install monitor in existence time-datestamps application installations to the device. It should be trivial to give this sort function to a user and it is a fundamental way to search.",
