    "content": "I have a very VERY specific question about the Pixel 4a 5G.\nI already got it and I love using it, but I have something that makes it hard to get used to, compared to my prior Pixel 3 XL.\n\nUnder the phone's Settings -> System -> Gestures -> System Navigation\nThere are two options... the new \"Gesture Navigation\", and the legacy \"3-button Navigation\".\n\nI love, and always will, the \"3-button Navigation\".\nBut the Pixel 4a 5G lost a VERY crucial feature with that 3-button Navigation.\nI can no longer swipe left and right to quickly switch back-and-forth between recent apps.\nAnd that swiping feature is available in the \"Gesture Navigation\" option.\nSo, why does the 3-button Navigation not have it?\n\nIs there something I can do?\nIf not, what can i do to request that feature inclusion?\n\nPLEASE GIVE ME GOOD NEWS!",
