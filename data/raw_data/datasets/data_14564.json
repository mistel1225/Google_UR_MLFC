    "content": "Why Pixel 4A 5G and Pixel 5 is not made available in India? I can understand that 5G rollout is still under process in many countries but what makes google stop introducing these phones to India? Even if I consider that 5G is of no use to me right now in India still, there are differences in other features of both variants of 4A so if people want to have added features, why google is stopping them?",
