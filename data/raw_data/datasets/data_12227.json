    "content": "I try to lock my Pixel 4a and listen to music on YT Music Premium. It plays and then stops, and then plays but constantly stopping and going.\n\nI've tried restarting my phone but this does not fix the issue. I understand it's only recently been released, so perhaps some sort of software bug.",
