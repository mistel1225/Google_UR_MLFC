    "title": "My Lock Screen Photo was hacked (the grim reaper was inserted) -- how is this possible?",
    "content": "Tonight my lock screen picture all of a sudden showed a photo that is not mine, and is not in my camera roll. It was a photo of the grim reaper, and was cleverly very similar in color and layout to my own lock screen photo. After checking the lock screen a few times, it reverted back to my original photo. The grim reaper photo is nowhere to be found on my phone. I have not installed any apps in quite awhile. Would this be caused by an app? Or does it mean the Android operating system is compromised? I've changed passwords, and will do a factory reset, then reinstall from backup, but will the backup likely recreate the problem? Or can that be avoided by downloading each app again from Google Play? Any explanations and advice is much appreciated.",
