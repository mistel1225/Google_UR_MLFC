    "content": "Hi everybody! \nI have my pixel 4xl since the beginning of the year. Actually I am quite satisfied. However, I noticed the other day during a video recording in a quiet environment that auto focus or OIS make a quiet noise when you turn the phone around the vertical axis with short movements. Either auto focus/OIS corrects the movement or the mounted lens swings. If the camera app is closed, you won't hear anything.\n\nA user has already written on reddit. Since it is only perceptible in absolutely quiet surroundings, probably not too many have noticed this phenomenon. But unfortunately you can hear it on the video.\n\nIs it a HW issue or just normal beahviour? I assume it's the OIS is moving the lens.\n\nHere the video on reddit, with me it is absolutely identical. Another one has probably confirmed it:\n\n\nPixel 4 xl OIS sound or noise - Streamable",
