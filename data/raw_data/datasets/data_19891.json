    "title": "Google Play Music (Musicolet) Hijacks my music source",
    "content": "Google Pixle 4\nAndroid Auto / SiriusXM / Google Music Player (Musicolet)\n\nI have Android Auto in my phone and my Ford F150. When getting back into the truck, plugging my phone into the dash, it often/always defaults to Google Play Music (Musicolet) and albums on my phone, even though I had last been using SiriusXM for music. I now have to cycle through sources (AM1->AM2->FM1->FM2->etc->Sirius1/2/3) to get back to the SiriusXM Station I had on the last time I was in the truck. This is happening despite not having Musicolet on recently.\n\nI connect to a Bluetooth Speaker. Open the SiriusXM App and start a music channel. A song starts playing. Shortly afterward, Google Play Music switches over to music stored in my phone. Open the phone, restart the paused song I was listening to on the SiriusXM App and it works fine. Just like in the truck, this is happening despite not having Musicolet on recently.\n\nAny help would be appreciated.\n\nJohn",
