    "content": "I've tried looking at the setup option. This only sets up Google assistant. I've tried to see if there is debris in the headphone port but have not tried cleaning (afraid I might damage them). The headphone symbol doesn't come up when plugged in. I briefly had an issue where the sound was playing through the phone speaker. I've tried taking my phone case off to test if the headphones were not connected properly.",
