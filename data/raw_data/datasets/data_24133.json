    "content": "I am using Pixel 2 and I just got the December update yesterday. And I found that the change keyboard button, which usually appears on bottom right corner of the screen while typing, is gone now. I don't know how to fix this.\nBefore update, if I want to change from swiftkey to gboard, I just need to tap the change keyboard button and choose gboard. But now, I have to go to settings, system, languages&input, virtual keyboard, manage keyboards, then toggle off the swiftkey so that it will change to gboard. That is ANNOYING. Does anyone meet the same problem?",
