    "content": "I just got my 4XL back from Google this week for the repair of my phone no longer wireless charging.  The first day of having it the wireless charging worked perfect.  The next day I got the notification to update my phone back to Android 11.  After that update by wireless charging is no longer working again.  I am using the Google Pixel stand.  I am not sure if it software or not, but it does not wireless charge even when turned off.  This was the third charging issue repair in about 6 month for this phone.  :(",
