    "content": "Google had FedEx ship my pixel 3, I didn't hear my door, so they delivered it to a neighbor!!! ðŸ˜¡And had them sign... First of all I don't trust my neighbors. \nI received a message saying my package was delivered, but it wasn't here. It still hadn't come by evening, so I called customer service for Google. They started an investigation, because that shouldn't be happening... \"Right!?\"\nThen a few hours later, late that night, I heard a knock at my door, a neighbor handed me the box, and I noticed it was partially opened...\n I did not sign for it, and I'm frankly very frustrated. I don't want to open the box the rest of the way, what if its damaged and they say they can't take it back if I open it... I sent a message to their technical support team, and haven't heard back still! I informed them I'm willing to take it into the FedEx store where they can return it to sender. \nBut then I would like a full refund... I'm done. Can someone please help me with this???",
