    "content": "I have 4 phones on T mobile 2 apple 11 pros and a s10 and a pixel 3xl ..the 3xl is using over 20GB a month data on photos . This is way more than all my other phones use combined. I took a regular photo of a river and my data use jumped 898 for just one photo. Is there a work around or fix for this?",
