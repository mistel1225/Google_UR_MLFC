    "content": "I had this problem for a while when I first got the pixel 2 about a year ago but it eventually stopped. Now it has suddenly come back and almost every time I unlock my pixel whether it be with my fingerprint or just pressing the power button the phone takes about 2 seconds before the screen lights up and it won't respond to my touch. The only way to fix is to perform a soft reset, which I have had to do about 10 times today because the issue keeps occurring. I just performed a factory reset in hopes it would solve the problem but the first time I went to unlock my phone after the screen was unresponsive. Anyone had this issue or have any tips to resolve it? Thanks.",
