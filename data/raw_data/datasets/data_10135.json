    "content": "In the last couple of days I will be using my phone and all of the apps  and widgets disappear from the homepage. If I try to swipe up, nothing appears. I can only access the settings and notifications. Phone must be restarted to go back to normal. I've had the phone 18 months and never had this issue before.",
