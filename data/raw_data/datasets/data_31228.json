    "content": "I just received my Pixel 3 in the mail and instantly dropped and cracked the screen, I want to know if I can trade it in. Since I bought it on the birthday sale I wasn't able to buy accedental dammage protection so I'm not able to have it replaced. I realise the value for trade in is lower than that of the actual retail price of the phone. I don't see a trade in option for the Pixel 3, can I trade it in?",
