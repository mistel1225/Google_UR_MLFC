    "content": "Hi,\nI just uncovered that:\n1. if you turn on gesture controls for navigation in pixel 2, \n2. rotate your phone while playing YouTube the GUI stops working, and the phone locks.\n\n I tried this in multiple phones and the problem persists.\nBelow is the image of what the error looks like.\n\nThanks\nAiman",
