    "content": "I have a Next Hub next to my desk and a Pixel 4, which is usually with me wherever. Whenever I 'Ok Google' to request something from the Next my Pixel also activates and copies the action if it can or fails if it's not possible. As far as I understand it this shouldn't happen, but I can't figure out how to get the phone to stop. Any help appreciated.",
