    "content": "Whilst charging my Pixel 4 XL will not display a screen other than a blank/black screen. \n\nIf I press the unlock button nothing is displayed; haptic feedback occurs as if face recognition takes place but remains black; when the unlock button is held down it will display my bank cards at the top of the screen, the usual emergency contacts, screenshot etc but nothing else; to amend this every time I have had to restart the phone. \n\nAll software/security updates have been performed. \n\nIt's not really a 'huge' issue, however I don't believe this should happen on a premium product. \n\nRegards,\n\nKirk.",
