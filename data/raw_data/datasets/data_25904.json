I'd love to use this in a routine!\n\nI notice Do Not Disturb now works via voice commands on Google Assistant (this didn't before), but thats not the same as the vibrate setting that you can tap when using the volume up / down keys.\n\nI mean, is there any way to get Google Assistant on a Pixel to just do the equivalent of tapping this button?",
