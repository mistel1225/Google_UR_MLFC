    "title": "Pixel 4a messages: all of the sudden some messages missing completely or display as unknown sender",
    "content": "Hi,\n\nI migrated from iPhone 8 Plus to Pixel 4a not quite two weeks ago. All has been going well. Today I noticed some of the messages I sent as recently as last weekend either disappeared completely or are still visible but show unknown sender. I checked in archived and nothing doing. On the unknown sender messages, I can see that the contact is still associated with the phone number\n\nAny idea what might be the issue or is this possibly a messages bug? Some of the message threads are Android users and others are iPhone users. If there is a way to clear all messages and start from scratch, I'd be game to give that a try.",
