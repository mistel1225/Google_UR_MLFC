    "title": "Pixel 2 xl Huge battery drain when using the camera app",
    "content": "When i am using the camera app on Pixel xl 2, especially the portrait mode, i get 2% battery drops after 2-4 pictures taken. This drained my battery 2 times when i was taking some pictures for somebody. After showing 1% and restarting the phone, i had 20% again... \n\nI have tested it, my phone is discharging at a normal rate, but when i open the camera and try portrait mode i get 2% battery drain after 2-3 portrait pictures taken... The same with camera app , after taking multiple photos and especially HDR  + on but that's not as bad as portrait. I will go on a trip in 2 weeks and i really need my phone for this.. I think resetting the phone to factory settings will NOT help, because it is clearly a software/camera related problem. Maybe i will disable the camera app, uninstall the updates and install a camera app that is a port from pixel 3 or 4.",
