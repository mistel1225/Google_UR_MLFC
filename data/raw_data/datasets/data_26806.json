    "content": "I am being trying lately since last 6-7months or so and I am not being able to cast my phone screen on to the television where as rest all other flagship device are able to do it and whole pressing on the option \"cast\" in the settings and it doesn't locate my TV name and it connects manually through Bluetooth and it is of no use to me so Google developers and team pixel provide me a solution.\nHoping that you would provide!!\nThanks, \nM.
