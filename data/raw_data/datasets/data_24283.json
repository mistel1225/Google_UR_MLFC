    "content": "I was actually on the call with CVS and nobody was on hold.  114 hours with a contact in my phone.  Showed as current call. What in the world is up with this quirky display.  Only reason I noticed was because I was trying to figure out how to press numbers for a live person at CVS. When I hung up with CVS it said call ended with Matt.  I called Matt and he confused as no call was placed to him.  Yeah exactly Google is jacked I was on phone with CVS",
