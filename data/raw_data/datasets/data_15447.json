    "content": "The phone and messaging apps are frequently displays a notification in the  notifications bar stating that it is background processing. They usually show up for a couple seconds and then disappear but it is happening all the time and is extremely frustrating. \n\nI have not been able to figure out any way to stop it from popping up on my notifications. I have gone into the apps and turned the background processing notification to silent but I want it to stop popping up in my notifications all together but it still shows up all the time. This wasn't happening before I updated Android 11 recently.\n\n\nNothing I've tried has worked, the only option would be for me to disable all silent notifications but I have other silent notifications that I need to see in this is not unacceptable \"solution.\"\n\nI have not seen an option to disable the background processing notification from showing up. I have Googled and browed the community forums several times and still have not been able to find to a solution and this needs to be fixed ASAP. Android 11 has a ton of glitches and issues that has made my phone virtually unusable half of the time and it is extremely frustrating; this is just one of many things but it should be easily fixable and yet I cannot figure out how to get it to stop popping up. \n\nI will try to get a screenshot next time it happens but it only shows up for a few seconds and then disappears so it's difficult to get a screenshot.",
