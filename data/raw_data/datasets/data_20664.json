    "content": "My Wifi connection ONLY is only working when Bluetooth is enabled. I have a PixelXL 1st Gen Android 10 on GFi. \n\nHow do I fix this? \n\nI have tried restarting and starting in safe mode. Tried forgetting network. Tried forgetting network and resetting router and then reconnecting to wifi, and all combinations. I have also tried turning airplane mode on and off again, and tried connecting with and without VPN. Everything.\n\nMy Wifi still /only/ works when my Bluetooth is enabled. Will not connect otherwise. Any ideas?",
