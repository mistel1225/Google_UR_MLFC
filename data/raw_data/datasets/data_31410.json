    "content": "I used \"find my phone\" to locate my phone through my gmail account. I found it, days later. It keeps asking me for a password, which I have forgotten. I've tried multiple times to figure it out, and now it says I have 4 attempts left until a phone reset. This can not happen, I need the information on this phone to stay intact.\n\nHow can I un do this?? It won't let me reset a password through my gmail that I can find, because of the one I set before that I can't remember.\n\nThere is no contact number from gmail to call, and verizon has no answers for me.",
