    "title": "I'm having continued difficulty swiping away notifications or to answer/decline a call.",
    "content": "I find it frustratingly difficulty to dismiss notifications or answer the phone.  This seems doubly so when when the phone is locked.  Quite frequently I have to swipe 3 or more times before it actually does what I want instead of bouncing the notification or call back to where it started.  It doesn't matter if it's a quick stroke, a slow sure stroke, or how much of the screen I cover with the swipe.  When Googling the problem, I'm continually led to something called \"anti-falsing\" but I don't see a way to disable it without install some weird UI overlay or rooting my phone and installing a different OS.  How can I improve the swipe response before I yeet this phone out the window?!",
