    "content": "I bought an unlocked Pixel 3 with eSim capability and I can't scan the QR code from Mint Mobile to activate the service using an eSim.  The carrier has verified that my specific phone is eSim enabled, but nothing happens when I use the camera to scan the QR code.  The option for \"Mobile Networks\" is also grayed out in Settings.  How can I get my new mobile service to work using an eSim?",
