Everything was fine last night, woke up this morning and the phone won't turn on or reboot. Power button isn't responsive, Power button + Volume down to get into recovery mode is also not responsive. When I connect my phone to my PC I also get QUSB_BULK_CID:xxxx_SN:xxxxxxxx.\n\nI did some searching around and it sounds like the phone might be stuck in Emergency Download Mode? Anyone have a solution on how to fix this issue?\n\n\nQUSB_BULK_CID:xxxx_SN:xxxxxxxx.",
