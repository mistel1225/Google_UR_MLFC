    "content": "Brand New Google Pixel XL ( Purchased on July 10, 2019 ) freezes randomly. It does not matter what app is being operated or if no apps are opened and just trying to navigate the home screen. Once problem begins, all touch screen responses begin to become increasingly sluggish/delayed and eventually stop functioning completely. At which time a pop-up box indicates that the app, function or input is not responding. Options given are force stop, wait or send a report. Reports have been sent to Google. Checked for available update to the phone and all the apps. None needed, everything is updated. Tested phone in safe mode and problem still occurs. Performed a full factory reset. As soon as the phone was complete with all the setup procedures , installs and updates, problem re-occured. Contacted carrier (Verizon) who recommended reset or replacement. Returned to the dealer and they replaced the phone with a brand new replacement. ( July 20, 2019 ) After one full day with no issues, the replacement phone began to freeze on July 22, 2019. Removed all non-factory installed apps and disabled all non-essential apps. Problem still occurs. The Verizon store rep believes the issue is possibly caused by a Google factory installed app called \"Digital Wellbeing\". Unfortunately, this app cannot be completely uninstalled or removed. No resolution has been found. Anyone who has experienced this same issue and has a resolution, please advise.\n\nThank You.",
