    "content": "I am an IT professional and have factory reset the phone numerous times, yet I cannot get past the security feature. As this is a company owned phone for a not for profit health center, we have no idea what the original pin was set to and the person who used the phone is no longer with the company. We use Google for all of our services and would like to issue the phone to another employee.",
