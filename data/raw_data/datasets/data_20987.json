    "content": "I'm a Paralegal, and I need to not have message previews show up on my phone when I'm in Court for privacy reasons. We use an app called Telegram for security, but I can't find out how to turn off the message content previews on my Pixel 2.\n\nTo reiterate: I still want the notification, just not the content of the message. Like \"Discord message\" or \"Telegram message\" - How do I do this?\n\nI'm using the latest Android version that's pushed over the air.\n\nThanks for your help, everyone!",
