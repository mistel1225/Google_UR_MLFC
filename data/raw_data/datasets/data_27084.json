    "content": "My Pixel 2 has been experiencing dead spots and ghost touching over the last couple of weeks. It has days when it is kind of ok and days when it is completely unusable. Unfortunately, I did a factory reset tonight and now can't even get back into the phone because the entire right hand side of the screen is completely dead.\n\nArgh - I'm so distressed about it, especially since I am away from home for the foreseeable future and in the Balkans until Christmas!\n\nHas anyone had similar issues? Is it a hardware problem? Will replacing the screen fix it? \n\nThanks in advance.",
