    "content": "Suddenly my GPS stopped working. When I open Google Maps or Waze or any other app that uses my location, they don't work because the phone can't detect my location at all, as if the location setting was turned off.\nMy phone didn't fell or nothing, I was watching a movie and when it ended I opened Google Maps but it didn't work. So then is where I realized there was a problem.\nSo far I tried restarting the phone, turning off location, switching to airplane mode, but nothing seems to work out.\nIs this a hardware problem or can it be solved with a software update?\nThanks for the help.",
