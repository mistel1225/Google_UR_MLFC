    "content": "I dread every 'update' they force onto my phone... Unbelievably  stupid UI changes... And now, they decided to render my alarm app useless (without indicating so) by making it silent... Missed so many alarms before figuring out it is the f'ing Android 10 update. But hey, at least now I have a dark theme!\n\nI just want Oreo back, and never update again. Help!",
