    "content": "Vonage Extensions will ring simultaneously on my mobile when a caller phones my landline at home.  The problem that has occurred since upgrading to Android 10 is the apps answer screen no longer opens.  There is a narrow notification bar that displays but now there is no way of answering the call.\nHas anyone else experienced this problem?",
