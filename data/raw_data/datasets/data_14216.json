    "content": "Over been on support for hours trying to fix this issue.\n\nI can no longer use the Google Home app. I've tried all troubleshooting steps they ask me to attempt. It's been multiple days of chatting with support reps who cannot help.\n\nLooking around online I see I am not alone here. How can this be escalated?\n\nThanks",
