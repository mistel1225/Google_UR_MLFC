    "content": "I bought a Google Pixel 3 UNLOCKED off of Ebay (I know, kind of risky) and instead the seller sent me a Verizon locked phone. I have never had service with Verizon or ever considered it to be honest, so I don't know if they'll be willing to unlock the phone for me. Any suggestions?",
