    "title": "My Google Pixel 4a battery doesn't last all day (unless I don't use it), is it a dud?",
    "content": "I upgraded my phone from a Pixel 2XL to a Pixel 4a recently (delivered on November 28) because the battery life for my 2XL was no longer lasting all day like before, but I'm finding that the battery on my phone also doesn't last very long, unless I don't use it at all. I'm not someone who spends countless hours on my phone and when I check the battery for usage it says \"phone has typical background battery usage.\" In a typical day my phone usage is about 20 minutes of Pandora, a handle full of text messages, and playing Toy blast while on my lunch break...I've been reading about people being able to watch shows and stream other things and yet my battery doesn't last while not doing all of that. I'm starting to think I received a lemon. Any thoughts?",
