    "title": "\"Certificate authority installed\" after Pixel 3a xl repaired locally. Benign, malicious, purpose?",
    "content": "I had the cracked touchscreen replaced on my Pixel 3a xl at a local repair shop that advertised as having training re: Pixels. At home, I noticed a colored triangle in the notifications bar at the top of my phone. Scrolling down to the notice, flush left on the screen, there is a (sometimes colored) triangle, with an exclamation point in its center. On the same line, it reads \"Android System.\"\n           Directly under that line, it reads: \"Certificate authority installed\"\n           Next line: \"By an unknown third party\"\nI researched the phrase online, but didn't understand what I was reading. Hence, this post.\n\nNow, someone is probably wondering why I am asking others about this \"certificate\" rather than calling the people who I am assuming put it there. Well, It felt weird that this company might have put something in my phone, which doesn't seem to relate to the problem that needed fixing, but didn't ask or tell me about it.\n\nWould like to know if it is harmful or not. Btw, I am NOT a techie, so please, be gentle\n\nPamela Golden",
