    "content": "I signed up for FanDuel Sportsbook and it says it cannot determine my location even though I gave it location permission and have location turned on in settings.\n\nThe app says it cannot determine my location due to a VPN or proxy setting. I've tried to remedy this but cannot find a fix, and their support doesn't have an answer.\n\nAnyone have any helpful advice so I can use this app?",
