    "title": "True dual SIM on Pixel 5",
    "content": "I would love to buy Pixel 4 because I really do like the design but I can't buy it due to no true dual SIM support. I was waiting for dual SIM support every single Pixel phone release but no soap...\n\nA bit less I mind no 3.5mm Jack support but I would like it there, too. I think that even more people would also love to have true dual SIM on Pixel.\nIs it a big problem? What about 2 versions of Pixel:\n1. dual SIM\n2. SIM+eSIM\n\nWould it be possible to get it on Pixel 5 (that would have similar design to Pixel 4), please? (I don't like 4a :))\n\nI wish this thread would be read by someone from Google. :)",
