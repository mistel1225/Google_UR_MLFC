    "content": "My phone, a pixel 3a, is changing volume at random. I use my phone pretty reasonably, and I've never seen this issue before today.\n\nIt both decreases and increases system volume at random.\n\nI don't know what could be causing the issue.\n\nI mainly use wired headphones, but I've never had issue with these headphones in the past.\nI do have a case, but again, its never given me an issue before today.\n\nMy phone launched itself in safe mode twice earlier today after restarting to try and fix this issue.\n\nMy only possible idea is that it's a humidity issue?",
