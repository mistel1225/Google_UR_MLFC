    "content": "So my touch vibs won't stay on. I've restarted in safe to get it going but then restart again and it'll work for a while but eventually stop. Naturally I suspect it's an app but I don't know which one.\nRecently I installed the beta Q and didn't like it so removed it, it wiped my pixel. So I've reinstalled all the same apps I had before but never had this problem.\nI'm using the stock keyboard and have checked the settings in that and also in my normal settings.\nNot sure which app is likely the issue, how can I fix it? I've opened up developer options and have \"runnings apps\" available to see what's running and it doesn't look like anything out of the ordinary.\nThanks.",
