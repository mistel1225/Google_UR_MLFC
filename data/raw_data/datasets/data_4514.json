    "content": "I have a Spanish sim and am traveling to France. But, as soon as I entered I'm unable to pick up another data network. They connect for a few seconds and then drop.\n\nAn orange operator told me that the problem is with the phone, that it won't let me set the imapping to France from the international setting. Any advice. I'm just counting the days before 2FA locks me out of my work accounts. \n\nI've tried restarting the phone, resetting the network settings, Ipv6 instead of 4, manually connecting to another network. I don't know what else to try and I'm desperate. If this is a Pixel problem, than maybe I just need to upgrade to another phone brand?",
