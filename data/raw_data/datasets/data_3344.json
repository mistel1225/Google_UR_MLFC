    "content": "I just bought a new Pixel 5 and want to transfer data from my Pixel 3 to it but my Pixel 3's USB-C port is not working. Is there a way to transfer the data wirelessly?\n\nEDIT: I tried following the instructions in the support article by selecting \"No cable\" when prompted in the setup wizard but the only option I got was to restore from a cloud backup. No mention of using the \"Set up nearby device\" function at all. Is the support article out of date or does it not apply to transferring from one Pixel to another?",
