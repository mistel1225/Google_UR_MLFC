    "content": "Pixel 3 is running slowly, very hot and is charging incredibly slowly after the update.\n\nFor an example, the Madden 21 NFL game is now impossible to play as it jumps and lags. Previously it was fine.\n\nPhone now barely charging.\n\nI've restarted several times, closed apps down, cleaned up storage etc.",
