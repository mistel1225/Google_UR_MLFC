    "content": "My Pixel 4 suddenly stopped responding to touches. The device is well taken care of. It has not fallen in any way. All hard-keys still work fine but the screen is completely unresponsive.\n\nI removed the screen protector I had but it didn't help fix the situation. The screen is clean, it doesn't have any visible scratches and of course no stickers nor anything that could interfere with it working.\n\nI tried restarting the phone using the hard-keys. I also restarted it in safe mode. The touchscreen still doesn't work.\n\nI have some data that I really need (including 2-Step Verification for bank accounts and other sensitive logins) so I haven't tried restoring to factory settings. This looks like a hardware problem anyway.\n\nBecause since I restarted it, the phone was stuck on the lockscreen, I used a USB-C OTG (On The Go) adapter to try a standard mouse.\n\nThe screen itself works fine and shows everything perfectly. All the apps also seem to work. But the touch sensor is not working anywhere on the phone screen! It cannot detect any of my touch gestures no matter what I try.\n\nWith a mouse connected to the OTG USB adapter the phone works fine, but it's of course extremely painful to use without the touchscreen.\n\nI tried contacting Google Support (https://support.google.com/pixelphone/) but no matter where I click, I can't find a way to contact support, only a suggestion to try with a Twitter account, where I was told to go back to the support website...\n\nI bought the phone in Germany.",
