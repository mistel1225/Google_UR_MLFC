    "content": "Pardon my English,but I'm really need help now.My college gonna start online education next month.\nSo my phone suddenly restart itself when I was playing games.At first I thought It was normal,But then it restart again sometimes looping at the Google logo.If I was lucky I able to get in but only for few minutes it restart again.\nSo here what I notice.\n-I charged the phone until 100%(Not in power off state).Then wait for it to restart.(And yes it restart after I unplug it after only few minutes)\n-After boot loop a couple of times I was able to get in,and I notice my battery only left 63% and the battery 63% won't decrease at all.Unless restarting again which will decrease % drastically.\n-\"Battery usage data not available\" in show battery usage.\n-Factory reset won't do anything.",
