    "content": "I have just picked my phone up off the table to check it, and to my surprise some of the pixels have died, and the whole touchscreen is unresponsive, EXCEPT for the area where the pixels are dead. I have restarted my device so far but that has been to no avail. Is there any explanation for this? I have dropped my phone in the past, however not between the time I last checked it (10 minutes or so ago) and now when I discovered the problem, nor has it had anything spilt on it etc. \n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated.",
