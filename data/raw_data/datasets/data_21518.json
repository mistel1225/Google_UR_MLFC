    "title": "Randomly Shuts Down, Sometimes with Quick Battery Drain; NEVER Occurs When Charging",
    "content": "In the last week, my Pixel 3 has been:\nSeemingly randomly shutting down, even though the battery is charged (it could be 25%, 50%, 80%, etc.).\nSometimes there is a quick battery drain below 15% where it shuts down within seconds.\n\nHowever, there is NEVER a problem when it is plugged in and is recharging.\n\nHere's what I've done:\nContacted Google Chat Support.\nInitiated a factory reboot (recommended by Support). and backup/restore.\nStarted in Safe-Mode.\nConfirmed I've the most recent updates.\nChecked the battery usage for problems.\n\nProblem persists.\n\nGoogle Support says I can have it sent to them to be repaired for $80 but will take ten to fourteen days (there seems to be no walk-in drop-off in my New York Zip Code of 10003). \n\nHowever, this is too long for me not to have a business phone.\n\nQuestions:\nHave you come across this?\nAny other solution?\nIt seems like a battery issue, right?\nCan I replace the battery on my own, to save time?\n\nThanks in advance.",
