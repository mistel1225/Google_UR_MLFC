    "content": "After updating my Pixel 2 XL with February 2020 update, I cannot transfer files, connect device with android auto, or even worse as an Android developer, use USB debugging anymore.\n\nI have tried with different cables, different laptops and even with different cars to connect with Android Auto, but it doesn't work. However, other different devices with the same laptops, cables and autos they do. It seems a software issue due to I can charge it and it stopped after an update.\n\nI don't know if steps with my actions helps but I remember it was connected to an auto (using Android Auto obviously), I tap button to update, I unplugged device from auto and after restart, it stopped working.\n\nI have tried resetting device to factory settings but with no success.\n\nAlso, I have search on internet there are other users with the same issue but with different updates, so you are aware of USB issue with this device and updates.\n\nI need this device for working. How can I fix it? Waiting for another update seems not to be the solution, having read the same issue from other users.",
