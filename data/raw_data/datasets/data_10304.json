    "content": "I updated to Android 11 last night. When I close the spotify application, the music continues running and the only way to stop the music is to force stop the application. Even when I attempt to switch to other applications like youtube or netflix, music still play in the background.\n\nRestarted my phone and it did not help. Any solutions?",
