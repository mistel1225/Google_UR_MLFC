    "content": "I'm looking to buy a Google pixel 3 phone to have unlimited Google photos storage. But as mentioned in the recent email by Google there will be policy changes for Google accounts and data that exceeds free storage limit will be removed.\n\nI'm trying to understand if this means that Google photos storage will still be unlimited for Pixel 3 phones or it will be under 15gb free limit after policy changes.\n\nThanks",
