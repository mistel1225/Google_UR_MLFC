    "title": "My Google Pixel 3 XL automatically factory reset itself, and after system updates, it's very glitchy",
    "content": "I just woke up and checked my phone for time, but it was asking what language to set up.\nI was surprised and had to set everything up.\nI still have no clue what happened to my phone. I don't think I sleepwalked and pressed the factory reset button myself.\nI am speculating that it tried to update the phone firmware, but during the process, reset happened or something.\nDid anyone experience a similar situation?\nDoes anyone know what is going on? Please help! Thank you.",
