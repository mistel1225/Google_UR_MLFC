    "content": "I bought google pixel 2 XL on january and just get it from aliexpress and seller told me that it is new, NOT refurbished, but i think he lies, because package quality was poor there was like slight glue mark  on its side, battery dies too quick I think, it has one broken pixel in its right bottom corner. But he still insists that the phone is new and was checked before shipment(how did he check it if it was packaged from google). IMEI is 358036080670088. How can I prove that the phone was previously used or refurbished? Maybe Google can check IMEI and confirm it?",
