    "content": "Is there an option to only show battery percentage and hide the battery level symbol? It's an issue where other icons get hidden because of the notch. Why force the battery symbol on users that prefer percentage? Also, the \"LTE\" next to signal strength is also a waste but I don't expect a solution there.",
