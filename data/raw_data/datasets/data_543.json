    "content": "It has been three weeks since I shipped my newly bought device to Google for replacement. Despite being promised that I will receive a new phone once Google receives my device, I haven't got any news for replacement nor any reason for the delay from the Google support team. I regret to say it's a real disappointment and frustration for Google's failed promise. \n\nIs there someone that I can reach out on this issue? Thank you.",
