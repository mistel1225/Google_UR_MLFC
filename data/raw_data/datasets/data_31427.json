    "content": "My fiance's Pixel 2XL screen broke while currently traveling in Asia. We found someone who would replace the screen, but is now experiencing really bad phantom touch the majority of the time it is on, making it almost impossible to use. Luckily the repair had warranty included, but we really wanted the device to use as a camera on our travels. Is there any solutions for phantom touch? We have already tried the basics of restarting, letting the battery drain and such, we will likely factory reset soon after backing up too. The device worked fine for about half an hour after replacing the screen then the issue appeared and is constant now.\n\nOur device is also only 6months old, we purchased in Canada. Is it possible we could use the manufactures warranty when we get home or abroad, or would getting it repaired from a third party void the warranty? Trying to figure out my best options, any input is appreciated.",
