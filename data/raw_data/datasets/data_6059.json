    "content": "I just got the new Google pixel 5, when I connect the Bluetooth to my 2017 Jeep, the audio skips and jitters often. I never had this problem with my previous phone, the Google pixel 2 XL. I've read that changing something in the Bluetooth settings can help, but I can't find advanced bluetooth settings on the phone.",
