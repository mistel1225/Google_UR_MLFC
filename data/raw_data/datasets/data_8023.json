    "content": "Hi all, \nAnother year, another flagship phone, same lens issue. \nI used my new Pixel 5 today at night for the first time, and I immediately saw the lens flare ( is that what it's called?) right from the get go. What makes it worse is that my Pixel 1 did not exhibit this behaviour. This issue essentially renders the 5 unusable for night time photography. \nI have tried it in night mode, in regular mode as well as in videos. And the issue is just the same. \nIt is a massive let down, to buy the flagship phone from Google and yet encounter such issues. If I cannot use the phone at night without such issues, then I am not sure how I feel about staying with Google or the Android ecosystem.  Not sure what DxOMark are rating the camera on.\n\nHave others using Pixel 5 faced this issue, and if yes, any resolutions? \nIs this a hardware issue?\nAny support/resolutions from Google? ",
