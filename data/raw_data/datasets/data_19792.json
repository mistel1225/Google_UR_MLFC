    "content": "No audio on video connections, phone not ringing on incoming calls. Extremely inconveinient when trying to keep in touch with family. Especially in the situation we are in because of the virus. Have done factory reset, reinstalled apps and all the tests suggested by Google support, and more than once all to no avail. They don't seem to know what to do next and have run out of ideas and given up, passing me from one dept to another. With many more pixel owners in this situation, surely something should be being done about it. Anyone know what if anything Google are doing to solve this issue?",
