    "content": "Since my phone updated to Android 11 last month it suddenly started using a lot of data, despite data being turned off and apps not having permission to access data unless connected to wifi. I've tried searching for ways to turn off background data but what I've found doesn't seem to do anything. Anyone have suggestions?",
