    "content": "My assistant suddenly began talking in an English accent when I told it to read out notifications. I held down the middle button and told it to change it's voice to the default voice, and it confirmed that it did, but the notifications keep being read in an English accent. I went on my phone to see what voice my assistant was on and it was on 'red', the default voice. I honestly don't know why it's doing this.",
