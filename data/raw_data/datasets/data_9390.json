    "content": "I have had it for about a month with adaptive battery always on. I am having horrible issues with notifications not showing up in time. I have gone through and turned off battery optimization for all the apps I would like to be notified right away.\nEven after doing this I will sit my phone down at work right next to me and not get any notifications for a while. As soon as I pick up the phone and unlock they all flood in, even the non optimized ones.\nAnyone have any suggestions? Would turning off battery optimization kill my battery?",
