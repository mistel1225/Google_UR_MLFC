    "content": "If I use the internal electronic SIM (for my phone and data connection to Fi), is there any way to use the empty SIM slot for external storage?  This had been possible with dual SIM models that worked on Fi---well before electronic SIM--with a nano-SIM card. Quite an advantage---one could get up to 250 Gig addintiona.\n\nI my new 4a5g I see no instructions for setting this up, however.  It appears that the size SIM is slightly smaller than the traditional nano-SIM  of a few years ago.\nQ.1--Is it possible to use the SIM slot for external storage?\nQ. 2 - If so, would someone point me to the instructions (i.e. for formatting, and then mounting, and any further specifications for loading.\nQ. 3-If so, what size nano-SIM.\n\nThe usual search has just brought up a large amount of how to use different carriers in a dual SIM mode.  But that, as I hope I've made clear, is not my goal.  Storage is.\nthanks",
