    "content": "Hello,\n\nI have just bought a new Google Pixel 3, and wish to put my music from my PC onto my phone.\n\nI am connecting via USB to PC (and in connectivity options, choosing FILE TRANSFER), I go to transfer music and it says \"Cannot Copy......Device is has either stopped responding or is disconnected\", or it will start transferring, and halfway through the album transfer, \"error\" will come up and like half the album is there. Then when I go to delete the songs on there, another \"error - cannot delete\" prompt comes up.\n\nHelp!!!!",
