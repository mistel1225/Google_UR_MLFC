    "content": "Sorry to sound ignorant. I bought my Pixel 2XL direct from the Google store, so it came unlocked. I inserted a T-Mobile SIM card into it. Is it now locked to T-Mobile, or is it still technically an \"unlocked\" phone?  All my family are on the same T-mobile plan, so I don't have a SIM card from another provider that I can test it with....\n\nThanks!",
