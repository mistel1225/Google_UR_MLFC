    "content": "I shoot outdoor wildlife videos for which my Pixel 3 video capability is just right but ..... I need help with voice recording. \n\nThe in-phone mic is fine so long as there is no wind blowing but if even the lightest breeze is present then it destroys my voice recording. I have been using an external cabled mic which I've attached just inside my collar which does a decent job of shielding the wind noise but the problem there is that the mic cable isn't long enough to give me freedom with the camera ...... I basically have to stay close to the camera and I don't want that.\n\nI have purchased a cable extension but as soon as I use that, the Pixel 3 fails to recognise a \"USB Mic\" is connected so it appears that such extensions are not compatible (I'm already using the short USB-C to Jack adapter for the mic so maybe it doesn't like two \"extensions\").\n\nIf I had a jack connector - which obviously the Pixel 3 doesn't have - then I could try out what looks like an ideal solution which is the simple, non-cabled, multi-directional mic that simply plugs in and rides on the camera but there appears to be no USB-C version.\n\nMay have to settle for a clip-on mic that has a long cable (eg: 2 metres or more) but is there one out there ?\n\nAny help appreciated !",
