    "content": "I have a Bluetooth headset linked to phone, but when I plug in USB to Honda Odyssey 2020 and use Android auto, all sound is routed through car.  I need media to go to headset so people in the car can listen to radio and such, and I can listen to media apps on phone.  I set the setti he per screenshots.  Have tried disconnecting and reconnecting headset before and after connecting auto.  Nothing works.  Suggestions?",
