    "content": "About a month ago my 3.5mm audio headphones stopped working with my pixel 2xl.  I tried them on my work phone and they're fine so I assumed it was the adaptor.  Ordered a new one which I just received and still no audio.  My phone charges so the port is ok to my knowledge, but the issue seems to be with the phone.  I've tried cleaning, booting in safe mode, etc.  Nothing. Help.",
