    "content": "Hi everyone. I recently bought a used Pixel on backmarket. I set it up and used it for about a week, but the battery was not holding a charge, so I factory reset it and returned it. Then, some days later, I got a message from the seller that \"it is still attached to a google account\" and they need me to take my account off of it before they will refund me. So I went to my google account, saw that I was still signed into the phone, and signed out from it, not knowing what else to do since I had already factory reset it. But they replied saying it was still connected to an account. Part of the issue may be that on the day that I returned the phone, when I turned it on in the morning, it would not recognize my passcode and wouldn't let me into the phone. I tried several times, and I know that I was entering the correct code, but it kept saying, \"invalid passcode\" and would not let me in. So I factory reset the phone using the power/volume buttons. I recommended to the seller that they try again to factory reset it with the buttons now that the phone was signed out of my account. But they replied that they had tried that already and are still \"running into the issue where it asks for the last password or email that was entered in the device.\" Having signed out of the account and factory reset the phone, and given that my passcode would not open the phone even before I factory reset it, I'm not sure what else to tell them so I can get my refund. Anyone have any ideas? Thanks!",
