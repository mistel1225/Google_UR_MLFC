    "content": "Has anyone experienced issues with the hang-up sound (the two note ba-dum) playing randomly?  The sound actually plays twice in a row quickly.  The only big change I've done recently is upgrade to Android 11 and update a bunch of apps.  I've restarted the phone and it happened again after a couple minutes but I can't repeat this.  Software or app bug?  Virus?  Queue up Rockwell's \"Somebody's Watching Me\"  =)",
