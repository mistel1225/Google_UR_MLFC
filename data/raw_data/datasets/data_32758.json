    "content": "I have had this same issue with a 3 differentPixel 2 XL and now a Pixel 3 Xl. The device will randomly become locked. It will go to the bootloader and then the Android operating system is unreachable. I am forced to do a factory reset on the device and restore from backup. This happens completely at random, but never more than 2weeks go by without it happening. While I'm using my device and while I am not. I haven't rooted it I haven't downloaded anything shady. I would like my phone to be reliable but this issue really makes me question the entire Android ecosystem. Google has remote viewed my phones multiple times they have no idea what is going on. Each time they offer to give me a warranty replacement to get me to go away but they don't want to escalate the issue to see if it can be fixed. If it's a device issue then the quality control is horrible because 3 Pixel 2 XL  in a row were faulty and now a Pixel 3 XL so the chances of it being a hardware issue are silm. I am convinced that it has to be something about my account but I can't change accounts because then I was told I would loose my unlimited photos with google. Does anyone know what can be done about this ?",
