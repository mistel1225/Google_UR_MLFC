    "content": "I have an Exchange account whose calendar I want to sync with my phone. I added the account and then unchecked all the sync boxes except calendar. (I.e. I unchecked contacts and email.). Still, contacts and email continue to sync.  I've tried deleting the account, clearing storage for contacts and then adding the account again. This hasn't stopped the behavior.",
