    "content": "Hey! Can anyoneor got any advice?\n\nI like that my phone vibrates the first time I get a notification but if I don't clear the notification, the phone vibrates again a few hours later! Is there a way to have the phone buzz only when I get new notifications and not just reminding me of my old ones without clearing them?",
