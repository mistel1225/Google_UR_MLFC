    "content": "I don't like to have my front facing camera unblocked, it's very unsafe. On my Pixel 2 I put a webcam cover that slid open and worked great. On the Pixel 5 the same cover won't stick, it falls off. I've put duct tape, stickers, everything slides off the screen. Is there something that will adhere to the screen? Or is there some case or webcam cover that will stick and stay put? Crazy glue? Something? I would like to go back to being able to slide open a webcam cover.",
