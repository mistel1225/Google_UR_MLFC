    "content": "I really don't know the answer to the pixel question just asked. My sound works fine (I think) everywhere else on my phone Except when I play a QVC video clip. Then, the visual is perfect, but there is no sound. I have tried every selection I see  in Settings, but nothing produced sound. \nAny advice?   Thank-you!!",
