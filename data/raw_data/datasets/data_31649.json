    "content": "I have recently purchased Pixel 3 and copied the data over from my older LG Nexus. I have installed all the updated and logged in to all relevant apps and accounts. Everything seems to be working fine apart from the Google App screen to the left of the main Home that is empty.\n\nI have tried changing the settings, reinstalling the Google App, disabling/enabling the screen, syncing the account and all the relevant data to no avail. Google news seem to be working fine.\n\nDoes anyone have any idea what other things I could try to make it work? I have gotten used to having my news there and while this is a minor inconvenience I would like to and resolve it.\n\nThanks in advance to anyone taking the time to help!",
