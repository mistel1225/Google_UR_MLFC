    "content": "My phone restarted itself earlier today and now it won't stop restarting. \nIt makes it as far as getting to the google symbol that says 'powered by android' underneath, and then it restarts again.\nI've tried turning it off - it won't turn off.\nI've tried holding down the volume down button to load the bootloader menu, and I've selected every option that that gives me, but it makes no difference. \nWhatever I do, the phone just keeps restarting.\nI've tried all these things with it plugged into the charger, and without.\n\nI am completely out of ideas! And I can't take it to a store because everywhere is shut with covid 19.\n\nHELP!!!!",
