    "content": "I love call screening, but there are a couple of categories of spam calls that still get through, and overwhelmingly these are insurance scams and auto-warranty scams. I can see why these would both sound legitimate to an algorithm, so I'm hoping someone's figured out a way to add keywords to a list that will result in call screen automatically rejecting the call. Since a lot of these numbers are spoofs or local untraceable skype numbers, it's pointless to block these calls manually.",
