    "content": "When I put my Pixel 5 on the Pixel stand with display set to off (no lights or screensaver). As soon as it finishes charging, the digital clock appears and it's annoyingly bright. I don't even have a screensaver active and the last settings for the screen saver had a dim analogue clock, so it is deciding to show this for no clear reason.\n\nKeeps us awake due to the brightness, so really annoying. I have the same settings as for my old Pixel 4xl, so this looks like a Pixel 5 specific bug.\n\nAny suggestions?",
