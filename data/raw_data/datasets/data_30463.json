    "title": "\"Charging Rapidly\" now displayed for all chargers",
    "content": "I've noticed recently that whenever I plug in a charger my phone always displays \"Charging Rapidly.\"  I used to only get this message on a couple chargers, notably ones that were USB-C to USB-C.  The phone would display a basic \"Charging\" with my other chargers but these now also say charging rapidly.  I'm wondering if the definition of fast charging changed, or if there's some software glitch with the phone.  I've tried cleaning out the USB port.",
