    "content": "Ever since my Phone installed the new Security Update March 2021.... my Whatsapp constantly stops working. Whatsapp would kick out and display a ' whatsapp keeps stopping' pop up. Also I do not get notifications from Whatsapp anymore. \n\nI have uninstalled the app, reinstalled it clean without pre-existing data. Force stopped it, opened it. Problem still remains. \n\nFrustrating ! if anyone can shed light onto this matter, it would be grateful.",
