    "content": "In the past few weeks, my device just shuts down.  The battery can be near full, and there seems to be no consistent method to it shutting down.  I most frequently see it happen when I open Pokemon Go in the late afternoon, but I can have the game open for hours in the AM. I have noticed that most of the time the device is warm to hot, but that is not always the case.",
