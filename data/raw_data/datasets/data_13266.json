    "content": "I have a Pixel 4. I want to take a video in the 4:3 aspect ratio taking full advantage of the maximum area of the camera. In other words, when I take a photo, it is in 4:3. I have the option of changing the still image camera settings to 16:9, which cuts off the top and bottom of the picture.\n\nWith the video camera, it puts it in 16:9 and cuts off the top and the bottom automatically. I want to take videos using the full display field of the camera at the 4:3 resolution so I can see more in the vertical direction.\n\nI can do this with a third party app such as OpenCamera with no problem. Is it possible to do this with the built in Pixel camera app.",
