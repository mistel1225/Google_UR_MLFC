    "content": "My pixel 2xl crashed and half of the touchscreen stopped working. And I can't unlock my phone and make a backup or drop all the data on the cable because of this. I know the password for the phone, but I cannot enter. I want you to help unlock your pixel 2 xl remotely to transfer all data to a new phone.",
