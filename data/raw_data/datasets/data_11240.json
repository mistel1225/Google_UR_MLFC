    "content": "I spent nearly 2 hours on chat \"support\" with 5 agents to try and solve an unwanted alert issue when connecting the phone to my car. Each rep would take their sweet time responding to my replies. And then after 20 minutes they would pass me off to yet another clueless rep. \n\nThe final straw was the last rep who told me to test the changes made to the phone, I said I needed to go to my car to do so. He said \"No problem\". I came back 3 (THREE) minutes later, and he dropped the chat.\n\nI used to love Google but their customer service, especially for PAID goods and services, SUCKS! \n\nI get the same dismal useless \"support\" for YouTube TV.  I get their lack of support for the free stuff but when I spend hard-earned money I expect more than \"We covered every support scenario in our chat scripts and nothing else can possibly be wrong.\"\n\nSorry, but all the friendly banter does absolutely NO good when you cannot or worse, will not fix issues!\n\nI am so fed up with that sort of arrogance.",
