    "title": "Pixel 3 stuck on G logo loading page with a progress bar under when updating Android 10",
    "content": "I have tried a lot of times. Everytime, it just stuck on G logo loading page but with a progress bar. The progress bar was just rolling back and forth but not had the function to display the progress. The situation would maintain over 3 hours. I had to stop updating to protect my deceive.\n I've heard some people deal with this problem by resetting the phone. But I don't want to do this. Is there any other way to deal with it? \nThanks.",
