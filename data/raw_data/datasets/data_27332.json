    "content": "I've checked I'm running the opperating software update, turned NFC on and off, restarted the device, deleted and reinstalled the banking app and contacted my bank who investigated and said it is a known problem with the pixel 2xl and to contact google.  Have also checked Apps and notifications and Tap & Pay is not listed as an option. Tap and pay did work until about 2 weeks ago.",
