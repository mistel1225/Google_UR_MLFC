    "content": "Ever since the past update to my Pixel 5 it seems to be randomly disconnecting from my wireless network. It will show full bars and LTE but will have a small x on the bars. The issue seems to happen most often when I leave my home wifi network and I have to restart the phone each time in order to get it to connect again. I know a few others who seem to be having the same issue and are all on different networks so this doesn't seem to be tied to a specific network. I am on Freedom mobile and my friend who is having the same issue is on Telus. Any suggestions on how to fix the issue would be much appreciated.",
