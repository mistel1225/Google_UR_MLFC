    "title": "Sound search can't identify music that's playing from the phone (after recent updates)",
    "content": "After some recent updates the Sound Search homescreen widget (from the google application) can no longer identify a song that's playing from the phone, such as from a podcast or an internet radio station.It worked great until recently.\n\nNow when I press Sound Search the music pauses and the song can't be identified. The now playing feature never worked very well and can only identify a small fraction of the music that Sound Search can.\n\nIs there a setting somewhere to prevent the music audio from ducking or pausing when I hit Sound Search?",
