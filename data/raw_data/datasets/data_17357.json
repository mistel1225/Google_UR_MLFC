    "title": "\"My Devices\" in PlayStore - remove old phone (only 1 account)",
    "content": "I used to have a 2XL i would use with my current account. \nI no longer use that device and have it \"unlocked\" and in use with a different account. Both accounts are what Google refers to as \"Primary\" accounts. Non managed. I had upgraded to a 3XL in February, and ever since , when viewing \"Devices\" associated with my account, it's listed as have been used, but  *ONLY IN * Google.PlayStore. \n\nI want to remove it. It's not a device associated with my primary account any longer and I'd like to treat it as such. \n\nIf Google wants to retain a list of devices used some other way (browser, manifest file, cookie or someplace in chrome://about) then that's fine but as it sits presently, with the exception of the instance at Google.Playstore(not the mobile app, can't even find it there), it shouldn't be listed for all intensive purposes.",
