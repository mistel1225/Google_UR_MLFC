    "content": "After deconstructing my phone to replace the battery. My touch screen no longer works. It will turn on, but does not respond to any touch. While attempting to remove glue I cut a bit of the orange hardware underneath. I've since purchased a new screen + digitizer, installed it and the same issue occurs. Am I missing something, where is the touch screen portion of hardware located on phone.\n\nAny thoughts of what to try next.. Yes a professional would've been nice but the phone is 3 years old so I thought I would give it a go.",
