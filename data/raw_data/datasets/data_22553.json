    "content": "I want to set a custom notification for SMS, email etc.\n\nI've downloaded the sound I want, moved it to the notifications folder but when I try to chose the tone I don't see any option to select it, no file name, no option for \"My Sounds\" nothing. I've used the three dot's on the side to go into notifications and into advance, I've tapped on the \"incoming messages\" to open that option, still nothing.\n\nDoes the filename need to be set a specific way to be read by the OS, or do I need a particular file type or size? The one I want to use is a 54kb .mp3 file",
