    "content": "I've recently got a new iPhone and am trying to transfer the data on my pixel to it using the move to iOS app, and so far every time I've tried it hasn't worked. I've tried everything suggested online and nothing has solved the problem. I then went on an online chat with an apple advisor but they couldn't solve it and said I should ask the developers of my pixel. I can't find any support chats for the pixel, and I know most people on here won't be concerned about switching from Google to another phone, and that it would make more sense to go on Apple support forums. However I've looked everywhere and tried everything and have been at it for several hours for nothing so, has anyone got any suggestions?",
