    "content": "Last night, I had left my Pixel XL (1st gen) to charge and in the morning, I had a \"Data might be corrupt\" message. Once I dismissed the message, I could successfully boot the phone, but the phone behaved weirdly (sluggish and unresponsive, I could tap, but not type etc). In about 10 mins, the phone completely switched off and I haven't been able to restart since then. \n\nI've tried doing a factory reset as suggested in this forum earlier, but the phone doesn't respond at all. Any ideas on what I should be doing?",
