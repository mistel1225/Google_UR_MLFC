    "content": "I'm trying to create a playlist from my now playing history.  I do see a history of the songs I (and my pixel 3) heard recently. I am not able to select these songs for export to a playlist. When I tap the ðŸŽµ for the song in the now playing list, it doesn't turn into a check. Instead, the whole line is highlighted in gray temporarily, then unhighlighted.. then nothing.",
