    "title": "Pixel 4xl camera recording issue \"something went wrong...\" Or \"other app is using mic...\"",
    "content": "I am facing a very annoying issue with default camera app. When I start to record video within few seconds I get message saying \" Can't record audio, another app is using the mic.\"  And \"Something went wrong - part of this video may not be saved.\" Then the video fails. I can't record any video now. I recently opted for Android 11 beta and this started not sure related or not. I tried reinstalling app, clearing cache permission and all default troubleshooting but of no use. Desperately need help.",
