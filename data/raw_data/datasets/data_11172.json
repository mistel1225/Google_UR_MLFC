    "title": "How do you get google to actually send you a working phone? 2nd bad pixel 4a. Shuts off constantly",
    "content": "Pixel 4a shuts off when I lightly tap on the back. I've had it for one day. It has shut off 20+ times today. It's a refurbished phone to replace the brand new 4a I bought that needed a new board. Buggy phones. I can't get through the awful chats and emails to get a phone that actually works. They give me the run around for months. What's my recourse here?",
