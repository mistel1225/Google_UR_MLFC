    "content": "I have never had a lock set on my phone, but the lock screen displayed and I would just swipe up to unlock my device. I tried using my finger print but didn't like it. Now that I've switched back to not having a lock my lock screen won't display at all. When I push the button on the side of my phone to lock it it turns the screen black. When I push it again my home screen shows. No lock screen. How do I get it back?",
