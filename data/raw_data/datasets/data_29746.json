    "content": "Hello all, I have just got back from my anniversary holidays. I have lost several precious videos from our trip to Tenerife.\n\nWhile I'm taking videos, I get the error \"Something went wrong, part of last video may not have saved\"\n\nI then desperatley try to press the record button to stop recording, the phone freezes so I lock the device and unlock it.\n\nI then go into the Photos app to view the Videos and they appear black thumpnail with the time showing as 0:00 in the top right corner of the thumnail and I am unable to play the files.\n\nI moved the files to my Drive account and I am also unable to play using VLC player on my PC.\n\nI rung Google to report this and they do not have this error in their database and cannot help me recover my videos.  The phone is still under warranty and they wanted to send me a replacement but I have instead opted to esculate the problem!\n\nCan anyone recommend a video player that might help me view or recover these videos, I am desperate!",
