    "content": "My phone received update this morning and since then my sim is not getting detected\n1. I first reset the network\n2. Switched off, inserted sim again\n3. Did a factory reset\n4. Checked my sim with other device it is working\n\nI also checked other threads, downgrading doesn't seem like a good solution, please provide a proper solution to fix this.",
