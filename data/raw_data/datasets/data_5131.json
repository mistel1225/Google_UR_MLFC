    "content": "For no reason at all, whether in use or not, this happens ev few minutes, then not for hours, then frequently again. Techies have tried to find 'from what app' this might come from, we've eliminated games, notifications, nothing seems to affect or stop this. It's driving me crazy. I HV 139 apps left on phone. Everytime this happens, a small BLACK SCREEN shows up in middle of screen with words: LIVE CAPTION (MUSIC) - does that give us a clue?",
