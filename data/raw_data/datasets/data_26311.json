    "title": "Can Google Software Developer include options for RECORDING TIME LIMITS with Clips?",
    "content": "I was in a Q&A with some YouTube teachers a few years ago!  They were sharing infomation that the handycam makers split the clips of recording at around 20 minutes! They told us the reason was to bypass the film standards! And it had something to do with being taxed for a certain criteria & to avoid the film industry! So what I was wondering is if there could be time limit options baked in the software of the Google Pixel! SO the video would keep recording, but create clips between 2-10 minutes long for each clip!  Maybe even a custom options!   CUSTOM CLIPS!\n\nCould YOUTUBE LIVE STREAMING be done in clips, where the live stream generates a new clip and carries the existing audience to the new clip! With a CLIPS REFRESH or revolving clips?   IT would be like TWITTER for YouTube/Google LIVE streaming!  Here is a FUN BLUR WORD!  CLIPS!!!  The US MARINES, US ARMY, GRUNTS, LOW CRAWLERS, BABY HILL CLIMBERS, US INFANTry, will LOVE THIS!",
