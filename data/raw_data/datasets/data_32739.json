    "content": "Randomly today my Pixel 2 freezes when anything is touched. Apps aren't responding properly, however, I'm just hearing tones when I'm getting phone calls or texts. After freezing for a minute or two, it goes to a 'black screen' thats really a super pixelated screen of color and that holds anywhere from 2-5 minutes. I've tried hard reset and it's still happening. No new apps, downloads. What is this?",
