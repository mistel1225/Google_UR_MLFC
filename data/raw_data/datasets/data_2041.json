    "content": "The phone seems to give me options of completely silent or vibrate with sound, but not just vibrate. I have looked through all the settings and articles, and it won’t find it. I have tried going from individual apps, but the options are the same. I don’t want Do Not Disturb- I want to be disturbed, just not as annoyingly!",
