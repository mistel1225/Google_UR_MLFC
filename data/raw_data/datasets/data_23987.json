    "title": "Camera broken after December update",
    "content": "After a security update in December 2019, the main camera stopped working. When I start the Google Camera application, it closes. When using external applications, the front camera only works, the rear one gives the error \"Cannot connect to the camera.\" I updated the application, rolled back the update, reset the cache and wipe data of the Camera application, completely reset the phone - nothing helps, the camera crashes.\n\nI recorded a video: https://youtu.be/4Uo4awKrpWY\n\nI collected the logs using adb logcat: https://pastebin.com/Lxn9Y8JL\n\nThe phone did not drop, the camera broke itself",
