    "content": "Not sure how I'm doing it, but somehow I hit the combination that turns on the 'Shortcut to Prevent Ringing' feature and once it's been toggled on you cannot toggle it off. Not sure it's accurate to call it a toggle since it does not seem to work both ways.\nI don't know it's happened until suddenly I'm missing calls because the ringer is not working.\nThe first time I did it I was able to reset the phone and it came back as normal. But this time nothing seems to work.\nSo what's the trick here?",
