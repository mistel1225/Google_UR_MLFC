    "title": "Why is half of Facebook and FB messenger all white and unreadable?",
    "content": "I updated to android 10 without issue and haven't had any problems yet except for a major one with Facebook and Facebook messenger. After turning on dark mode throughout all supported apps Facebook and Facebook messenger are all white anywhere there is text from people. All messages are whited out completely all the comment lines below videos and pictures are white when the background of the screen is black where there isn't text. Uninstalling and reinstalling didn't do anything restarting phone didn't work and ive tried every possible setting that could potentially change it but nothing has changed. There was a working dark mode with Facebook and messenger before android 10 that worked fine but as soon as I turn on dark mode for all other apps it turns Facebook white and unreadable. ",
