    "content": "So far my old charger provided in the box for my pixel 2 had broke in 2018 so I had to stick with third party chargers now, my charger will take around 4 hours and not even full yet I swapped chargers wall adapters but nothing, the problem continues. When I plug it in while using it would not charge at all, the apps aren't even supposed to be draining the battery but when I continue to use it my pixel 2 reaches to 0% while charging and says it will take 3 hours but will obviously take much longer. I don't know what to do",
