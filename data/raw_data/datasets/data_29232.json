    "content": "When I first bought my phone I set spotify playlists as my alarm tone. It worked for the first couple of days but now when I try and choose a spotify song it does not play any sound even with all volume settings turned up. The alarm tone just reverts to the default google alarm sound. I have tried reinstalling spotify but this didn't help.",
