    "content": "On my previous pixel 2's camera, I can take multiple shots in quick succession,  all of which I can then immediately review with the instant review button and they then all appear in the Google photos app very quickly and I can also see them  all stored in the Google Files app. On my new 4a5G this does not happen, with only the last shot taken available in the review button, (but only after it has taken time to process with a processing  message near the bottom of the screen and a circle progress indicator,)  and only the last taken image appears in the photos app, but they can all be seen in the Files app. \n\nIs there a setting somewhere I can't find or is this a backward step and you now have to wait for each image to process before taking another to make sure it turns up in the photos app? I'm using medium resolution not full resolution.\n\nAny help on this would be appreciated.\n\nThanks\n\nTM",
