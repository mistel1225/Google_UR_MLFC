    "content": "When I launch two apps in split screen mode on my Pixel 4XL, I can move the dividing bar when my phone is in portrait orientation. If I change the screen orientation to landscape, I cannot move the divider from the middle position. When I try to move the divider to one side, it moves but as soon as I let go, it reverts to the middle position.\nHave others noticed this effect?\nThanks",
