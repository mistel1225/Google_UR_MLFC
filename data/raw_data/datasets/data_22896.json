    "content": "I currently have a problem where the Google Discover page is blank (currently on Android 10, 5 January 2020 security patch. Google version is 10.97.8.21.arm64). When I switched over to my secondary account, it works. The same problem occurs to my Nokia 4.2 (runs on Pie) which I factory reset and the page is still blank\n\n I did clear the cache of the Google app on both of the phones but it wouldn't work. Tried to request a callback under Tips & Support but it says that Call support unavailable.",
