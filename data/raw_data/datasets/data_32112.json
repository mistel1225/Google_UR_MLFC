    "content": "I pulled my phone out of my bag to use an app at a store and the screen is black. The phone was charged. I've tried several times to restart using the power and volume buttons. I've put the phone on the charger to see if that would help too. Nothing has worked. My alarms are working and even with it black screen I can still swipe to turn them off. This malfunction is extremely disappointing on a phone that is not even quite two years old. I hope there's something that can be done to resolve this problem and fast. TIA",
