Or in the case of the MBook, a connection is made briefly, but then drops off in 2-3 seconds. The speakers are showing  as connected devices on the 4a...but no sound is coming thru.\nHave tried all the suggested fixes as far as I'm able with what's a new and unfamiliar phone, but nothing's working. \nAn suggestions ?",
