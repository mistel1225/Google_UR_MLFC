    "content": "Since the recent software update for Android 11 my pixel 5 will only wirelessly charge when it is off. It charges perfectly fine while in the off state, but while on it stops charging and tells me to realign with the charging pad no matter what. I've tried taking off the case, and have tried changing out the charging pad, wire, and brick. This was never an issue before the update.",
