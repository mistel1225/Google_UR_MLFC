    "content": "My device can successfully receive app notifications, but I no longer receive account recovery or account verification notifications (\"Is this you? Match the number on the screen\", etc) types of messages. This worked perfectly on my Pixel 1, but since switching I have had to choose the option to receive a text message or email verification. Has anyone else had this issue and/or know of a fix? As a note, I've set up 2-factor authentication on my device as well.",
