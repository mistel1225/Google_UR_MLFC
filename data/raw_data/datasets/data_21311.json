    "title": "Fingerprint scanner issues after April 2020 update",
    "content": "My fingerprint scanner has developed an issue where it either will not recognize my fingerprint or will tell me the scanner is dirty. I have done the normal reboots without help. I was able to add the prints again and it's better, but far less reliable than before. This is a pixel 2xl. My other pixel 3 will not recognize any prints and says the sensor is dirty. It has been cleaned several times and nothing helps. I am unable to scan new prints due to the dirty sensor error. I would like to avoid factory resets if possible. Both phones developed these issues after April security update. Any assistance would be appreciated.",
