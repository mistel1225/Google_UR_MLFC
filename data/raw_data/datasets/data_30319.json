    "content": "My Pixel 3 will randomly shutdown when I'm using it. The device turns off and won't respond to any button presses until I plug it in.\nWhen I plug it in, the small white battery icon flashes in the middle of the screen for a split second and then the Pixel boots up to the white Google screen.\nI thought this might be due to \"overheating\" because many of the times it was pretty warm where I was at. The phone itself didn't feel like it was too hot in my opinion.\nIs there anywhere to see an error log that would help me discern why this is happening? Pretty peeved i spent $500 on this phone and it's having these issues not even a month after purchasing.",
