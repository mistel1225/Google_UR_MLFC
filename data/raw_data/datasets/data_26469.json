    "content": " After last security update I got this problem. After rebooting the phone gets stuck with black screen and only showing flashing time and battery status at the top. Only power button works. Hard reset doesn't help, I get to make all setups, but after locking the screen for the first time it gets back to same black screen. Please look at two videos below.\n\nAfter restart\nhttps://youtu.be/teDGbO69sRo\n\nAfter hard reset\nhttps://youtu.be/Q_ZypMZm_O8",
