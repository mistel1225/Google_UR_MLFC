    "content": " S. Jesuits Cross! Why can't I disable that \"ADD TO DICTIONARY\" billboard sign that often pops up right over my cursor while I'm typing? \nIt's incredibly disruptive.\n\nIt shows up & covers up my work when I click on an illegal compound word to add a space in my text, making it way more complicated to add that little space between the two words. Can't just ignore it. It usually causes me to forget a few lines I had begun planning in my head... AND It DOESN'T appear when I DO want to add a word. WTF? It seems as if they designed it to only pop up if there are two words stuck together, or when letters are needed on their inside of a word.  This forces you to click on it to dismiss before you can continue typing. Having to do that several times an hour is very annoying, How can I write while my KEYBOARD is shouting at me? yeah by the way the popup has bold all-capital words covering up more than one line. It's ridiculous.\n  Yes, I know I can disable auto-correct. That makes it go away, but I LIKE autocorrect! It is one of the best things Gboard has! I just hate the stupid \"ADD TO DICTIONARY\" popup.",
