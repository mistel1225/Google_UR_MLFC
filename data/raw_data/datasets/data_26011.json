    "content": "After 5 days of use, a vertical green line appeared on the left side of my Google PIxel 3a phone.\n\nIt appeared at 17h, and later, at 21h screen completely stopped working.\n\nBetween 17h and 21h, while I was using the phone, green line was changing width, disappearing and getting back periodically, and changing height depending on the content displayed on the screen.\n\nNo drops or physical damages occurred and phone was handled very gentle during these days.\n\nI tried factory reset. Didn't helped.\n\n\nAny help is appreciated. Thanks.",
