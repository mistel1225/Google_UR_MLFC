    "content": "Since I last posted here, the lag when opening Settings on both my XL 3 and XL 2 is now around 4 seconds.\nAlso, on both 'phones, when Settings eventually opens, if I tap the Search box at the top, Settings crashes.\nI've sent feedback on both 'phones. This is extremely irritating.\n\nNote: It is exactly the same after a restart and in Safe mode.",
