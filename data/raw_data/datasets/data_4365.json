    "content": "Twice in a row, wife's 4a has deleted her frequently-called shortcuts from her Contacts. She says she doesn't fiddle with the settings but...I shouldn't have said that. :-). Latest March update and all apps updated. She has continuous problems with this phone while mine performs flawlessly. I think some of it has to do with transitioning from our original Pixel XL 128s. Hers failed and I got her a Samsung Jv something or other as we knew that the 4a was on the horizon. I don't think all the XL's settings translated well to the 4a. Anyway...\nAnyone heard of this?\nThanks",
