    "content": "Whenever a call comes in the phone freezes and remains blank. It simply rings but there is no way to answer the call. I am not the only one with this issue as I saw many of the same in the play store. This has been going on for almost 2 weeks with no fix, no information given, no response to my feedbacks.",
