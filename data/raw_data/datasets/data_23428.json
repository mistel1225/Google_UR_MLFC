    "content": "Since the latest update my Pixel 4 keeps randomly freezing/crashing. I could be using apps like Google Maps or just swapping between screens/apps then it would randomly freeze/crash and reboot. I don't know why but it's so frequent now I'm having several reboots a day.\n\nAnyone else having this same issue? When is google going to release a fix for this?",
