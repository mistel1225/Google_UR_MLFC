    "content": "I had bought a pixel 4a in December 2020. And now suddenly the screen display has damaged. I'm pretty sure that it is not due to any fall or anything other. Some portions of the screen after touching is not responding. I had also tried resetting my phone to fix the problem, still, it is not performing well. Thus I would like you to recommend some places in India where I can replace the screen display. Also if there is any warranty period, please do inform me how to proceed with that.",
