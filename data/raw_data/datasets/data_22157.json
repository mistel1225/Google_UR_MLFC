    "content": "I already did a master reset and also a safe mode reset and the phone always gets extremely hot when I'm in a video call. I can barely touch the phone when it happens, and it starts overheating the minute I start the call. Is my phone broken? Do I need to file a warranty order? Anyone knows what to do?",
