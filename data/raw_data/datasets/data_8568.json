    "title": "3a XL with no sim receiving sms texts",
    "content": "Has anyone experienced this?\n\nI removed my sim card from my 3A and put in iPhone to determine if the \"no sim card, emergency calls only\" message issue might be the sim card going bad. Note: the sim card is several years old. \n\nI sent text message from the iPhone to another android. the other android replies come to the no sim 3A. So basically I'm texting another android from the iPhone and getting all replies on the 3A. I did verify that the 3A would not send SMS reply and as you would expect it will not.\n\nI've owned the 3A for over a year at which time moved the sim card from the iPhone to the 3A. it's only been in the last few weeks that the \"no sim card, emergency calls only\" message has started.",
