    "content": "Recently updated my Pixel 1 XL to Android 10. Now the device does not go past the \"G\" symbol. It always gets stuck there, unable to boot. I tried going into recovery mode but no success. It either gets stuck at \"G\" screen or get the flat android with error \"no command\". My phone is now bricked because of the Android 10 update and I can't even revert it back!",
