    "content": "Hi here,\n\nI believe more people are having an issue after the Android 10 update. My File Manager won't open at all anymore. I've deleted cache, as well as for the launcher, rebooted, still doesn't work. At first, I deleted apps that use the file manager to add pictures and such until I noticed I can't open any files in any app because File Manager keeps on crashing. I also heard after updating you might have to wait a while, but in this case, my update installed on December 5th, and it's now more than 2 weeks later.\nThe file manager isn't available to see in the store manager either and other than sending feedback I can't seem to do anything.\n\nIs there any way to get support from Google or to fix this problem? I work on my phone but unfortunately can't do anything now as I rely on my files and the apps that use the file manager.",
