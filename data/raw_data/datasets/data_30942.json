    "content": "My Pixel 2 keep crashing every time I tried to open the camera app and I noticed that it happens often during the battery is less than 30%, but also can happen randomly even though battery is more than 30%. I tried to reboot to safe mode and tried to troubleshoot to isolate problematic apps, but it didn't work and ultimately had done the factory reset, but the problem remains unsolved. Help!!",
