    "content": "I booked the pixel 4a the moment it got released. In just 1 month i observed a crackling noise in my videos. \nI had put this into google's notice few days back. Tried all the troubleshooting steps they asked me to. When nothing worked by chat they suggested two options. Either i should send the device to google and it may take minimum 7 days for me to get it back depends when they will receive it or i should go to my nearest ubreakifix stores which are the partners in this support program. \nI chose option 2 went straight to the store and asked them to diagnose. They said we can't do much about it and we have sent our report to google. \nI contacted google they said give it 24 to 48 hours they will get back. Out of anxiety i tried reaching out again after 24 hours. The support person suggested me to send them device and they will refurbish it. \nNow i am very annoyed, your service company told that phone is no good still you want to waste my time and effort to repair this broken phone. And if this was my mistake and phone has seen a few months of life i can understand, but a month old brand new phone gets most unique problem in the world and they are reluctant to replace it. How can you assume that i have spare phones kept in my home? \nThey sold me a broken phone and now they are getting away from replacing it easily. \n\nBasically this company has come upto cheap tactics of looting customer money. \nI was so desperate to buy pixel 5 but now i will never recommend anyone to buy google phones only because of their dirty customer service.",
