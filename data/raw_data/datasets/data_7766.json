    "title": "How can my PC see the existing photos in a folder in the Pixel 4A 5G",
    "content": "I just upgraded from a Samsung S7 to a Pixel 4A 5G. In the Samsung I could see the Camera storage as a folder in Win 10, just like any other folder and the photos were thumbnails of the photos, you could ID each photo by looking at it.\n\nThis is not the case with this Pixel, I cannot see individual thumbnails, just a generic artistic thumbnail with each jpg labeled separately, but no idea which is which. I want to leave some photos on my phone and know which ones to keep or delete by seeing them in the Camera folder as I have done for years with Samsung, and this Pixel will not allow me to do that. I often take a photo and then post it to a forum and being able to see the individual photos in the phone, on the PC, it what makes it easiest for me. \n\nit's impossible for me to remember each generic jpg's name, and if the only way of dealing with seeing the photos in the camera folder is going to involve using the cloud or some remote/3rd party way of visualizing the individual thumbnails, I need to know ASAP so I can return this phone while I can. I will hate to take my 15% restocking hit and go back to looking for a phone that works seamlessly for my needs. \n\nAny help will be appreciated & thanks.",
