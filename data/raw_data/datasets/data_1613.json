    "content": "I have a pixel 4a cell phone using Verizon service.\n\nAll of the email that I receive via my domain email account always goes into the gmail trash folder. I can't find a way to mark this as NOT trash so future email goes to into the inbox. Any suggestions?\n\nThanks for taking the time to read this. Your help is greatly appreciated.",
