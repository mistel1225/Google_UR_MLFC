    "content": "I cannot get my pixel 5 to consistently hold a Wi-Fi call or receive a Wi-Fi call.  I had T-Mobile put in a new SIM card and check all of my settings.  My emergency location is set but people tell me that my phone just goes straight to voicemail or doesn't receive calls and I can frequently not dial out on Wi-Fi calling.  I did not have this problem with my pixel 4 XL and I'm actually thinking about switching back to it unless I can resolve this issue on my pixel 5.",
