    "content": "My google pixel 3a is stuck on the boot screen with the google logo for hours now. This has happened for the third time in a short period now, and is getting very annoying. The problem has always been fixed by waiting till the device is discharged and then recharging it after a few hours, where the total process takes easily above 8 hours. I'm not willing to reboot or hard reset my device, since I have a lot of stuff I don't wanna lose. And by what I've seen a lot of people have faced this problem, what I'm frustrated is why hasn't google ever responded to any of this, with practical solutions unlike the good ol' hard reset.",
