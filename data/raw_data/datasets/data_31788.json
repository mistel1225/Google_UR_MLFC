    "title": "New Pixel 2 XL Volume issues",
    "content": "My new Pixel 2 XL (Had it for less than a day), even after a factory reset, will randomly turn the media volume all the way up, and will hold it there, immediately increasing the volume even after I turn it down. This keeps preventing me from even turning the screen off. No apps are installed, I've tried some troubleshooting (Switch access, dev mode) with no success. It doesn't occur in safe mode, however.",
