    "content": "When I unplug the phone at 92%, the battery meter jumps to 97% and when I unplug at 95%, it jumps to 100% and similarly, when I unplug at 88% it jumps to 93% (always a 5% increment). Strangely this behavior is replicable only above 80% charge. I once removed at 60% and it was at 60%. Anyone else having this issue and any idea if this is software or the real battery issue?\n\nAbove is copied from previous post but I have came across identical issues. And yes I tried safe mode. I wonder if it has something to do with the battery swelling issue and now I am worrying about whether it's safe to charge it overnight",
