    "content": "Right after the warranty expired on my Pixel 2, its rear camera malfunctions possibly due to condensation. But the thing is, I baby my phone; it has has never been damaged by water or exposed to much moisture. At this point, the pictures are extremely blurry to the point where the rear camera is practically useless. I am very disappointed with this issue and even more so with the fact that there's no warranty. \n\nDid anyone run into the same issue? If so how did you resolve it? Did you get help from Google?",
