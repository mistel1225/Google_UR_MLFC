    "content": "So recently my phone is showing some problems. My type c cable only works one way, tested another cable and it was the same. To plug a type c earplug is a nightmare, it rarely works. I'm constantly plugin and removing it hoping it will eventually work. I'm quite sure it's a physical thing but I have no idea how to solve.",
