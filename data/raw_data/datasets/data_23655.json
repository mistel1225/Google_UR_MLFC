    "content": "Any help would be appreciated as both Verizon and Google have told me over the phone it is a very difficult situation:\nPurchased Pixel 4 from carrier outright. Traveled overseas and 60 days later the device did not unlock. Apparently it was never activated under a phone line. Purchased prepaid plan on the phone to activate  while oversees in order for the phone to communicate with Verizon so it can be unlocked. I am now told that it needs to ping a Verizon tower or it will never be unlocked and need to ship phone back. Google is saying there is nothing they can do to unlock the phone which I find highly unlikely. Thank you all in advance.",
