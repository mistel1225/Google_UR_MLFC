    "content": "I used to think I loved Google and their products and now after dealing with your help center I do not think I will be buying another product. This is simply unacceptable. I was supposed to receive an email with a return slip to send my pixel 4A in for warranty. I have yet to receive anything. I cannot get a hold of anyone or talk to anyone about the issue. Instead I keep going from page to page trying to explain the issue so I can get help. Why is there not an option at the start to talk with someone? I cannot afford to not have a phone. I run my business out of it. I cannot afford to buy another one. I would just like to talk with someone to resolve this issue. For the love of God someone answer my call",
