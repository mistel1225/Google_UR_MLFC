    "title": "3 weeks and counting for my Pixel 3 RMA. How much longer do I have to wait!?!?",
    "content": "The pixel 3 I had developed a fault with the camera (as I turns out I am not alone and many others have too!) I went through every process to try and fix the problem, but nothing worked. I then decided that although it would be inconvenient to send it off and get a new one, it would be worth it to have a camera that actually works as that's mainly the reason I bought the phone. Now the google store is out of stock of Pixel 3s and I have been made empty promises that I will \"hear within the week\" about receiving a replacement device twice now, only for the week to pass and hear absolutely nothing from Google. Not even an email apologising for the delay. I am frustrated and having had my case \"escalated\" twice already now, I am still completely in the dark about getting a replacement device.",
