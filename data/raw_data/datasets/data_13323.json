    "content": "Hi everybody, my 4a's battery seems to die incredibly quickly, barely lasting form 9am to 7pm, despite very low use - nothing more than occasional browsing, a bit of spotify and whatsapp. I have turned on battery saver and adaptive battery, but it seems to make little difference. \n\n3 hours since full charge and it's already down at 69% (90 mins Spotify: 12% and 30 mins Chrome: 11% look like the big culprits). Similar usage on my previous handset (Huawei p30) would have only used 5% or so of battery life. Am I just expecting too much from battery performance or is there something faulty here? Any feedback would be massively appreciated!",
