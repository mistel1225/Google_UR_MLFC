    "content": "I was scrolling through Facebook feed when suddenly my phone froze and became unresponsive. Then the screen turned black. Battery was at about 50%. My phone is normal and for normal use (as in I'm not a developer who knows how to fiddle with android software things). I tried to power the phone back on, but nothing happened. Tried pressing power+volume up and power+volume down at same time for a minute each but nothing. Couldn't get to bootloader screen. I plugged my phone into PC to charge and the phone registered as \"Qualcomm HS-USB QDLoader 9008\" instead of my phone. When charging my phone through regular wall outlet, I think my phone got a bit warmer .. But phone will not turn on. \n\nAny chance at saving my phone?? I saw some people with same issue saying Ubreakifix is recommending new motherboard for this which is like >$250, but I haven't seen a comment with this issue recently like in the past 2 months. Just thought maybe there is an update on a new fix for this? \n\nSince my phone is almost 3 years old now, I guess I am only a bit devastated at the loss of my phone (since I replaced battery this year hoping to go for 5 years). But now I worry about the quality of the build for purchasing future Pixel phones ..\n\nPlease let me know if there are any updates to this problem! Still holding on to some hope.",
