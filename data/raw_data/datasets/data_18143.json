    "content": "Hi LONGTIME Apple user currently using a very low budget LG Android. I'm seriously considering a Pixel 4a but I'm kinda scared off by the statement about \"at least 3 yrs of support\" Has that been a thought to anyone? I would like to think I'm upgrading in 3 yrs time but realistically that may not happen. Any thoughts from you older Pixel users would be great. Thank you in advance!",
