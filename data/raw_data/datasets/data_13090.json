    "content": "I've been trying to get my Google Pixel 4a working with an external microphone (Mosotech). During my research I found out that it should work using the official Google dongle. So I used my dongle that came with my old Google Pixel 3. But unfortunately I still can't use my external mic in combination with the Pixel 4a even though it perfectly works with the Pixel 3. Does anybody know how to fix that problem?",
