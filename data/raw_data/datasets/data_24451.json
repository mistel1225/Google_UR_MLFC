    "content": "Randomly the camera won't open. It just crashes (It crashes more often than not). I have tried to clear the cache, restarting the phone, factory resetting the phone, update check and nothing works. Sometimes it will actually work after restarting the phone numerous times but only for a short time. Now the YouTube app won't load it's just a constant loading circle. Online research has shown this seems to be a problem with the Pixel 2 XL phone. Has anyone had any real luck getting it to work? Thanks for any insight you can provide.",
