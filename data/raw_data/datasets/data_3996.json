    "content": "My pixel phone's alarm somehow sets off my husband's Samsung phone when the alarm goes off in the morning. At the bottom of the alarm screen as it was going off it had a little symbol and said something but I cannot remember what it said exactly, it seemed like it was synching to nearby phones. I went into the settings to turn it off but I do not see anything in the settings about it. I tried setting an alarm a minute later to demonstrate and it didn't happen, but at that time my husband and I were both on our phones so maybe that's why. We checked that he didn't just have an alarm set for the same time and he did not. Also when I turn my alarm off, his also turned off. I am just worried that this could set my neighbor's alarm off too! Has anyone had this happen?",
