    "content": "Hi all, I have a pixel 2 and I'm wondering what happened to the grayscale button that was on Android when I was using the pixel 1. I had the pixel 1 (don't remember which android version, but it was right when \"digital well-being\" was introduced), and I loved keeping my phone in grayscale mode 24/7. Now with the pixel 2 (android 10) the only way I can enable grayscale is to use the bedtime mode function, but I don't want my display to be on a schedule, nor do I want \"do not disturb\" to turn on whenever I enable grayscale mode. Is there a way to do this, or has google unfortunately decided that this feature belongs in the bedtime mode function?",
