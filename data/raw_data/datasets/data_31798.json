    "title": "phone screen went blank - would not respond to anything including hard reset",
    "content": "Out of the blue whilst sat on my work desk i noticed the screen was completely off. This raised concern as it wasnt on power saver mode and had been charged that morning.\n\nIt did not respond to any of the remediations - recharge with orig cable/long press of power button. Completely unresponsive.\n\nI had arranged to take it to the phone shop, but i was about to go on holiday. Anyway i had a my old S8 to use.\n\nWhen I got back from holiday after a week it tried charging it and hey presto it worked again.\n\nThis phenomenon happened with a sony android tablet - the 'hard' reset would not work and you had to wait a week for it to discharge. \n\nNow, there might be a harder reset Im not aware of - otherwise it renders the phone unreliable if it has to be left for several days after a major crash.\n\nIs this a known problem? is there some way of fixing the phone so this wont happen again? Is there a harder reset?\n\nThanks\nAndy",
