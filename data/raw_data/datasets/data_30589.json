    "content": "Hi,\n\nI was super excited to get my hands on a Pixel 3A today.\nAdded my new sim card and fired it up. \nAdded my Wifi and password  and now it has been stuck on searching for updates for hours and hours. I have tried different Wifi's but honestly have no idea what else to do.\n\nDoes anyone have any idea? \n#suchabummer",
