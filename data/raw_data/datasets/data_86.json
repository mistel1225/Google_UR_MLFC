    "title": "Pixel 4XL wireless charging has stopped working after the March update.",
    "content": "I did the update this morning and both of my wireless chargers display on the phone\" Realign phone to charge wirelessly\" I have restarted but that is about all I can think of. I have a very thin case which I took off, no change. Both have worked fine since I bought them and the only thing that has changed is this update. I looked around but couldn't find anyone anywhere with the same problem.\n\nEDIT: Found this Reddit thread https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/lyr50v/anyone_elses_4xl_have_problems_with_wireless/",
