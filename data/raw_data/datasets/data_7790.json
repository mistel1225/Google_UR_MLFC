    "content": "Since late November, my phone's speakerphone has been extremely quiet. Even with the volume turned all the way up, I can barely hear them. Not only that, but the volume is super low on any app that uses the speakerphone (eg Facebook Messenger). Anyone else experience this? Any solutions?",
