    "title": "Disabling \"save selfie as previewed\" in camera app does nothing (want to disable selfie mirroring)",
    "content": "I need help to solve a very, very annoying problem. I wanted to take a selfie and noticed it saved the image mirrored, as in the text on my shirt was clearly backward as if I was looking at myself in the mirror. I do not want this. I want my image to appear as others see me, not mirrored. (In fact, I can't understand why anyone would actually prefer this, but that's beside the point)\n\nI went into the camera app settings and found \"\"Save selfie as previewed\" was already disabled, which I would expect would un-mirror my selfies, as I want. It does not! I tried setting it back and forth, and no change. No matter which way I change that setting, all of my selfies using the front camera are mirrored.\n\nI have tried restarting the phone, no change. I have tried toggling the setting and restarting the phone and toggling the setting back, no change. I have force-quit the camera app and opened it again, toggling the setting and force-quit the app between toggles, no change. Literally nothing will make this change. It's stuck in mirror selfie mode.\n\nI have a Pixel 4XL. I have a friend with the exact same phone model, he has the same problem. It's not my specific phone having the problem, I can say that with certainty now.\n\nDoes anyone have any suggestions for me to try? This is quite frustrating. I'm pretty sure this is a bug in the camera app, but that's just my best guess.\n\nThanks!",
