    "title": "Is Google going to address Pixel 3XL bending issue?",
    "content": "Mine bent about a year ago and I just happened to be about a month out of warranty. I found this thread https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/9371059?hl=en which confirms that this is a widespread issue, but all Google did is locked that post. This is not a cheap phone and to me it sounds like an issue worth a recall. There's a precedent of people successfully suing Google for the original pixel battery issue, shall we (the users) team up and push Google to replace our warped phones?",
