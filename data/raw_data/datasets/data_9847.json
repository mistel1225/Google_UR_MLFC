    "content": "I keep getting notifications saying \"3 viruses detected.\" It takes me to a page to download a app. I thought Android had its own security system to avoid getting viruses..I included a screenshot of what it says before it takes me to Google play to download the app. My phone is up to date. I checked that first. And I literally JUST updated maybe 3-4 hours before I entered a weird webpage by accident half asleep and started this whole thing.. is this something I should worry about or should I ignore it?",
