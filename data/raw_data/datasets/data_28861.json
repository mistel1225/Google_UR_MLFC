    "content": "Disclaimer: Currently my phone is operating with Android Q beta 6 but the problem also existed when it operated with Pie. \n\nI recently bought a segate portable hard drive of 1 TB. I reformatted it in my computer to NTFS and then I connected it to my phone with the USB A to usb C adapter I got when I bought the phone. The phone told me I need to format it to be able to use it. When I clicked the format button it was stuck on 20% for a while and then rebooted and then finished. After that I passed some thing to the hard drive and connected it to my phone and everything was fine, I was able to use it but since then Everytime I connect the hardrive I get a notification that it is being checked and then my phone suddenly powers off and powers on again stuck on the loading \"G\" of the Google logo untill I pull the hard drive off.",
