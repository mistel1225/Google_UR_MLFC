    "content": "I just got a new phone and I am letting my girlfriend use my old one, its a Pixel 2 XL. I didn't want to completely wipe the phone so I made her a second account on the phone. The only problem is whenever the phone restarts, my account is chosen by default and she has to sign into my account, and the go and select her account to sign into that. How can I change it so that her account is the one that is chosen when the phone starts?",
