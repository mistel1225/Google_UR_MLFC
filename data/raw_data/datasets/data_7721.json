    "content": "Hello all,\n\nI have a pixel 4a my wired android auto has been working flawlessly for a few months and then yesterday all of a sudden when I plug my phone in it starts rebooting immediately and stays in a cyclical rebooting phase until I unplug it. The head unit in my car is not even registering that the phone is plugged in. Everything on the car and phone is updated.\n\nYou guys have any ideas?\n\nThanks",
