    "content": "As far as I can tell, there is no way to clear the recently opened files from the Recents section in Google Drive on my Pixel. What's even more mind numbingly frustrating is that if I open Drive on my computer, I can successfully and easily clear recently open files. Now, what shows as recently opened in Drive's browser app is different from what I'm seeing in Drive's mobile app. I've noticed a lot of really weird issues like this with my new(er) Pixel and am really upset that Google can't seem to make a user-friendly phone. Anyways, it seems there is no way to remove recently opened files in the mobile app even if the files no longer even exist in your Drive. I think there should be a way to do this!",
