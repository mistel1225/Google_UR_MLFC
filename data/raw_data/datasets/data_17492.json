    "content": "My phone will beep and then crash when I receive a notification while using another app. This problem has happened when using several different apps as well as receiving the notification from several different apps. I have done a factory reset and through the guidance of Google support I cleared several different caches, but the problem persists. I have done lots of searches, but it doesn't appear that anyone else is having this issue or they haven't posted anything about it.",
