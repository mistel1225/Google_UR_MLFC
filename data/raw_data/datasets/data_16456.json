    "content": "I want to set my security system app to be able to interrupt Do Not Disturb and Bedtime Mode so that it can get alert while I'm asleep. I can't find anywhere to do allow you to select whatever app you want to interrupt these Modes. I've checked in the app's setting and in notification settings. Has anyone had success with this?",
