    "content": "This morning, I noticed that my Pixel 2 XL was charging much slower than usual. My deduction was right, when I locked the phone, on the bottom of the screen it says \"charging rapidly, 4 hours remaining\". 4 hours, that ain't right.\n\nThat's when I unplug my charger from the electric socket. \nNote: this is a new (used) charger I bought roughly a good few weeks ago, and they were in mint condition when they came in.\n\nI currently live in Indonesia so I have to use an adapter to use this charger (first picture).\nI noticed this rather apparent burnt marks on the tip of my charger's electrode (second picture). My guess it's the adapter not properly transmitting the current to my charger and onto my phone, thus the burnt electrodes.\n\nThey worked perfectly fine the first few days of having it, and I believe, continued to do so until this very morning. It's either the charger or the adapter, my guess is the latter. Although that is also rather baffling because this adapter came from a notable manufacturer company, Krisbow. \n\nI'm not looking forward to replacing my charger as it is still very new and costs a premium. \nAny suggestions on what I should do? Thank you.",
