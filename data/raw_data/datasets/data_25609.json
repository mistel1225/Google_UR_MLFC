    "content": "Can I trade my Google pixel 1 in for the 4XL if it is just a Google Pixel without one of those other company brand names?  I don't have a Samsung or an iPHONE! I have a GOOGLE PIXEL 1! The deal sounds pretty good tho, because my Pixel 1 is losing the battery while it is shut off!  However I will say, it will take me 1 month income from YouTube, plus another 1/4, one quarter, month to pay for the mobile computer, to make  the $299 payment!  \n\nOMG, if only car dealership actually gave consumers such a good deal, when trading in a car!  We paid $18,000 for a used Dodge Ram truck that was wrecked, totaled 2 weeks after my old may bought it around 2009!  The woman tboned him, but then her insurance would not total the truck, because they didn't want to pay $18,000 to pay off the loan!  SO we ended up with a wrecked hunk of junk that insurance spent $11,000 on to fix the truck, when it should have been totaled!  Even the guy fixing the truck said it should have been totaled, because he said he remembered working on the truck after it was originally wrecked! He gave us a lifetime guarantee on the paint! Then he went out of business! Now the paint has gone bad!  \n\nI no longer have my pictures because the local police department have my computer equipment for 18+ months and I am currently banned from Facebook, which had more pictures of the wrecked truck!  Just being people try to ignore/sanitize/redact/leave out/exclude/change history/delete websites/ and hide the facts doesn't mean it didn't happen!  ",
