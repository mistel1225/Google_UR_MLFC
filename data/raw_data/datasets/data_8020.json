    "content": "\"At A Glance\" weather widget CONSTANTLY randomly switches units between Celsius and Fahrenheit. My preferences everywhere are set to Fahrenheit, but I (multiple times a day) find it set to Celsius without any input from me. Help, this is so immensely frustrating. It happens on my Pixel 4 XL and my Pixel 2 XL, and it happens even after a factory reset AND even if I set up a phone from scratch (as opposed to restoring from a backup).",
