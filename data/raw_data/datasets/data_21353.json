    "content": "I get targeted ads based on things I talk about in calls or text messages on my Pixel. I know this claim is often dismissed-- but someone recently texted me and then called me to say they have a rare type of cancer, and an hour later I was seeing ads for products for that treating specific type of cancer. I didn't do any web searches related to this. I have microphone and SMS permissions turned off to all but Google apps. Does Google share your call or message data with advertisers?",
