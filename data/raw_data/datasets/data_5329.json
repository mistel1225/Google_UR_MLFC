    "content": "On Google Pixel 4a. I cannot for my life find the right place to ask so I'm just asking here.\n\nSometimes I can't find my phone, and I call out by saying \"Hey Google\" and locate it by the ding, but it can sometimes be pretty faint especially when it'a far away.\n\nI read that you can tell it to \"ring my phone\", so I tried it - and it prompts a screen unlock using keypin/fingerprint before it will ring, which doesn't make sense because I'd be in a situation where I CAN'T unlock my phone because I don't know where it is.\n\nHow do I bypass the screen unlock?",
