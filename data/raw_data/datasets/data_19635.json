    "content": "I have a Pixel 2 that's about 2 years old. Has been working fine until last night. Was taking lots of pix and texting them when at some point the screen froze. I was able to power it down but now I can't restart it. The screen is dark, no signs of life. When I connect it to a PC via USB, the PC makes a sound like it noticed an external device, but nothing more. When I went to a local repair store they told me that it's drawing about 1/2 of the normal current (around 0.5A instead of about 1A).\nMy photos and contacts are backed up on Google, but not regular SMS and MMS messages. Is there any way for me to recover them without damaging the phone? Verizon is sending me a free replacement but they will charge me $300 if I send them back a damaged phone. TIA!",
