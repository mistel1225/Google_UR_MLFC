    "content": "Please note I have been using my phone for two years now. Due to the extensive use, the battery is not lasting more and now I have to charge the phone twice a day even on normal usage. The problem is that I live in Qatar and could not find an authorized dealer here for Google. What options I have to replace the battery?",
