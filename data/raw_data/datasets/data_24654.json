    "content": "I've had my pixel 2 XL since Jan 2018, about 2 months ago I had to jiggle the charge cable to start charging, then eventually it would work normally again, yesterday however, I tried to start charging and the device completely shut off without charging starting, after a few repeats it turned off and started charging, this morning, when I got up, it was at 100%, I came downstairs and plugged in my headphones and the same shutdown problem occured as soon as they were insterted, if the device doesn't crash then there is a bunch of glitchy, loose connection sounds and then after about 90 seconds once again it crashes, I've tried multiple ways as well as safe mode and nothing has worked.",
