    "content": "Bedtime mode doesn't turn on DND mode and this causes all the apps to play any media to a volume though it applies grayscale and turns off AOD like before. This is very annoying for someone like me who has been using bedtime mode since it was launched. I dont remember it happening a month ago but I guess it started happening after this month's, January, Security Update. Please help if there is any solution to this problem and if there isn't I'd like to request the pixel team to fix it in the next update.",
