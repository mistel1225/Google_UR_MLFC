    "content": "Hey folks! My pixel 2 is running extremely slow, and it won't load apps or open menus. It was working fine last night - I woke up today and unplugged it, only to discover that it takes minutes to boot up. Once it reaches the lock screen where i enter my code - that's snappy and responsive, but once i enter my code, it takes another couple minutes to get to the home screen. \n\nOnce I'm there, I can see all my apps as normal. I can swipe left or right to get to other pages of app icons (again, runs smooth). But I can't seem to click on an app icon to load the app itself. Normally dragging your finger from the status bar at the top of the scree, down towards the bottom of the screen would drag open a set of phone options - wifi, bluetooth, batterysaver, etc. But that doesn't seem to be working either.\n\nat the top left hand corner of the phone, where there are small icons for notifications - texts, calls, etc - there is a small caution sign. It's an exclamation point in a triangle. As far as i can tell, that's new, but i can't drag the status bar down to see the notification.\n\ncouple questions: does anyone recognize this problem, and is it fixable? And if not, is there a way to recover files from the phone? The phone has over 850 voicenotes - that's where I store the music I've been writing for the past four years or so. It'd really break my heart to lose those. \n\nAppreciate any help! \n\nbest,\nMike",
