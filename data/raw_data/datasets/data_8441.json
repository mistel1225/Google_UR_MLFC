    "content": "I have to pay a hold charge of 1k to replace my pixel 3XL. How does that make any sense Google when the cost to buy a brand new phone is less than the cost to replace a 3 year old model? If I had known you would put a 1k hold on my credit card I would have said no and just bought a 5g or 4a. I was expecting $375 a best which is the current price for a refurbished Pixel 3 XL on your own website.",
