    "content": "Screen attention is turned on, and it works. EXCEPT when I'm on Instagram, it does not work and my screen will time out and turn off while I'm looking at it. This only happens in the feed view when a video is playing and when it is over it goes to the next image or video, depending on what's next on the feed  then the screen goes dark and turns off.",
