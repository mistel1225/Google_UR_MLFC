    "title": "Overheating even in battery saver mode",
    "content": "I've had this phone replaced once already. The first time my battery drained like crazy even on battery saver mode. I could only keep a full charge for a couple hours. Eventually it crashed on me in about 2 months and Verizon sent a replacement. Now it's been 3 weeks and it's beginning to over heat again. I don't use any random made apps, mainly just Twitter, Snapchat, Facebook, sometimes Instagram and Marco Polo. Gmail. Google Photos, camera. Easy stuff. A couple restaurant apps here and there. I don't feel like that's too much. I thought switching from iPhone would help me but I'm majorly regretting ever giving a Google phone a chance.",
