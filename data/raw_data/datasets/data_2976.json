    "content": "My Pixel 5 doesn't show caller ID's when receiving calls - it just shows a floating call icon on the bottom of the screen, even the caller's number is not shown.\n\nI switched to the Pixel 5 from a Galaxy 10 Lite a couple of moths ago but before that I was on the Pixel 2 XL. My contacts have always been synced with my google account and while on the Galaxy I used the stock contacts app, not the Samsung one. So I assume this should not be an issue, especially since I didn't have such issues on the Pixel 2 XL nor on the Galaxy.\n\nI have a Garmin smart watch connected and it shows only the caller's number.\n\nLater in the call log, doesn't matter if I answered the call or missed it, it shows the caller ID (if I have them saved in my contacts obviously).\n\nNot sure what to do about this, it super inconvenient.",
