    "title": "Pixel 1 freezing on boot and boot looping",
    "content": "My Pixel has been stuck in a boot loop for the past 36 hours. It suddenly froze up while I was listening to music and was constantly vibrating, then it shut down and rebooted. This is when it started to freeze on boot and then reboot. This was a major issue so as soon as I got home, I tried again and again to boot it and back up all my needed files. I managed to do this and then decided it would be best to factory reset it. Unfortunately, it still is freezing on boot and rebooting. It will try this about 5 times before showing a black screen where you can't turn it on/off unless you open the repair menu (using power and down volume).\n\nDoes anyone know of any fixes to this as I need my phone fixed asap and everything being suggested isn't working.",
