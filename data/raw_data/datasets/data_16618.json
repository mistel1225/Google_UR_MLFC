    "content": "My Google Pixel 2XL will not turn on. I've tried holding the ON button down several times, holding the ON button and volume down button at the same time, plugged it into my computer, and made sure my charger is still working, but still nothing. My phone's screen stays black and has not turned back on once since i tried all these things. What else can i do? or is my phone just done/dead?",
