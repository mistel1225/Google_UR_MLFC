    "content": "The glass on the back of my pixel 4 is peeling off and I'm struggling to find a support contact for assistance.  It seems like the \"help pages\" have been designed to frustrate customers in a circular loop of links that never get to a number, email or online webchat support service.\n\nI'm hoping someone has managed to find an online webchat service that they can share?\n\nThanks in advance.\n\nLee (from New Zealand)",
