    "content": "Hi, so recently my pixel 3 started to lose battery really fast. Like, when i charge it before i go sleep, its fully charged, i even turn on battery saver and after like 6 hours of sleep i have like 55% . I tryed many solutions even factory reset. Yesterday i tryed to drain my battery fully to 0% and leave it to charge turned off to 100% but nothing changed. But my phone stayed at 1% of battery really long, so i think it may be some software issue. I dont have any apps that would drain it, or at least it does not show in the settings.\nThank you for help",
