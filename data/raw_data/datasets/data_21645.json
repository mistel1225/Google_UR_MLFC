    "content": "Firstly i want to say it's a off topic. \nI am from the country name Bangladesh. Recently i am using a Samsung Galaxy A5(2017) phone. I am writing with this phone. But it is too much painful. The touch & display of this phone gone really poor. It is to hard for maintaining these quarentine days without a good phone. Some parts of my phone allready damaged. I have not tasted any GOOGLE phone yet. I dreamed about google pixel 4xl. But there is no store of google in our region. Some unofficial phones are available here. But too much costly. As a student i have not that much money. Otherside, the situation of Bangladesh is going down for the pandemic. \nSo, i request to the google company. Can u please send me a google pixel 4xl as a love/gift in Bangladesh. It will be really helpful for me. \nMy gmail address is anikdass2016210175@gmail.com \nIf you can then please, let me know..\nThank You.\nStay home,\nStay safe.",
