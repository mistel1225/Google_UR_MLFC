    "title": "Pixel 3a front camera isue",
    "content": "When I try to flip to the front camera, the camera app says \"something go wrong\", I restarted in safe mode, I used factory reset. Also updated all apps and used \"scan hardware\" kinda apps, and it doesn't recognize front camera. So after try it all, I bought a new camera part, then I asked a specialist to change it for me, I changed but the trouble remains. This phone was brought in french last year and should be working properly... Currently I'm in brazil, I'm fan of pixels but I'm deeply sad about this issue ad the lack of information about how to solve it.",
