    "title": "How do I transfer my data from Google to my Pixel 2XL?",
    "content": "My Pixel 2XL recently got stolen, I've been unable to locate it as it has been switched off and as a result, I've repurchased the same phone. I'm having trouble trying to figure out how to get the data I had on my old phone (pictures, notes, apps, etc, which I have access to online) on to my new device as I don't have my old one. I thought it would be possible to do so through Cloud when I was setting up my new phone but a message appeared that basically suggested there was nothing backed up to transfer onto my new phone, but as I said I can see and have access to everything that was on my old device via my google account. \n\nCan anyone make sense of what I've just described and help me? I'm not particularly tech savvy so I apologise in advance for the confusing paragraph above, in short, I'd just like to find a way to transfer the info I had on my old device on to my new one without the presence of the former.",
