    "content": "So when you are on a call ..when you switch to speakerphone. They are not able to hear me but I can hear them. Also with video calls like duo or calls on Snapchat are not working. \nBut when you record video like on snap or on the actual camera app. The microphone works perfectly. Even with the recorder app.  Anyone else having issues like this??",
