    "content": "    Pixel 3a delivered yesterday, I set up the phone and the PIN worked fine. Today I setup fingerprint, phone worked fine, restarted phone, now the PIN doesn't work.\n    This is a known issue \"bug\" according to the community, is Google support working on a fix or should I just return the phone.\n   I'm NOT going to \"FACTORY RESET\" every time I restart. Is this an issue with ALL Pixel phones?\n\nThanks in advance to those who respond.....Jeff",
