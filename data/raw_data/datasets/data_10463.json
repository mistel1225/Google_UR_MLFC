    "content": "Hi all,\n\nI went to bed last night and set my phone on the nightstand to charge -- it was working fine then. Woke up this morning, alarm is going off (because I set it the night before lol), and the screen won't response to touch. There is a lock symbol at the top of the screen, and at the bottom of the screen it states \"unlock for all features and data.\"\n\nThe phone has worked fine for months, so no idea what occurred.\n\nThanks in advance for any help!\n\nNote: I'm also unable to restart the phone. The screen doesn't respond to touch at all. I can get \"power off\" and \"restart\" to appear by holding the power button, but I'm unable to select them.\n\n-Cody\n\nUpdate: I figured out the restart trick lol... (hold down the power button for ~30 seconds). It seems to be working now. Still, I'd like to know what causes this! There was a couple other times the screen didn't want to respond.\n\n2nd update: Annnd it's not working again. Tried restarting it a few times to no avail.",
