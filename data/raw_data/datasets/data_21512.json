    "content": "Hey guys, I bought a brand new Pixel 3 from a private seller recently and I've been having screen issues where the whites would become blue on the side of the screen. I was asking because I'm not sure about Google's return policy on this and how this would be treated. I also changed the display colours but none of them were different. Has anyone else had this issue?",
