    "content": "Hello, \n\n4 months ago I got a Pixel 3a. The recently the screen began to flicker / act weird when 10 PM came around. I'm not sure if this was the night light or something else. But it would only happen for a split second then resume working normally...sometimes the screen would still look weird but it was readable.\n\nLast night I was outside listening to Spotify on my Pixel 3a. All of a sudden the screen wacked out similar to before except it didn't go back to normal! So now the \"Always Display\" looks normal in black/white, when I turn the phone screen on, I can BARELY see stuff on the screen. It's BRIGHT WHITE, I can barely make out whats on the screen, usually you can't see at all. When I restart the phone by holding power, I can just barely see the Google/Welcome logo pop up.\n\nI was able to just barely navigate to the Display Settings section, but I literally cannot make out ANYTHING on this page when I click it. It's just too white. So some stuff I can just barely see, and others I cannot see at all.\n\nAt one point I tilted my phone and tried turning the screen on and it worked normally! for 1 split second, then reverted back to the super bright screen.\n\nI've NEVER dropped my phone. It's been in the case since day 1 with my on-screen protector. \n\nHow do I fix this? What phone number do I call for Canada support? Everywhere I click on the pixel 3 support page I'm sent in a loop. \"Contact Us\" links just loop me to pages with basic info and I can't speak to anybody! No phone numbers are listed anywhere. \n\nPlease help.",
