    "title": "My Google Pixel 2 is in Factory Reset Protection mode, I've exhausted all my steps to recover it.",
    "content": "First and foremost, the Pixel 2 is definitely mine, I still have receipt on my google account.\n\nWhen I stopped using my Pixel 2 and got a new phone, I factory reset it, and somewhere down the line, I created a brand new account on it but never inserted a sim into the phone.\n\nAnd now, a year later, I've offered to give my Pixel 2 to a family member as I'm only using it as a paperweight. But now, I can't remember the pin nor account I was using on the phone which prompted me to reset the phone on recovery mode (simultaneously pressing volume and power button).\n\nThat proved to be a mistake as the phone is factory reset protected and still asks for the pin or google account information that was on the phone prior to my resetting.\n I've exhausted Google's customer online chat support steps, they were unable to resolve the issue.\n\nThere isn't any way to bypass FRP, or take it/send it in to a google store to be restored? I can't believe this phone would be irretrievable?",
