    "title": "Volume Changes on Unlock",
    "content": "I have a lot of issues with my volume level changing itself. For instance, when my phone connects to my vehicle automatically (without unlocking the screen), the bluetooth volume let is set to 30%. I then use the hardware buttons (w/o unlocking) to turn the volume up to 100% so I can actually hear my audio book. However, as soon as I unlock the screen (fingerprint touch), the volume returns to 30% and I have to turn it up again. It's almost like the setting just didn't save? This will also happen if I disconnect and reconnect my bluetooth device. The volume does not revert to my last change. This issue is not online or in the forums anywhere but it is really starting to change my opinion of my phone. Any suggestions or help? I have tried restarting the phone, updating, and all of that stuff.",
