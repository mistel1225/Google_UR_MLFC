    "content": "The past week I have noticed a volume issue on my Bluetooth devices. I have wireless headphones, a speaker, and car stereo. I have had this phone for 18 months with no sound issues. Now every time I connect to one of these devices, the volume jumps way up to max. It is painful! I turn the volume down and then 10-15 seconds later it turns down again. I assume it's adjusting back to the original setting. So then I turn it up and it doesn't change again. I didn't change anything settings that I'm aware of. I have not tried a factory reset. Would like to know if anyone has suggestions or experienced this issue. Thank you",
