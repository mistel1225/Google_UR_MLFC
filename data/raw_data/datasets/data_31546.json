    "content": "I have a Garmin vivomove HR that I just purchased and I cannot get it to pair to my Pixel 3. I followed the instructions that came with the book, tried that multiple times and that didn't work. I then tried these instructors found here a few times https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/8msost/bluetooth_fix_pixel_2_garmin/, and it still doesn't work. I am getting very frustrated with this and beginning to regret Pixel 3 purchase because of other issues I have as well as this.",
