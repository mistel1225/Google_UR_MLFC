    "title": "Pixel 3XL sending duplicate messages from stock messaging app.",
    "content": "When I send messages the messages are continuously \"sending\" and the recipient receives multiple messages until I delete the message and shutdown my phone. It even occurred when entering a competition and cost me several entries. I'm in the UK, latest version of Android and it is not my carrier. Looks like the issue was raised before and locked down so felt like it needed raised again.",
