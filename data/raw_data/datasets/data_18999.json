    "title": "screen keeps dimming. some how the phone keeps setting the display to 4% brightness while locked",
    "content": "phone is locked. in my pocket, the phone some how changes the display brightness to 4%, which makes it impossible to read and re set to a brightness that is viewable. i have tested with adaptive brightness on and off. it does not happen every time. but it happens while hiking. then I can no longer use my navigation software, as I cannot read the screen. I have to find shade and try to reset the screen to a higher brightness, which is very difficult to do.",
