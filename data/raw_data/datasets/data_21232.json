    "content": "My phone's battery died yesterday so I put it on charge. When I put it on charge, I tried to turn it on as I had to access something however it wasn't turning on (something that's happened quite a few times now.) So I have become used to rebooting it by pressing the volume down button and the power button to get it to start again. I pressed the 'start' button when the options came up after rebooting. I did this and it did turn on but with a default wallpaper and limited features e.g I can't get the multiview of my apps anymore or I used to have a lot of options in the bar where my wifi, bluetooth and everything exist on my home page but now it's only limited to one line. I also don't get notifications from any of my apps and have to open the app to view them. All of my data is on my phone though, I haven't lost anything. I'm just wondering how I can get it back to the original state with all the features working. \n\nThanks.",
