    "content": "Updated as above, it says phone not allowed for voice. Network is in U.K. With BT (used to be EE).\nTried another bt sim and still no calls possible. The old sim works ok in another phone. \nFactory reset the phone still the same. \nIn mobile network settings, it shows as BT.\nIn about phone looking in sim status network and phone number are unknown, mobile state is disconnected.\nHad a google chat, they checked various things and have offered me to exchange the phone FOC.\nBut it worked fine before update so surely is a software problem???\nAny help appreciated. Thanks",
