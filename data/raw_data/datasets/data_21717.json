    "content": "My Pixel 3 (running latest v10 update) just automatically performed  factory reset !!! It was in my pocket and when I got it in hand, it was already rebooting. But the real problem is that it refuses to connect to my google acccount and an unknown padlock icon is showing in the upper left (where the mobile carrier should be showing). I can't receive any SMS... Tried to switch the SIM (Motorola with earlier version) and the phone will display a \"secure mode\" and I don't find a way to the SIM. Any clue what happen and how I can get around this ?",
