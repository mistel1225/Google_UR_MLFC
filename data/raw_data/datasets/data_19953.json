    "title": "Not able to shoot video in dark, LED flash goes OFF in less than a minute",
    "content": "While I am shooting video in the dark with my Pixel 3a, the LED flash is turned on. During shooting video, after say 15-30 seconds the LED Flash is automatically OFF and I get an error message \"Device is too hot. Flash has been turned off\". Please find attached screenshot of the same.\nI have tried multiple ways to diagnose the issue like using the latest camera app, using the factory version of camera app, clearing the cache, Booting into safe mode but issue is not solved.\nI am so disappointed to know that a phone like google Pixel can't shoot video in the dark. \nI am little curious if this issue is specific to my device or all Pixel 3a devices have the same problem. Did any user faced  similar issue with pixel 3a and is there any possible solution.",
