    "content": "I have a Pixel 3 XL. I have Visible as my provider (they are Verizon's prepaid arm) I use the Messages app for text messages.\n\nI have been seeing a weird problem with group texts. I randomly don't get some of the text messages. I will get a text from Person B responding to a text from Person A but will never get the original message from Person A. Leads to very awkward situations where people think Im being rude by not responding.\n\nI am not sure what the problem is. But the pattern that I have noticed that the missing messages are usually from people with iPhones\n\nAnyone else run into something like this?",
