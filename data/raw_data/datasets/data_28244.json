    "content": "Since upgrading to Android 10, my Pixel3's audio system is basically \"dying' after listening to Spotify for a few minutes. Audio controls become \"greyed\" out, cannot change volume, mute, etc. Audio is gone for everything, not just Spotify. The only solution is to reboot the phone.",
