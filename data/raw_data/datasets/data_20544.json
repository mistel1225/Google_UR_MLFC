    "content": "Trying to hold down the power button and volume down button to take a screenshot is really difficult for me on my 3a XL. I have small hands and I can't do it one handed. I know I can hold down the power button and then tap screenshot, or ask Assistant to do it, but I don't want to go through the extra step. On my Samsung, taking screenshots was so easy, I would do it accidentally, and I really miss that ease!\n\nI'd like to be able to change which buttons I hold in order to take a screenshot, and shorten the delay before it actually takes. I need to find something more comfortable for me. I'd love it if I could take a screenshot by squeezing the bottom, rather than activating Google Assistant, since I use screenshots more often. \n\nTL;dr: the current screenshot buttons are uncomfortable for me, how do I change them?",
