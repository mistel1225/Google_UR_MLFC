    "title": "Using Hotspot with an ESIM not working",
    "content": "I recently bought a PIXEL 3A  (Android 10) .   Everything works fine and Hotspot works when I am using the physical SIM from my telco.\n\nI tried an ESIM from GIGSKY which worked well and gave me connectivity.    \n\nProblem was when I turned on Hotspot with ESIM connection.    It connected then dropped with 'network unavailable try again later'.   The test was done in Canada so I am assuming GIGSKY get their network service from a Canadian telco like TELUS.\n\nGIGSKY claim this is a known fault with Android 10 ....no resolution\n\nCan anyone confirm that Hotspot with ESIM connections will not work ?\n\ncheers",
