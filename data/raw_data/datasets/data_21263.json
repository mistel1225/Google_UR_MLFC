    "title": "Audio issues with Phone Speakers as well as on Bluetooth , Audio feel boosted on my Pixel 3XL",
    "content": "The audio output is very boosted on my 3XL , the audio feels too loud to be pleasant , i tried everything i did a factory reset , used the phone in safe mode but the problem is still there . The audio feels very treble & bass boosted in 3XL after April 2020 update , my old Pixel 2XL still delivers better audio output on Bluetooth as well as with inbuilt speakers . I'm afraid that if this problem continues i might end up damaging my speakers as 3XL is my primary device .\n\nDear Google please fix it.",
