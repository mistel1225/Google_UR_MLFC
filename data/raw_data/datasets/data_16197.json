    "content": "Turned on my phone and got solid white Google screen. Somehow got to a black background screen with yellow, orange and green writing. In my hurry to restore the phone, I may have clicked on \"This Cannot Be Undone\" - I really didn't know what I was clicking on. Now I appear to be back to initial phone set up i.e. transferring contacts from my old phone, etc.       Is there a way to restore the phone to its old self? If now, where do I go for help?  It was purchased at Best Buy.",
