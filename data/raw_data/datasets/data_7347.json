    "content": "Is there a way to increase the camera resolution on my Pixel 3a? When I take a photo they are only 72dpi, which is pretty feeble. The online tutorials I've consulted show a 'More' button on the camera app, but on mine it says 'Modes' instead. When I go to Settings via the pulldown and then select Camera photo resolution there are only the options 'Full', which I already have selected, and 'Medium', which I presume must be lower than 72dpi.",
