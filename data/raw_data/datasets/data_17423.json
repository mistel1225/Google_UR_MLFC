    "content": "I have been having charging issues since March 2020 and have requested the customer care for assistance, but in June 2020 I submitted my device to authorized dealer B2X (Google authorized service) and it took one and half months to diagnose the issue, and I received it on August 19, 2020. It was shocking to me cause it was again taking 3 and 1/2 hours from 0 to 100 Percent. Again I raised the issue to concern persons but still now I didn't receive any help from anyone. Please help me by resolving the issue. Even I performed all the safety mode settings said by google",
