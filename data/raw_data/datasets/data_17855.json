    "content": "I have a Pixel 3XL. The power and volume buttons stopped working around 2 weeks ago. I still managed to use it. However, the battery has drain and I can't seem to be able to turn it on again. I charged it fully but it won't turn on automatically.\nIs there a way to turn it on without the need to use the power and/or volume buttons?\n\nThanks",
