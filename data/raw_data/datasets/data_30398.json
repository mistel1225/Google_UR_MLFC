    "content": "Great Google product fan for many years. bought Pixel when it just showed up in the market. Kept it in a great condition.  This phone served well until 4 weeks ago. It started to rebooting every 30 seconds. I save tons of important pics and files in the phone, suddenly none of them can be save. went to ubreakifix in San Jose and identified it's the known motherboard issue. They asked for $300+ if you want to replace it and Google is not pay for it. I am so frustrated and disappointed. Why such a loyal customer should pay for the issue which is caused by the design/manufacture? communicated with Google service via phone. received none of help but cold response. Google agent asked me to forget this one and buy a new one. such a non-responsible company.  Yes, I will buy a new one, but it will be iphone/Samsung, Never ever any G-products. I know I am just normal customer, Google will never care such things. they made mistake, customer paid for it and force them move on. But I definitely share my painful experience to all my close friends. hope them will learn from me and stay away from company like this. RIP Pixel.....",
