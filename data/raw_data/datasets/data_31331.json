    "content": "Hi, I just got a Pixel 3 and experiencing this issue that while I'm listening to Spotify or my podcast application and I try to dictate for example a text message or an email using the Google voice typing, the audio from Spotify or podcast does not automatically pause as it had on previous android phones. \n\nIt's really distracting when i'm trying to dictate and have to talk over the audio, which also sometimes gets picked up by the voice typing.\n\nI don't know if there's a setting that's not checked, but i've been looking and can't find one.\n\nAny help would be appreciated.\n\nThanks",
