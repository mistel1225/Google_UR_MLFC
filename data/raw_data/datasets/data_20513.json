    "content": "This is not a Pixel phone related issue, but I've not been able to get the Emoji Mini's. I saw a forum explaining you needed to clear your storage. But even that didn't work for me. Helpful fact: my main keyboard is Gboard unlike other Android devices where you can download Gboard as an extension. I'm not able to delete Gboard and that may be one of the reasons.",
