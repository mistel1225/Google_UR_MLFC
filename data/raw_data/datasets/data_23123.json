    "content": "The Upcoming Alarm notification on my phone used to pop up 1 hour in advance of the alarm, but since the most recent update it now comes 2 hours in advance. I frequently found the 1-hour notice to be useful so I could silence the alarm in advance depending on the situation I was going into, but 2 hours is too far in advance to feel connected to the pending alarm. Is there any way to change this setting back to 1 hour in advance, or do I have to turn the notification off completely?",
