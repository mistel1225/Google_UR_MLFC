    "content": "The recent Android 11 update has changed the interface on my phone, and there's nothing about it I like. It's changed the way my notifications show up, and there's are details from said notifications that I liked and very much preferred that are gone now. Not to mention, the way I access my recent/open apps has become more complicated than it needs to be, with a search bar and app shortcuts at the bottom that I will never use. \nI already have an app that's meant to modify the display, but it can't return everything to normal. I'm not necessarily looking to undo the whole update, I just want the old interface back.",
