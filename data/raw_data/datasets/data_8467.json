    "content": "Hello,\nI have noticed a very wierd issue in Pixel 5 camera.\nWhen you are trying to click a photo at night and if there are Christmas light strings or collection of lights in front then the camera is showing wierd reflection of those lights in the picture. You will have many small light dots in the picture.\nI cleaned the camera well before using it so it is not due to dirt.\n\nIs there any solution to this issue.\n\nRegards,\nVatsal",
