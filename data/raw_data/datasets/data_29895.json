    "content": "So I'm a new pixel user. Switched from iphone. I know there's been posts about this before, but nothing specifically with what's happening to me and nothing helped so far.\n\nBasically, I just got the pixel and google photos automatically put all the photos I already had in storage in Google Photos onto my phone. But I don't want them on my phone. That's why I put them in google photos in the first place. But now that I have the pixel they're all on my phone.\n\nI tried deleting the albums. Learned the hard way that doesn't work- even though I checked before deleting all the albums, google was slow to update and turns out deleting them from my phone does indeed, eventually, delete the albums from google photos online. So now I just have a bunch of unsorted photos on google photos. And if I put them back into albums, they go back onto my phone.\n\nI've also tried Free up space. Which doesn't work. I'm assuming because they aren't \"original photos\" from this phone? It just says \"can't free up space\".Can anyone help me out here?",
