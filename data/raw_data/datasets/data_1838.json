    "content": "Android auto is not working on my pixel 5. I plug it into my car and can't pair it with the car. I tried multiple cables and have restarted my phone, tried changing USB configuration settings and nothing happens. My partner has an Apple and apple car play works so i know it's not my car.\n\nAny suggestions?",
