    "content": "Recently I got a notification saying \"Problem reading your battery meter. Tap for more information.\". I tapped and got nothing useful to solve the problem. Instantly, I noticed that the battery icon had a question mark \"?\" on it. I thought that maybe restarting the phone would work, but it didn't. Later that day the phone started to shut down by itself. Even later, it shut down for good and now I can't turn the phone can only be turned on when it's connected to a power source. As soon as I remove it from the power source, it shuts down. How can I fix it?",
