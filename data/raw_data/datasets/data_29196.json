    "content": "I noticed my phone heats up after every video call. The battery just evaporates around 15% in just 15 mins and once the battery actually reaches 15% it drains completely in like 2 minutes. I am noticing this only after video calls. Tested with both WhatsApp and duo apps. I have received no support from feedbacks sent to Google. Anyone know what I can try ?",
