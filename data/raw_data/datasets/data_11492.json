    "content": "So I recently bought a used Pixel 2 XL. Everything seems to be fine, I was even able to update to Android 11 however, as soon as it locks the screen, it freezes.\n\nI've done multiple reboots, soft resets and even the alternative method for wipe data/factory reset but the issue remains the same. \n\nDoes anyone else has been having the same experience?\n\nA note I should add is the fact that when I make the factory reset the Google app keeps crashing but I'm able to update it through the PlayStore and then it stops crashing or at least I don't get the warning any longer.\n\nThanks for any help in advance!",
