    "content": "Okay. I used Pixel 3XL on Android 11 and it frequently has Google X enrollment program running causing phone to lag, heat up and then change the background to stock. It almost happens exclusively when playing graphic-heavy game and it is super annoying. \nAnyone knows the root of the problem and how can I fix it? Any helps would be deeply appreciated. Thank everyone.\nBackground change which I described is attached below.",
