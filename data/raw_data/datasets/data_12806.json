    "content": "My Pixel 4's screen decided it didn't want to work anymore just two days after my warranty expired. I can no longer see anything on it but I know that the phone is still on because I can feel it responding to my face recognition each time I hold it up to my face. Instead of spending money to repair it I'm just getting a new phone. I want to factory reset the Pixel 4 but cannot get to where I'd need to go to do it the traditional method. Is there another way I can factory reset it?",
