    "title": "Request for escalation on Case ID [3-9199000026477]",
    "content": "Unfortunately, my Pixel 2, along with many others, got bricked after Q Beta 2 update last June.\n\nI've opened a support case and the initially experience with Google Support was amazing. Fast responses and quick outcome.\n\nBased on the nature of the issue, and the phone being within the warranty period, it was decided that I would get a replacement phone.\n\nThe agent mentioned that I would get the needed Labels, in order to proceed with the RMA.\n\nDays went by and nothing. I decide to report that I did not get the labels, in order to understand what was the issue and it's root cause.\n\nThe case got handled by a different agent, and since then the only information that I get is: \"I've checked this further with my specialist and was informed that they are still working on it.\"\n\nThis has been now the de-facto response for almost 2 weeks.\n\nIt's incomprehensible how low the quality of the service is, since it's crystal clear that this represents a simple SLA management.\n\nI've asked for more information, on why it was needed a \"specialist\" to work on the case, given the previous triage and outcome. No valuable information, other than SLA management as come back.\n\nI've honestly requested to cancel the support request, as I feel unwelcome and not a valuable customer.\n\nStill, it's definitely my duty to report such low bar quality customer care.\n\nI'm available for more information.\n\nThank you for your attention.\n\nAnt√≥nio Vasconcelos.",
