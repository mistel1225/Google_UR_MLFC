    "content": "Pixel 2 XL 128 GB. Randomly my screen would fade or freeze or flicker. When it freezes it's annoying and I have to restart my phone. When it flickers I'm afraid my phone is not reliable and will be gone soon. I have to restart and eventually will stop the flickering. When I get the faded colors on my screen I get really worried. It's very random when it happens. It seems that it fixes randomly as well. Sometimes I press the buttons on the side, sometimes I tap on the screen, sometimes I have to unlock the phone, sometimes I have to restart the phone to get back the normal colors. Sometimes the phone works just normally. All this random experience stresses me out. I'm not sure if my phone is fine or it'll die to the point of no return.",
