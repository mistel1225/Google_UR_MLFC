    "content": "I use my Pixel 3 as an alarm clock and when it goes off in the morning, it immediately goes lock mode. I have to press the power button, then scan my finger print, then I can turn off the alarm (or snooze, except by then I am wide awake). Is there a setting I am missing? On my old 5X, the screen stayed up and I could just touch the command I wanted to turn off or snooze the alarm.",
