    "content": "Last night my charger stopped working and when my phone was plugged in it didnt show the charging symbol. I went to sleep and just left it overnight and since the battery was low (~1%) it was dead in the morning.  Now when I plug it in there is a white battery charging symbol but when I unplug it it instantly turns to the red battery low symbol and when i try to turn it on, it flashes off breifly then it reapears. There is no expanding circle where it shows how much it has charged. I have also tried to hold the power+volume down buttons but same thing happens",
