    "content": "So I purchased a Google Pixel 3a Xl off ebay and it said it was carrier unlocked which it was and I had no issues with my SIM card, however when i tried to unlock the OEM to root my phone it said it cant because the phone was carrier locked. Now from what I have been told it used to be locked to sprint and it was flashed with a stock google rom yet i still cant unlock the OEM because it says otherwise. Any help would be great.",
