    "content": "For the last few days out of no where my phone will lock itself as if the power button has been pressed, and will act as if the button keeps getting clicked, the screen will start flashing rapidly when it does this, the power button doesn't feel stuck or anything so my first thoughts is that the problem lies with the cables for the power button, I can't find any other problems quite like this. I have done a full wipe on my phone and tried varies troubleshooting methods such as safe mode, keeping the device turned off for a while and fully charging the phone, but it keeps doing the same thing, if anyone has any ideas what could help me resolve this, I would appreciate this, I just hope I don't have to replace the part for the power button.",
