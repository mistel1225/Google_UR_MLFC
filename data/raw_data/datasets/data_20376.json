    "content": "Every day, every time I open Keep it does this routine: buffers for about a minute, freezes up on main screen, then collapses. I pull it up again, wait for the buffering to stop, then wait till it unfreezes, then tap the + to take a note, it freezes for an eternity, then a box appears asking if I want to close or wait.\n\nI have complained in the comments section in Play Store. I have sent screenshot and dialog to Google help. I don't know what else to do. Help!",
