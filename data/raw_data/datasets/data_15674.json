    "content": "How can I tell if I am being routed to person's voicemail? I know how to route contacts and/or numbers to my voicemail. Is there a specific number of rings? Is the receiver made aware I had called? How does this effect text messages if it does? Can receiver read/receive text messages I have sent? I guess, the first question I asked is what I'd like to know. But please consider any answers or info regarding other questions that follow. I appreciate it very much! Cheers!",
