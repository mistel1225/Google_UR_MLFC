    "title": "Emoji Minis Missing From GBoard",
    "content": "It's not necessarily a Pixel-related issue, however, the Gboard support doesn't have a community section.\nToday, I was going to send a customized Emoji Mini to someone because I actually use that feature. I go to my stickers and it says, \"create your minis\" so I scan my face and it only comes up the sweet and bold minis, but not the Emoji themed one made by Google. Is this something that is happening for everyone or is there just something wrong for my phone? (By everyone, I mean people who used the minis in the first place, which many people don't)",
