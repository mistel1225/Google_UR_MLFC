    "content": "My Pixel 3 has been acting up recently. \n\nMy phone wouldn't start back up after leaving it for charge or an hour. I opened the boot-loader and it says Device Status: Error! Thankfully I found a solution online which was to drain the battery then plug it back it. However, now every time I restart my phone it doesn't start back up again after holding the power button for quite some time. The only way for me to start it back up is to plug in to a charger while holding down the power button. This is really strange.\n\nAdditionally my phone does not recognise my headphones or adapters. It was working fine the day before. I plugged my headphones into other devices and sure enough they worked. The USB-C charger is also quite unreliable. A slight nudge will cause it to stop charging. The phone is 2 months old and there not a scratch on it. \n\nThis isn't the first time I've had problems with my phone, in fact this is my second Pixel 3. My first one came out of the box with a broken vibration motor. \n\nI'm starting to rethink my purchase of a Pixel phone.",
