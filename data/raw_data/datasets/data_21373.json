    "content": "I just got the pixel 4 and I have a specific song I like to use for my alarm.  I purchase all of my music through google play music and cannot seem to use that for my alarm.  I'd hate to have to subscribe to one of the three listed services just to play that one song that I've already paid for.\n\nThanks for any answers.",
