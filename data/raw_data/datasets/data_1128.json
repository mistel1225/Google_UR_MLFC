    "title": "My NFC stopped working on Singapore \"Tap & Go\" transit all of a sudden",
    "content": "All of a sudden, on April 15, my phone cannot read Singapore Transit Readers using the Tap & Go feature. It simply reads it as \"That Didn't Work. Please place phone next to terminal\". I even tried without my case, and I just stood there blocking people.\n\nHowever, it works fine on any other payment terminal. I can buy in Mcdonald's, my favourite caf√©, etc. just fine. Just stopped working on any bus i get on all of a sudden.",
