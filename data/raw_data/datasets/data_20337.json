    "content": "I got a Google Pixel 4xl about 3-4 months ago. I immediately set up voice assistance and have really enjoyed using it so far. However, every now and then I will have to go back and set up voice assist as if it is the first time (give permission for it, speak the phrases so Google knows my voice, etc.). This has happened I think about 5 times now? It's really annoying that I'm having to completely redo the set up for this option, giving that I use the voice assist frequently. With my timeline, I'm having to do this at least once a month if not more. Is there something I'm doing wrong with the setup that's not sticking?",
