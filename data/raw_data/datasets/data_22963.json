    "title": "After a recent update my Pixel3XL will no longer open my gates. This is an issue with DTMF.",
    "content": "The DTMF appears to have stopped working after a recent update. I hear the tone on the speaker but it is not working with any of my remove devices - gates, alarms etc. I have explored all obvious options around DTMF and O2 said there is nothing they can do. Could this be an issue with the DTMF tones now being too short for my devices? Any help greatly appreciated.",
