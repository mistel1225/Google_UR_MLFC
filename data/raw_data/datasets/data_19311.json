    "title": "Pixel 3a Not charging",
    "content": "I have a Pixel 3a running the Android Beta 2. In no way can I get it to charge (using multiple cables), and the phone keeps giving me system notifications like \"Analog audio device detected\" or \"Charging connected device via USB\".\n\nI have contacted Google support however they can not help me because my phone is on the beta program. They asked me to opt out from the program but I can not do that because my phone is at 34% charge and I can not install any updates with the charge level. I have also created an issue on the android beta issue tracker because the support team told me to do so. The issue is here: https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/161029771\n\nIs there anything I can do? I am frustrated by Google's customer support or lack of it.",
