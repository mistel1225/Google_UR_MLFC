    "content": "Google pixel 3 a stops Bluetooth connectivity when screen times out. Phone is up to date, works perfectly with all other devices, only Bluetooth is affected.\nIs same for different Bluetooth speaker and headphones.\nIs same for 3 types of music streaming services.\nI got Google support to call me, idiots, they said....\n1; can you try it with Google play music app? ( Google play music no longer exists)\n2: reset your phone....nope.\n3: turn off and reset your WiFi...to fix a Bluetooth issue???\nThey did not listen to what I said, are reading from a script and a very old and out of date one, and when I pointed out the issues with what they were saying, they just said send your phone in to your warranty provider, during the Corona, I am to be without my phone for weeks, and with Brexit and fact Google have NO repair centres in UK stall, I might never get it back.\nGoogle support sucks.\nAm hoping boffins and wise people here may know where I can change settings.\nNever had this issue on previous phone ( not Google).\nHelpful ideas welcomed.",
