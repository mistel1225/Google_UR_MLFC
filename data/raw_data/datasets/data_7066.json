    "title": "Can't hear phone calls sometimes, a reboot usually fixes, but issue keeps recurring",
    "content": "Sometimes, when answering or placing a phone call (or even listening to my voicemail), the phone speaker simply does not work. I can't hear the other person at all, but they can hear me. Turning on speaker phone during the call does not fix the issue. Hanging up and dialing again does not fix the issue. \n\nThe only thing that does work, is re-booting the phone. Each time I've tried this, phone calls have worked again. But then the issue will happen again several days later, requiring another re-boot.",
