    "title": "I got a minor scratch on my fingerprint reader, device overheating and dying under 1 minute.",
    "content": "I disabled all things fingerprint as soon as it happened. It got overheated and I turned it off. I couldnt use it for more than a minute until it gets overheated in the fingerprint area in the back and gets turned off. After a few days, I was unable to charge it as well. This happened at 42% and now I just see it die by a percent everyday. Support centers are not open because of COVID since 3 months, is there any other solution?",
