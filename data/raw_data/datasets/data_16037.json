    "content": "In looking back through the last thousand picture I took with Pixel 3A, I see that only a few percent of them include GPS location data in the EXIF.  Some even half worked -- there is a GPS group in the EXIF, but no lat/long/etc in it.\n\nThe issue is somewhat random -- two out of 20 have GPS one day, non have GPS for a week or two.  One time I had zero location data for a few hundred pictures, then for the next few hundred, about 95% worked.  Then off again.\n\nAnother curiosity -- all panorama pictures seem to have GPS location data.\n\nSmells like a bug.  Can someone confirm?  Can someone fix?",
