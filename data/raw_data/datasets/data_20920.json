    "title": "Pixel 4 XL - Android 10 - Sensors not working after May 2020 update",
    "content": "After the May 2020 update some of the sensors on my phone are not functioning. \n- Gyroscope\n- Acceleration (with g)\n- Acceleration (without g)\n- Magnetometer \n\nIn camera and other apps screen rotate doesn't work. I have enabled auto-rotate.\nI google maps the direction/compass doesn't work. The compass symbol appears and then disappears. \n\nI have tried the following:\n- Booted into Safe mode but no change.\n- Factory reset but no change.\n\nThere are many posts online with similar issues. I haven't seen any resolution.\n\nIs there any way to fix this or do I need to get the phone replaced? \n\nPlease assist.\nShehan",
