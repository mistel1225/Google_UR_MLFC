    "content": "Made sure \"Access with voice match\" was turned on and still my pixel 3 will not respond to ok Google or hey Google commands. It's like the phone can't hear me at all. Note the Google Assistant does respond when holding the home button or using the squeeze feature on the Pixel 3... So much for hands-free",
