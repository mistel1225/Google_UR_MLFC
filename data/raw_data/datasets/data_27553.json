    "title": "How can I compose a question here using my Pixel XL (Android 10)?",
    "content": "I am using my PC for this because when I tried to compose a response to another topic on this site,  all I could  see is what fits on the first screen of my response.  So I composed the response in another notepad-type  app without any problems and copied it to my clipboard, came back here and pasted it and... I had the same problem so I could not access the 'Post' button.\n\nI was using SwiftKey and when I encountered the problem I switched to Gboard. But it gave me the same problem.  I've come across something like this every so often but have always managed to find a work-around (like using SwiftKey's cursor keys for text navigation).  This time, on this web, I could find no such work-around.  I've owned a Pixel XL since a little before the end of the first year it was released so I know my way around.  But this one's got me stumped.",
