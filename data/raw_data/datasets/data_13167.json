    "content": "Hi, I was running out of space on my OG Pixel, space was about 92%. Today morning suddenly the phone froze and then multiple times restarted, every time stuck on G logo. And finally, it completely went dead now. I tried everything to start it - holding the power button for 30 secs, Holding volume down + power button, etc. nothings working. Left phone for charging for a couple of hrs, still nothings working. Appreciate if someone can help here",
