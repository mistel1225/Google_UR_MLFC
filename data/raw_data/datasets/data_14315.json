    "title": "Pixel Phone Rear Camera Stopped working (SOLUTION)",
    "content": "I've tried everything from factory resets, to safe mode start ups, etc. Nothing has worked but I stumbled on a thread for a temporary solution which said to put a magnet by the rear camera and it worked for me! a weak magnet would have to permanently stay there. I'm sure google wouldn't recommend this solution because putting a magnet near electronics might mess up other things, so try this at your own risk! \n\nThe original solution I found is linked below. \nhttps://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/3317373?hl=en&msgid=36182209\n\nJust wanted to spread this temporary solution out there to those who might be experiencing a similar problem instead of spending another $1000 on a new phone.",
