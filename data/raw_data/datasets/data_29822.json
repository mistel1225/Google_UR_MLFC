    "title": "OG Pixel in Reboot Loop even after shut down while charging",
    "content": "Out of nowhere yesterday by OG Pixel (2016) froze and rebooted, after that it has a rebooting loop that lasted for hours yesterday until it ran out of battery, I left it charging the whole night. Today I powered it on and seem to be normal but without battery (even if it was left charging), plugged it in again and was fine and did the whole factory reset. The reboot problem still persists if the phone is under like 70% of battery. Even if it is connected to a power outlet it reboots forever, I've been able to get to my phone working normal but have to disconnect from power and shut it down from the recovery screen? .. \n\nThis phone was functioning just fine yesterday!",
