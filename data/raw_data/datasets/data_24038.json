    "content": "Calls made on Pixel 4 (using Google Fi as provider) over WIFI will randomly not transmit any sound, though the receiver is heard clearly. This happens several times a week, which for business calls can be very annoying. Only solution I've found has been to hang up, turn off WIFI, and call again using regular Google Fi phone signal. Has this issue been identified before? Is there any possible solution?",
