    "content": "I have a Pixel 4 XL. The screen is black/blank and I am unable to use it. However, I know it is on because I feel the phone vibrate when I press the power button. I tried multiple troubleshooting steps. I was able to get it to work for a few days after a factory reset, but now I can't even get to any options to restart in safe mode, factory reset, etc. because there is no display at all.\n\nAny other suggestions? Would replacing the screen help?\n\nThanks\n\nDan",
