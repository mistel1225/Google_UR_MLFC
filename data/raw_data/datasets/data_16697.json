Nothing is visible under it.\nPhoto : https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Kdkek1otmcMdim8q45HrLXyR7jAMju2n/view?usp=sharing \nI tried restarting the phone many times. Tried soft reset. Tried to wait till the battery is drained - no luck !\nIndian Pixel service center says it is a display issue. \n\nAnother problem is it is not launched in India. My sis had brought it for me from Canada. \nIndian service center says it cannot be fixed here.\nAnd, couriers are not allowing phones to be sent internationally !",
