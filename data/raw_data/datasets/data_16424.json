    "content": "My microphone is not working, and it only works on a phone call if I have my head phones on. I already spoke to UbreakIfix and see if they can fix it but they told me that it would not help changing the microphone because is a defect of the device itself. They recommended to speak to you to see if I can change my device. Please let me know if it can get fix.",
