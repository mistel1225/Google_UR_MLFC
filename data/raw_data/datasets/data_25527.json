    "content": "This morning my Pixel 3 stopped working. I cannot charge it or turn it on. I've had it plugged in all day with the google charger and tried other chargers but theres no indication its actually charging. The screen is black.\n\nI've tried holding the power button for 30 seconds and also tried holding the power button and volume down for 30+ seconds but nothing happens.\n\nI installed Android 10 a few days ago but everything was working fine until this morning.",
