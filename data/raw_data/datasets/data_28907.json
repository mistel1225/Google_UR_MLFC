    "content": "New phone 2 days old, was working fine until my microphone stopped picking up audio when placing a call or when using Google assistant. Seems that there's been a few people that have had this issue,  I've tried multiple fixes but nothing seems to remedy the microphone issue. \nI've tried:\n\nCleaning the microphone opening\nRestarting in safe mode \nDoing a hard reset \nUsing 4G/WIFI/3G- All had the same results\nupdating everything to the latest version\nUsing a bluetooth headset.\n\nThe funny thing is that the microphone picks things up perfectly when using apps such as Snapchat and when taking videos. Not sure if it's a software related issue but it's rather frustrating. \n\nLooking for any advice.",
