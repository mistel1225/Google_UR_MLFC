    "title": "Pixel 4 XL touch screen jumping when typing",
    "content": "I would like to start this with I have gone through the Google checklist to insure this is not caused by a screen protector or 3rd party app and have factory reset my phone. The touchscreen on my Pixel 4 XL seems to jump to spots that are horizontal to where I touch. This is most prevalent when typing but occurs constantly. So if I type an f, F and L will both be typed. or F and K. or if O is typed, O and W or E will be typed. This makes typing incredibly difficult and troublesome. just wondering if I was the only one with this issue.",
