    "content": "I ordered a pixelbook go from Best Buy. They didn't give me the option to buy their extended warranty I asked for it they said Google didn't want them offering it. So I tried to get your extended care plan and apparently I can't get that unless I buy from the Google store. The amount of money I'm spending I should be able to get a plan from either one. I honestly feel less valued as a customer because of where I chose to buy my device. Or maybe the ones at Best Buy are of less quality. This doesn't say good things.",
