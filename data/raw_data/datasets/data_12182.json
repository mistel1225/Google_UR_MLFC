    "title": "Why does Google charge $130 to repair a camera focus problem that is a manufacturing defect?",
    "content": "I have tried all of the fixes suggested in this forum and on the internet but none work.  The camera fails to focus 90 percent of the time.  This is a common problem with the Pixel 3.  I believe that Google should fix this problem for free.  It has certainly affected my view of the phone.  I can't even use the phone to deposit a check electronically because of this problem.  Google needs to stand by their products.",
