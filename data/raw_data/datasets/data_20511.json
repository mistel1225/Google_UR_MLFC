    "content": "I have a Pixel 3.  About a month after the warranty expired and around the time of the Android 10 update it started draining quickly under use -- call it 1% per minute.  Then at some point around 50%, the drain increased to 5% per *second* until the battery drained.  Now it's got a new habit. It's still draining at 1% per minute but it just randomly dies at some point between 90 and 80%.  Sometimes it restarts briefly, sometimes not, but even if it does it quickly dies again and then refuses to restart, claiming the battery is drained (by showing the icon).  When reconnected to outside power, the device operates normally and recognizes that it has whatever power it really had when it died. \n\nI've followed all the troubleshooting ideas, including a factory reset.  Has anyone else experienced this problem?\n\nThanks in advance for any assistance you can offer.",
