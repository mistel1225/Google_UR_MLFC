    "content": "My phone was stolen and even though I have the IMEI number I dont know how to use it. How can I block my phone? Will they be able to use it if I will do so? If they will use another SIM card will they have access to my phone's data? Should I erase them? If I will erase them, will they also be erased by my google account?",
