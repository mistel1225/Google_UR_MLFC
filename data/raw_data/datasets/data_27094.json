    "content": "I have a Google Pixel C tablet. As of today, my password no longer works. It’s the right password, and when I power off and restart it will get me past the initial login, but once it’s up and running, the password no longer works. I tried resetting it (power button + volume down) and I get a screen that says “No command.” Help please!",
