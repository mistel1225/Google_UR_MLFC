    "content": "Hey all,\n\nSo this is crazy, my auto rotate does not work.  It's turned on and my phone is all updated, I even did a factory reset as per Google support.  Nothing has helped and I cant get the screen to rotate on its own.  If I take a picture in landscape, it's saves sideways, in YouTube when I rotate the screen nothing happens. \n\nI downloaded an app to check the gyroscope sensors (gyroscope test).. it says that it cannot detect a gyroscope, accelerator, magnetor, on my phone. \n\nWhat's even crazier is that my wife's pixel 5 has the exact same issue, and two of friends as well... None of them realized it until I pointed it out and I'll be honest I didn't notice it for a week. \n\nPlease post below and let me know if your auto rotate is working or not or if you know of a solution to this.",
