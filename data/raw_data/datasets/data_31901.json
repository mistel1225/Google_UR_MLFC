    "title": "iheart radio app pausing on Pixel 2 after several minutes",
    "content": "This happens while listening to music on the iHeart Radio app via bluetooth to a speaker. After several minutes the music just stops. I go to the phone and unlock it and the music resumes within a second. It's really annoying if you are listening for a while. It also happens while listening in the car and it's connected via Bluetooth to my car stereo. I'm guessing it's something related to the phone's screen turning off? Or maybe sleep mode? I have no idea how to regulate that, if possible.",
