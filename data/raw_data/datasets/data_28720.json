    "content": "Hey community\n\nI am experiencing a newly developed problem with my Pixel 2 XL, when using it with my car. \n\nWhen I push the talk button on the steering wheel, I get the assistant \"ding\" and if I say for instance \"Play some pop music\" the phone will respond with \"Ok, playing a Playlist called the best pop songs\". But then nothing happens. It just goes back to playing what was already playing before the command. \n\nIt will only work if I pick up the phone and turn on the screen. \n\nUntil recently it worked like a charm. \n\nAny ideas? \n\nMike ðŸ˜Š",
