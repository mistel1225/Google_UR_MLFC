    "content": "Hi,\nNo matter the media app (YouTube, Play Music, Spotify, Google Podcasts) the playback gets randomly paused for no reason. It happens when I'm using the phone speakers, bluetooth, or earbuds through the 3mm to USB C dongle. \nIt also happens when things are downloaded on the phone, so I don't think it's a connectivity issue.\n\nDoes anyone have a fix for this? I'm using Android 10 and my device is up to date",
