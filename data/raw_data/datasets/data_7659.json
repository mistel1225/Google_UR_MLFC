    "content": "Up until recently, when clicking a link in a message in my yahoo mail app, it would open in chrome. Now, it just opens in an app view. I fixed this once before, but haven't been able to fix it again. Does anyone have suggestions or information about this? Chrome is set as my default browser.",
