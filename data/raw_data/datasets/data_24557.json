    "content": "TL;DR: Spoken notifications using USB-C headphones on Pixel 3 are using an otherwise unseen robotic assistant and Assistant voice is not changing when switched in settings.\n\nSince I have updated to Android 10, I have had continuous issues with the Assistant voices. I used to have the voice set to Sydney Harbour, which worked on my phone but not on my Google Home (I was okay with this). Since the update, my phone has been set to the default voice (Red?) and my Google Home has been set to Sydney Harbour. As much as I want to find a solution to this, I am fine with bearing with this as it is still pleasant to listen to and is probably a bug of Android 10.\n\nHowever when having using spoken notifications on my USB-C earphones with the Pixel 3, the voice used is a horrible, almost robotic sounding voice that only seems to come through the earphones and does not appear anywhere else. This voice is not selectable on the voice selection screen in settings. Is anyone else having this issue and are they aware of a solution to this? I have trawled the settings for Assistant and Voice and spoken notifications but I have not been able to find a solution.\n\nI have also tried a different pair of the same earphones, no change.\n\nRegards,\nMike",
