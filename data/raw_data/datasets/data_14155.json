    "content": "Issues started 3-4 days ago.  Completely random crashes....wouldnt turn on afterward sometimes.  When comes today while calling bestbuy about the phone and finding out that I'm one day over return policy (was moving from PA to VA with my 8 yr old son....fak!)...this pixel does it's *POOF* \"I'm out\" crashing trick that I had just been informed I was stuck with.  \n\nExcept this time, when it finally started again, it says something to the effect of \"Your device is corrupted and cannot be trusted to work.   \"Press the power button to continue.\" \n\nok...wtf, that's new...and doesn't sound good.  Pressed the power button, and after an eternity of the Google splash screen...same thing.  \nOn the following \"press power to continue\", I see the poor little android bot, apparently murdered, with the text, NO Command.   \n\nAnd thats where I'm at.",
