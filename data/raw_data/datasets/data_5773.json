    "content": "I have had T-Mobile insert a new SIM card, check and update all settings. I have factory reset the phone and replaced the phone. With the new, factory phone, I installed nothing except the SIM card to see if there was an app or weird setting at issue; still no luck. Neither phone will connect to the mobile network unless Wi-Fi is turned on and the phone is connected to Wi-Fi, and this is only because T-Mobile has Wi-Fi calling. When Wi-Fi is turned off or when the phone is not connected to Wi-Fi – as in when I am not at home, when having the phone work is the most important – the phone will not connect to the network. T-Mobile assures me (and I believe them) that this is a hardware issue. Searching online leads me to believe this is a known issue with the Pixel 4a 5g. Is there a fix for it?",
