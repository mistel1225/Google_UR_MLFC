    "content": "I have a pixel 2 XL that has had this issue for a while. The phone can only connect to Chromecast about half the time, and I had the phone replaced under warranty and the new phone still does not connect all of the time. The interesting thing is that there are 2 other pixel devices in my home that can connect 100% of the time without issue. I am just wondering if the 2 XL has a known Chromecast issue? For the other pixel 3 devices to connect perfectly while my pixel gets errors casting Netflix and YouTube, and the Chromecast does not show up in the home app periodically.\nAny suggestions?",
