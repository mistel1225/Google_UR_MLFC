    "content": "Hey guys,\n\nI just purchased some new wired earphones with volume control / mic. I am using my google 'aux to usb c adapter'. The volume down '-' and middle button (play/pause button) work as they should (volume down and stopping music or answer call etc) but the volume up '+' button only brings up the google assistant. \nIs there a way I can edit what this button does? As I would prefer to be able to control the volume rather than bringing up the google assistant. \n\nThanks,\nNick",
