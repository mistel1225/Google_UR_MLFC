    "content": "Just got a Pixel 4 and there seems to be one pixel on the screen that is always a different brightness than the rest. It's more noticeable as I turn the brightness down which makes me believe the brightness of the particular pixel is stuck. I have tried different colour backgrounds and it seems to be able to change colour, although it's more noticeable on some colours over others. I have already reset the phone twice to no avail. Is there anything else I could try or should I exchange it for a new one?",
