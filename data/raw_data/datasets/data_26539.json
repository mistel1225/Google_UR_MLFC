    "content": "Trying to touch at the very top edge of the pinned apps -> ok.\nSwipe up and enter to the apps drawer and open the apps at the same position of the pinned apps (at home screen) -> opened smoothly.\nTrying to use 3rd party launcher and touch the home screen apps (at the same position) -> open smoothly.\n\nSo, I guess this is an issue or error of the pixel launcher. Ever this issue happened before?\nHow is solution?\n\nThanks!",
