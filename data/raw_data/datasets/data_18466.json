    "title": "Will camera be fixed on Pixel2? I realize that Product Sustainability is inverse to Economic Growth.",
    "content": "Obsolescence - considering I've had this phone for 2.5 years and it has worked at an extraordinary high level and me along with every other user of the Pixel 2 have recently had issues with the camera not working since the last software/firmware update, I guess my question is; Is Google going to actually fixed the bugs they created on my phone or are you forcing me to by a new one? I have factory data reset and even downloaded the beta version (Android 11) and now I am back on Android 10. When I was using Android 11 the camera was working on and off depending on the day and YouTube and Amazon apps worked perfectly... Now switching back to Android 10 neither the YouTube, Amazon, Google Camera, or the flashlight are working... Please try an answer these questions with sincerity and not like a bot. Thank You",
