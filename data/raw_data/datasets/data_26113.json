    "title": "Worst Customer Service Experience in Years",
    "content": "What a sham google's support has become.  I purchased a new pixel 3 last year and the usb charge port started failing.  I sent it in and received, days later, a refurbished phone.  It wouldn't acknowledge any sim card.  I then spent the next 48 hours on the phone and chatting with google for up to 7 hours total.  On hold for over at hour at a time, hoping to speak with a supervisor that never showed up.  At this point, I simply want to get the phone replaced out of principal.  But given this experience, I will never purchase another google hardware product again until they develop a more robust and RESPECTFUL customer service operation.  You guys suck.",
