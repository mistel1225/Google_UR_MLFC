    "content": "My messages app has been acting up. First, I keep seeing the notification \"Messages is working in the background.\" Then, the app won't open at all. After clearing the cache, it opens, but I can't open any specific messages. When I send out texts, it'll let me know an hour or more later that it didn't send. \n\nClearing the cache doesn't solve the problem. Does anyone have any ideas?",
