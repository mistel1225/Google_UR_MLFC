    "content": "my pixel 2 xl had some bugs (there was a word that was overlapping every app I opened) so I decided to restart the smartphone. However, when the phone went on, the \"G\" logo appeared (as usual) and, under it, a loading bar. But, more than 2 hours went by and the smartphone was still in the same situation, without completing the initialization. I tried to restart other times, turn off and then turn on, but it always stopped in that same part, with the \"G\" logo and the loading bar, without finishing loading and without initializing. The phone stayed that way until it completely discharged. Then, I plugged it on power plug so it would charge. When the battery was about 80%, I unplugged it and tried to turn it on, but it still didn't leave this loading screen with the logo.",
