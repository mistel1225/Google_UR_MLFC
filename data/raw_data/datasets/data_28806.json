    "content": "The audio on my Pixel 3 is not working properly on phone calls. When I receive a call, I can hear the caller but they cannot hear me. Usually trying multiple times will fix the issue, if the caller calls back right away a second time, but the audio always fails when a call first comes in. Also, when I place a call, I can hear the receiver but they cannot hear me. I was able to get this working the last time by using a headset.",
