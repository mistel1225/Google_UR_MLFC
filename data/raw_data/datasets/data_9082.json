    "content": "theres pretty much nothing i can do to troubleshoot this since you're the one deciding device security is moot after 2.5 years.   tell me, is election security just as moot?  or how about banking security?  or that credit card account?  how about that hospital EHR mobile app running on your device?  how about home security?  no?  didn't think so.   \n\ngive me a break google and show some responsibility for all the 1's and 0's pouring through all your hardware and software and networks and clouds for all these years. better device and info security is in everyone's best interest.",
