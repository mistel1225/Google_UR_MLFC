    "content": "Hi,\nI just got Pixel 5 and Pixel Stand.\nAfter the phone is fully charged (without any issue), a red message appears on the phone saying 'realign phone for faster charging' and constantly switching with 'charged'. It isn't very pleasant, especially since my phone and stand are on my desk in front of me. If I put the phone horizontally on the stand, I will not have this issue.\nIs there any fix for this issue?\nThank you\n\nUPDATE: I just notice Stand make a chirping noise while charging!",
