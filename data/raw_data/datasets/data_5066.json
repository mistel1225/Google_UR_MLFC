    "title": "Blurry photos using \"Far\" Focus mode in Night Sight",
    "content": "In Night Signt, with focus set on \"Far\", pictures will be consistently blurry: instead of being correctly focused on far items, the camera will be correctly focused for objects at a 1 meter distance approximately.\n\nThis brings the main problem: when in astrophotography mode, it is very hard to correctly focus on the sky using autofocus, intuitively I would lock the focus to \"far\": this however makes all photos consistently blurry as the focus is not being correctly applied, by the app, to infinity.\nSome pictures for example:\n\nTaken with Night Sight + focus set to \"far\"\n\n\nTaken with Night Sight + focus set to \"auto\"\n\nLeft: Taken with Night Sight with Astrophotography + focus set to \"far\" (on a tripod)\nRight: Taken with Night Sight with Astrophotography + focus set to \"auto\" (on a tripod)\n\n\n\nThis seems to be a software issue with the camera (it assumes it is focused to far when set to \"far\" while it is not. How should I do to fix this problem?",
