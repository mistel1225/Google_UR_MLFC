    "content": "I've just edited a batch of 400+ photos on my HP Envy 360 15t convertable laptop for a client... \n\nI'm a labor doula who provides pictures as a free side bonus/artistic outlet. Birthing pics, need to look natural, and my old nexus 6p XL, plus old hp laptop were pretty consistent with each other. This is the first client that I've done photos for, with this phone and new laptop...\n\nWhen I started looking through the edited photos on my pixel 3a XL (which I had taken the pics on originally), I noticed much to my horror, that almost every image looks over saturated. They did not look that way on my laptop screen... \n\nI'm very concerned to find out which screen is showing the most accurate representation of the colors my client will get when they print these photos. I need to know which screen is likely to be showing the most true representation for future editing as well... ðŸ˜¬",
