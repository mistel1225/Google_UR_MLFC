    "content": "I have just dropped my 4A 5G in a very simple fall - about 2 foot with a screen protector and hard case on it and the screen is broken and the phone unusable. This is the 3rd 4A 5G that has broken on me in 6 months. I have got two replacements from Google which is all very well but a total hassle. The first phone fell on a rug from about two feet high again, no way it should have broken, the second one the camera just decided to stop working one day and never worked again and now this one is beyond use. I should say that I have had a 3Xl absolutely no problem at all for a couple of years and I've never broken a phone before. I think the build quality is awful on it- I've treated other models and makes of phone way worse than this and never had any problem.  Customer service was fine but I have spend absolutely hours dealing with returning phones and emailing google staff. I do not think the 4A 5G is merchantable quality and it takes ages to get anything sorted out.",
