    "title": "February 2019 security update fail",
    "content": "I recently tried updating my phone to the most recent security update. It started downloading, installing, and then mysteriously went back to the original page showing me the version I'm running with the \"Check for updates\" button down at the bottom. It shows I'm running the January 2019 update (which I was running before), but checking for an update just tells me there isn't one available. While the February update was installing, I think the last page I saw was the \"Optimizing Apps\" page, so it got pretty far into the update. I've tried checking for updates periodically, restarting my phone, etc. Support chat told me the only other option was to completely reset my phone, which I'm not ready to do. My phone isn't rooted, modified, etc.",
