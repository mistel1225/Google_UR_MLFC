    "content": "I have only recently updated this device to Android Pie, the problem is now the notes field in contacts no longer displays on the in call screen under the telephone number you are calling (during the call), for example if you have a lot of suppliers with different account numbers if you put that account number in the notes field that would be displayed under the telephone number during the call, so then you just have to glance at your phone for that information, now it doesn't seem to do that on Android 9, this was/is an extremely important feature for business users that have multiple contacts, was this missed during the update?",
