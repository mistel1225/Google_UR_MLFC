    "content": "My camera started showing the \"camera keeps stopping\" errors a week ago whenever I accessed my Google photos app or the camera itself. The camera continued to work for a couple of days but 5 days ago the camera just stopped working completely. I've since tried a few recommended tricks with no success (cleared cache plus restart, device in safe mode, uninstall/reinstall app, uninstalled recently added apps). Does anyone have any other suggestions? It seems like I'm headed for a warranty claim.",
