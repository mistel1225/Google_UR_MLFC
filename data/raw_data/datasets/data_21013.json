    "title": "Battery dies at 65-60 percent. Pixel 3 64GB just crossed 1 year warranty.",
    "content": "The phone suddenly goes from around 65% to 0% and shuts down in matter of seconds. Bought the phone from Google store in March 2019 and issue started in April 2020.\nContacted Google support and did all the troubleshooting steps including a factory reset. They asked me to go to ubreakifix to fix it. But I don't want to spend money on a phone just over 1 year. I should have gone for some other brand. Anyone else have the same issue and whether it was resolved?",
