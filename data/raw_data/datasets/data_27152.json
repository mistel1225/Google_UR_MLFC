    "content": "The tech support team for one of my apps asked me to do this, in addition to other steps related to the app. \n\nSo far, I've checked storage and cleared everything I didn't need, but didn't see a category for cookies or cache. I've gone through settings, and couldn't find it there either. I also did a Google search on the topic, which turned up Google support's “free up storage” article, but didn't see anything there.",
