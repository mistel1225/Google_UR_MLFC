    "content": "Camera app opens to a black screen and gives error message \"Something went wrong.  Close and open the Camera app again.\" but it never works.\n\nNo images ever show up, it is always a black screen.\n\nTried updating everything, restarting, safe mode, clearing cache and data, removing all the apps I installed, uninstalling camera update, reinstalling camera and nothing works.\n\nJust did a factory reset and it still does not work.  the error message doesn't come up, it just opens the app to the black screen, pauses, then closes automatically.\n\nI was really counting on using this camera for the upcoming holidays and now not sure what to hope for.\n\nPlease advise.\n\nThanks,\nBrad S.",
