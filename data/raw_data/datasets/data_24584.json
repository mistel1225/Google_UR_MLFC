    "content": "Has anyone else noticed a persistent notification bar while listening to music and using an app in full screen mode? I noticed it playing a game. Happens with YouTube Music and Google Play Music. I've tried turning the notifications off for the apps but the bar is still there. As soon as I pause the music it's gone. Does this have anything to do with motion Sense? It can get kind of annoying whenever I try to select something and keep opening the clock instead.",
