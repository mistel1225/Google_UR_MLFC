    "content": "The Pixel 4a launched in the US on 20th August 2020.\nIt is not due to launch in the UK until October 2020.\nThe Google support page states the phone will be supported until August 2020. This means that in the UK we will get less than the expected 3 years of guaranteed security updates.\nCan someone at Google clarify the support period for UK Pixel 4a devices?\nThank you",
