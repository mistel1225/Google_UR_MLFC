    "content": "Like many others have reported my Pixel 3 camera freezes and/or shows a black screen. I first followed the advice to try safe mode (still occurs), empty cache and storage (still occurs) and factory reset.( No better). I had the front camera replaced and that resolved the issue for about 4 hours. I probably now have no alternative but to dump investment in this phone and try something else. A real shame because Google Fi is great!!",
