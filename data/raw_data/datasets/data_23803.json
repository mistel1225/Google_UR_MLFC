    "title": "Visual voicemail does not work on pixel 3a and T-Mobile",
    "content": "I get an error in the phone app's voicemail tab saying I need to setup voicemail. But my voicemail is already set up (I get notified to dial the voicemail number when I get a voicemail). This used to work with my Pixel 1. I have tried calling TMobile, but they just say visual voicemail is not supported on the pixel 3a. Is this really the case? Google online help seem to tout support for visual voicemail for the pixels, even calling out TMobile. \n\nI also called Google support and they also couldn't figure it out. The rep suggested I get a new SIM, which I did, and that did not work either. \n\nWould really appreciate some help on this. \n\nThank you.",
