    "content": "I have a pixel 2XL and even at the lowest brightness setting the screen is very bright but all the dark colors are just black. Brown things are just black. The fix on the computer displays is called gamma correction. Is there any way of adjusting gamma correction for pixel2xl? Having the display so poorly calibrated makes low brightness unusable, and I can't just run full brightness all the time because then the light colored things are just too bright. It's almost like there needs to be a brightness based gamma correction factor. Help.",
