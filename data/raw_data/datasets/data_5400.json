    "content": "Last year I bought pixel 3xl from sprint. Certainly I met criteria for unlocking and got it unlocked from sprint. I moved out to verizon later and then to visible. I was on visible when I sent my device under warranty for replacement. \nGoogle sent me an locked device to sprint now. I am struggling to get it unlocked and simple unlock. It's taking days and weeks for them to resolve the issues. I have provided all the information to them but every day I just hear only that they are still working. Just no resolution. No phone no help. First of all for such a big company this crappy customer service is really something I can't understand. What do I do with this now since I am on visible. Sprint says they can't unlock since google replaced it. What the heck. Any suggestions would be appreciated.",
