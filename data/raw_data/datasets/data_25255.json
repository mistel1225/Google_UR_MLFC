    "content": "Random crashes and then have to reboot 4+ times until phone is stable again. Always crashes while in use but different apps. \nHave done factory reset and still have same problem. \nCalled support and they suggested taking it to ubreakifix but I prefer to get new phone. Just ordered Pixel 4 XL but not due to arrive for 10 days. \n\nQuestion - is it close to complete death?",
