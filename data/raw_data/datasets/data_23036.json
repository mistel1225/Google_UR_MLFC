    "content": "I tried the \"Customize your Pixel\" feature that was pushed in settings today. I wanted to see what other options are out there so I created a custom view and applied it. Now I can't get back to the original view which I liked better. If I search in Settings, nothing comes up for custom or customize. I am frustrated and just want the original view back.",
