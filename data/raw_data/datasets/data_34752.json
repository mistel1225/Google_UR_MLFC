    "content": "While I have gone into my settings to turn off the Google assistant, as I have the Google Home, Home Hub, & Mini's and rarely need to use the assistant on my phone, it doesn't seem to turn off completely. Everytime I say, 'Hey Google\", it pops up on my phone in one of two ways. If it is in screen lock and I am not using it, a keypad pops up and I have to back out of it twice to get it to go away. If I am using my phone, in app or otherwise, it pops up asking me to turn the assistant on, interrupting my game play, browsing, or whatever it is I am doing, and forcing me to \"back out\" of it. This is by far the *MOST* annoying thing I have ever had to deal with, as far as phones go. Is there something I'm doing wrong? Or is Google really going to be this forceful about pushing the assistant on people? I love the assistant. I have many of them at home and my office. **BUT** I do not need 3 different devices answering me when I say \"Hey Google\" and I do not want phone interuption every single time I say \"Hey Google\". Is there a fix!?! Please!?!",
