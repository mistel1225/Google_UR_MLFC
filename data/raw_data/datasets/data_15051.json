    "content": "Hi, I own pixcel 3 and it has serious battery problem. At first it become very hot for couple of months and now stop charging and I cannot even turn it on. Google told me they will send me replacement phone more than 3 weeks ago and they block my money 3 weeks ago to send me replacement they estimate time was 17_22 September and yet I have not received any because they don't have it in their warehouse and their warehouse team even don't reply to their customer service team. So poor customer service I have  diferent google phone for almost 6 years and I wanted to buy again pixcel 5 but I have change my mind because their customer service performance has come down dramatically.",
