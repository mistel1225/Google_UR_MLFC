    "content": "My Pixel 3 has been draining faster than usual lately, from lasting about 7 hours with full battery to 3.5 hours in the span of one day.  This was not immediately following the download of any new apps.\n\nWhen I charged it normally, the battery actually drained at the same rate as if I had been using it.  It showed the charging symbol when it was plugged in.  Later, I tried shutting it down and it charged fine, so I thought it was some kind of background app.  My settings showed none of my apps were an abnormal amount of battery, even after disabling background battery usage for most of them.\n\nI have tried draining the battery to 0% and charging it a few times, with no success.  I'm now charging it from a different outlet and cable and it's charging slower than usual, but it's still charging, unlike with the other plug.  \n\nThis is confusing because I don't know why a broken charger cable would change after the phone is shut down.\n\nAny ideas of what I can do to resolve this would be appreciated",
