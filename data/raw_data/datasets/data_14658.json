    "content": "I don't really have an issue since I solved it myself, but I'd figure I would share since I've seen past forum topics with no real solutions that actually work. \n\n I've been seeing people complain about their notifications/ringtones being low and thought \"Well, what if I just upload my own but increase the gain?\" (Tbh, I have no idea why they sound so low compared to my older phones)\nSo I went to Audacity (The blue letters are a link) and well... increased the gain. \n\nI then exported it as a WAV. to tell the difference between my custom notification/ringtone to the appropriate levels where it sounded nice and now I can hear my phone pretty clearly. EVEN WITH AN OTTERBOX CASE\n\nIf people really need a tutorial, I suggest to go to look at Youtube or if this actually gets any traction at all, I'll edit this post to be a bit more descriptive. \n\nHope this helps~!",
