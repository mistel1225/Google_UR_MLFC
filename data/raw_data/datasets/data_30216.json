    "content": "My Google Pixel went into a boot loop this morning and the went completely dead. I had applied an update recently.\n\nPhone was purchased through Verizon and is roughly a year and half old. So they are throwing up their hands saying that its outside of warranty.\n\nThis is the 2nd Google phone that has experienced this. My Nexus 6P also died like this when it was a year and half old. That time Google also threw up their hands and refused to help.\n\nI have been a loyal Google user from day 1...both software and hardware. But this is really testing my loyalty. Very very disappointed.\n\nCan Google support please help get this resolved? Expensive phones like this shouldn't die in a year and half.",
