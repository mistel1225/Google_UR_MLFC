    "content": "I have issues with my new Pixel 3XL battery, it is draining without even touching it. I had to charge it 3 times a day. Its faulty device evidently. I traded in MY Iphone and was told the refund will be issue to my Credit Card. \nNo that the new Pixel 3XL is faulty, I have asked them to get me a refund. They said, I would get a store credit for my Iphone. \n\nI AM NOT LIKE THE PIXEL because of its issues. I have wasted enough time going back and forth with the customer service. \n\nIS there an escalation point???? I need a solution. I am okay to get my Iphone back, if its not possible, i would prefer a refund to my credit card. No a store credit!!!!!\n\nHow do I complain about this and who is responsible ? The customer service was so rude and I can never forget, the lady just put me on hold when I was speaking and explaining my problem and later came back saying is there anything else that she could help with!!! I feel cheated and I regret choosing google product!!",
