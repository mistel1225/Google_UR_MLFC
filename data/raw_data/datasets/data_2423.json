    "content": "I held off updating my phone for over 100 days until the pop up came up on my phone right when I was tapping my screen and accidentally hit restart now... before the update, my phone was laggy but I have grown used to dealing with it. After the update, I still have the lag, but my battery is now AWEFUL. my phone battery is at 60% when I get to work now whereas before it would be in the 90s with the same usage. Last night I no joke watched my battery count down from 10% to 1% in under 20 seconds (being kind) when I was on the home screen and no apps running in the background, no joke it went as fast as the NASA rocket launch countdown because that was the voice I was imitating in my head lol and I just looked up the audio of it and its dead on with the battery dropping... I have noticed it in the past where I would see that I have 17% battery, and two minutes later I am running to put my phone on life support because its on 1%, just last night was the first time I saw it dropping.  Like I said in the question, no new apps were downloaded, only the update to Android 11. I say that because I looked at battery help on the Google website and it said to check any new app's battery usage in settings. I also looked at the warranty page and I am out of warranty, has anyone else experienced this problem and is there anything I can do?",
