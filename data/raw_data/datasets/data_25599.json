    "title": "Pixel 3 XL touch has become very less sensitive and have to apply lot of pressure. What can be done?",
    "content": "Suddenly without any physical damage, my Pixel 3XL has become very less sensitive and I have to apply more pressure to type, scroll or do anything on the screen. Using some apps available on Play store, I found one entire column from top to bottom on the touch pad has gone dead. When I draw a line from left to right, it gets disconnected in that particular column. I tried rebooting in safe mode as well as factory reset. But issue remained.\n\nI suspect it as hardware issue but is there anything else I can try before contacting google?",
