    "content": "So I dropped my phone in the pool, but got it out almost instantaneously and sucked the water out and immediately put it in a bag of rice. So far, everything is working fine, however my wifi will not turn on. I am trying to swipe the toggle from grey to blue and it wont do it, it just keeps returning to grey. Same thing with the widget, it will go to blue for a second and then back to grey. Any ideas on why this is happening? Or how to fix it?",
