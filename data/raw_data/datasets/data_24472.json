    "content": "I did restarts, shut down and start, restarting from the boot loader.\nwhen i put my pin in it goes to a black screen for a second and back to asking for pin number.\nI have done a factory reset and that has solved the issue.\nnow this is a new phone replacement for my old pixel xl which I've got less then a week ago and I'm just trying to make sure it's not a hardware issue, which to me it seems like a weird software issue that I can't seem to be able to find any information anywhere, as in like it has never happened to anyone else.",
