    "title": "Extreme Battery Draining even on idle",
    "content": "I've been using my pixel 3 for a couple of months and since the first day with the phone I noticed the poor battery performance it had but I didn't complain because I could charge it rapidly. But since a trip I noticed that it couldn't last a day even with battery saver on at full charge. It last 10 hours in  which 3 are SOT.\n\nI went through all the troubleshooting pages and I tried  everything. I checked if there was an app draining battery, turned off always off display and even restarting the phone in safe mode but nothing seems to fix it. \n\nI noticed something else: Everytime I had to restart my phone I had to connect it to the charge cable because It can't turn itself on (in safe mode or in the normal restart). \n\nHope I can get my problem addressed.\n:)",
