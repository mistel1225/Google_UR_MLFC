    "content": "For the past two months my phone has been randomly taking screenshots without me pressing the volume and power button.  Today I finally figured out that the screenshots are caused by me shaking my phone.  How do I turn this feature off? I've looked through all of the settings on my phone and can't find anything. It is extremely aggravating because the phone's censors are so sensitive it thinks any movement means that I am shaking the phone. I have to constantly go into my photos app and delete all of the accidental screenshots.  So how do I turn that off?",
