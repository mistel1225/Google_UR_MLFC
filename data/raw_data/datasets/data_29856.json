    "content": "I switched from an S6 recently, and I have tried and am losing patience with the phone and camera app itself. I have looked for an app in the play store that would let me  I simply want to press and hold on a picture I have taken and to then have the option to copy it to the clipboard, the same as text or any other device I own. I don't have any interest in letting apps have permission to the camera. They don't need it, I don't want to share camera. I want to paste the picture somewhere else. I have had no luck trying to google solutions, and most threads I have found do not address this specifically or imply that for some unknowable reason it cannot work.\n\nIf anyone knows how to copy the photo or other images to the clipboard and paste it elsewhere, or if there is an app that will let me do so, or even some way to just share without providing everyone access to my camera I would appreciate any assistance.",
