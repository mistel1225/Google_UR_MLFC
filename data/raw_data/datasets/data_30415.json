    "title": "Are the Pixel USB C earbuds only compatible with Pixel phones?",
    "content": "I recently bought a separate pair of USB C Pixel earbuds (the ones you get with the Pixel 3) for use with my Pixel 2 and other devices.\n\nVery disappointed to discover that they will only work with my phone. Tried plugging them into my USB C port on my PC and the USB C port on my Nintendo Switch and neither device even recognises that something has been plugged in!\n\nNo issues whatsoever on my Pixel 2, they sound great for Â£18, but I am majorly annoyed that they seem to have been designed for a very limited number of devices, given that USB C is supposed to be universal.\n\nHas anyone else experienced the same, or does it seem like my pair might be faulty?",
