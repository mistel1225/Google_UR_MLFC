    "title": "No service on Pixel 3a (an \"x\" where service bars usually are) happening repeatedly! No calls/texts",
    "content": "My phone over the last few weeks has repeatedly dropped network service (x where LTE usually is) I've followed a number of \"How to fix this\" forums online because they all say that service providers are not acknowledging this issue. Service will come back for a short time after these \"fixes\" but will disapear again. Currently restarting phone 4-6 times/day when I notice it. No missed calls or texts come in after either - lost in the void forever.",
