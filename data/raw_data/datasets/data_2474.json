    "content": "I have been waiting over one month now for my Pixel 5 to be repaired. There was a crack in the rear camera glass so I purchased their courier service expecting a quick collection, repair and return. It has been over a month now and still no collection with their latest advice being to cancel the order and request a repair directly with Google; the reason for the delay is that they are waiting for the component to be delivered. Is anyone else experiencing a similar issue and has found that going direct to Google was a quicker option?",
