    "content": "My aunt just bought Pixel 4 (google FI version) and there are 2 versions unlocked/google FI (unlocked). I know unlocked mean can use any physical SIM in the world.\nSince Google doesn't support Google FI in my country. So can I use Pixel 4 (Google FI) with physical SIM and does Google FI cost monthly for its service if I didn't active it?",
