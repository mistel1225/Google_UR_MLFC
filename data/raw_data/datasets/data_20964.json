    "title": "Pixel 4 XL Proximity Sensor not working",
    "content": "During every phone call the screen fails to turn off leading me to believe that the proximity sensor is not working. After doing some quick reading it looks like this is an established issue since September of 2019. The issue didn't show up until I updated to the latest security patch. I have rebooted the phone multiple times and the issue hasn't corrected. I have not done a factory reset as I would prefer to not to.",
