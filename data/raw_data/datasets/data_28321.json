    "content": "So over the past few days, i've noticed that I can no longer make calls, send text, or use the internet. Trying to make a call just tells me to use wi-fi calling, and attempting to use any app with online connectivity leads to a \"no internet connection\" message or just a continuous load. The phone display that i have service, with a perfectly fine signal, but refuses to work till i restart the phone. Which in turn eventually happens again at any random. Longest Ive been able to go without a restart since this has started was 3 hours, and at worse 5 mins. I've had no luck looking for any troubleshooting advice for this issue. Any help would be appreciated.",
