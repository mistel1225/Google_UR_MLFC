    "content": "When I put my phone on my Pixel Stand it suggests me to ask to show photos from my account.\n\nWhen I trigger this voice action, it only says it can't show personal photos from my account. \n\nI also have a Google Home device linked to this account in the same room.\n\nI have Google Photos enabled and synced to my personal account. \n\nMy personal account is in my personal G Suite domain with no restrictions on services itself, but I'm assuming this is the issue as I've had issues with other services like my calendar not working with Google Home device. \n\nIf Google Assistant can't trigger some actions, could these be hidden from the suggestions. \n\nThe error message could also be helpful if it explains me why this issue is happening.",
