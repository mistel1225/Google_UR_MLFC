    "content": "I keep losing DATA while in LTE (not all the time).  Google replaced my phone and the exact same issue happened on the new unit. My girlfriends Pixel 4XL does this as well.  I find when in LTE+ it works well, but when i travel from area to area i lose DATA while in LTE and have to constantly reboot my phone.  I have set them all to only use 3G and that has made them usable for now.  \n\nI noticed that my carriers APN keeps getting un-selected on its own and i need to keep fixing that as well.\n\nWe are both on the Rogers network and they claim all is OK at their end.  Goggle told me if i get signal in LTE sometimes its a carries issue.  So I have the carrier saying its a phone issue and i have Goggle saying its a carries issue. \n\nThings i have done to date...\n1. new SIM card\n2. called carrier to make sure all is well\n3. called goggle and reset apps and settings \n4. new phone from goggle (same issues)\n5. factory reset phone a lot",
