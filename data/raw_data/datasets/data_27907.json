    "content": "I live in Greece but i will be in London for a few days. I try to find a store or sth in london to drop my pixel xl 2. I have issues with the screen,camera and fingerprint. The problem is that i follow the instructions in google store and after i describe the problem as asked, i hit next and it has only options to call me back or chat. No options to mail the phone or drop it myself. What am i supposed to do? All i want is to ship or drop it myself to a store in London.",
