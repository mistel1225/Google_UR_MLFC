    "content": "New problem as of Android 11. When pressing the action button on a Bluetooth earpiece device, i.e. play/pause, any audio playing *mutes* but continues playing. \nWhen paused, pressing the action button will begin playing the audio, however. The same issue occurs for youtube and other audio media. Muting occurs, but not pausing.",
