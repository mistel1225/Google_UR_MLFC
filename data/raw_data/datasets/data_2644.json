    "title": "Pixel 3 battery indicator stuck at 1%. Yesterday turned off when indicator reaches 93%.",
    "content": "I'm using my Pixel 3 for past 2 years. Recently I'm having issues with battery. At first when battery drain indicator reaches 86% mobile shuts down indicating low battery. After 2 days the same occurred when reaching 93%. Now my pixel 3 is not charging above 1% as per the battery indicator. For the past 2hr battery indicator is showing 1% but my mobile working fine. Is this because of battery issue or software related issues. Please Help.",
