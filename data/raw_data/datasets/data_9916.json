    "content": "I just received my phone on Thursday and I immediately noticed that the battery drains very quickly. For example my phone was at 87%, when I started looking for reasons why the battery is draining, and it's been about 5 minutes and it's 81% now.\n I had the pixel 3a xl before and the battery lasted all day being used. And this phone is advertised as having a larger battery. Is it a faulty battery or is it a simple fix?",
