    "content": "I just got a Pixel 3a XL (Fi) this week... I upgraded from a Moto X4 (Fi).  Overall I love the phone but I sorely miss one feature that Moto had and Pixel doesn't.  A hand gesture to turn on and off the flashlight (Double Chop for Flashlight toggle).  I know it must seem a trivial thing, but I used this particular feature many times a day.\n\nFrom what I can see there is no way to modify the built-in gestures to toggle the flashlight.  I also tried a couple of apps that had disappointing results.  Does any pixel 3 user on Android 9 have any suggestions so I can mimic this ability or something similar (app for button press combo, gesture, etc.)?  I don't always want to use voice assistant or notification tray settings button to toggle flashlight.  Any apps or suggestions are greatly appreciated!\n\nP.S. - If you are reading this Google, a double/triple tap of the fingerprint sensor for flashlight (or anything else) or a double squeeze would be cool.  Why are there no gestures (that are reliable) that we can assign?",
