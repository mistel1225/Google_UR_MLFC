    "content": "Hi all, so i've updated my pixel 2 to android 10 after many failed attempts, after having done so everything was fine but every time my phone would restart to a message\" your phone is corrupt...\" and would have to reboot and wipe to factory default which happened many times, however the last time it choose to restore from a newer backup that didn't have all my apps or settings, when accessing google drive i see an older version of my backup that i want to restore, but after following the onscreen options after setting it up again from factory wipe the older version of the backup doesn't show and only the latest one appears. in other words how do i restore to a previous backup point and not the latest ?",
