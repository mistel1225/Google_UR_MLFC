    "content": "Wtf Google, do you love people coming to your building and take over and ruin most of your programming and mess with a lot of people's phones. that is terrible business ethics and completely unacceptable. I have proof that malicious apps are being installed directly from Google servers and masking themselves as OEM software but they cause more harm than good. I have multiple backups across multiple devices online and offline and hard copy, I even went as far as the good ole Polaroids. So if you want to discuss before I leak all of this information please send me a text through your Google server.",
