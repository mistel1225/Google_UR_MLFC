    "content": "I just installed the Personal Safety app and when trying to set it up, it said all of my emergency contact numbers were invalid. I tried re-typing in the numbers, which did not satisfy Google, and then just skipped the step. I then set up the emergency sharing feature and all of my emergency contacts appeared. When I tried to test the feature, none of my contacts received any notifications. What do I need to do to get the app to recognize my emergency contacts?",
