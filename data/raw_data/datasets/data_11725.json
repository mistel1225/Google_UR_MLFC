    "content": "So I've never had any issues with my OG Pixel apart from it dying on me seemingly forever while charging. Google is of no help, and taking it to a third party repair store I understand it's a motherboard issue. They tried a new screen and new battery neither of which worked. It's infuriating how such an expensive premium phone can act like this. Annoyingly my warranty ran out only a few months ago. Looking at these forums tells me that many others have had this issue. Has anyone managed to replace their motherboard on the OG Pixel? Finding replacement parts is difficult, especially if you've relocated to countries where Google mobiles aren't sold.",
