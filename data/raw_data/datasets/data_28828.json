    "content": "hello guys. \nmy pixel XL has been stuck on boot-loop for weeks now and i can't do anything with it, not even a factory reset, seriously need solutions.\n1. I can boot into the quick recovery guide(power button + volume up) but nothing works not even the recovery mode option.\n2. Boot-loader is locked as i cant access my phone to unlock it.\n3. boot-slot is b. i dont even know how or why.\nwith all these being said,  anyone with solutions should please reply to this or mail it to me @ okonlester@gmail.com\nlooking forward to your replies....\nLastly, its my hope that a personnel at pixels phones sees this so this message can be channeled to the appropriate offices ...'Africa is not a continent for you guys to dump your products alone without providing any physical office for uncomfortable situations like this, it is very frustrating to know when there is an issue like this, our default solution is to send the phone all the way back to the states for repairs. please establish offices across Africa. p/s i am in Ghana.",
