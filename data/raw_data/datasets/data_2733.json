    "content": "When GMAIL crashed in December 2020, the only way I could get my phone to get new mail was to perform a factory reset. The reset correctly attached to my Google account and reinstalled all my applications, however it did not restore all the files created by my applications. Specifically, /storage/emulated/0/recorders was not restored and I appear to have lost dozens of voice memos created by Voice Recorder. Checking on Google Drive, my oldest current backup is last month, so the data erased by the factory reset would not be present in the backup.\n\nIs there a reliable utility that can scan the storage of the phone and recover files marked for deletion?\n\nI've tried FileMaster, Deleted Photo Video Recovery, All Data Recover, and File Recovery from the Play store and none of them seem to find any files marked for deletion.",
