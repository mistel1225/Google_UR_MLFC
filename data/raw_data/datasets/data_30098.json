    "content": "I just bought a Pixel 2 XL, Got it set up and working pretty well, the Active Edge feature does not work at all though. If i turn the feature on it does not respond to squezing the phone no matter what sensetivity i set it to, however, if i have it activated and set to the lowest setting, then put the phone down and just let it sit, it will activate the assistant without being touched, as if something is activating the sensors.\n\nI have the assistant set to google (found several people who had the issue of no assistant being selected in the settings). I have also tried changing the language to English just to check if that would make a difference (it didn't). I have done 3 factory resets to see if anything would fix itself. And finally i have cleared the google app storage and reinstalled all firmware updates 3 times as well. Nothing has made any difference.\n\nI find this fault somewhat suspicious (as in possibly indicative of something being wrong with the hardware) considering it's a brand new phone, just pulled out of the box.",
