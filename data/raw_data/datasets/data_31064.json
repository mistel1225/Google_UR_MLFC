    "content": "I received but couldn't answer my phone today nor an email that was sent to me.  I managed to get voice mails after the people phoning had hung up.  I didn't even know where one of the calls was coming from. My phone mentioned google so what is going on? I received a message a few days ago to upgrade my phone and I thought it was from Samsung.  Apparently it had to do with a google update. Now how to do remove this update?",
