    "content": "I have a google pixel 2, I have just completed the july update and allowed the phone to restart to finish the update. The phone is now asking me to unlock it with the pin but when I try It says the pin is incorrect. I used the pin to access the phone in the first place before the update so I know it is not incorrect and have tried multiple times. Any Ideas?",
