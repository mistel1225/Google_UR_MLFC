    "content": "Hello, I'm from Singapore and there's a free wifi network that we can connect to called Wireless@SGx. The set-up is just to set the EAP method to SIM. However, after setting up the wifi network on my pixel 4a, it restarted itself multiple times.\nI temporarily remedied the problem by resetting the network settings using \"settings app --> system --> reset options\". The phone works fine after the reset. \nI have recently tried to connect to the network again and my phone restarted itself again multiple times. Please help/advise what I should do 🙇🏻‍♂️🙇🏻‍♂️ Thank you.",
