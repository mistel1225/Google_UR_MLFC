    "content": "I dropped my phone in water and it stopped working. I left it UBreakIFix overnight and came to pick it up this morning. The man at UBreakIFix said that they were not able to work on it because Google did not give them permission to, likely because it was water damage, and advised me to \"contact Google\". What should I do to get my phone fixed?",
