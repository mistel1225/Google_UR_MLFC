    "content": "Happens with Spotify and separate podcast app, Bluetooth speaker or speaker wired to headset jack. Seems to be more of an issue when lock screen is on, stops temporarily when unlocked but also happens when unlocked.\nRestarting phone, uninstalling and reinstalling apps - issue persists.",
