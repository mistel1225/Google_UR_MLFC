    "content": "Hello!\nMy Pixel 3 USB C works only in one direction. When I plug the cable into phone one side up everything is working (charging and data), but if I turn the cable around nothing is working (no charging, no data). This is with all USB cables what I have tried with. I have tested the same cables with other devices and they work both ways in other devices. My phone has latest updates and I have tried to restart it. I have also tried to clean the USB port of the phone with wooden toothpick and with toothbrush. The USB port of the phone is clean.\nWhen I tried to contact Google support, it says: \"Chat support is currently not available.\". I refreshed the page every 30 seconds for 24 hours yesterday (20.04.2020 Monday) and it showed every time the same message and I was unable to start support chat.\nI am unable to request a call from support because in the phone number country select list, my country is not present there (Estonia). And it also shows: \"Phone support is currently closed. Please try again during business hours.\".\nHow can I get support with this issue?",
