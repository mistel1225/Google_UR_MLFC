    "content": "So I updated to android 9 about a week ago. Ever since then, my camera has been mostly inoperative. I just get a black screen when I try to open the camera in ANY app. It doesn't matter if it's the front, or the back camera. I've force quit all apps. I've cleared data/cache. I've even restored my phone to factory defaults. It'll work for one or two pictures after a reboot, then any app attempting to use the camera will crash. I've had the phone for just under a year, and have never had a problem with it. Please tell me I'm not the only one having this issue...",
