    "content": "So, I've been using the pixel 3 XL for over a few years. When I updated to android 10, a bluetooth error appears constantly. I tried rebooting, clearing cash, resetting the bluetooth/wifi settings, hard reboot, and every possible way that's on the issue. What happen to you guys(Google) fix the bluetooth issue? It's literally making me wanna leave Google and just go for Apple. I'm getting sick of this bluetooth error that makes my phone unuseable. PLEASE FIX THIS...You will be losing valuable customers..I even contacted support, but I'm not going to buy a new phone!. I love my pixel 3 XL, just the bluetooth crashing is making it unusable. FIX THIS WITH AN UPDATE PLEASE!!!!!",
