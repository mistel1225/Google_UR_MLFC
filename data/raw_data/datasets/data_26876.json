    "content": "HELP! I have a pixel 2, and just the other day it stopped accepting my PIN. The PIN has not changed, it just won't log in with it anymore. The screen hangs after trying to enter a PIN, then goes back to the lock screen.\n\nI factory reset my phone, installed all outstanding updates and it happened again straight away.\n\nI then factory reset for a second time, changed the PIN during this process. It worked for a few hours that night logging in with the PIN then when i woke in the morning it wouldn't work again.\n\nI've reached out to google support, who said they couldn't help because I was in a country that i didn't purchase it from and that the country I purchased it from (Australia) would email me.\n\nI haven't heard anything, very poor customer service!!!!",
