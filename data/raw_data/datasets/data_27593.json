    "content": "When I ask Google assistant to set a reminder I want it to remind me with a different sound from the default notification sound. I opened the Google app, tapped on more, then settings, then notifications. Scrolled down to Reminders, Advance then Sound and selected Twinkle from Pixel Sounds. However once I've set a reminder with Google assistant, it reminds me with the default notification sound and not Twinkle. Setting sound to Twinkle in Google Calendar worked for its reminders and events, alerting me with the Twinkle sound. Can you please help me with getting Google assistant reminders to play a different sound from the default notification sound?",
