    "content": "With Do Not Disturb enabled and blocking notification sounds, is there a way to allow an individual app permission to make a notification sound?\n\nWhen I go to bed, I want to silence most sounds and notifications.\nHowever, when my Ivideon app (a security camera) senses movement and sends a notification, I want that notification sound to be heard.\n\nThanks for any help you can provide.",
