    "content": "I have bought a new pair of USB-C earphones. When I use with my Pixel 5, I hear a lot of static noise, especially at the lower volumes.\n\nHowever, when I use the same USB-C earphones with my laptop, they work perfectly (no noise). So, the issue doesn't seem to be with the earphones themselves.\n\nAlso, however, when I use my old 3.5mm jack earphones with a 3.5mm to USB-C converter on my Pixel 5, I also don't hear static noise.\n\nAny suggestions on why my new pair of USB-C earphones give so much static noise with my Pixel 5?",
