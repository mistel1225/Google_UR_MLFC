    "content": "Don't know why but pixel launcher gets shifted up and down in uncertain times. This is very disturbing at important times and when accessing apps. Very dissatisfied and disappointed with this bug. \nI hope google solves this and send some patches to resolve this bug.\nCheck the SS and there are still more different issues with launcher shifting up and down and turning screen black upto the half. Very hard to describe. ",
