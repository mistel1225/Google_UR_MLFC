    "content": "Yesterday, I'm guessing due to the phone screen unlocking while in my pocket, the Favorites tray which is normally at the bottom of the Home screen moved to the right side.  While I can move individual apps to and from the Favorites tray, I cannot seem to move the entire tray as a whole in order to move it back to the bottom.  Any ideas?\n\n(As a surprising aside, this is one of the rare issues that I have not been able to find a solution to via Google searches, Pixel community searches and etcetera.  Hoping that someone can point me to the solution)",
