    "title": "Does the google pixel EUROPEAN model include the power adapter suitable for europe plugs in the box",
    "content": "I bought a phone from a Vendor in Greece, that told me that the model is the european one, but when i unboxed the device i found out that the chargers plug was American and not European. They gave me an adapter from their shop. So my questions are:\n\n1) Will i still be able to use the warranty in case that something goes wrong?\n2) Does the European model comes with a european plug inside the box or there is not such thing? \n\nThanks a lot in advance,\n\nMike Rallis",
