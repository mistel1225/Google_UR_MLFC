    "content": "Hi,\n\nI had to factory reset my devide, as I lost my pin.  After factory reset, I entered my Google account details, but it still needed the pin.  I got stuck in a loop where it kept on asking for a pin until it wiped by backup.  It has now changed, where it says the device requires a my google account details.  I am entering my account and my password (it is an active account) and I am verifying that it is me on my new device, however, it is again stuck in a loop where it requires me to type in my google account password.  \nThe error says something like \"Something went wrong\", then it goes back to the screeen to add my google account.\n\nThe phone is actually a Nexus 6P (wasn't on the drop down).\nMy Google account is active.  I am using it on my new phone.  It is definitely the correct password.\n\nThank you\nLeon",
