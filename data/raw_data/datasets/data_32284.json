    "content": "Hi, I'm having problems with the Bluetooth on my phone. For some reason, my phone's Bluetooth will connect to my devices (my headphones) but I can't hear anything. It's not my headphones, they will connect to any other device and I can hear music through those headphones, just not with my phone. I tried almost everything. I tried disconnecting and reconnecting my headphones with my phone. I tried restarting my phone, but that didn't work. I tried clearing out my memory cache then restarting my phone. I tried forgetting my headphones on the Bluetooth but that didn't work. I would appreciate any help. \nThanks",
