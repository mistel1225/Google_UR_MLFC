    "content": "I was out walking this morning listening to a podcast on the Google Podcast app and after an hour the assistant kept coming on as if I was holding the button down for assistance. I restarted my phone (P3XL) and that worked for about 10 minutes. Tried listening to music on the YouTube Music app and experienced the same issues. I was pissed. Had to finish my last mile in silence. Hopefully they get this cleaned up quickly. Anyone else have this happen to them?",
