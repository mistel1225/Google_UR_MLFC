    "content": "I have a Pixel 2 XL and am having a hard time getting the camera to focus properly and take good pictures of my foster kitten, which I need for his personal ad. Usually the camera on this phone takes excellent kitten pictures in varying levels of light and activity. This kitten has dark brown to black fur. Typically dark cats are typically harder to photograph, though I have one that is mostly black that I regularly get great pictures of. I've watched a variety of videos on how to improve the pictures (direct sunlight, simple background, no flash, adjust exposure, focus on eyes). Still, it's not helping. \n\nI've tried portrait and the regular camera mode, as well as adjusting the exposure and shooting with direct sunlight on the cat and behind me. I'm tapping the screen to focus. Is it simply too dark or that I need additional direct light on him? Other than a couple of pictures, most came out blurry or low detail, which you can see in the gallery of pictures I took today. Any thoughts on how to get my little guy some great pictures so he can find a good family to adopt him? With kittens, time is of the essence, because they're most adoptable when they're really tiny and cute. \n\nAlso - a Black Cat Photo Mode (or black dog) would be a brilliant feature for Pixel phone cameras to have.",
