    "content": "Every time I open Google Chrome I notice an outlined Red Star in the upper right corner. So I click it and it shows that Chrome has an update, New Version Available. With a red circle with a white arrow pointing up. So I click it and obviously it takes me to the Google Play Store to Update Google Chrome. I click the green Update button and for a couple seconds it turns grey as if it is attempting to update and then turns right back to the button being green and says \"Update.\" No matter how many times I click update it won't update. Can anyone please help?!?",
