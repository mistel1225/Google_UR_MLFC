    "content": "I just noticed I have a ton of apps that have Wi-Fi Control turned on. They supposedly allow each app \"to turn Wifi on or off, scan and connect to wifi networks, add or remove networks, or start a local-only hotspot\"\nI thought my phone was supposed to scan / connect to wifi -- not individual apps.  This seems like a security risk (and potentially use battery from all the scanning). Why do I need apps to individually have this feature? What happens if I remove permissions?",
