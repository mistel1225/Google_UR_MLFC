    "content": "Does anyone else find their pixel 3a's screen very dark? \n\nI had a moto g5 plus, which is a budget phone and I usually have the brightness at 30-35% when inside and up to about 60% Outdoors. Ever since I switched to the pixel 3a, I find myself using the phone at 70-75% indoors and would need 100% brightness when I'm out. \n\nIf I put my pixel 3a next to my moto, the 70% brightness on my pixel 3a looks darker than the 35% brightness on the Moto.\n\nI find this very unacceptable as the pixel 3a is superior in every other way except for the screen brightness. \n\nJust wanted to see if it's just me or do other users also find this to be an issue.",
