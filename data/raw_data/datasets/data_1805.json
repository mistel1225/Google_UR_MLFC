    "content": "All of my pixel 3xl sensors is stucking , no more douple tap to turn on screen , no more adaptive brightness , on calls it doesn't detect ear to turn off display and no more active edge isn't working until I restart my phone , after restarted it fixes but some times later problem is appearing again. In case if you suggest me to relaunch it in safe mode .. i tried but after restart it is fixing and i have to wait for it some time like 1-2 hr",
