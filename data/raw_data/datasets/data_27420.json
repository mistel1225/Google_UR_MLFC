    "content": "When is RCS being rolled out to Pixel and Pixel 2 devices? Also, the other Android devices that are severly lacking a sufficient messaging service? It's been quite a while since it rolled out to Pixel 3. A lot of Pixel and Pixel 2 owners would greatly appreciate if this could be rolled out soon, especially since Allo was killed off. I have Verizon, by the way. They're waiting on Google to provide them the necessary platform to roll out RCS to the rest of Android devices.",
