    "content": "I just received a Pixel 4 XL and as I was enrolling into MDM with Android Enterprise, I Factory Reset phone, only to find that the Recorder App is nowhere to be found. I web searched and found the package name is com.google.android.apps.recorder, but this is not on the Google Play Store. Where do I officially download this App? When will it be on the Google Play Store, as I need to download it from Managed Play Store? Thanks.",
