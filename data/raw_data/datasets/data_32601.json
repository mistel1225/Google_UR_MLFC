    "content": "I'd like to use an LG brick wall USB A charger I have with the original pixel XL. It is rated for 1.2 amps and 5 volts. I am not concerned about speed of charge (which will be slower) but safety. \n\nI've done as much reading online as possible but get a mixture of advice on whether this is safe to do or not. Will it damage/overheat the charger? Will it damager the phone?\n\nPlease could you advise.",
