    "content": "I have been trying to use Astrophotography for a while, but not able to as there's no pop up when Night Sight is being used. When I first bought the phone(December 2019), it worked couple of times. I had been to a trek in February 2020 where I tried to use Astrophotography mode, but the option didn't pop up. Recently I even bought a stand and focused the sky, but still didn't get the Astrophotography mode.\nPlease help in this regard",
