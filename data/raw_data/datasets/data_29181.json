    "content": "Hi guys,\n\nMy name is Michael. I am a Belgian citizen, but I bought a Pixel 3XL in a Mediamarkt store (authorised Google Hardware dealer) in Aachen, Germany. As the Pixel phones are not available in BE.\n\nNow my phone broke down, I think the battery is broken. When I plug in my phone he charges in couple of seconds to 100% and when I unplug it he dies instantly... \n\nNow I'm trying to get the device back to Google under guarantee but I am not able to contact anyone or file a claim for this, since I'm currently in BE and no Pixel support is provide in BE. I don't mind driving or sending my device to Germany or wherever. But I cannot find help anywhere?\n\nReally hope you can help me!\n\nThanks in advance.",
