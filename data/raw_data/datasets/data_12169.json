    "content": "I've had my P5 (sorta sage) for about a week now and noticed that the bottom corners of the phone are starting to become shinier, like anything plastic (e.g keyboard turning glossy after years of use). Is this just a fact having a plastic coating on my phone or is this a QC issue? \n\nAnd yes I do tend to keep my phone fully naked.",
