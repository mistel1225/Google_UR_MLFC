    "title": "Within the last few days, my phone (original Pixel XL) has started turning the media volume to max",
    "content": "The media volume on my phone keeps setting itself to the maximum level. It does this repeatedly on loop. \n\nI will be scrolling through twitter, or messaging someone and suddenly the volume \"slider\" pops up and the volume goes to max. If i drag it down, it immediately goes back to maximum. \n\nHas anyone had this and managed to get it to stop?",
