    "content": "I accidentally turned on the talk back setting and i didnt know what it was at the time so I tried to restart my phone to get rid of it. When I tried to turn my phone back on, the message read, \"Your device is corrupt. It can't be trusted and may not work properly.\". So far nothing that i read online has worked to fix it. I tried to go into recovery mode to factory reset it but the dead robot shows up and says, \"No command\" and when i try to start it up normally even though it says its corrupt, it stays stuck on the google start up screen frozen.",
