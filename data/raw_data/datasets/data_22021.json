    "content": "Well no more Google phones for me ever. My pixel 3XL that's only 1 year and 3 months old bricked on me the other day. My local fix my gadget store wants around $400 to fix it. I've never dropped my phone, never seen water, had a case since day one and screen protector. I understand anything mass produced you're going to have 1-2 out of 10 with issues eventually, but I've never had a phone die like that shortly after a year.",
