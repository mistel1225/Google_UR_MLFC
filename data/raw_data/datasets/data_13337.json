    "content": "I've already backed up and freed up space using google photos but it doesn't seem to be clearing up the space on my phone.\n\nI cannot find Chat support on my Google Pixel as well which is quite frustrating because I was able to access it just a few months ago.\n\nThis issue started occurring with the recent Android 11 update.\nI have a Pixel 2 XL.\n\nPlease see screenshots for reference. All my whatsapp, and viber images have also been backed up and synced on Photos",
