    "content": "I have a Google Pixel 4a, and have had no issues connecting it to the Bluetooth in my car and making calls until the other day. \nNow when I try to make a call, it starts ringing and then disconnects on the car saying \"An error has occured\", whilst the phone calls for a second and then says the system is busy, try again later. I haven't had any issues previously with an iPhone, or with this phone. Can anyone help please? Thank you\n ",
