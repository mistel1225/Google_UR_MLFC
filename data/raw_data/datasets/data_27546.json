    "title": "2 problems: 1. Poor charger connection 2. Not receiving text",
    "content": "Issue 1: Poor charger connection \nIn order to charge the phone, I need to have the phone in one hand and the charging cable in the other so that it doesn't fall out. I have tried 4 different cables including a new one.\nI live in Chile so I haven't been able to claim my warranty \n\nIssue 2: Not receiving text from online services \nI do not receive messages from service providers. In particular, the apps and services that sends a text with a code in order to proceed in the given wizard. For instance Googles Duo app. I need to type in my Chilean phone number but I never receive the text from Google. The same happens for Twilio, Twitter, etc. I have spoken with my local carrier several times and they have assured me that everything looks fine from their end. I do receive these texts if I insert my sim in any other phone. My phone is registered on the Chilean network. Even my wife's pixel 3 receives these texts but mine doesn't. So it narrows it down to a pixel 2 problem. \n\nHow to solve the above 2 issues? \nI may go to the USA in November if it would be possible to revise the device",
