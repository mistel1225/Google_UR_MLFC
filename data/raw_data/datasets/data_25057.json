    "content": "Hello! Let me know if this is the wrong place but ever since I got my 3a a few weeks ago, I've been disappointed with the battery life. The stats are below. The \"Averaged per complete charge\" are completely inaccurate as I've never hit > 4 SOT, ever. I don't really know what to do at this point because I've tried cleaning out everything I could. \n\nThese stats are on a regular work day, light usage. Texting, 2 or 3 calls, etc.\n\nbattery stats\n\n\nAny tips?",
