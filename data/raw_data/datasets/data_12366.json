    "content": "I have a first-generation Pixel XL. I'm currently in Mexico, visiting from the U.S., and while using the phone this morning (while a passenger in a car), it suddenly went black. Now it will not turn on, or charge. I have tried all the recommendations made by Pixel Phone Help: plugging the charger into an outlet; plugging  the USB charger into a USB port; holding down the power + volume down buttons at the same time for 30 seconds. I *really* need access to my phone this week, so any suggestions appreciated!",
