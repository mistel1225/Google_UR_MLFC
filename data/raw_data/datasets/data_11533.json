    "title": "Unavailability of Google pixel 4a in major locations of India",
    "content": " Google pixel 4a not being delivered by Flipkart at majority of locations including Bangalore or Delhi. There sincerely seems some problem either with stock made available to Flipkart by Google or resourceful distribution by Flipkart. I  have been trying since day 1 of its launch in India and my location/ any location in Bangalore is always alien to Flipkart especially delivery of any Google mobile for that matter. I humbly request you to confirm whether I need to wait further if there is any chance of its availability or it is better to proceed with some other brand like Apple Iphone 12.",
