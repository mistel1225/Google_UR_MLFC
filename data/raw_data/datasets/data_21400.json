    "content": "My storage was almost full, 99 or 100%(would automatically change). One of my apps wasnt working properly so i thought of restarting the phone. And since then it has been on bootloop forever. I read posts about sideloading and how ppl's issues got sorted who had the same problem, but mine to no avail. I tried sideloading with quite a few OTA images but some were aborted, some were installed but yet no success. I do not want to lose my data. is there any way at all to get the phone started or at least recover my data somehow. Also After sideloading in the recovery mode for a while the new software is shown and then when i again go to the recovery mode after trying 2 or 3 times, the last software update ((QQ2A.200305.002, Mar 2020) that i had installed when the phone was working is shown. Is there any solution to this...just want to recover my data. Dont care even if i dont get to use the phone post that. Utterly disappointed and fed up with google..just want to avoid doing a factory reset and get my data back..i am really tensed because of this issue.",
