    "content": "After installing the March Google update I faced an issue on my Google Pixel 4a: each time I'm listening a song using a player like HiBy or Onkyo with an external DAC and a bit-perfect mode turned on, my phone \"freezes\" and then reboots. When this mode is turned off, everything works fine. Could you please help me to solve this issue?",
