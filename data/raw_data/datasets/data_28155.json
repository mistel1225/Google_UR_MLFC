    "title": "Camera Shooting JPG + RAW - but RAW copies from last 5 days missing?",
    "content": "Title summarizes it pretty well. I'm traveling internationally at the moment, and I like to shoot in JPG + RAW so I can properly edit my photos. However, going back through the folders, I have the JPG copies but not the RAW copies for the last five days. My camera is still set to shoot both, so they must exist somewhere. I tried clearing Google Photo's storage and cache, and that did not work. Tried rebooting - didn't work. \n\nAny thoughts? \n\nThanks, \nZ",
