    "title": "Music stops and Bluetooth connection drops when I plug my phone in to charge",
    "content": "I've reset my phone. Redownloaded Spotify. Basically if I'm playing music on my Pixel 2 XL and decide to plug it in for a charge the music would stop after a minute or so. This also happens if I've connected the music to a JBL speaker or my Bose earbuds. Also, the phone starts lagging once in plug it in to charge as well. Slows down, jitters, the keyboard won't show up. It's really frustrating.",
