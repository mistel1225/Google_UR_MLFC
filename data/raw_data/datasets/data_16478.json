    "content": "Hi I have not updated to Android 11 I like to wait until most bugs are sorted out after recent updates from the play store just app updates one of them was Google's own Google app at 150 mb very large app update I've been experiencing strange behaviour my phone has become slow and laggie I'm experiencing weird battery behaviour my phone is heating up on charging nothing new to that I don't  wirelessly charge my phone I am aware of the swelling battery issue if I use my phone during charging my phone cools down a bit and still charges this doesn't make sense if I leave my phone to charge it remains warm to hot until it hits 90% then cools until it hits 100% and is fully charged in use after charging I'm getting strange battery drain my phone will drop 5 to 10 % when the phone is in use weather I'm just browsing chrome or YouTube I have no explanation for this it doesn't matter if I'm watching a video a podcast or looking up the score of a game this is just one or two minutes of general use not watching half an hour of a podcast or reading several articles online possibly the large Google app update was to counter act what seems to be a very buggy android 11 release",
