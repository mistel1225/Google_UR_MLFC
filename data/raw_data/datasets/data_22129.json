    "content": " I have a pixel 2 xl and it won't boot up? It is in a never ending boot loop.  I get the graphics and then it just spins for 20 to 30 minutes without ever booting up. I believe I was able to get it to the restart bootloader and recovery mode and barcode and start selector (safe mode?) but no matter what I select can''t seem to boot.  Ideas?",
