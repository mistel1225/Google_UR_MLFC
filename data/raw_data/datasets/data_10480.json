    "title": "Pixel 3 not starting after battery low. Shows white screen with Google logo & switches on and off.",
    "content": "After the battery died its been showing a white screen with Google logo and that screen has been flashing on and off since then. I heard a vibration when I put it on charging so thought its charging but no changes in behaviour after I kept it for charging whole night - screen with google logo still flashes one and off. I tried pressing the power button and lower volume button, that shows me the another boot mode but as soon as I released the buttons the screen goes away and shows the google logo screen again and then same flashes on and off - Not sure if the battery is not charged or something else.\n\nAny suggestions?",
