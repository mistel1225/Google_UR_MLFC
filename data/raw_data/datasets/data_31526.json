    "content": "SIM card is cut down from a micro SIM, so the full SIM number isn't visible on the card.  Apparently the ICCID is supposed to be in SIM status under About, but when i look there and scroll down it's not there. There's not even an ICCID: unknown listing.\n\nSIM is from Tracfone, I need this info to port to another carrier",
