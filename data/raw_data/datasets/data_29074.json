    "content": "I have been trying to contact google all day trying to find a resolution. My parents purchased a phone for me (from amazon) and it looks like it was resold to us. The phone is under warranty, but I am being forced to provide the information from the original seller (order number and original email) which the seller does not to provide, citing security issues. I cannot get google to budge on this- they do not want to help at all, even though the device is in warranty. I am in dire need of a resolution to this and have escalated but I don't know what other options I may have. I need help, if anyone can help me please I am open to ideas!",
