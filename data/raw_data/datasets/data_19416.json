    "content": "I'm trying to connect my bang and Olufsen Beoplay E8 earphones. They were connected previously but the left earbud would keep dropping out so I thought I would disconnect and restart everything to see if that helped. I also removed all previously connected Bluetooth devices.\nI have finally got the earbuds to connect after 2 hours of trying and the phone saying pairing rejected or couldn't communicate. Despite being connected, there is no media or phone options below so I can't actually use the earphones. Is there anything I can change in the developer settings that may fix this? Please help I got these last month as a birthday gift anyone experienced this or know how to fix? Thanks.",
