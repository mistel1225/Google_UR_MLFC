    "content": "Hi,\nOnce I connect my Pixel 4 to my home wifi internet speed gets super slow, basically not working (500kpb).\n\nNot only the Pixel 4 is super slow but as well all other devices connected (e.g. Mac..).\nOnce I disconnect the Pixel 4 from the wifi, all other devices are working full speed.\n\nAnyone able to support? :)\n\n- I tried both 5 GHz and 2.4 GHz WiFi\n- I already reset WiFi in the System Advanced Settings\n- WiFi Signal is Excellent\n- All other devices have no issue with the wifi\n\nThanks!!\n\nG",
