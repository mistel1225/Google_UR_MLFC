    "content": "I have had an original model Google Pixel for the last 3 years. For the last week or two, almost every time I have made or received a phone call the phone has frozen, crashed and entered into a boot loop. I can send/receive text messages without issue. I have attempted a factory reset as well as launched the phone in safe mode to no success. Is there anything else I can do?",
