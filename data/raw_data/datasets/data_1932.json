    "content": "During a call, when I put the call on speaker mode and my daughter speaks; the person on the other side of the call isn't able to hear my daughter well. No matter how loud she speaks. However, when I speak; the audio is clear. Very strange issue but annoying for a branded device like the Google Pixel.",
