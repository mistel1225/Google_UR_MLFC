    "content": "About two weeks ago my Pixel2 XL stopped connecting to devices/vehicles. In my job I drive different vehicles during the week and like to be able to connect my phone via bluetooth. The issue I have is I'll select pairing on the vehicle and go into connected devices/pair new device on the phone. I'll be able to see the vehicles bluetooth name and I try to select the name, it highlights, but nothing else.\n\nIf I use a USB cable and connect through Android Auto I'll get messages on the vehicle head unit that it can't connect bluetooth (which should be automatic with Android Auto).\n\nI've deleted all previous connections on the phone and in the vehicle to no avail. I've rebooted the phone multiple times as well. Any assistance would be appreciated.\n\nThanks in advance.",
