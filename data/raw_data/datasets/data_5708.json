I then have to drag the icon to the bottom where it will disappear.\n\nThat extra step is very annoying considering all the  junk calls that come in.\n\nIt never did this before. It just started recently, so I assume there was an update. But is there someway to make it stop?\n\nThis is an example of two different disks that are left behind.",
