    "content": "Can't just press power for the ability to take a screenshot since the last update. Now I have to press two buttons - power and volume down together. That is very difficult for someone who has arthritis. Can't pull down and swipe to take a screenshot either.\n\nPretty miserable since I used that feature often. Just pressing power made it so much easier.\nCan I get rid of the update that caused the problem?",
