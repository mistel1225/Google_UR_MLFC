    "content": "This issue just started last night. Every time I plug in to charge it shuts down immediately. It constantly switches from charging to not charging. I can power it back on. Sometimes it shuts down immediately, sometimes it shuts down after a few minutes. Sometimes it stays on, however, I don't have a network connection. If I unplug it, the network connection comes back immediately. Sometimes it also shuts down immediately when I unplug it.\nI have tried 4 different chargers/cables including 2 chargers/cables that came with my 2 different Pixels. I have cleaned the ports, I have rebooted.\n\nThere are too many people having this issue right now. I believe it is something to do with the latest updated. We need a fix ASAP",
