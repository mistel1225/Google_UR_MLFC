    "content": "My wife and I recently switched to T-Mobile. I have a Pixel 4A and she has a Pixel 2. we are both able to call and text other people without issue but but my wife has been unable to send text messages specifically only to me since we made the switch. she is able to receive my text messages but none of her text messages get sent to me. We are both able to text anyone else and we are also able to call each other along with anyone else so the issue seems specific between my phone and her phone using Google messages. We also confirmed another texting app worked fine so the issue appears to be specific between each Google phone specifically when using Google messages.",
