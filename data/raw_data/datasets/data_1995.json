    "content": "My Pixel 4XL is no longer switching on. When I keep the ON button pressed, the \"Google\" logo appears for a bout 2 second and disappears. When I do the same why plugged into the Power cable, I can access the \"Fastboot mode\" but as soon as I let go of the power buttons, it switches off. \n\nAccording to https://store.google.com/de/repair I still have warranty, however at the end of the process, I cannot contact Google by Phone or Chat. The links just point back to the Support center. I am spinning in circles. Please help.",
