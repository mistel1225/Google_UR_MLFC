    "content": "The screen stays on during calls so that you can mute, end call, change to airplane mode, etc with your cheek while on calls.  I have reset the device 3 times, tried without the phone case, but it still does this.  No cracks or visible damage to the phone.  It  just started yesterday and I've had the phone for a month.",
