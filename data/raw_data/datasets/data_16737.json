    "content": "I recently purchased a Google nest mini from flipkart India and after using it for a few days I found that my device isn't working properly. \nwhen I try to speak it's wake up word it sometimes don't respond and sometimes it start responding while I am talking with someone else. Also it's too slow when it comes to asking something or playing some music/news. \nHence, I want to return my google nest mini which was delivered to me on 31st of August 2020 and it's still in return period.",
