    "content": "Music won't play through the Google brand USB c to 3.5mm jack adapter. I've tried with 2 different dongles. Instead of playing music in the notification bar it displays that the phone is \"charging connected device via USB\" and won't switch out of that mode. Restarting phone doesn't work. Don't want to hard boot the phone for a stupid issue like this.",
