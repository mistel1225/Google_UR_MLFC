    "content": "Since a couple of months I have a Google Pixel 4A 5G. I read on the internet that this model doesn't have acces to 5G in The Netherlands yet and I was wondering when there will be an update so that I can have 5G as well. I have 5G in my data plan and it is enabled on my phone. Please let me know if you have any info on when I will be able to use the 5G network on my phone. Thanks a lot!",
