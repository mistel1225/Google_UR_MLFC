    "content": "My phone suddenly turned off and I can't turn it on anymore. I tried all the methods mentioned in the support, but they do not work, the phone still does not turn on. Sometimes the red light is on, I charge the phone, then try again and still no reaction.\nI am shocked, because after 2 days I have a trip and I planned to take pictures on my Pixel, but now I do not have such an opportunity. I bought this phone in Russia, and I have my warranry, but I don't realize where I can get a support?",
