    "content": "Hi\nMy Pixel 2xl camera suddenly stopped working in Mid/Dec/2020. When I turn the rear camera on I get a black screen or the error \"something went wrong\". Front camera was completely OK. \n\nAll the routine checks were tried with Google support team and was finally decided the device needs to be sent to the Mumbai repair center for detailed diagnosis. (There is no repair center in Delhi/NCR!) (Also Device collection process was painfully annoying but lets ignore that) \n\nDiagnostic team of B2X reported that the Rear camera module, front camera module and USB port had to be replaced with a Rs9000 repair charge. \n\n1. Anyone else faced this kind of issue? \n\n2. The service support team says front camera and USB replacement cost is mandatory. Why? Esp when the front camera was OK just before the service?",
