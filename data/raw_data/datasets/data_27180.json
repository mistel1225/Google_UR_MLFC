    "content": "Hello Team,\n\nMy Pixel 3 was powered off and when I tried to start it but it wouldn't boot. I tried charging the phone and all other rebooting techniques but it didn't help. About 14 hours later the phone booted for a minute and again it shutdown. I was able to reboot it again after a couple of mins but it stopped again. the phone is still powered off and I'm unable to power it on again.",
