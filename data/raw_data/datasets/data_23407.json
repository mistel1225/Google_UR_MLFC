    "content": "Since I have upgraded my Pixel 3 XL to Android 10 in September, its screen turns black when I listen to phone call or voice message. It is irrelevant to screen protector because I have tried to tear it off, the issue still exist.  I can't use the number pad when listening to call, so I can't dial to any hotlines, very troublesome to me.  I am very disappointed because Pixel 3 XL was the flagship phone, but it is not compatible with Google's own OS.  Please advise me asap or I will choose other os, so I can solve the problem!",
