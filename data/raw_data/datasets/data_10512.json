    "content": "I have setup a voip/sip connection in the native phone app. It works well for sending and receiving calls using voip.  However i want to set it to \"ask first\" when making calls so I can choose if it is a carrier or voip call.  When I make the setting it does not work and just dials with the carrier.  Additionally, there is no setting for UK calls via carrier and international calls via voip.",
