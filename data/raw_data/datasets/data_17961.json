    "content": "The back of my Pixel 4 XL appears to be separating from the phone. I first noticed it two days ago. If my phone is face down, I can push in the top right corner of the back of the phone down a noticeable distance. This appears to be affecting other Pixel 4 XL users. Is there a way to issue a replacement phone? It is unclear to me how this issue can be fixed.",
