    "content": "I had given my Pixel 3 XL for repair on 4th of September 2019 as the front wide angle camera was not working. Case ID [5-9389000027145]\nIt was repaired 3 times and I had to reject the device the first 2 times as they didnt even fix anything and just returned the device. On the third time, the issue was working so I accepted it. After 1 week of using, the device became unusable - Not able to connect to network (both mobile and wifi), battery would die suddenly and a lot of new issues. So I gave for repair again on 23rd of October, and till now they are delaying the repair. It has been over 2 months and I dont have the device. The support channels in India are pretty bad - the primary email will respond after 1-2 weeks, the pixel-escalation-support id doesn't even work i.e. no one responds. Is there any escalation point that I can take this up with?",
