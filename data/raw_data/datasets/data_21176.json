    "content": "I have tried all these suggested fixes from Google. Such as factory reset, deleting new apps, and backing up the phone. None of these have worked. The phone keeps turning itself on and off. It also opens the camera by itself after buzzing a lot. And it will also bring up the options for Google pay with the restart and shutdown buttons at the bottom of the screen randomly.",
