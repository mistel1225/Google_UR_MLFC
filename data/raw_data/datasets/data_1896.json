    "content": "My home screen keeps going blank after I scroll to look for the right app. All the apps disappear from the screen. I can still see the background and I can still access notifications but nothing else\n\n\nI've had to restart my phone three times today to resolve this. The last time it wouldn't restart I had to do the hard restart.",
