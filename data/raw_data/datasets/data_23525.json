    "content": "For the last few months, I've been experiencing terrible battery life on my Pixel 3 device. It is worse than any other device I've ever owned. Checked for malicious/outdated apps and there are none. Restarted in safe mode and still no help. Tried restricting background usage on so many apps. My battery usage shows sharp dips in the battery levels and that probably proves the issue. Can somebody help identify the exact error? I can post the screenshot of the battery levels. I just use a bunch of normal apps like fb, insta, YouTube, Whatsapp. I definitely do not wanna factory reset my Device and check.\n\nPFA the screenshot. Just FYI: I never charge my phone to full 100% so don't be fooled by that 3 days ago.. :) ",
