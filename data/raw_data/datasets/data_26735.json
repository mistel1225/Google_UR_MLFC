    "content": "I originally had a Google Pixel (purchased right after it was released) and had no issues with photo and video storage in Google Photos (cloud side).  However, I upgraded to the Pixel 3XL and now I'm getting notices that I'm out of storage.  I look at the Google One storage analyzer and see that 10GB is from Google photos.  I do not upload any other pictures or videos from other devices.  Any ideas???",
