    "content": "Recently I suddenly can't hear the other party halfway through the call. It seems to happen multiple times on one call and with other calls it never happens. I am usually in my house where there is a very good signal. Other times it happens when I'm not home but it's not a dropped call as they can still hear me. I spoke to my service provider and they told me it was my phone and not them.",
