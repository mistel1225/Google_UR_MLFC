    "content": "Google Pixel Android keeps shutting down with 37% or more battery remaining. Things l have tried 1) replacement phone 2) replacement sim card 3) operating in safe mode 4) factory reset (multiple times). Nothing has worked and it's getting worse. Today it shut off with 57% battery remaining, then when l plugged into charger and restarted, battery display showed 11%. As far as l can determine, it's not one of the apps. Verizon gave me a new phone, so it can't be the battery... I'm at a loss, please help. Thanks.",
