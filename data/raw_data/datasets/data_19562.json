    "content": "I have never been so disappointed with a product as I have been with my  google phone.  My phone is under warranty and stopped working. I was told the whole replacement process would take 5-10 days from start to finish.  I sent the phone back for a replacement and after 3 weeks all I keep hearing is that my case has been escalated to the  \"specific team\", \"the higher team\", \"the team\", \"the shipping and refunds team\", \" the product specialist team\", \"the store order management team\", \"the shipping team\", \"the google store team\", \"the Higher Support team\", \"\"the Google support team\", \"the Escalation team\", \"the Tier 2 team\", \"the google store management team\", \"product specialist\",  \"one of my colleagues\", \"limited team\", \"the people handling the escalation\", \"a representative\", \"the representative supervisor\" now I am told they have \"specialists\" working on it.  I can't even tell you how many times I have been told it is being processed and I will get an email with tracking and shipping information.  I get no emails back. They obviously don't have a replacement for me.  So instead of admitting that,  they keep giving me the run around.  There is no accountability.  The public needs to know that when you purchase a google phone, it comes with NO support.  My phone is still under warranty.  I have sent them the warranty statement off their website stating if the phone is under warranty, I can get a full refund. They have recognized that I asked for a refund but have done nothing to make it happen.   So they have my money and my phone.  This is not right. This is such a scam.  No wonder they are worth so much, they have our money and our devices.  Since they are a HUGE company I mean nothing to them.  I have had 156 e mail conversations  with google support team since June 13 and this is still not resolved even though they state they are always \"happy to assist you\", \"and thanks for your patience and understanding\" and \"please give them 24 hours to update you regarding the status of your request\"(which never gets done).  Now I am being told to \"reply to the email of the representative who's working on your case\".  After 156 emails I have no idea who from the above mentioned \"teams\" are working on my case.  I was even told \"It's a good thing that you already sent back the device to us and we received it already\". What is that supposed to mean?  Now they are asking for my \"consideration to give us a chance as we continue to work on your concern\". How hard is it.  Put a replacement phone in a box and mail it to me or give me a refund.  Stop wasting everyone's time. Again, How do I get a replacement phone?",
