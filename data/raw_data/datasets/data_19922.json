    "content": "My pixel 3 simply will not turn on at all. I tried following all the steps I saw but it still wont turn on. i tried using multiple chargers which i know work because they charge my other devices fine, i tried a wireless charger for about an hour and still no luck. I've held down the power button for 10-30 seconds with nothing ever happening. I also tried ringing myself and plugging it into my pc but it still does nothing. My phone has never been in contact with water so I am not sure what caused the problem it happened over night. There weren't any updates that were going to be applied. I also don't know how to get my serial number to apply for a rma request since it wont turn on.",
