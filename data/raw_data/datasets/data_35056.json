    "content": "I needed to call 911 and my pixel XL would not let me. An error showed up saying can't verify location. My location is on in my settings. It just did a repetitive beeping noise. I eventually tried on my husband's pixel and it worked.  I tried several times. This is obviously a serious issue and I need it fixed asap.",
