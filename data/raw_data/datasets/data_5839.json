    "content": "According to the Help article, it seems Google only supports 5G in the 13 regions where the phone is sold. Is there any way to enable it in the 100+ other countries/regions in the world? If it's really only available in those regions, that's a huge limitation when roaming that a bunch of people are going to notice once travel becomes widespread again. Please advise ðŸ˜¥",
