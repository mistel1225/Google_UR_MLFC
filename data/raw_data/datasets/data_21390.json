    "content": "My wife has a weird problem with her 3a. She has the screen timeout set to 30 seconds, however somethimes the phone ignores this and keeps the display on untill she presses the power button and then the screen will turn off.\n\nThis can be fixed by restarting the phone and the phone's screen timeout will work again for maybe a day or so but then the problem will come back.\n\nAnyone else had this?",
