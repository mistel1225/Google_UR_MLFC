    "content": "A couple of days ago my pixel 3 stopped working with any 3rd party chargers. The chargers charge other devices, my pixel 3 is the only device they do not work on. I have been using the chargers for years without issue until  now. The chargers are from reputable brands such as Anker.  The charger that came with the phone does still work. Any ideas on how fix this?",
