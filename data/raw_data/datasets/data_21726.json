    "content": "My Google Pixel 4XL will shut down when the battery is below 50% when playing certain games like Coin Master.  The first time it did it the phone was very warm so I thought it overheated.  The other day I had just started it playing it maybe it had been about 5 minutes and the battery was in the 40s and it shut down the phone wasn't even warm.  Any help or suggestions are appreciated.",
