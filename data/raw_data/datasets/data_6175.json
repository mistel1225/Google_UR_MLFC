    "content": "There is a big colored circle with the 1st letter of the contact's name in the Favorites view.  The colored circles in contacts view is a normal size.  I have looked through settings and found nothing that explicitly affects the Favorites list.  I can make everything on the phone super small, but that renders the rest of the phone unusable.\nI want to use the \"Favorites\" list for people I need to call frequently.  They are NOT people who are my favorites in my social life.  This is my work life!\n(Also, why is the favorites list not alphabetical?  The order is random.)  The Favorites list was useful on my old Samsung phone.",
