    "content": "Ever since a recent update, I've had a weird issue. Most of the time now when I hold down the power button in order to open the menu that allows you to restart the phone, take a screenshot, change the card you're using in Google pay etc, before the menu has time to open the screen will turn off, as if I just tapped the lock button instead. A similar issue occurs when I try to hold the volume down button and power to take a screenshot, even if I make sure to hold down the volume button first. I feel like the most rational assumption is that this is a hardware issue, but I'm not entirely sure and don't know of a good way to check.",
