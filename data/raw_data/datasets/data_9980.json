    "content": "I purchased a Google \"Cardboard\", put it all together and then tried to use it with my 3 XL.  Well, it did 'work', except for one thing:  I couldn't \"select\" anything, even during the setup/configuration for it.\n\nI posted a question on Amazon (where I purchased it) and everyone just kept saying \"You just need to press the button on the upper right of the 'Cardboard'.  That would be great, but I don't have a button there!  It DOES have some 'magnets' on the LEFT side (not top, but side) and you are supposed to be able to just 'slide the magnet' to select things.  It's supposed to use the 'magnetic field to 'click' things when they are highlighted (not sure if that's the way the 'button on the top right' worked either).\n\nHowever, it does nothing.  I have tried putting the phone in the other direction - still nothing.\n\nIn addition, the whole for the camera doesn't seem to line up properly either - seems like it would for my old Samsung Galaxy (I traded in), but not the Pixel 3 XL... \n\nSo, I am wondering, what OTHER VR type headsets ARE compatible with this phone?  Someone else told me the \"Daydream\" would, but then in reading reviews I find that 1) It's discontinued   and 2) It's not compatible with the 3XL after all!\n\nSo, anyone out there have a 3 XL and using it with VR headset, it would be great to know which one(s) line up properly and/or have a way to 'choose' something (button, remote, whatever) when the VR software is running.",
