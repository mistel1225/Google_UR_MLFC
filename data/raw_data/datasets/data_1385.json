    "content": "Hello,\n\nMy Pixel 3a will not power up and is humming.  Sometimes the humming sutters like Morse code, sometimes it stops, and sometimes it just continues for minutes.  This started when my phone battery power was down to about 10% and I tried charging it in my car using a recently purchased cable.\n\nThank you,\nAlan",
