    "content": "Hi,\n\nPixel 3 forward camera is fine. \nSelfie mode is not working in Camera App or any app using the camera. \n\nUnless I use 'Playground' mode in the Camera App - it works fine then. Weird but makes me think it's purely software issue???\n\nI have tried Safe Mode and deleted storage/cache. Really don't want to do a factory reset as I have work accounts linked to it which were not easy to get set up. Is there any other option?\nOn latest Android 11 version. No outstanding updates.\nAnd, this was the same before I installed Android 11 so not related to that. \n\nAny suggestions?\n\nAidan.",
