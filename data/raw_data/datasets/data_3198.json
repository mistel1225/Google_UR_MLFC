    "content": "Hello in Greece all people has a problem with 5g and volte, in setting I use 5g connection but the Phone works only with LTE, I spoke legally with my mobile network provider (Cosmote) and these support 5G network, and the problem they told me is my mobile company support Phone (Google phones pixel5). It's unfortunately to sell a device without supporting the capabilities of the device, when there are much cheaper device on other device with full 5g support.\nOther devices are not intended for Greece, but they have made sure that all their functions work, and in communication they make sure that they have an immediate solution and not an excuse, It's racist for other countries to have support and others not, as the Czech Republic is not in them, another has been resolved and they normally have 5g. If this is your tactic, you should mention in the market that the device will have all the features in the elite countries of the world economy, and in countries that we consider low in the economy, only a part of the features of the device It will work properly. It's very sad.",
