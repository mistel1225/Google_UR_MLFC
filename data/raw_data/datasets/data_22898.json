    "content": "Hey everyone) My pixel started to make weird noises. I've read the same topics, but in this case I think that it is happening because of Google app, check this out - https://photos.app.goo.gl/q4nUQaDzhHitc2UU7 . You can also notice, that Google turns on geolocation while phone doing those sounds. I tried to turn location off - didn't help, still random noises. Really strange bag.",
