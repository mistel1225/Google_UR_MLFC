    "content": "My Pixel 3a is one month old. It had been working fine I suppose other than the annoying android glitches that happen from time to time. (Text messages longer than 1 text would not go through to wife's Pixel 3a). Anyhow, phone was down to 15%, I plugged it in to charge (Pixel 3a charger), 30 mins later the phone rang once, I went to pick it up and it was dead. Like it had shut off. No lights to indicate charging, no clock showing on screen, it was dead. I unplugged it, tried to reboot. Nothing. Tried holding the power button even longer 1 minute, nothing. Tried recovery mode, volume down/power button, nothing. Called google support, they had me retry all previously attempted fixes and nothing. They finally gave up and now I'm supposed to take it to U BREAK I FIX, SMH. Never had a phone go dead on me like that. No other Android has ever done that. Yeah, I've had phones crash or suddenly power off, but I've always been able to reboot them by one of the methods above. They didn't even offer to replace with a new one. If the repair shop can't fix it, they'll send me a refurbished one. Again, SMH, I paid full price for a new one not a used refurbished phone. This stinks!",
