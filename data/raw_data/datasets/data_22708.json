    "content": "I am getting this strange display when I put my pixel on the pixel stand. It's almost like a video or podcast is playing, but none are. I've tried restarting, closing all apps, I've even deleted apps I thought it could be (google podcasts, youtube etc...). Never seen it before, only started happening today.",
