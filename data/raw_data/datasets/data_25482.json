    "title": "Google says pixel 2 phone is flagged, and cannot be fixed under warranty",
    "content": "We purchased two phones through the Costco around 14 months ago, so still under the 2-year manufacturer's warranty. About 6 months after purchase, my phone had a charging port issue, which was RMA sent to Google for repair, and sent back to me. No issues there. \n\nNow, the same charging issue is happening with my wife's phone. After about a week of back and forth with Google support, we have been told that my wife's phone is flagged, and cannot be repaired under warranty. They would not clarify what that means or why it was flagged. Very frustrating, as it feels like I'm getting the run around with Google.\n\nIf anyone has thoughts or suggestions I would appreciate it. Thank you.",
