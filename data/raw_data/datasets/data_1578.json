    "title": "Gmail: Failed to download attachment, please try again",
    "content": "For the past few weeks, Gmail will not download or show attachments.  Sometimes, I just get the download square, that just stays stuck at 0% until I cancel it.  Most of the time I get a nearly instant notification that says \"Failed to download. Please try again.\"  I've found other posts on this site and elsewhere making suggestions (clear cache/storage, uninstall updates, reinstall updates, check permissions, restart in safe mode, etc.) but nothing seems to work.  Also, I haven't really found any \"recent\" posts regarding the issue.  I REALLY don't want to do a factory reset, as it's such a pain to re-set up the whole phone, so I'm hoping there's some other options I'm missing.  As I'm on the road quite a bit, being able to read my email, including the attachments, from my phone is kind of vital.",
