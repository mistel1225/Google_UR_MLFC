    "content": "My phone keeps playing notification sounds even when it's on vibrate or silent. I've tried setting notification sound to \"none.\" The only way to stop it seems to be to turn down the media volume. The issue is I don't always remember to turn off the media volume since it's not supposed to control notification sounds. It's become extremely annoying. I've tried safe mode as well. Please help?",
