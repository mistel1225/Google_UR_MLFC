    "title": "Volume of incoming audio messages on whatsapp too low",
    "content": "Every time I receive an audio message on whatsapp I have to increase the volume to 100% to hear anything. Even then, it's not nearly as loud as anything else (like music or a youtube video). \nIt's incredibly frustrating to have to turn up and down the volume all the time depending on what app I'm using.\nI upgraded from a pixel 3 and I did not have this issue there, so it's definitely something new with the pixel 5.",
