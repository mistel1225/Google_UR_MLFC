    "content": "I am trying to find any resources that google may have that could help me with a donated laptop for college. I am 38 yrs old and finally mad the big decisions. I lost both my jobs in March like many of us and started college the same week..I actually got sick with covid and had to take a break ..I spent my last 300$ on a Lenovo chromebook for school and the keyboard is not working properly. I have worked hard my entire life and never asked anyone for help like I have had to here recently. They say it's not the fall that matters, it's how you pick yourself back up..well I keep getting up and pushed down. I haven't received any unemployment benefits in months because, well they are understaffed and overworked. I am not only facing eviction but I'm not sure how I will buy my next bar of soap..I have been trying to sell everything I have . My husband is a veteran and his benefits are being delayed as well..if anyone could help me find some resources for my needs I would greatly appreciate it ..I am depressed and at my breaking point. I don't think mental health can take much more. Thanks for listening.",
