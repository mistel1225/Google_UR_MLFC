    "content": "I bought my pixel 3 xl in November 2018 and just checked the phone by removing the case cover. The back panel is lifted from left side and appears to be due to swollen battery. I have always used the google power brick and had never used a 3rd party wireless charger. The phone is out of warranty. Where can i get the battery and the back panel replaced. Should i stop using the phone? Will it explode?\nFurther there is no water and dust protection now that can result in internal components being damage.",
