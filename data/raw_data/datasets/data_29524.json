    "content": "Hey everybody, \n\nIn advance, sorry for my English I am French. \n\nLast Saturday I bought a Pixel 3XL and when I launch I got the following message (see attached picture). \n\nI tried to go back to the vendor but they told me that everything was alright and that I should relock myself the bootloader or even leave it like that. \n\nMy concern is about warranty, if I try to fix it myself; is it possible that I break/lose the manufacturer's warranty ? \n\nAnd seeing this message makes me think that this phone might be refurbished and sold as new...\n\nDo you guys have any ideas ? \n\nThank you in advance for your messages and have a nice day !",
