    "content": "Less than a month I got a new phone.  Now I noticed that the screen is at a right angle yellow.  I change the angle, tilt the phone and the yellow hue disappears.  I have turned off the night mode completely.  Adaptive color adjustment is also disabled.  What is it, a defect in the factory screen settings, a system bug or a defect in the screen itself ???",
