    "content": "Hi everyone!\nSo, I am now using the Google Assistant to automatically listen to some news after my morning alarm. That's super cool, awesome feature, life if great so far.\nBut then, later the same today, let's say 4 pm, I start listening to some songs on Deezer using the Pixel's headset (the white one that comes with the smartphone). \nThe problem is: if I pause the song using the button on the headset, and then I click it again to un-pause the song, instead of that it resurrects the Google News app and starts to play the news again. Totally weird!\n\nIs there any way to make sure that it does what would be the obvious choice?\nThanks!",
