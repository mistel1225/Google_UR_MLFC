    "content": "After updating my phone on latest security patch of July 2019 suddenly 3.5mm USB dongle (original) stopped supporting my pixel 2xl. Whenever I connect it shows charging via usb which makes no sense. It neither allow me to switch to \"this device\" when try to adjust settings of usb. Even tried in safe mode still no luck. Got a replacement adaptor from google as well but still issue is unresolved.",
