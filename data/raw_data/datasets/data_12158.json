    "content": "I first noticed this issue on Microsoft teams and put it down to that particular app. The app works flawlessly apart from when I load an attachment such as a word document then the scrolling of the document just jitters. \n\nI have now found the same issue on my banking app where the scrolling jitter isn't as bad but it is still noticeable through all parts of the app.",
