    "content": "Last week I managed to crack a screen so bad it required me to send it in for repair. Before sending it in I performed (what I thought) to be a backup and factory reset my device. I send it in, and get a new device backup today. It is not the same device as I sent in. I go through the normal activation with my old SIM and run into a couple of issues that required me to call Verizon support. Currently the tech thinks my device has not been made available to the Verizon database as acceptable (though it shows it is Verizon enabled). I don't know that this is related. I can't connect to 4G/LTE or wifi yet.\n\nThe problem lies with the backup I thought I created. It is not available in my backup list, only my Chromebook. From what I have gathered the backup should be there. Even if it weren't the most recent I should still see one, right? Does the factory reset affect this? The new device? The lack of actual wifi set up? I had a recovery email set up but I don't think that's where my backup was located. I'm just truly lost. The whole point, to me, of a backup is to keep it there. A Google rep on chat indicated that the backup may expire which is 2 weeks. It's already been one. What else can I do? I set a backup to be able to recover everything and when I delete my device via factory reset it deleted the backup?? That's not the point! \n\nHappy to provide whatever info I can.",
