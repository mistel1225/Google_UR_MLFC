    "content": "My phone is just over 2 years old and technically out of warranty. I read where people have been able to get a free replacement due to the defect.\nBut I can't find a way to talk to support to request this. I either get to where it says I'm out of warranty or I just keep looping around the \"how to contact us\" and getting the same pages of info with no contact link.",
