    "content": "Hi all,\nIf I get a call while I am streaming Spotify on my Nissan 370z, the Bluetooth just disconnects from the car's system. There is no way to answer the call on my Pixel 2XL without putting it on speaker. If the call lasts longer than a minute the system reconnects to the phone again automatically. \n\nThis issue only started post-Android 10 updates. it worked perfectly before that. \n\nI have disconnected, re-paired, factory reset the phone already. Not sure what else I can do.",
