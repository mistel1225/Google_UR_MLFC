    "title": "Can't transfer data from old Pixel to new Pixel 4a",
    "content": "I recently upgraded from Pixel 1 to Pixel 4a because my old Pixel was having battery life issues. The problem is that I can't transfer my data over to the new phone because my old Pixel will die within a minute if I unplug it from a power source. Even if I wait until battery is fully charged. This includes connecting the cable between the two phones to initiate transfer. Is there a way to still transfer my data to the new phone while keeping my old one plugged in? Maybe via PC or NFC? Any help would be appreciated! Thank you",
