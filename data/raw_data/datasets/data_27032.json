    "content": "On my Pixel 4 I'm able to turn off WiFi and data on from the locked screen without having to unlock it first, and also turn off and restart the phone at will. On my Galaxy s10 I have to unlock it first in order to do any of the things I mentioned above. Is this normal on Pixel? This is my first time using it. Please let me know what you think",
