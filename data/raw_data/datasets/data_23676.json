    "content": "When you press the sound level on the side of the phone a \"settings bar\" appears on the right side of the screen with volume settings.  At the bottom of the bar is a small rectangular  icon that  looks like a keyboard - push it once and a line goes through it, push it again and it goes away.  I haven't been able to figure out what this does........anyone know?",
