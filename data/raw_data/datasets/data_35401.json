    "title": "Pixel (1) 128GB online manual & way to find/filter Pixel (1) help online - Pixel 3 'hits' are first",
    "content": "Trying to find a Pixel (1) manual (?)  to read - figuring what questions to search for online is terribly inefficient & effectively out of date if find content is for a different model and Android version. I guess with any phone an OS update makes a manual outdated immediately, but I need to learn Pixel in an orderly way, not search for random questions based on trying to translate past experience with iOS 'terminology'.\n\nI just bought an unopened Pixel 128GB (first edition)...I don't need a '3'. Switched from iPhone and despite having used Android tablets, I have to figure some very different things out. Some Android 9 features in this phone don't even match (random) help content which could be for an earlier version.\n\nAn example:\n\nI really want to use the AF/AE lock touchscreen feature I had on past phones, and which Pixels supposedly have. It updated to Android 9 upon first powerup & touching the screen doesn't lock focus; it brings up Google Lens signup which is actually turned off/not installed in my settings. If I search for AF lock, I get latest Pixel 3 help or outdated 2016 Pixel help apparently superseded by OS updates. Maybe the feature was taken away. I'm temporarily trying other camera apps that have manual focus sliders...a workaround.\nI assume Pixel 3 hardware differences from Pixel (1) are potentially as significant as differences between OS versions.\n\nNice phone, just a bumpy learning curve.\n\nThank you",
