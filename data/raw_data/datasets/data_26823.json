    "content": "I've run many many speed tests, using both pixels and the same SIM card. Not once has the pixel 4 been faster, mostly 2mbps at least slower. This is made even worse when I put my Spigen case on it ! It reduces another 2mbps.. so not only is it slower but gets worse with the case :(",
