    "content": "My battery life used to be ok lasting all day no problem but is now very poor, the battery app says a full charge last 6hours 45 mins. I'm not 100% sure but this may have been since the update to Android 11.\n\nEven it I don't use the phone the battery goes down at the rate of 10% per hour, obviously if I use it even faster. \n\nHad a look at many reports of similar problems but no resolution it appears. \n\nI've tried running in safe mode, removing apps, rebooting, running in airplane mode, looking at battery historian for any potential bad apps but nothing so far has helped.\n\nAnyone had success rolling back to Android 10 ?",
