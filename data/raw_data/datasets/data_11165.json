    "content": "5g wont work on my pixel 5 in Qatar. Google doesn't sell the phone and i get that. But in any case the bands for 5g are supported by Pixel and Ooredoo (Telecom) then why did Google block the 5g!!!! Many people travel around the world what's the point of giving 5g and then it wont work !! All iphones work with 5g here this is shame for google ðŸ˜ .",
