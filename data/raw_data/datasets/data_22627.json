    "content": "So to describe my issue: Anytime I type the letter 'i' in the middle of a sentence, it does not capitalize anymore like it used to.\n\nI've seen this issue posted elsewhere before, but nothing I tried solved it\n\nHere's a list of things I've tried.\nReset the phone\nUninstall and reinstall updates\nRemove entire personal dictionary\nSet the shortcut of 'I' to be 'i'\nI only have English (US) but I switched to another English, then deleted English (US) and then added it back and deleted the other one\nDrag and dropped the small 'i' to \"Remove from suggestions\" which didn't work\nText correction is on\nSpell check is on\nLiterally everything on every Reddit thread with this issue\nTried joining the Beta to see if that would help the issue (it didn't)\nUpdated the Pixel 4 XL to the latest software updates\n\nFor real, I'm stumped.",
