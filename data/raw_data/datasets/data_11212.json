    "content": "My PIxel3 overheats and shuts down when using GPS, playing music, or during video calls.  No other apps are in use at the time.  The phone is not charging.  The most recent time it happened, the phone was not in its case.  The room temp was around 72F.  The overheating and shutdown happened within 10 minutes of the start of a video call.   In previous contact with Google support, I was advised to simply use it less.  That isn't a real solution.  Does anyone know if the issue can be remedied?  Or is time to switch to a different phone.  This is my first Google phone, and I've never experienced these issues any of my other phones (all iPhones). Also - could the extreme overheating be a safety issue?",
