    "title": "Does the Pixel (2XL) volume problem still exist, and does casting make it worse?",
    "content": "I'm casting to a newly purchased Google Max from my Pixel 2Xl and am really disappointed at the low maximum volume! I set it to 10 and am not impressed--I can hear faint clipping and had to back it off. The loudest cast volume is about what I get at 4-5ish when I go directly to YouTube on the Max.  This is a bummer; I cannot use my phone as a cast control device. I end up getting alternate streams (YouTube playlists) when I give voice commands to the max, instead of the very music that I want. Get it together Google!",
