    "content": "I have multiple email accounts on my device. I want only ONE of them to display and sync contacts. Even when un-selecting the \"sync\" feature for the other accounts, they still show up. I deleted the accounts, re-added them, then immediately turned on airplane mode, un-selected the sync feature, but as soon as I turn on airplane mode, they sync.",
