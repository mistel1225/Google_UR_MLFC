    "content": "I have a pixel 2xl. Recently it had developed a fault where the USB c port wouldn't respond to the headphone adapter. It has been approved for a replacement and I'm currently waiting for it's pick up. I just wanted to know approximately how long the whole replacement process will take. As in how long after I send my phone will I receive the new device. The person I contacted from the google support team wasn't too clear on this.\n\nThanks!",
