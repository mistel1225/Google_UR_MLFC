    "content": "A while ago the top speaker on my pixel 4 randomly started to sound tinny and blown out.\nthen a couple of weeks later it happened to the bottom left and today it happened to the bottom right.\nI'm barely able to hear anything over the distortion. I haven't even owned the phone for a full year yet\nI don't really know what to do or how to fix it. Any suggestions?",
