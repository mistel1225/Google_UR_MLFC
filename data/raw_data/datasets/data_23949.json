    "content": "I purchased a new pickup within the last few months.  I connect my pixel 3 xl to the Uconnect system via usb for Android Auto.  I frequently use this for hands free calling.  After talking with someone for 5 or so minutes all of a sudden they cannot hear me.  I can hear them.  This happens on a majority of my calls.   My phone is up to date along with my Uconnect system in my truck.  Anyone experience this with other systems besides Uconnect?  Anyone have a fix for this?",
