    "content": "I have a new Verizon prepaid Pixel 4a cell phone and the carrier notifications wont go away.  After long press the notification, it says \"carrier setup these notifications cant be modified.  I called Verizon and they blamed it on Google and said it takes days to disappear when GOOGLE is updating their system.  Is this true, or just an excuse to get rid of me or should i return the phone for a Samsung?",
