    "title": "Pixel 2 battery depleted during data copy to Pixel 5",
    "content": "During initial apps and data copying when setting up a new Pixel 5, the battery of the source Pixel 2 is rapidly depleted. Can this procedure be continued after recharging the P2? I have tried twice, the second time after a factory reset. The copy only managed about half the photos and videos (of which there are almost 14000) and nothing else. I suppose I could remove copying these from the list and copy them manually, assuming I can find as many as the copy procedure.\nAny help would be greatly appreciated.",
