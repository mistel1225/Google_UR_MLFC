    "content": "Lately my phone has been freezing up when using some of my everyday apps. I've exited out of them and restarted to no avail, and then it wouldn't recognize my network/ data. \n\nAfter all of this occured I dropped it accidently, today, I'm clutzy, but my case protected it like usual. Had to restart again, but It wouldn't start go past the first or second screen, did a factory reset to get it going again, but still the same issues are occuring... Can't recognize network or ands all factory approved apps won't install. \nAny help you can give would be appreciated. \n- Arielle",
