    "content": "I was trying to figure out if my emails have been hacked or my Google accounts, because I've had somebody access them and add a bunch of dating websites that I never participated in or tried to gain access to. So I think that someone is either spoofing me or they're gaining illegal access to my Google account through a server somehow using malware. I was having a conversation with one of the Google people and then I had to reset my phone and then I got cut off from them.",
