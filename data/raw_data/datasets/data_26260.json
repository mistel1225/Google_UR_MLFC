    "title": "Pixel 2 XL won’t connect to LTE on Verizon",
    "content": "I have a Pixel 2 XL with Verizon. It constantly runs on 3G, regardless of where I am, including while other phones on the same plan and network run on LTE.  It is updated and for awhile, I was able to use the “airplane mode” trick to for it back to LTE but that has stopped working as well. \n\nI’ve been to Verizon and they’ve replaced my SIM card but it did nothing. I’ve also placed the new SIM card into an extra Pixel 2XL (both phones have previously been active on Verizon and have run LTE just fine). A return trip to Verizon and another new SIM card has them saying the phone is somehow corrupting the SIM card, which is their explanation for why neither phone will connect correctly. \n\nI’ve googled trying to find similar problems, but all I’m finding is broken or damaged SIM cards throwing errors, nothing about the phone (any phone, not even Pixel specific) corrupting the SIM card. \n\nIs this something that happens and how do I fix it?",
