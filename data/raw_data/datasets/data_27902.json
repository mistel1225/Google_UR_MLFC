    "content": "Recently updated my pixel 3 to Android 10 and I've noticed the following software issues:\n\n- phone calls sometimes come up under silent notifications even though the phone is ringing. I'm not given the prompt screen to answer unless I swipe down to notifications\n\n- when connected via Bluetooth to a car or speaker, sometimes while on a call the Bluetooth toggle button to go from BT device to handset or speakerphone does not work\n\n- Answering a call on speakerphone requires me to yell or put phone directly to mouth for other party to hear me, sometimes the other party cannot hear me at all for about 10 seconds, even if I take call off of speaker phone. \n\n- Do not disturb does not toggle on automatically using a defined rule at all anymore, and needs to toggle from the notification shade.\n\nNone of these issues occured in Android Pie\nRebooting does no rectify these either.",
