    "content": "When tethered to another mobile device, the internet on the 3XL works perfectly except for downloading a system upgrade. Does the 3XL detect that its wifi connection is coming from a mobile device and therefore blocks the download so as to save the data on the other mobile device? If so, can it be unblocked?",
