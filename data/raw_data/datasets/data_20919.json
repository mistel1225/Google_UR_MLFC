    "content": "A lot of issues with the Android Pixel 4 XL and posting text messages in online discussions.\n\nMost sites have a little text box to enter reply and often when I click on something to fix a word or add a word it jumps to the top of the page and you have to scroll all the way down every time you touch the box.\n\nAlso many times when I go to enter text it starts writing over the words or letters next to where I'm entering text like you toggled insert on a keyboard or something but this is on the phone.",
