    "title": "Fix to no sound on Pixel 4 after Android 10 update",
    "content": "I recently updated my Pixel 4 to Android version 10 and now I get no sounds at all with alarms, only vibrating. My volumes are all set right and do not disturb has never been turned on (picture below). When on the screen from the photo, I can move the bar to hear the sounds for media and call but nothing on the ring and alarm bars? I've done a factory reset and nothing, I've deleted the storage and cashe from the clock app and nothing, I forced stopped the app and tried uninstalling the apps updates and also reinstalling to try other ways and all hasn't worked. Also realised when I call others or they call me it's extremely quiet and when put on loud speaker nobody can hear me and I can't hear them at all. \n\nPlease find a fix asap! Missing alarms made for work and being extremely late, very annoyed at this update and used to love this phone!!",
