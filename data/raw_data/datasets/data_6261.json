    "content": "I have two weird problems one is with cameras and the other with the ear speaker both of them fail when my phone restarts and need to restart a lot of times to get them to work although in the cameras subject I can only make the main camera to work, front face camera sometimes work but just for seconds before going black, keep in mind that I already have wiped out the phone twice, and also followed the common steps like erasing cache and storage and updating etc.",
