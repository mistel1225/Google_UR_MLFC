    "content": "When a call hangs up I get an incredibly loud beep, regardless of volume setting. It's so loud the sound is distorted (e.g. top end of speaker power/sound output).\n\nI have tried disabling the microphone permission as per this: https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/9476624?hl=en\n\nI don't have snapchat (as per the 2017 bug). \n\nMy 'SIM Toolkit' doesn't have any permissions to disable.\n\nI don't mind a little, gentle tone. But this thing is INSANE.",
