    "content": "Since the most recent OS upgrade to Android 11, \"starred contacts\" no longer ring through when Pixel 2 is on DND. My phone is the 64GB model; however, I would like to mention that this same feature is STILL WORKING CORRECTLY on one of our phones that is also a Pixel 2, but is the 128GB model. \n\nIs there something different about how the update is working on these 2 different models?\n\nI see several reports online of this same issue being reported after the update to Android 11, so do you know if a fix for the OS is going to be pushed out soon? Thanks!",
