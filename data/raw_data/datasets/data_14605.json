    "content": "I bought a pixel 4a and the camera was amazing but as soon as I updated it to android 11, the rear camera became blurry. It doesn't focus at all except with close objects.\n\nI made sure all apps were updated. I cleared the camera's cache. I restarted the phone. Even on Safe mode the camera takes blurry photos.",
