    "content": "I have tried resetting bluetooth, un-installing and re-installing the google app, a full hardware reset.  If no app is streaming, or any app other than npr one is streaming, then I cannot hear the google assistant prompts through my car bluetooth.  If the NPR One app is streaming, then google assistant works just fine.",
