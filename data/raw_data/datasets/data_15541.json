    "content": "When I rotate phone to landscape and press the button to change view everything is fine but when I want to go pack to portrait pressing button does nothing. If I will click as fast as I can as soon as this button appear phone will eventually rotate but if not I should rotate it to landscape and back in order to this button to show again. I made a sensor test and all sensors including accelerometer and gyroscope is working properly. If auto-rotate is turned on it rotates properly as well, the issue occures only if I use this pop up button. Any idea how to fix this?\n\nI'm on Pixel 2 XL with latest Android 11.",
