    "content": "I am considering buying a Pixel 2 XL.  I want to connect it to a computer running Windows Vista for tethering (Pdanet) and for transferring files such as photos.  Are any needed drivers available for Vista?  Under Device Manager, Portable Devices lists \"Android Phone\" and under Disk Drives there is \"HTC Android Phone USB Device\" (my current phone is an HTC Thunderbolt).  Obviously these are old, so I figure they will need to be updated",
