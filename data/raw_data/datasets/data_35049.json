    "content": "Vzw recorded the call, over an hour. It was shockingly bad, even vzw couldn't believe it. I've been loyal over a year contending with charging issues,  they send replacement and it bricks less than a week before a business trip. This is the second device. Google needs to hear their custom service reps reply. Unreal, may be forced to switch brands which I regret.",
