    "title": "Pixel 3 issue - \"connected phone does not support phone book importing\"",
    "content": "I have a new Pixel 3 phone and I've gotten it connected to my car (2018 Acura TLX) with Android Auto.  However, I have been unable to sync the phone book and call history.  When I attempt do to so, the car gives me the message \"Connected phone does not support phone book importing.\" \n\nPreviously I had an older Samsung Galaxy 7 connected to the same car and had no issues with call history, phone book, or SMS integration.  However none of these features work with my Pixel3, and I haven't been able to find any settings or advice that can enable them. \n\nAny help or suggestions is much appreciated.\n\nThanks,\nJohn",
