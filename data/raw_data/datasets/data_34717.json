    "content": "For the last two weeks, my Pixel 2 XL won't allow me to use the camera app. Everytime it opens it's just a black screen for a few seconds, then closes. I've tried uninstalling the last 5 or so apps I installed, tried it in safe mode, still the same response. I finally did a Full factory reset today, and it still doesn't work? Anyone else have any idea what to do?",
