    "content": "Pixel 3A XL , no display on phone.  \nWife was using phone and phone locked up. Touch was unresponsive so I held power button for 10 seconds to reboot. Once it did no display appeared, like the pixels are all dead on display . I did multiple soft reset, no display at all on boot. Phone is on, I can feel it vibrate and there are a few live pixels at top of phone that light up but the rest of it is dead and unlit. More than likely will need to RMA.",
