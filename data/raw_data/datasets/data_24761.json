    "content": "I'm using my Pixel 3 with a USB-C audio/power split adapter.  I'm getting left channel audio leakage into the right channel and vice versa.  I've tried several headphones and 2 different split adapters and the problem remains.  Ive notice the same problem with other Android devices as well.  Anyone else having the same issue?",
