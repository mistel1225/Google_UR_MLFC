    "title": "How do I get my Pixel 4a 5G to use my cochlear implants instead of the speaker?",
    "content": "In \"Settings | Connected Devices\" I can see both of the processors for my cochlear implants listed.   However, I am unable to get my Pixel 4A 5G to send any sound to my processors - it insists on using the phone's speaker.\n\nIn \"Settings | Accessibility | Hearing Aids\" it says \"No hearing aids connected\" ... and it provides no way for me to select my processors that are already listed in \"Settings|Connected Devices\".    Part of the problem is perhaps that I don't have hearing aids, I have cochlear implants and the phone does not know how to deal with cochlear implants?   My processors are \"Nucleus 7\" made by Cochlear.\n\nI would like to permanently turn off the speaker on the phone and have ALL sounds go to my processors.",
