    "content": "My phone is unusable as a phone unless I have a headset. The other party hears an echo of everything they say. This did not always happen so I assume it is a software issue. I also assume Google is avoiding admitting it because I can't find any good answers. \n\nSupport is non-existent. Going through the motions just directs to this forum (always says chat is closed). And others with this issue don't seem to have answers.\n\nSo Google here is your chance to redeem yourself. How am I supposed to use my phone if it doesn't work as a phone?",
