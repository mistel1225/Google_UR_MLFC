    "title": "Is my battery malfunctioning or is it a software issue. Original Pixel 5\", phone dies at 90%",
    "content": "Things have been troubled for some time. First issue was phone not turning on unless I tried over 10 times. This lasted for several months, then went away after an update /patch. Then awhile later the phone would get warm while I used it and it was plugged in. Also the screen touch was random and chaotic. This lasted for a couple months, then went away after updates. Then after Dark mode update, my phone would die randomly if I used the camera at anything below 65% battery. Then it started happening with any app. Then the percentage started climbing. It has now crashed after coming off 100% after 10 seconds. Once plugged in it shows a random percentage of battery. Could be 2% or 88%.\n\nI don't have a backup phone, so I don't want to reset unless it will actually solve the problem. How can I know if my battery is bad? Is there a way to test it while the phone still has my data on it?",
