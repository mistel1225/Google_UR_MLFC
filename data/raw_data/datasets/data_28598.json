    "title": "Pixel 2 XL microphone stopped working (after it turned off due to heat)",
    "content": "Started using the phone on Thursday (3-14) and everything worked fine. Friday (3-15) morning I woke up to the message attached. \n\nDuring the day I realized my microphone wasn't working because people hung up on me and I couldn't send audios through WhatsApp or Telegram and the google assistant didn't work.\n\nI don't know if these two events are linked (though I've read that heating could cause the microphone solder to fail).\n\nI've already tested the microphone on safe mode and did a factory reset with no positive result. The OTHER microphones work on loudspeaker and when taking video.",
