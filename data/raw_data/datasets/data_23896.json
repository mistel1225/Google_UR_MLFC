    "content": "Just got my Pixel 4 a few weeks ago and, so far, I have not been impressed with my Google camera. It seems to click and stutter every time I try to frame a shot and the same thing occurs when taking videos. It seems like it could be a focusing issue, but I am not sure. \n\nI have tried booting up my phone is safe mode, I've cleared my camera cache, and restarted my phone. I've even factory reset my phone all to no avail. The camera still clicks and stutters. What do I do now?\n\nHere is a short video showing what happens:\nhttps://photos.app.goo.gl/h7MZ4NAmJCY6UWaN9",
