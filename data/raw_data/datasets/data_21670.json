    "content": "I updated to android 10 and now no media will play out of the speakers on the device. When I click ringer it plays a sound with no issue however when I try to use Spotify or YouTube or anything no sound comes out of the speakers - I was playing music fine a few hours ago and the phone has not had any water damage or been dropped.",
