    "content": "Trying to scan fingerprint for unlocking. \nIt WAS working, then became intermittent, then said sensor was dirty.  \nI deleted 3 previous fingerprint imprints, and it stopped working entirely. \nWhen I try to setup a new imprint, it doesn't register at all, in the past it used to tell my to move my finger around but now it just sits there.\n\nI tried:  (after cleaning my own fingers :)\n- cleaning with old non-moistened T-Shirt - no good.  \n- cleaning with dry paper towel - no good. \n- cleaning with moist (not even damp) cotton swab - still no good.\n- restart in Safe Mode - no difference.\n\nI wanted to know if there's anything else I might try before doing a factory reset.\nIs there an app that might test the sensor or something?\n\nThanks",
