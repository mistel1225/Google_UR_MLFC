    "content": "I continually receive duplicate notifications for the same things across many apps (Gmail, WhatsApp, others). When I clear the notification bar those notifications will reappear shortly later again. What's more, when this occurs my smart watch notifies me as if I'm receiving all of my unread emails at once and/or other app notifications at once. How an I able to configure this phone to not repopulate cleared notifications on the notification bar and not re-alert me regarding old notifications.  I find this remarkably frustrating. Thanks for your help.",
