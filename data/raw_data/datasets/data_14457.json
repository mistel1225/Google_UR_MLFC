    "content": "I returned my pixel 3 because the screen started flashing green and short color lines started appearing.  I did not drop it.  Per their instructions I did not mis represent the phone.  There were no cracks, it would boot and it was very clean.   I received a $40 credit when the site offered a $90 credit.  I had not dropped it.  I wanted to hold out for the pixel 4a 5G but finally settled for the motorola power.  I don't like it much because the camera sucks compared to the pixel 3.  I also find it  larger than I liked.  My plan was to get the motorola until the pixel 4a5g was shipping.  Now I don't think I want to bother.  Not sure I will stay with FI either.  My phone met the criteria for the higher value and if not Google needs to update the information rather than pretend they will provide the credit they will not.   This happened with my original pixel too.  They are providing false information.",
