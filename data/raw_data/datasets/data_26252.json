    "content": "Hello! I purchased a new Pixel 3 Phone back in December, no issues right away. Over time, the camera started rippling, shaking, and not focusing when using the camera  for pictures and video. The phone also had a notification issue that caused the phone to go max brightness when receiving a new notification.\n\nWe did an RMA, got a refurbished phone sent out. It was locked, had a pin when starting the phone. Tech support didn't know how that happened and couldn't fix the issue. They had us return that phone and sent out another  phone. The second phone is refurbished and has a few issues as well. First, it freezes and you can't do anything until you restart the phone. It has happened 5 times in the past two days. Second, when trying to use the camera, it was all black. No picture came up and I had to restart my phone in order to use the camera.\n\nI called support and they didn't know how to help me without seeing the issue. I am going to work on getting a video of the issue but I can't keep on having this happen with a phone that I spent over $800 on when I came over from Apple and am on my last straw before going back. I am leaving for my wedding and honeymoon in a week. We have been working with customer service since the beginning of the month and they promised the issue would be resolved before we left with no help.\n\nIs there any way to get a new phone instead of a refurbished phone so I don't keep on having these issues? I don't want to get into a cycle of having refurbished phone after refurbished phone sent to me.\n\nThanks,\nAleksandra",
