    "content": "Hi there, \n\nmy phone fell on the floor (10cm? because I was seated already) and suddenly went black. I notice when I click on the power button that it vibrates - same if I insert the cable charge. I try to touch different part of the screen with more intensity to see the light coming up at some parts but nothing. I also click on the power button/volum up for more than 30s and nothing changed.\n\nI called my phone number and get the vocal message so I assume it's turned off? \n\nThank you for your help here!\n\nPauline",
