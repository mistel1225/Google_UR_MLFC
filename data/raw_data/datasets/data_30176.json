    "content": "My Pixel 2 Xl that I bought at launch is shutting down while charging and will not charge at all with the original charger. Steps I have tried:\n1. Various other cables/chargers both in a wall outlet and via my PC. All will charge the phone but the phone powers off. If I am just using the phone not charging it will keep working fine until I go to charge it again.\n2. Tried the charger the phone came with including the original cable an it does not charge at all.\n3. Made sure all updates were done/complete and none pending.\n3. Tried soft reset, hard reset, factory reset AND booting in to recovery mode and doing a factor reset from there.\n4. Tried blowing out the contacts of the USB-C port with canned air. No difference.\n\nPlease help.",
