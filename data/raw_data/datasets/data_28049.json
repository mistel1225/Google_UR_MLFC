    "content": "So, I have the following issue.\nI purchased my Pixel 3A from Spain store while I was there. Now I live abroad, but I will soon be in Germany for couple of weeks.\n\nI know I can send the phone for repairs, but I wanted to ask is it possible to send it from Serbia (where I currently am) to Germany for repairs and then pick it up in Germany from my friends address when it's done.\n\nSince I'm not sure it's going to be done while I'm there.\n\nThanks for any info.",
