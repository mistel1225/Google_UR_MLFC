    "content": "It's been 4 months now, I cannot charge my pixel 2 due to the same charging port issue which has struck me twice. Google services support is worst in the world. They are unable to understand my issue at all. All they give excuse is lockdown and can't take service request\nWhat lockdown are u talking about, all business are open everywhere. It's just a big mistake I did in buying a Google phone ☹️",
