    "content": "I recently reset my phone and now I have an alarm icon that will not go away. I use alarmy for my daily alarms and I have already told that to not display next alarm. How do I disable that for Google as a whole. If I shut off all arms it goes away, but having to remember to turn my alarm on defeats the point of having it set to repeat. Anyone know how to get rid of it?",
