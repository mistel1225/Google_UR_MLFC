    "content": "New Pixel 3 bluetooth issue - can pair my TomTom with it, but for some reason it cannot pair with my Plantronics device.  Have tried turning off wifi, turning location on and off, trying to connect in other locations in case other wifi is interfering,  resetting network settings, using NFC, and all the other tips in the forums, but no matter how many times I scan, the phone will not recognise the headphones.  The headphones work with my Huwawei and my Samsung phone perfectly so it's not the headphones. The pixel works with my TomTom, so it's not the bluetooth.  Any ideas?",
