    "content": "Hello Google Community,\nI would like to ask some questions regarding the warranty of Google Pixel.\nI bought Google Pixel 3a from Taiwan Area, but I will use the device in Indonesia.\n1. Is the warranty from Google is International Warranty?\n2. Will the warranty be able to be used in Indonesia or Other nearby countries (like Singapore), in case there is something wrong?\n3. If it is not international warranty, I heard from a friend of mine that I can change the warranty coverage area to other country. Is that true? How is the procedures?\n\nThank you very much for the help.\n\nWega",
