    "content": "Bluetooth completely stopped working after android 11 update. It worked just fine before. After the update I started getting constant \"bluetooth keeps stopping\" messages until I turned off bluetooth scanning. Bluetooth will not turn on. Phone support to Google was of no help whatsoever. Told me to check if I was still under warranty so as to get a new phone. On my own, I did a factory reset which made no difference. I would like to go back to android 10, but support tells me this is not possible. I'm very angry at Google support. They don't seem to care.",
