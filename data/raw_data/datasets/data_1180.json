    "content": "Ok this is really annoying. When I receive voicemails it will add a plus in front of the number and some numbers are like they are broken apart ( see attached pic). When I click on the voicemail and finish listening to my message I will try to click call from within the VM app, well it gives an error about international calls. So I have to edit the number and remove the + symbol from the beginning before I can call the number. I tried clearing the app cache and I uninstalled the latest update for the phone app. Rebooted and it worked and looked correct until I rebooted and it's back to the same old thing. And could never get it working again.I have cricket as my provider. Could it be an issue with them? The cricket voicemail app works fine but I like the Google one better I want to use it if possible. Oh and the 606-336 number is a local number so why does it keep putting a + in front of it and has a space between the numbers?",
