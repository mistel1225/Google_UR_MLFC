    "content": "I flashed my pixel xl to Android p last August, and now I want to join Android beta program. However,I can't receive Android q update on my pixel. I just know that my device became a flashed device and is unable to receive such update. What should I do if I want q beta update and its released update without flashing my device (how can I make my phone no longer \"flashed\" to receive updates)?",
