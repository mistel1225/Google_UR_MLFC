    "content": "What is this?!!!\nPixel 4 is the actual garbage. Never buying a Google phone again. I can't count the unacceptable bugs in this thing on all my fingers and toes.\n\nlatest android update added this, can't turn off voicemail notifications. Now this trash is objectively even worse.\n\nI hope someone can tell me how to clear this, it's on my home screen 100% of the time, wasting the oled screen that was the reason I bought this. But honestly, I'm over it, I think I'm literally going to switch back to my iphone 7 after 9 months of using the pixel 4. And I know I'm not alone seeing as google just discontinued the f'n thing.",
