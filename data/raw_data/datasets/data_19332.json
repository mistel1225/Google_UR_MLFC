    "content": "The lower 5th portion of my touch screen randomly stops performing this has happened both in regular and dark mode. It seems the only solution I found so far is to restart and within 1 to 5 days it happens again. \n\nI've seen in other solutions to this problem is to reboot into safe mode, but that would be difficult considering it may be the better part of a week before it happens again. Can't stay in safe mode the whole time?",
