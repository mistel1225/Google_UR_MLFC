    "content": "This is something I am seeing happen both when casting audio from my Pixel 4XL to Google Home Mini from the Podcasts App and Spotify. It will be casting from the phone with all audio controls working on the phone for some period of time. Then I will look at the phone and see that the audio there is paused, but the mini has taken over playing the audio directly, meaning now the controls for what is being played are through the Home App or voice. Has anyone else seen this issue or found a setting to disable this transfer of control between devices?",
