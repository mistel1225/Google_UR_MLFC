    "content": "Severe delay registering incoming calls\nEver since updating my Pixel to Android 9 I have a severe delay in incoming calls being registered to the phone.  Usually I get maybe 1 ring out of the phone before it goes to voicemail and sometimes nothing at all.  If it doesn't ring at all I don't even show a registered missed call on my phone, I don't know anything even happened until I get a voicemail notification.  When I do catch it and answer the caller usually says that they never even hear a ring, all they hear is me say hello.  This isn't a connection issue because it now happens every phone call and I often have full LTE connection or am on my home WIFI.  Help please?!  This is killing me to be dealing with on a such an expensive phone.",
