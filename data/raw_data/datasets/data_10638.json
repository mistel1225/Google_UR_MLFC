    "content": "I have my Pixel 5 on the lowest volume setting and I have a set of wired headphones plugged in with the google adaptor https://store.google.com/us/product/usb_c_headphone_adapter\nIn this configuration, the volume is too loud. This also happened for me with different headphones on the pixel 2. I think Google's lowest setting still is just too amplified for wired headphones. I hope they will fix this. This would be resolved if the lowest audio setting for a call corresponds to a smaller amplification of the signal sent to the phone. The same headphones are quiet enough when plugged into a computer.",
