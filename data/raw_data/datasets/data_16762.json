    "content": "Hello all!\n\nI just had my phone randomly have the settings app crash everytime I tried accessing the settings. I reset my phone I shut my phone down. Nothing fixed it. \n\nThe issue is outlined very well in this post. https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/25287538?hl=en\n\nI have tried more than just this post I was able to clear cache,  by clicking quickly I also was able to re enable all my disabled apps (by also clicking quickly) \n\nThis started happening randomly and it seems there is no fix except for a factory reset which SUCKS. What the heck google???",
