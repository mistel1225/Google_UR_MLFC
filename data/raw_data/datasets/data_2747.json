    "content": "My Pixel 4 Xl is just 6 months old with Android 11. \n\nAll the apps are getting crashed very frequently including the social media apps. I googled for the issue followed the so-called solutions. I updated all the apps. I cleared all the cache files. I still have 52% memory left on my phone. Nevertheless, I see my phone crashing all the apps, saying \"System UI not responding\", and then either restarting or refreshing itself. This has been getting very annoying for the last 4-5 days. \n\nWhy would this happen continuously?",
