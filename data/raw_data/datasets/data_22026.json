    "content": "My phone keeps crashing and shutting down even at 60% battery life and on battery saver mode. It will only turn back on if I plug it in to charge. I have cleared all of my apps caches, cleared up storage space, deleted unnecessary apps. The problem seems to get worse and crash sooner if I'm taking pictures with it. Thoughts?",
