    "content": "When an alarm is going off and another one starts, the first alarm often continues to go off. This usually happens with a Spotify alarm is going off, then a normal alarm goes off, or vice versa. When I stop the second alarm, I can't stop the first. If the first alarm was a Spotify alarm, I can go into Spotify and pause the music. If it's a normal alarm, I have to restart my whole device to stop the alarm sound. Before restarting, the alarm continues even when another normal or Spotify alarm goes off. This is very frustrating and troublesome to deal with first thing in the morning.",
