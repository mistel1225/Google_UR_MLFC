    "content": "Since the Android 11 update my phone has been the biggest pain in the butt. Lots of apps just freeze or crash, keyboard won't show, the camera will not always open or if it does it may open upside down. Phone doesn't recognize when I flip it on its side quite often. Overall it is quite infuriating since before the update the phone was flawless and barely ever had any issue. Now it's all. The. Time. \n\nAny fix? Plan to fix it? Any update coming? Or even a rollback to Android 10 would be nice.",
