    "content": "Recent bought Pixel 5. I have noticed that on the startup screen following restart, the display is jagged around the front-facing camera hole and also on the four corners of the display. This appears to sort itself out once the  phone has loaded up, though there is a tiny bit of distortion still on the top-hand corners which is only noticeable when display is white (jagged bits are black). Any ideas?",
