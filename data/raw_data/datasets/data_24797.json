    "content": "Is there any way to change the default weather provider for the weather widget on the pixel 2 XL? I don't know why, but it never shows the correct temperature for my home address, it is often off by 20 degrees. It seems to be correct for other locations but not for the one where I'm at most of the time. It shows the correct location but other weather apps, as well as two physical thermometers in my yard confirm that it is usually way off.",
