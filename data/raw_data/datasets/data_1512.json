    "content": "The LCD display on my phone ruptured and so the entire phone screen is now blacked out. I cannot see anything on it although the touch capabilities still work.\n\nHow do I perform a factory reset without being able to see any of the options that would actually allow me to do that? I know that you can hard reboot using only the power and volume buttons, but if I can't see the menu options on screen, it will be a little difficult to do that as well.\n\nIn addition, I was hoping to project my phone screen to my computer, but I also need to be able to interact with the phone screen and several settings functions that I can't see in order to do that.\n\nThis is what my phone screen looked like last night and now the entire thing is black except for a thin, maybe 1/8 inch margin at the very top of the phone.\n\nI'm looking to recycle the phone, but I would need to factory reset it before I have the option to without compromising my security.",
