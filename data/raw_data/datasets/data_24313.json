    "content": "Is there a way to keep certain notifications in the top left corner of the screen? I would like to keep the date and the weather, permanently showing in the top left corner in the status bar. As of now, when I get new notifications, they get pushed to the right and end up being hidden, which defeats the purpose. Is there a setting in Pixel 2/android or an app that can persistently show specific notifications?\n\nThanks!",
