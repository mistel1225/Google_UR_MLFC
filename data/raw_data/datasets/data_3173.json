    "title": "Direct Dial Widgets Disappearing",
    "content": "I have the Pixel 4a, everything stock running latest Android update. I also use Microsoft Launcher.\n\nI have direct dial widgets (official, from the Google Contacts app) on my homescreen. Every few hours they disappear. I put them all back and even backed up my launcher, yet when they disappear, restoring doesn't return the direct dial widgets.\n\nSimultaneous to them disappearing, I also have a shortcut on my homescreen for the weather in the Google app plus 2 shortcuts in Edge and 1 shortcut in Chrome. All of them also disappear and don't reappear when I restore.\n\nThis seems unique to Pixel as I had the exact same set up on previous phones, including Microsoft Launcher, and no issues whatsoever.\n\nPhone isn't rooted.\n\nAny suggestions??",
