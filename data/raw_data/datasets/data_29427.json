    "content": "I did change the settings for Play Services a few months ago. The phone is working fine in every way, except, every time the phone app is accessed there is an audible and visual notification.\n\"Google Play services error\nPhone is having trouble with Google Play services. Please try again.\nThe phone app works fine in every way. But I can't find how to turn off the notification. The Phone app notifications are all selected and none are accessible to de-select. Why wouldn't I have access to the notification selections?\nI ended up going into developer mode for other reasons today and it didn't change the access to the phone notifications when I checked, for the heck of it.\nI'd like to stop the phone notifications as when in the resents section the notification happens with every scroll attempt. So if I'm scrolling for a call a few weeks ago the audible notification happens over and over as if the phone is in some alarm panic mode.",
