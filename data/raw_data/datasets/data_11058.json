    "content": "I purchased a Google Pixel 4a from the Google Store to use on Google's Project Fi network. I'm upgrading, so would like to sell this phone, but I'm not sure if it will work for other carriers. I know if the device has an unlocked sim, it can be used for another (compatible) service provider, but I'm not sure how to check.\n\nI read \"Use your Pixel phone with any mobile carrier\" and they suggested using a different cell provider sim to check, but I don't have one available for testing. Is there something in the phone menu itself that will show me whether it is locked/unlocked?\n\nThanks!",
