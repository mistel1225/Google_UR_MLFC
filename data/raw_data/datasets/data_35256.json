    "content": "I, had bought the device from reliance store on 07 January, 2019. On 9th Jan the phone's camera stopped focusing and also a horizontal line was seen where the screen spotted not working or lighted up. I had visited the store where I bought it and finally booked a service ticket on 10th Jan. The agent had picked up my phone and sent it to service. Further I had requested for refund or replacement since no one wants to pay the cost of new one for a defect piece. It was a manufacturer fault and I need replacement or refund. Though the device may be repaired and sent backed to me, I don't need the repaired one since, if so I would have preferred to buy a refurbished phone for lesser price. No one will pay a new device price for a device that is repaired. I had contacted the helpline number twice seeking clarity on this issue, but there was no response, further, the date of deliver is also being changed several time. At first it showed earliest and latest times of delivery as 18-01-19/20-01-19. Then it was changed several times to 22-01-19/24-01-19, then 24-01-19/26-01-19, then as 26-01-19/28-01-19 and later on to 29-01-19/31-01-19, and then to 31-01-19/02-02-19. Lastly now it changed to 02-02-19/04-02-19. I'm vexed up with the delay as well as the response to my issue and as a final action, I decided to ask here for refund or replacement of my device. If not, I would approach further consumer redressals for the inconvenience that I'm facing. Need a positive reply at least for my final hope and trust in google. Thank you.",
