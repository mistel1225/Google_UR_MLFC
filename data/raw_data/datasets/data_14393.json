    "content": "Hello Google, I'm writing this message about pixel smartphone in india. When pixel 3a was launched in India a little bit overpriced it was flop. I like pixel smartphone because of its compact design and less wait. Now pixel 4a launched in USA. If we convert USA price in india it will perfect price in india around 25 or 26 thousands INR. But i don't think it will launch same price in India so please if this smartphone launched overpriced in india around 35 to 40 thousands rupees, it will flop again. People skip this price point 4a and buy another smartphone like apple. I just want to say as a true fan of Google pixel smartphone, please launch pixel 4a in india as same price in USA around 26 thousands INR. Overpriced pixel smartphone will be flop in india but perfect price of pixel smartphone is awesome to launch in india. If any Google employee reading this message please I'm requesting send this message to pixel smartphone team.",
