    "title": "Pixel 2 XL resets randomly when connected to specific wifi network",
    "content": "My phone resets randomly when connected to this one hotel's wifi network I've been staying at. I've turned private DNS off and it seemed to lessen the issue. I haven't had this issue at all with any other wifi network.\n\nDoesn't seem to happen in safe mode. I left my phone on overnight and it allowed me to unlock with fingerprint which I assumed to mean that it didn't reset overnight. In normal mode it will reset when doing nothing. I don't have any apps that I would think tamper with wifi functionality other than my VPN.",
