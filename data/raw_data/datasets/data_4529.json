    "content": "Every time I try to initiate a Google search on my Pixel 3a; the instant I type a single character (letter or number) into the search bar, the app closes, and I wind up back at the 'home screen'. I've cleared the app's stash and data; re-synched the server by manaully inputting the incorrect date/time/time zone, then hitting auto feature, and finally uninstalling Googles updates and re-opening the app. Each attempt is successfull for only a very limited time; then the whole cycle repeats itself. What's next on the \"To Do\" list to get the app to return to full functionality?",
