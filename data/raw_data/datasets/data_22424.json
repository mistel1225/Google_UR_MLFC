    "content": "My Pixel 3xl 128 gb freezes whenever the screen is off long enough for the always on display to activate. The only solution is a soft reset which works until the screen times out again. \n\nSo far I have tried rebooting, rebooting into safe mode, a factory reset, a factory reset and immediately into safe mode.\n\nThe problem returns after each factory reset, though it is gone for a few minutes. \n\nPlease help with any suggestions or similar cases!",
