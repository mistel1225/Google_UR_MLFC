    "content": "Hello all, so the original battery on my Google pixel, almost 3 years old, went to complete hell. It turns off in about a minute once unplugged, despite 100% battery life. So I went and replaced it with two Amazon bought batteries. The first one (definitely not OEM) had the same issue but my pixel would at least last about 10 minutes of regular use, unplugged, before shutting down. So I thought it might be a defective battery but the second one has the exact same issue. The second one at least looked like OEM with the exterior but since it came from Amazon, it's not 100% certain.\nIs it possible that it's not a battery issue but maybe a different issue--perhaps motherboard? The Amazon bought battery charges unusually fast and discharges just as fast.\nI know that a recent google play store version was found to be the culprit for the extensive battery loss. Could this be the main reason?\nthank you.",
