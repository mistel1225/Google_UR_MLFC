    "content": "I have one issue with the gesture navigation on Android 11.\nBack in Android 10 I used to fire up the multitasking pane (recent apps) with moving my finger in the middle of the screen up a bit and wait. This is now only working directly from the home bar and it is really inconvenient to adapt. Even the gesture navigation tutorial is showing that I can do the middle of the screen swipe, but it clearly isn't working.\n\nIs it a know issue? Or I'm the only one experiencing it?",
