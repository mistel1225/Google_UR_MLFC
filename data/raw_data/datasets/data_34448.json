    "content": "I own pixel phone gen 1 which i buy in dec 2018. After a month of normal usage, it suddenly die and can not turn on even after charging. The temperature rising after a few minutes of charges, but when I press the power button only red led flash at top side of phone blinking but didn't turning on. I try to test the power intake when charging and notice the reading is normal according to the one who handling the test at that time. I already contacted the seller but he direct me to the repair shop which I did not really convince and trust to handle my phone. I pass it to the other shop and waiting more than a month but the problem still did not solve. I can't contact any google customer service. What can I do to get this phone working again?",
