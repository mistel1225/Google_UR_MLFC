    "title": "Google Pixel - tried battery saver, factory reset and even got the battery replaced but drains still",
    "content": "Had this Pixel for just over 2 years now, and started experiencing battery draining around December last year. I tried leaving the phone on battery saver and I'd be lucky to get through the workday from a full charge. Have recently tried factory resetting the phone, and deleting unwanted apps, but the battery usage menu in the settings doesn't flag up anything massive. I've even had the battery replaced (which was another saga in it's own right and I went two weeks without the phone) and received it back today, and what do you have it, even with battery saver on my phone drained from 82% to 62% in around half an hour. I'm at a loss of what to do - is there no saving this phone?",
