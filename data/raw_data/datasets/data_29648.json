    "content": "I noticed a small crack on my pixel phone a few weeks back, around april this year, which happened due to no apparent reason, guessing it was due to the heat, I really hadn't paid much attention to it since the phone was working just the same. But today, the glass started to crack as it came in contact with the table. I really dont have any idea why it happened and would really like some suggestions.",
