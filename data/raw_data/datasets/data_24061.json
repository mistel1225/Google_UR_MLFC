    "content": "I'm starting to get a green flash on the bottom half of the screen on lock, unlock and notifications popping up and my usb port is flaky. Yes I've cleaned it and tried multiple cables. I'm just past my one year warranty. I see many posts regarding this issue, but under warranty. It's clearly a hardware failure. I've done safe mode, disabled ambient display and a factory reset. What are my options? Do I need to contact the carrier for repair? Out of warranty and only half way through my device balance, so I'm guessing I'm out of luck for a new device.",
