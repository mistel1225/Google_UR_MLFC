    "content": "Upon completing the new security update, my phone has not been able to connect to T-Mobile's cellular network. I have contacted T-Mobile and with them deduced that the issue is not with my SIM card or cellular service provider but with the phone. \n\nI was in contact with a Google Help Center agent, but her troubleshooting solutions had no success. We then disconnected (or she ended the conversation purposefully), before we found a solution. \n\nI have now been without cellular service for almost two days. Can anyone help?",
