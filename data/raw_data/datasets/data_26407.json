    "content": "I purchased Google Pixel 3a phone a few days back. I could effortlessly notice that the display has a yellowish tint. For further information, the night mode is off, I have checked all other display settings, rebooted and even performed factory reset on the phone but to no avail. Yellowish tint is visible to the naked eye.",
