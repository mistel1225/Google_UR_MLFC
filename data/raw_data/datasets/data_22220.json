    "title": "Can't setup pixel 3a with existing child account",
    "content": "Tried to setup new pixel 3a with my daughter's account (which I supervise using family link). Entered her login and password, device asks for my password and 2FA. Device then asks me to accept terms, then next screen says family link will be installed and setup and I'll be told when I can give the phone to her. No way to progress past this screen. Meanwhile on family link on my phone the new device appears and there is a link to \"finish setup\" but if I follow this I get to a screen that says \"log in detected\" and they're is no way to get past this. There is than no way to make progress on either phone and eventually the new one times out and we start again.\n\nI can setup the new phone using my account, this works. I can then check all updates are installed, remove my account and try to add her account, but this takes me to the same situation as above. There seems to way to add her account to the new phone. I could create a new account for her, but she already has one on her existing phone (a pixel 1 that I want to retire). Do I need to remove her account from that old phone first before I can add her account to the new phone?\n\nCompletely stuck, any help appreciated!",
