    "title": "4a issues with new gestures-- the ones that have replaced the 3 buttons at the bottom of the screen",
    "content": "My SO has a pixel 3a and has updated to android 11 (we're both completely up to date). I've noticed his new gestures are so much smoother than the 4a. For instance to open the screen with open apps to switch between apps, his swipe up is so smooth. For the 4a I really have to press and hold before swiping up and sometimes it doesn't work. He swipes up and it is a smooth transition, the 4a is so jarring in comparison. Additionally, I want to disable the \"back\" function on the right edge entirely. I cannot express the outright frustration of apps or a page going back because I'm swiping through photos on the right side. It's not about changing a habit, this function is simply completely useless for right handed people. It would be nice to disable. I did find the settings to change the sensitivity but honestly the lowest setting is imperceivably different than the default middle it's at.",
