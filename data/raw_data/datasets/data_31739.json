    "content": "I have had issues with the phone app and periodic black screen for the three months I have had this phone, and am getting nowhere with Google support.  I called last week and in process of troubleshooting they stated would call me right back in, oh two minutes--didn't happen.\nCalls coming in do not appear on the screen, but appear in my notifications, requiring me to open notification screen  to answer my phone.  I notice the look of the call appearance will be different when this occurs.  I also have random black screen occurring, low  in call volume, and other glitchy issues.  Is anyone else having these issues.",
