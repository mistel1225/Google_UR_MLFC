    "title": "Pixel 3 loses charge on Pixel Stand",
    "content": "A couple of times per day my Pixel 3 will refuse to charge on the Pixel Stand - It will lose charge and hover around 89%-90% battery.  When it does this, the phone heats up to around 104 degrees F.  A reboot of the phone fixes it, temporarily.\n\n- There is no case on the phone.\n- This is my second Pixel 3 to do this.\n- This is my second Pixel Stand.\n- There are no apps running.\n- I cannot duplicate this, it seems to happen randomly throughout the day.  Safe Mode won't tell me anything because it might take 6-8 hours for the behavior to start.\n- I have unpaired/repaired the stand.\n- I am not using the photo frame.",
