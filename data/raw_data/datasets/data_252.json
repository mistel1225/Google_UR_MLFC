    "content": "After updating my Pixel 4a security, I can no longer connect to my network. My mobile data is turned on & it says I'm connected but it shows the triangle with an X in the bottom corner. I am at a loss for what to do. I can't contact Google directly because I keep getting redirected to different pages or I'm unable to continue because the option I want to list isn't available to select.
