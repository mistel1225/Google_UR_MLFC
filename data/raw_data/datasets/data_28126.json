    "content": "My pixel 2 shows \"no service\" after going to android 10.0, I also try different SIM card and neither do they work, however the card is fine. Now no phone calls and messages can be sent and received, No internet service. \nI tried many time reset it to factory setting, but it can be android 10 only, and the issue is still there.\nI don't know How this can happen form a simple upgrade. Does any one face this?",
