    "content": "Is there a problem with the Nov update OTA for Unlocked Pixel 4XL? Seems other devices started getting the OTA as early as the 4th.  Judging by forums and twitter, the only phones not getting the ota seems to be unlocked pixel 4 xl's.  Is this a known issue?  I've been hitting the \"check for update\" button every few hours.  I've rebooted numerous times and have also tried with mobile data turned off.",
