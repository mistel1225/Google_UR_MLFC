    "content": "Within the last day or two (most recent Android update?) all of the chrome shortcuts I had saved to my home screen just disappeared. The icons are gone, leaving an empty space where they used to be. Rebooting and power cycling has not helped.\n\nMany of these were specially-formatted links to run bits of my home automation system, but others were websites I use often, so it's quite frustrating that I'll have to recreate all of them from scratch.\n\nHas anybody else experienced this? And I know it's unlikely, but is there any way to get them to reappear?\n\nThanks! -Mike",
