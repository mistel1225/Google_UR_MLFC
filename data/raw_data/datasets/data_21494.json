    "title": "Pixel 3 front facing camera blurry + static noise",
    "content": "Essentially every time I start the Pixel 3 front camera, either from the camera app itself or using ANY 3rd party app, the camera starts up blurry and with a loud static noise. This has been going on for a few months now, and is at the point where it happens EVERY time I start up the camera. This means I can't use any video calling featuring (i.e. Duo), and takes an extended amount of time to use the front facing camera. I've cleared the apps cache and this has not helped at all. I've started in safe mode, and have also experienced the same issue. This looks like an on-going problem as several people are posting about this issue. \n\nThis is my 3rd Google phone (Nexus 6P, Pixel 2XL, and now Pixel 3) but only the first time I've ever experienced an issue this extreme. Disappointed to see that Google isn't doing a better job of addressing this issue since it seems rather wide-spread at this point.",
