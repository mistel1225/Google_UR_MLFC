    "content": "Hiya!\nLast night my Pixel 2XL stopped vibrating all of a sudden.\n\nSpent a bit of time on Google, and people with similar issues simply had wrong settings, I checked and I don't. Even downloaded a \"test android\" app and tried to make that force vibrations, nothing.\n\nSo I was going to contact support but was led here first, figured I'd give it a shot & ask if anyone has experienced similar issues and somehow fixed them, or will I have to send it off?\n\nCheers",
