Since launch back in October, my claim hasn't been validated, I have called the promotions support team and they keep saying they have no date as to when they will be able to validate the claim. They seem to have a technical issue with validating claims. It is now coming up to 2 months and  I have still have no update and no headphones? What should I do?",
