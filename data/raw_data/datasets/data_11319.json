    "content": "My Pixel 3a began having an issue in which the screen will cut to black when trying to start up/run media intensive apps (streaming, snapchat, games, websites with background animations running, etc). It started about a week ago I think, and seems to be getting more consistent. While black, the screen is still \"on\" and running like normal, the touch screen works, and I can toggle between pages/apps if I know where the buttons are. If I turn the screen off and on while still on the page/app that caused the issue, it will quickly go back to black on return. But if I can navigate to my home screen or another page, the screen will come back on just fine when I turn it off and on. This issue happens less often if the phone is plugged in and charging, though will still occasionally occur. Lock screen does not have a problem, as it will be visible no matter the status of the screen when it was turned off. \n\nI have tried a normal restart of the phone, changing the auto-brightness adjustment settings, and a hard reset by holding in the power button for a prolonged period of time. None of which have helped improve the frequency of occurrence.\n\nAny help would be appreciated.",
