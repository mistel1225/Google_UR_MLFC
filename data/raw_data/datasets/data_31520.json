    "title": "Pixel 2 Notifications Are Late (Delayed)",
    "content": "For the past month my Pixel 2 is not getting notifications on time (usually late 20-40mins), unless I  repeatedly open apps evry few minutes (WatsApp, Viber, Telegram, Facebook Messanger, Gmail... its mostly noticable with the online messaging apps) the notifications are not being displayed on time. \nOn one occasion I was even unable to send messages untill the device, acted on it own will per se.\nSearching online many have pointed that it is the adaptive battery that is causing the problem, but turning it off does not change anything, at least for me.\nSwtiching from mobile data to wifi back and fourth does not help as the problem is remains the same. \nI am not sure after which update these problems started, but after this much time it is getting very annoying.\nIs there anything I have not tried? Please help.",
