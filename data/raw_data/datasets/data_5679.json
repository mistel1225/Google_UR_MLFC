    "content": "When I check the devices that accessed my online banking account, my Pixel 5 shows up as \"Linux\". I know Linux is an OS for smartphones in Europe, but I know almost nothing about it. I'm worried my phone has some sort of software downloaded onto it besides the Android 11 OS. Does anyone's Pixel 5 show as a Linux when you check the history of which devices logged into your accounts?",
