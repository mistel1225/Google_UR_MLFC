    "content": "When I launch 2 of my apps (nytimes & outlook on pixel 4a and Samsung tablet) it opens briefly, then closes and I'm back at home screen. I've cleared cache & data, stays open for first few tries, was doing same with google search, clear data & cache worked for awhile, then broke again.",
