    "content": "Hi, I am looking to contact Google repair or customer service.  I search through the forums and did not find any solution that worked to get my phone out of fastboot mode.  Can I send this phone in for repairs or factory reset.  \nWhere can I reach someone, since the contact for help service seems to be busy. \n\nthanks,",
