    "content": "Intermittently, I won't receive calls or texts. When people try to call, it doesn't ring or go to voicemail.\n\nIt has recently started behaving this way. I think for the last month or so. \n\nI'm on the Freedom Mobile service, in Canada. I wondered if it was maybe a service issue, but my wife doesn't experience this on her iPhone. \n\nAny suggestions?\n\nDone to date: turned off automatically select network, reset airplane mode, turned roaming on, reset phone completely.\n\nI will randomly get a flood of texts at 2AM, or other odd times.",
