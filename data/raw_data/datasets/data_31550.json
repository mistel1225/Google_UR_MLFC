    "content": "This is my first Google phone and I got it on Saturday April 27th and I knew it was supposed to have a long battery life but I have been finding just the opposite in some cases. For example, this morning I unplugged my phone walked away for 10-15 minutes and it was already at 99% after being fully charged. I also noticed that it doesn't seem to last the whole day. I'm not sure if I'm using it to much, if the phone is defective, or this is normal. Please help.  I have also tried playing around with the settings and it doesn't seem to be helping. I have also restarted my phone.",
