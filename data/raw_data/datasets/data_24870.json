    "content": "Hi everybody!\nI bought a powerbank with wireless charging function (interstep 10DQi). I put the phone on charge. After 30 minutes, I took it off and it turned off. Now you can't turn it on. Only if you put it back on the charger. It doesn't charge from the wire.\nI record video with problem: youtu.be /6eKAO1z-D_I\nI need help. What should I do now?",
