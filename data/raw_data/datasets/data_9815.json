    "content": "Hello, \n\nI am trying to turn off mobile data for certain apps so that they only work if on wifi. For my previous iPhone I had certain apps which would only work on wifi (Facebook, instagram, Reddit, etc.) as to save data.\n\nIs that possible and how do you do this on a Pixel 5? \n\nThank you,",
