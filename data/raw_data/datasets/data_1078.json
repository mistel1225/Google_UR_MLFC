    "content": "When I set up my new Pixel 5 only texts sent to me and those sent from me via WiFi have transferred over. The ones that I sent via SMS (which is the majority of the texts that I sent) have not. I've tried 3 different ways - the initial Pixel set up, AT&T Mobile Transfer, and via the SMS Backup & Restore app. Any suggestions?",
