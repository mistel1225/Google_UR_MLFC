    "content": "Wifi calling on my Pixel 4 (ID mobile) no longer works.  The \"ID WiFi Calling\" text normally viewable when you swipe down from the top is no longer visible. \n\nLooking at these forums, it may have been caused by the last security update?\n\nI've tried:\nairplane mode, wifi on (says I need to connect to a network)\nrebooting\nresetting network settings\nturning wifi calling on and off\nand lots of variations of the above\n\nNo matter what I do, the phone only connects on the (very poor) mobile signal in the house.  Wifi calling was the primary reason I bought the pixel 4, and it worked fine until about a month ago, not at all now.  It's annoying as I use an iphone for work and wifi calling is always rock solid with that.  Any help gratefully accepted.",
