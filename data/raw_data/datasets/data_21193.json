    "title": "Horrible battery life all of a sudden",
    "content": "I've tried all the troubleshooting tips I can find but my battery life is ridiculous. I was using the same app on two different phones (one is a pixel 2, one is a moto brand) and the battery went from 100% to 93% on the moto and 100% to 65% on the pixel. Nothing in the \"recent apps\" area,  bluetooth turned off, wifi on. Location on for both since I'm playing a location based game. It's been about 30 minutes since I had the full charge and I played the game a total of maybe 12 minutes. I've been having to charge my battery 3 or 4 times a day for the past few weeks with the exact same amount of usage as before. Before this started I could get by with 1 charge a day, possibly 2.\n\neta: I wanted to add that on my pixel 2 I have all apps set to restrict battery (unless it's not possible) and turned off background data. On the moto  (which is my son's phone) I have nothing set to restrict battery. Also the phone gets really hot all of a sudden. Whether it's charging or not.",
