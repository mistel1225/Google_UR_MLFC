    "title": "Constantly Freezing, has become useless",
    "content": "All of a sudden my Pixel 1 has become useless.  It started a couple days ago where when attempting to answer a phone call my entire phone would freeze to a point where a hard restart was required (holding power button for 30 seconds).\n\nNow it happens all the time regardless of activity.  I've attempted Safe Mode, I've done a factory restart and installed little applications back, etc.\n\nI've also attempted the fixes I found on here about Device Health Services and Digital Well Being with no luck at all.",
