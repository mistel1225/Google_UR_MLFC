    "content": "Hi,\nSo just few days ago (2020.04.25) my Pixel 2XL will not charge with original charger  and shuts down every time while charging when plugged into non-original cable.\nOriginal charger works fine with my wifes phone so it's not broken.\nI have Android10 on my Pixel.\nI've done everything from list below and still facing this issue.\n1. Clean the USB-C port on your device. \n2. Use a different charging cable \n3. Make sure the plug is fully inserted and secured into the wall outlet.\n4. Try using a different wall outlet.\n5. Try using a different power adapter (that's the white brick (wall adapter) that plugs into the wall outlet).\n6. Make sure you're using the original charging cable and power adapter that came with the device\n7. You can say to Google Assistant \"Battery Troubleshooting\" and go through the diagnostic process to check on your device's battery health.\n8. See if you have the same results in Safe Mode.\nI didn't find any other solution on forum.\nObviously my phone doesn't have warranty any more.\nPlease help.\nPiotr",
