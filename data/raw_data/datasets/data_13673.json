    "title": "Does 3rd Party Call Recording Work on Android 11 (Pixel 4XL)?",
    "content": "Since upgrading to Android 11 on my Pixel 4XL, 3rd party call recording apps don't seem to work. I've tried them all. They'll either flat out alert me the call isn't being recorded due to errors or they simply won't actually record the call.  In addition, some apps have made my phone's screen glitchy and I'll have to reboot my device to regain functionality. \n\nUltimately, I'd just like a definitive answer as to whether or not it's possible to call record with a 3rd party app on Android 11, Pixel 4XL?",
