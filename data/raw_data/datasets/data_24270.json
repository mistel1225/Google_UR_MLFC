    "content": "Hello.\nSo yesterday, I accidentally dropped my phone in water, and I didn't turn it off after I took it out. When I noticed that my phone is wet, I tried to blow the water out with my mouth, but after I've done that, the touch screen would click on random spots. I tried searching for a repair service in my country (Poland) but there isn't one near me.  Could I somehow get it to work by myself? What do I do?\n\nEdit:\nLeft the phone to dry for 2 hours, charged it but when i shake it, it will make weird noises. i think its water... The ghost touches got worse...",
