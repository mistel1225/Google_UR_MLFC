    "content": "I completely reset my phone the other day due to slow activity and poor battery life. After the reset, whenever I get or make a phone call the phone hangs up after 15-17 seconds. \n\nSome details:\nthe phone is up to date\ni have not tried safe mode\n(unsure if this is relevant, but it wasn't present before) when I make a phone call, the screen says \"waiting for caller to join RTT)\nthis happens for every outbound and inbound call\ni do have the app Truecaller to filter spam, but the issue occurs without Truecaller as well\n\nthank you in advance!\n\nTheresa",
