    "title": "Recent apps not showing correct app for texting",
    "content": "In my Pixel 3's 'recent apps' section (top of the app drawer... first swipe upward from screen bottom) it has recently switched to showing the 'Messages' texting app icon instead of Textra that I actually use for texting. I never use Messages. It's like it knows I recently texted but decided to show the wrong app for that in the recent list. Prior to a few weeks ago Textra was displayed correctly. I think the latest Android update may have coincided with the change but I'm not sure. Any ideas?",
