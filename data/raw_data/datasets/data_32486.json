    "content": "When I record a video in lower light it's very grainy , even if there's light but there's something black in the background you'd be able to see the grain. Besides the grain the audio stops for a second and then starts again. Please help.\n\nhttps://photos.app.goo.gl/Auv1amhKTMefLBac9",
