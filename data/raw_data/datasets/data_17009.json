    "title": "Google Pixel didn't come with USB - Google SCUMBAGS!!",
    "content": "I'll cut to the chase: Google didn't give me a USB charging cable, like everyone else. So is the intent with Google to turn into the next Apple? Making needless changes just so I have to keep buying adapters and special cables? That is the entire reason I do not use Apple. If you buy one of their products, you have entered into a lifetime contract of buying only their stupid products.\n\nI'm just so angry that I have to wait an hour to charge my phone at home, because my USB car charger is USB... \n\nI understand that new formats are made by these mega corporations. But to give me a male/female USB ADAPTER, but not a male/female USB CABLE is fucking ridiculous. \n\nI've loved Google until now for always being the SENSIBLE option compared to Apple. But I guess fuck me. i guess i'll always be a fucking prisoner to this bullshit corporate fuck-fuck games\ni hate this fkn planet",
