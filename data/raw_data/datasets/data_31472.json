    "content": "Last night I plugged in my Pixel after work for a quick top up, but noticed when I went out with it after it hadn't charged. When I got home  and tried charging it (this is using the charger that comes in the box with it), nothing happened. This morning I tried using my headphones (again, the ones that come with the phone) and they didn't work either - music continued to play out of the speakers. I've had a couple of messages pop up about USB being connect to another device (it's not) but when I go to select \"this device\" the menu freezes. I've also tried plugging it into different outlets, flipping the USB cord before plugging it in and I've cleaned out the slot (it wasn't dirty). I am able to charge using wireless charging. The only thing I've done somewhat differently is use my headphone the last few days, which I have done before, but don't normally do regularly. \n\nPhone was purchased in November (six months ago). I've had no other issues.",
