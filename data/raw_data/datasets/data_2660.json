    "title": "Late last year I started to see an x on my 4G icon. I lose data but keep voice. Coverage is OK? Help",
    "content": "Apart from updating my phones software, restarting phone and switching to 3G I haven't tried anything else. I rely on my phone for work and I'm extremely busy. It's infuriating when I lose the data connection when I need the phone for streaming, maps etc. A quick toggle of airplane mode fixes it but it will randomly reoccur. I've resorted to relying on 3G but it's obviously slower and I lose access to VOLTE. This problem is also happening to a friend of mine. My networks 4G coverage is strong. Is this common and can it be fixed? Any help would be greatly appreciated.",
