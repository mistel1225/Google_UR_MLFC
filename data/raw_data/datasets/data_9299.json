    "content": "I've never had a problem with the Calendar App on any other of my devices, but I'm noticing a couple of strange things on the Pixel 5, relating to the contact's Birthdays calendar.\n\nThe birthdays are coming through to my calendar app ok, but in the \"Schedule\" view (which is the only view I use) the contact's picture which is shown to the right of the event is quite often incorrect. Either it doesn't show at all, or it shows the icon for a completely different contact. \n\n(I have another problem where the contact's birthday calendar does not show whatsoever on 3rd party agenda widgets, but that's another story)\n\nIs anyone else getting problems with the Birthdays calendar?",
