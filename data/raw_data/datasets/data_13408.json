    "title": "Why do headphone controls sometimes malfunction?",
    "content": "I often listen to media through Sennheiser 3.5mm earbuds with volume and play/pause controls. This is usually either podcasts through Podcast Addict or music through Spotify. Most of the time, it works fine with no problems. \nBut sometimes, if I open Spotify, the play/pause button stops working for anything else. I'll swap back to Podcast Addict, and when I try to pause it Spotify starts playing. I'll manually play and pause podcasts, and if I use the earphone button it starts playing Spotify. If I close or force stop Spotify, it opens it back up. I have now uninstalled Spotify, and the play/pause button just doesn't do anything, though the volume works fine the whole time.",
