    "content": "My Pixel 3a is not receiving sound alerts or any notifications from my Wyze camera or my Ring doorbell. In the past it did not work with Blink as well and i thought it was the Blink. I have turned off and on the notifications, uninstalled and reinstalled app, made sure notifications were turned on both on the phone and the apps, do not disturb is off, rebooted the phone. Ive cleared cache and data. I really need to get these notifications or the cameras are pretty useless. My husband has a Pixel 2 and it works fine with Ring. Any help is appreciated, thanks!",
