    "content": "Since daylight savings overnight this morning, my phone \"fell back\" by 2 hours instead of one. I finally figured out it's because it thinks I'm in Colorado/mountain time (I'm not) when I'm using the normal auto detection on network. Haven't tried wifi yet. I can manually set it back to central time but switching back to network it just keeps happening.",
