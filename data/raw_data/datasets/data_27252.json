    "content": "Pixel 2XL Device is currently stuck at the boot, where the Google logo appears and there is a small bar that keeps on loading and doesn't end.\n\nI tried going to the bootloader and already did below :\n* Restart the bootloader \n* Reboot the device \n\nI don't want to do a factory reset as I need my data.\n\nAny leads to recover the data and maybe fix the phone would be appreciated :) \nThank you so much.",
