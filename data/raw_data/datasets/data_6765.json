    "content": "I have an issue with hardware/warranty - and so far there is no help to be found. \nI want to get in contact with a Google Pixel rep and describe what has happened- for this, I need a link and a contact form. Why can't I get help on the forum on a fundamental support issue like this? again please provide a direct link to a contact form\n\nnow make sure your do not suggest a link like https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/9218411?hl=en\n\nbecause strangely enough there is absolutely no contact form in this link, just irrelevant problem-solving docs. \n\nI have posted this request and just received above link from a \" support \" rep . You can imagine my frustration of course.",
