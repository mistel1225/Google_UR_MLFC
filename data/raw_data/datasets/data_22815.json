    "content": "I volunteer at a community radio station.  We'd like the news folks to be able to use their phones as field recorders, which typically means an external mic for the interview and a pair of headphones to monitor the recording.  What hardware do I need for this? A TRRS splitter out of the headphone jack or a USB-C dongle of some sort?  And can anyone offer suggestions of apps that might be useful?  Thanks, and much appreciated.  Mike",
