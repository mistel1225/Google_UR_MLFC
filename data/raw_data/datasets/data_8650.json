    "content": "I have had issues multiple times now where my phone and my wife's phone have randomly rebooted into Recovery and stated \"Cannot load Android system. Your data may be corrupt...\".\n\nMy phone is a Pixel 4XL and it first happened about 10 days ago. It originally wouldn't boot the OS after several attempts then after plugging it in and waiting ~30 min it booted up OK.\n\nThen my wife's 4a (5G) had the same issue a couple days ago but hers restarted OK first attempt. Now I've had it happen to me a second time and rebooted 1st attempt.\n\nI have MANY apps (too many honestly) so I suppose it could be one of those. However my wife has very few and all of hers are popular apps from major developers so less likely to be caused by an app on her phone (although anything is possible).\n\nCurious if anyone else has had this issue and if you've resolved the problem. Just looking to narrow down the possible culprits and hopefully expedite troubleshooting.\n\nAny input is greatly appreciated\n\nVV    From my 4XL    VV",
