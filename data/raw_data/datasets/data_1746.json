    "content": "Hello Pixel Community! I have recently switched to Google Pixel 4a from Google Pixel XL. In the camera settings, I am unable to find the \"Camera sounds\" option in Pixel 4a whereas I can find this option in Google Pixel XL. I have camera app version 8.2.204.362396359.12 in Pixel 4a and on Pixel XL I have the camera app version 7.2.018.281779528. Kindly have a look into this and let me know how can I turn the camera sounds off in Pixel 4a",
