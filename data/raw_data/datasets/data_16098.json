    "content": "Black dot or more like a circle on upper right hand of my New pixel 4a, just appeared today, don't like it, how do you get it out, I paid $350 for this new, new phone and have never seen this, no new apps were installed, it just appeared. Hard to even get it on a screenshot is too high up, it's driving me crazy. I certainly didn't pay this much for this dot, . Does anyone know what to do or how to get rid of it, please. Where is the pixel support?",
