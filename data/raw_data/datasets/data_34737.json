    "content": "Whenever I am switching from Wifi to Mobile Data (Either when getting out of a wifi zone or switching off Wifi manually), all social apps (Messenger, WhatsApp, Skype) with Voice calling facility are loosing the calling functionality. But as soon as I restart the phone they are acting normally. I have reset the phone. Nothing changed. Anybody has a solution?",
