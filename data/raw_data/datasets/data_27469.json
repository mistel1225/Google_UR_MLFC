    "content": "Hi Google,\n\nI bought my Pixel 3 less than a month ago and since then it has had this green-ish tint emanating from the bottom left corner of the screen. It is not noticeable sometimes, but it becomes very apparent and distracting when viewing predominantly grey colors and when the brightness is below 50-60%. \n\nI thought it would go away, but the problem has persisted. I believe I may have a defective OLED panel.\n\nSee pictures attached for reference.\n\n\n\nWould appreciate any help, thanks!",
