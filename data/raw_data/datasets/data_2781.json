    "title": "Wanted: Lower-resolution, smaller-file-size photos",
    "content": "Google's camera app offers only two options for photo size: medium (which is >1 MB) and full-size (which is even larger).  Most of the pictures I take are going to be inserted into emails, and a high-res. photo of 1 MB, or even a quarter of that size, is far too large.  (Only a tiny bit of the ginormous photo is viewable at one time, forcing the recipient to zoom way out so that the email's text then becomes unreadable.)\n\nI find myself having to upload every photo I take to a website that shrinks the file size drastically, then download the smaller version back to my computer.  Surely there's a better way using either the camera app or the photo app that I just haven't found yet....right?",
