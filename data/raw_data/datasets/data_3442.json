    "content": "The navigation bar stuck very often when run any full-screen app with a third-party launcher like Microsoft Launcher and Nova Launcher.\nI'm highly suspicious that it is an Android's bug because it works properly with Google's own Pixel Launcher, so I think that Google should take responsibility for this for its customers.",
