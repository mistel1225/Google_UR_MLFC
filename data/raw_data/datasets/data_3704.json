    "content": "I only recently noticed this as I don't take many selfies but the image should be reversed left to right to give the correct perspective. If you're wearing a shirt with printing, it will be reversed like looking in a mirror.\nMany friends with iPhones don't seem to have this problem probably because Apple just made sure to correct it.\nI haven't found a L/R flip correction in Google photos app.",
