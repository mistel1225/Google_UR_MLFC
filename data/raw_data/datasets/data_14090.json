    "title": "Filing my complaint here in the hopes that Google will see it. Pixel 4a 3-Button-Navigation Bug.",
    "content": "I was working on a project on my phone and the three button navigation bar would not go down like it usually does. I tried tapping the screen, I tried waiting for a long time, and I tried swiping the screen, and yet the bar would not go away. It was covering up the undo button on the project's app. My only option was to go into settings and switch to gesture navigation. \n\nThe problem is, the app I was using will sometimes auto save when minimized, removing the option to undo previous work. I have never had an issue with this before because I could always just undo before I minimized, but because of this bug I had no access to the undo button. So a bug on my Google Pixel 4a caused me to lose a substantial amount of work on my project. I am aware that this is not entirely the bugs fault, but nevertheless a bug on their end contributed to me losing work, and I believe I should be recompensated for that. \n\nUnfortunately, this method appears to be the best way to contact them about such issues. If you have any better alternatives, please let me know.",
