    "content": "I woke up this morning to my Pixel 2 completely unresponsive, I last checked it at 5am (looked at the time) and then at 8am it was black screen city. It was just sitting on my nightstand and is in perfect condition other wise. I have charged it and confirmed charger was working with my husbands phone, held down power, held down power and volume down, gone through pretty much all the steps other than factory reboot. I contacted Google Fi support and after 15 seconds of dialog, they are sending me a new phone. It still seems like there is probably something else I can try? It's not damaged, it's fully charged and unresponsive. When my husband called it however, it \"rang\" on his end (my phone is on silent) and didn't go straight to voicemail. Any insight/ suggestions would be much appreciated!",
