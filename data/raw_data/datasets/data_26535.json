    "content": "I cannot change any sounds on my Pixel 3a. The Sound setting crashes every time I try to open it and suggests I send a feedback, which I do but it does not help. I can see the current ringtone but when I click on it, the app shuts down. I have tried to assign a ringtone to my contacts with the same result. I have also figured out that the same issue applies to the Themes app. I have restarted my phone, dunno what else I can do.",
