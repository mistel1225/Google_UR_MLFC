    "content": "Hi Pixel Community, this is my first post.\n\nI own Pixel 3a. Android 11 update is arriving this week in India as mentioned on this website. \n\nI'm planning to update my Pixel 3a using Pixel Repair Tool (reinstall the latest software option). Before doing so, I have a few queries.\n\nIs it safe to use 'reinstall the latest software option' in Pixel Repair Tool to update to Android 11?\nIf I do so, will I get future updates via OTA normally? OR I'll have to update using Pixel Repair Tool everytime from then?\nDoes it affect my device performance negatively? \n\nNotes\n- I always prefer fresh OS installs for major updates. That's why I'm thinking about using Pixel Repair Tool.\n- I don't care about present data on my phone. So, I'm okay with the reinstall software option. I'm just concerned about my device performance and future updates as mentioned in above queries.\n\nTIA for the help!",
