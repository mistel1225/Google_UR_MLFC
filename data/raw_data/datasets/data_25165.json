    "title": "Pixel 3a - Issue with camera stabilization",
    "content": "There is an issue with my pixel 3a's camera stabilization. (other people's issues are not quite the same, mine is not violently shaking or cutting out.)It has a wobble and is constantly adjusting around its housing meaning I cannot get decent photos. It can focus on a point when it's moving but not when still. The phone is newly bought (less than a month old) and has less than 10 \"extra\" apps on it. All the sensors seem to be working properly as well. I'd attach a video but I can't do that.",
