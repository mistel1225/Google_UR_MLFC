    "content": "I accidently let my pixel 3xl drain its battery to where it powered down itself.  From that point forward, no matter how much I charge it, it stays at 0%, even after charging over night.\n\nWhen it's plugged in, I can turn it on. As soon as I unplug it, it powers itself down.\n\nI've tried multiple cables and multiple power adapters, ones that work with other devices.  I've also tried charging it from my computer.\n\nI've checked the power port and blown it with compressed air.  It's clean.  No obstructing objects.\n\nI've performed factory reset.\n\nNo matter what I do, the phone just stays at 0%.  I've never dropped it, it has no cracks, the power cord seats firmly with no wiggle.\n\nAfter confirming these things, Google chat-support told me to take it to a repair shop and get it repaired myself.  WTF.\n\nAnyone else have any ideas?  This pixel 3xl is less than 2 years old but out of warrenty.",
