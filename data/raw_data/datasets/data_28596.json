    "content": "I purchased a used OG Pixel last year in October or November(I can’t remember). The phone was working really good until around January of this year. It started shutting off and I couldn’t use any voice activated features on the phone. I took the phone to UbreakIfix and they told me it was a faulty motherboard and that my phone qualified for the free motherboard replacement I guess Google was doing. It sat in the shop until March. When I got it back the battery wouldn’t charge and it was a new battery. I took it back and to this day I still don’t have it. I contacted them today and they told me that they’ve tried 6 motherboards and 10 different batteries and the phone still will not charge. They have swapped out the speaker, antenna cables, the microphone, and everything else on a phone to make sure it wasn’t another component of the device itself that was causing the issue. I tried calling Google back in March and was told they can’t do anything for me because I did not have the proof of purchase you get you when buy a brand new unused phone. Can someone point me into the right direction,.",
