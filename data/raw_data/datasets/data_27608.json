    "content": "My Pixel 2 Messages app with Verizon only works with certain WiFi. I'm in Poland currently so I keep my phone permanently in airplane mode. The only WiFi it currently isn't working with is the one in my apartment. I've reset both my phone and the router to no avail. The signal appears to be strong. All other WiFi networks have allowed me to utilize that app. Any inight is greatly appreciated.",
