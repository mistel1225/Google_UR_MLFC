    "content": "  Hey all just wanted to get some clarification. I have an old IPhone 6s Plus and have been eyeing the pixel for some time. The only reason I still have a iPhone is for the group chat with my buddies (all iPhone users). \n\n  I saw some stuff online that you can use iMessages on the pixel... it this right? And would the group chats work fine like they do now with my iPhone just obviously Iâ€™d be green instead of blue. Ty for the help!",
