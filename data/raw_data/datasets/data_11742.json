    "content": "I recently had the screen replaced on my Pixel 4a and my tap to check & lift to check have stopped working. Both settings are still on and neither worked in safe mode or after a hard reboot. Could it be the update to v11? or is it more likely the screen replacement?\n\nUpdate: The screen refuses to turn on when I've made a call since lift to check isn't on so I'm not able to hangup or access the phone if I'm on a call and the screen turns off.",
