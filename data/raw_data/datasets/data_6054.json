    "content": "While my Pixel 5 is charging it sometimes vibrates and has the screen turn on as if a notification happened. This happens every few minutes while plugged in. Using original charger and it happens when the phone is sitting on the table so I don't think it's getting disconnected. Is there some setting that could be doing this?",
