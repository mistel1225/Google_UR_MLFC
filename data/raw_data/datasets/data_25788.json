    "content": "I received my new Pixel 3 about 10 days ago. Right from the start, it started showing some horizontal black/dark grey lines on the screen after using it for some time. \nThe timing is random (not always after the same time), the lines are random (not always the same amount or on the same places). \nIf I take a screenshot, the lines do not show up there (so it's not an app/software issue). \nIf I lock my phone for a bit and turn the screen back on, the lines disappear.\nOther than that, it works perfect. The phone never fell to the floor or got bumped. \nIs this a known screen hardware or firmware issue?",
