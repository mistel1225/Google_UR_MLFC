    "content": "*my account is a g-suite which I own the org\n\nHey all,\n\nI've had an issue with  a couple minor bugs on my pixel 3a(google home app accessed from swipe left to right is just a blank page, temperature next to time shows for a few hours after a power cycle but switches between celsius and Fahrenheit and a few others. all minor. ) I did a backup, factory restore - issue wasn't resolved - so I did a restore from the backup i just did, which completely failed.\n\ndid it again following these steps:\nhttps://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/20887603\n\nwhich brought back some of the data/settings but not everything.. about half of the apps are missing and all the app data is gone which includes 2fa keys and so on. Contacted support and they had no suggestion other than posting here. \n\nI saw another post that you can now as of a few days ago see your backups in your google drive, which mine isn't showing. \n\nAny help would be appreciated.",
