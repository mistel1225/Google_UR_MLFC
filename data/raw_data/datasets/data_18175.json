    "content": "I've recently had my Pixel 3 scare me awake with a loud screeching sound coming from the bottom speaker while using Facebook messenger. My girlfriend and myself communicate through it, and it's not uncommon for us to fall asleep on a call, but this problem has started around last month. It doesn't happen in any other programs, and it's not something that happens every time. Could it be something tied to either the battery or ram?",
