    "content": "I went in and changed in developer options the USB default to file transfer/Android auto which is the only file transfer option I see. Also made sure drivers were up to date on my desktop computer. But when I hook my pixel 4a up to my computer and unlock my phone, my computer doesn't see it..\n Any workarounds? Thanks!\n  Jack",
