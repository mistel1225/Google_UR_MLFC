    "content": "i have a notification from an email that will not go away. i select the notification labeled \"account action required\" from google play services, but once i click on the notification, it briefly takes me to a menu that says \"checking info\" before it closes on itself. i dont want to get rid of this email due to it being one i have to check fairly regularly, so any help with this would be appreciated :)",
