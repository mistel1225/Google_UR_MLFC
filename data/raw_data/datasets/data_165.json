    "title": "I asked MetroPCS/tmobile to shut down phone when it was stolen. Now nobody will talk to me",
    "content": "Metro shut down my current stole sim card but also shut down 2 previous simcards I had from 10 years of being a customer. So I was unable to use any some cards thru my wifi on any phone. Now they will not speak to me on the phone. I suggest it would be a good time to get the guy or girl who knows this stuff but they seem intimidated. Bottom line I want every back up of my some card ever made asap. What can I do? I've been considering Google for a long time . But I have a phobia about always talking with robots and I need to speak to human beings at least 50% of the time.",
