    "content": "My charge port wasn't working well. I did all the troubleshooting steps and then took it to YouBreakIFix. They told me they could see no damage and, since it was under warranty, I should call Google.\nHUGE MISTAKE\nI have now spent over 5 hours on the phone, a few more in text conversations, all over a week - only to still be told the same thing, again and again and again. \nDue to 'technical difficulties', they cannot process my claim, but they will check on it and get back to me. \nMy warranty rubs out in November. If I didnt know better, I would thnk they were just trying to run out the clock.\nAnyone have any luck speaking with anyone there that can get them to honor their warranty?",
