    "content": "My Pixel 5 ringer randomly mutes itself. I've been through all of the settings and cannot find anything that would cause this. Even tried setting up routines to have the ringer turn on at work and at home, but it still randomly sets itself to mute. It does vibrate. But I'm still missing calls and texts.\n\nI'm going to start turning off notifications from apps one at a time to see if that fixes the problem, but if anyone has experienced this and fixed, I would love to know what the cause is.",
