    "title": "Text to speech no longer working after the Android 10 patch this week",
    "content": "On my Google Pixel 2XL, when in any app, I click the microphone icon, it beeps to prompt me to speak, then it immediately stops listening and resets to where I can click again. Gboard had mic permissions. Reboot didn't help. Problem started immediately after I followed the prompt to restart my phone to finish the October patch install this morning (10/8). I didn't realize how often I'd been using the feature until it broke today. I can use voice commands in the assistant, so I know the mic is hearing me and all.",
