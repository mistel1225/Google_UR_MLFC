    "content": "I want to look at pictures stored in my phone on PC on a big screen and delete or rename if necessary. when i open my phone in win10 or lightroom, i dont see any thumbnail/preview. what is the workflow here ? google photos is not substitute for a photo organizer or photo editing tool like lightroom. It has phone uploads at lower quality. It does not show a copy which is actually on the phone.\nI just need to be able to see my camera photos in a photo organizer on PC to delete/rename etc.",
