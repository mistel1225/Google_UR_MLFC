    "content": "For the last few months, my Pixel 4xl wilI randomly shut off. I can only turn it back on by plugging it into a charger and long pressing the power button. Even the slightest vibration from setting it down on a table will cause it to shut off. I have tried rebooting from safe mode, factory reset. Nothing has changed. I suspect it's got to do with the port.",
