    "content": "My pixel 3 XL stopped opening up the google app today, and gave me the Google keep stopping notification. I've also tried opening a game, Brawlstars, and i get the same message. Tried opening up wellsfargo app, the gmail app, Cargurus, same message. Surprisingly, Chrome opens up just fine, same with firefox. I've tried uninstalling google / google play services, that doesn't work. Safe mode, resetting, google support chat, nothing works. I don't have any space to back up my important files on my phone, so i really can't afford to factory reset my phone. Anyone else having this problem / error pop up?",
