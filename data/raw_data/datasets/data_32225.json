    "content": "When in landscape mode messenger doesn't respond or open. If I am in any app which is in landscape I can't open the chat window once the head has moved to the left of screen. This occurs even if no apps are running and I am on the home screen.\n\nTried clean install, updated app and OS, run in safe mode. I can see people are experiencing the same issue but no answer has been provided.",
