    "title": "Half of my Google Pixel XL on the right side changes between static and a frozen frame.",
    "content": "Does it less on black screen then white. almost always starts as a static, then as the phone has been on and switching apps it turns to the frozen frame. Touch is responsive and fine so phone is usable but without right side. sometimes the phone works fine, but some apps trigger the frozen frame. Sometime goes back and forth. I've factory reset  and cleaned the screen. phone is in perfect condition on screen. has a small dent an inch and a bit below camera on back.  Looking for ideas on what the problem is.",
