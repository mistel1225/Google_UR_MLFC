    "title": "Pixel 3 rear camera stopped working",
    "content": "After just over a year since buying my Pixel 3 the rear camera has suddenly stopped working. I've tried all the suggested fixes, clearing the cache, restarting the phone, downloading other camera apps but nothing has fixed it. I'm trying to reach out to customer support but of course they're all closed due to the virus. \n\nPlease let me know if there are any additional fixes. If there is any Google support staff here please get in touch with me to find a solution. I bought the Pixel primarily for the camera and this is unacceptable.",
