    "content": "I would like to be able to access my camera from my lock screen as this has been a feature on every single phone I've ever used but seemingly it can't be done on a Pixel 5 - or at least I cannot find a way to do it.\n\nDoes anyone know if there is a way to do it - I checked the Lock Screen settings and nothing about camera or apps in there. \n\nThanks!",
