    "content": "please see the attached image.  There's a green corner on my lock screen.  It doesn't show up when I unlock the phone, so I'm not sure if it's an actual screen failure issue?  I tried changing the lock screen picture and realized there's actually supposed to be a picture there, but instead it's always just been black, and now it's black with a green corner.  Anyone know why?",
