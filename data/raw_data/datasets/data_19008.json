    "content": "Does anyone know if a stylus can be used with the Pixel 4, and if so, which one would  you recommend?  I am increasingly using document signing apps (for example, Blackberry Notate) and finding it difficult to  stay within the space provided and create a legible signature, date etc using my finger.  I think a stylus would be a huge help with this issue, and probably get it done faster.",
