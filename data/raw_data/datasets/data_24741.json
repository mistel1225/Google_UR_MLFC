    "content": "Just FYI, my phone is actually a Google pixel 2 XL. I'm getting so tired of this. I've owned the phone for two years and it started doing this six months in. It is frustrating enough for me to never want to buy a Google phone ever again. Here's what happens: every couple months (usually right after updates), my phone seems to not recognize my headphones plugged into my headphone jack. What's annoying is it always seems to happen when I'm traveling somewhere and didn't bring my Bluetooth headphones. Sometimes it vibrates too like it thinks it is being plugged in to charge for whatever reason. I have no idea what to do with it. I'm getting SO FRUSTRATED. Please help.",
