    "content": "The built in MAC address randomization will generate a randomized MAC address the first time you log into a wifi network - and it will stick with that MAC address each time you are on that network.\n\nIs there a way to cause the phone to generate a new randomized MAC address for a network to which it has already assigned a randomized MAC?\n\nI tried \"forgetting\" the network, but the phone did not forget the previously assigned randomized MAC address.",
