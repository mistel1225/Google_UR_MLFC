    "content": "There is 1 issue with this phone that is EXTREMELY annoying and ridiculous to have to deal with. Every time I restart the phone, it automatically dials some phone number with an automated \"Thank you for calling the roaming charges information...\" an I hang up. This is both a major inconvenience, hassle and at times, embarrassing incident, Every Single Time! Fix this or I will continue to tell people this phone is NOT worth it!",
