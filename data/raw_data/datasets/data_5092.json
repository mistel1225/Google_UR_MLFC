    "content": "Just got the new buds and went through initial set up, they worked great! Put them away and next time I took them out I noticed that the right one wasn't playing anything. I investigated and found that it wasn't connected to the phone. I put it back in it's case and then took it out and put it back in my ear. Nothing. \n\nWhen I put both back in the case, and manually connect it; the right bud shows up as connected and charging but when I take it out it doesn't actually connect. \n\nI tried forgetting the device, but when I do the only way to get it to pair again is to reset the case... Simply putting it back into pairing mode and searching for a new device on my phone won't do it, and once I forget the buds it won't even re-pair with the left one.\n\nThe case senses the bud because when I take it out and put it back in the light pulses like it should.\n\nThe only way I have been able to make it connect is to reset the case, then I can use them both; but once I put the right one away it's pretty much dead until I get tired of using the left one all the time and reset the case again. I can use the left bud normally.\n\nAll software and firmware is up to date, and these are both google products, I don't understand why they're not working properly.\n\nPlease help!",
