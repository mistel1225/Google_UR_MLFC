    "content": "I just updated my phone today. After the update had installed it went to my normal pin screen. I put in my pin and then the phone went to a black screen. I left it sit for around an hour and it was still on this screen when I came back. I then tried resetting the phone but now it is stuck on the screen with the G logo and a a loading bar. It was like this for over an hour so I tried resetting it again but it's doing the same thing. Not sure what to do from here.",
