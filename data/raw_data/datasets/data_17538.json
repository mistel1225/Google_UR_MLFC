    "content": "Phone ran out of charge and rebooted for the first time since the August Security update and has not been able to connect to Mobile Network since then.\nSIM works perfectly fine on a different device.. Factory Reset, removing and adding SIM back on did not help resolve the problem. Anyone else facing similar issues on the Pixel3a with update? any suggestions around what I can try to solve this..\nReached out to support centre but no response on the case.",
