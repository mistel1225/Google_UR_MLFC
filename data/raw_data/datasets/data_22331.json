    "content": "Got a new 3a XL and inserted a new SIM from Three. All fine, but then my old number was transferred from my old carrier to Three. I can now send and receive calls, texts etc on my old number, on my new phone, so all good?\n\nNo!  For some reason the original number that came with the Three SIM is still recorded in the phone settings, and I can't edit it. The problem this creates is that any apps or websites that require verification seem to pick up the number automatically from the phone settings.\n\nAnyone any idea how to fix?",
