    "title": "Google Pay on Pixel 4 XL requires me to unlock the phone twice every time",
    "content": "Not sure if this is a common problem or if it's just me, but every time I use my P4XL to pay in-store I end up having to tap my phone twice on the POS before the transaction goes though. Basically, each transaction goes like this:\n\nUnlock phone and open Google Pay through power menu\nWave phone at contactless card reader\nGet error message that I need to authorize payment using my face and transaction stops\nAwkward moment between me and the cashier until they notice they need to hit some sort of redo button so I can try paying again\nWave phone at contactless card reader a second time\nTransaction complete\n\nCorrect me if I'm wrong, but shouldn't this be a more seamless process? I should be able to just wave the phone once and be done if I already have the phone unlocked right?\n\nI imagine I never had this issue on my pixel 2XL because I could hold my fingerprint on the reader as I tapped to pay. The same cannot be done with face unlock.\n\nCredit to chrispgriffin on Reddit for describing the issue. I am copying his post as it describes the issue I have perfectly since getting a Pixel 4 XL. \n\nThere is no Google Pay support forum so I'm posting here as it relates to Face Unlock.",
