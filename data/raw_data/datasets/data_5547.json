    "content": "So after updating to the March '21 update a few days ago I have noticed my Pixel 3a is noticeably sluggish performance wise.  Apps take twice as long to open, keyboard (even as I type this) is slow for words to appear.  It's not unusable, but definitely slower than before the update.  Anyone else experiencing the same, or is it coincidence?",
