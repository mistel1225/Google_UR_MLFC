    "title": "My Pixel 2 XL turns the volume off all by itself. It has nothing to do with Bluetooth or headphones. I don't use these. Most of the time it turns off the volume controlled by the volume button. Other times that volume is okay, but it is turned off in the settings. I thought maybe I was accidentally doing it as I handled the phone. That proved false because I would have to actually push the volume button to lower it. I also covered the button so it could not be changed and it lowered itself anyway. I have read the MANY complaints about this and would expect a replacement, especially having paid so much for a cell phone that makes you miss most of your calls. If I was Google, I would be terribly embarrassed and NOT have waited so long to investigate this serious problem.",
