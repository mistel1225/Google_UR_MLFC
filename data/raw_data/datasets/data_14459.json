    "title": "Android 11 upgrade has made listening with Bluetooth headphones worse.",
    "content": "Since upgrading to a android 11 I have consistently been having issues listening to anything with my Bluetooth headphones. They are enabled for media playback in the Bluetooth settings but don't show up as an available playback device in the new supposedly \"improved\" play interface in the notification tray. I have to restart my phone every time, then reconnect my headphones every time I want to listen to music. This functionality has made my experience worse because before it would just default to the Bluetooth device.",
