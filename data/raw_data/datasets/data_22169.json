    "title": "My Pixel 3a XL is not showing download notifications, nor showing when downloads are finished.",
    "content": "I'm not sure what I did or how I did it, but my Pixel 3a XL does not show downloads in the notifications bar, nor give any notifications/indication that a download has started at all. I want to be able to see when my files are downloading, what percentage they're at, and to be able to click on them or open them up once they're complete, but without that notification, I have to hope I didn't just download a huge file twice. To be clear, my files ARE downloading; I just have no visible indication that they are until they appear IN the downloads folder. Any advice?",
