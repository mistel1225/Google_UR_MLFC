    "content": "I am asking for confirmation on Pixel 5 specs. I want to know if it has dual-sim dual-standby support with 5g support as well? I know that it has to be a physical sim and an eSim and that it won't support dual 5g. The scenario that I am envisioning is to have a 5g capable eSim and a 4g physical sim.\n\nThis article would suggest this should be possible (at lease DSDS)\nhttps://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/9449293?hl=en",
