    "content": "Spoke with support they have me reset to factory. Didn't work. They then sent me to authorized repair and was told that it's a software issue and Google is responsible. They want me to mail my phone in. I can't be without a phone for 7 to 10 days let alone one or two. I don't have a computer or any other phone. It's still under warranty so why can't it just be replaced?",
