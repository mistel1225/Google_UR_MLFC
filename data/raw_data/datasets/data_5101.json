    "content": "When I try to full screen video in various apps, such as chrome, ring, etc the app crashes. Strangely Youtube seems ok.\n\nI have installed the latest OS and patches, and was hoping to not have to do a full factory reset, but I am going to try that next unless anyone has any other ideas.",
