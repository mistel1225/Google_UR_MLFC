    "content": "I have only had this camera for a few weeks,  clicking the power button twice has never opened the camera.  I have tried rebooting the phone and I have made sure this feature is turned on in gestures with NO luck .  Has anyone found a fix for this?  If not do I  take the phone back to  the T-mobile store where I bought and have them look at it or call T -mobile support?  Thanks for any help.   Jill",
