    "content": "So my alarms will still go off in the morning, but if I try to go into the clock app, it doesn't show any alarms as being in there. The add button is there and everything acts normal but it won't add that new alarm at all. Basically I can't add or edit or remove any current alarms because none of them show up in the app despite still going off every day",
