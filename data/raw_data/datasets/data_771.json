    "content": "9 days ago, I have raised a complaint regarding the issue with my touch screen not working. The phone got picked up and I got my phone back in just 4-5 days after the repair.\nBut when I open my phone there was even a big issue where the screen and frame were not fixed properly.\nAfter sending all the details, screenshots, clip.. still, there is no response from support or whosoever is responsible.\nIts been more than 2 days now and I am not getting any help. Contacted support several times, dropped an email multiple times, however same standard response.\n\nCan anyone help me with how I can escalate this? as in this Pandemic it is very difficult to work without a phone and it's been more than 9 days since I have not used my phone.",
