    "title": "Why is my audio choppy?",
    "content": "If I have a multi-point headset connected (via Bluetooth) to both my Pixel 4XL and my Pixelbook (or my MacBook Air) the audio is supper choppy on the computer. If I turn off the Bluetooth on the Pixel 4XL the audio gets smooth again. If I just listen to music from my phone on that same headset, the music is smooth. I find this to be true for the following headsets: Aftershokz Opencomm, Jabra Evolve 75, Jabra Elite 85t.\nThis only happens when using the multipoint connection and one of those connections is the Pixel 4XL. Although I haven't tested it with a multipoint connection between both laptops.",
