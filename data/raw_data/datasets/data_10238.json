    "content": "I just downloaded a zip folder of music from a site I have used with this phone hundreds of times. I extract the files, and there is no download option. The files are mp3s, yet when I try to open with, it says nothing on my device can play them. There is no simple move option, which is ridiculous. This was a recent update that has caused this, I have always been able to extract and download before recent updates.",
