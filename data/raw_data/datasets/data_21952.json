    "content": "Ever since the April 2020 Security Update, the Google Assistant on my two-month old Google Pixel has been spazzing out, turning on by itself, activating by itself, in very rapid succession. It happens to fast that the phone is completely unusable. Rolling back the update for \"Google\" did nothing to fix the issue. Clearing the cache for \"Google\" did nothing to fix the issue. \n\nPlease fix it! This is not a good look for a two-month old \"flagship\" phone model.",
