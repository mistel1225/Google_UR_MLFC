    "content": "When playing music on speaker, (haven't tested with headphones) the volume randomly increases and then decreases again. Doesn't seem to be any issues with the physical buttons. No volume UI appears on the screen to indicate any change in volume, just an audible difference. Haven't noticed the issue during calls, however for a while now, people have complained that my sound quality is very poor when I use speaker.",
