    "title": "Why is the entire screen in and around the 'w' key in my keypad not responding to touch?",
    "content": "The 'w' key in the keypad doesn't respond to touch. That part of the screen is dead. It doesn't respond to touch. There is no external damage. Further, I am not able to update Android System WebView and Chrome. Moreover, the phone is under warranty but Google says it will take more than 15 days to get it repaired. Factory Resetting done but still it doesn't work. Extremely frustrated with the service experience. Is Google selling a use-and-throw phone?",
