    "content": "My Phone got a dead black screen all of a sudden and was also not charging. The phone came back to like when I pressed the power button for more than 30 seconds. This is giving me unsecured feeling to continue use the device as the phone may crash again when I am in real need of the phone or the phone may die with all my important data in it. Kindly give me a solution.",
