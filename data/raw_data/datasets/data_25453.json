    "title": "I am not received group text messages from iPhone users on Google Pixel 3a",
    "content": "I recently switched from an iPhone to the Pixel 3a.  Before activating my Pixel, I turned off iMessage on my previous phone and have also deactivated iMessage from Apple's website.  I have about 10 different group texts currently over the last few years and am having really inconsistent incoming texts.  I think I'm the only Android user in all of my groups and am not receiving all of the texts.  I only know that I'm missing texts because my wife (iPhone user) is in several of the groups so I can see all the texts go through on her phone and nothing on mine.",
