    "content": "My WiFi constantly disconnects and when I go to turn it back on it either gets stuck on \"turning on\" or it can sometimes crash my phone. Restarting my phone helps most times but not all the time. Have tried resetting my network settings but it doesn't help.\nLooking to see if anyone else has had this problem?",
