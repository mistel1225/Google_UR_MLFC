    "content": "Google Play music going away but it doesn't do what I want   ...   YouTube music  doesn't do what I need, or would like ... and I don't want to buy a subscription in order to play my own music files which have been downloaded to the phone.  \n\nCan anyone recommend a free player .. a simple player.   I've got a smallish bunch of music on my Android, I don't really care about the audio features ... balance is probably the only thing that'd matter to me ... I'm no where near an audiophile ... my tin ear is constructed from a mixture of cold rolled steal and concrete.\n\nMy most pressing desire is that the music gets played in an order *I* specify.  I have albums (Hamilton soundtrack, for example) that I really want to play in the same order as would be in the show ... but I can't figure out how to make players such as JetAudio do that (I realize this isn't a Jet Audio chat area.\n\nWhat magic spells, or magic products do I need to be able to play albums (outdated term, I think) in a sequence that *I* want it to?\n\nAny help; including pointers to better sources of help would be more than greatly appreciated by this old man.",
