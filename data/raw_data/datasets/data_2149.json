    "title": "Google account stops syncing correctly once a day unless I restart my phone",
    "content": "My Pixel 3a has developed this new issue whereby a specific subset of my Google account stops syncing after about a day. Specifically, my email and my Keep notes will stop syncing. I've already tried everything in the \"Fix account sync issues\" article, including removing and re-adding my Google account. Nothing has helped.\n\nThe only thing that works for me is restarting my phone, which I have to do once a day now. It's a very reliable workaround to the problem, but it's obviously annoying.\n\nI contacted Project Fi support and their only advice was to factory reset the phone, which seems like an absurd next step. (I'd rather restart once a day than deal with rebuilding my phone after a reset.) Has anyone else found a solution to this?",
