    "content": "I have taken my pixel 3 to ubreakifix where they turned us away and said something was wrong with the motherboard and it could not be fixed. My photos did not sync to google photos so they recommended we send it to ontrack for data recovery. They worked on it for 3 weeks and had no luck.",
