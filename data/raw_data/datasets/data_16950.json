    "content": "My Pixel 3a screen got broken. I unable to find a service centre of Google in delhi. I don't know why. What's the point of making a premium smartphone when you can't afford to have a service centre. I've also tried all the toll free numbers but due to current covid situation, all those numbers are un-operational right now. I don't know what to do, but one thing's for sure I'm not purchasing an Google phone in future. Thanks Google for your fucked up after sales services. If for some reason, someone can help with this issue. Please respond. I'll be more than happy.",
