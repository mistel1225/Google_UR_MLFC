    "content": "My sound quit working, no music, no ringing, no notifications. There is no physical damage or water damage, the loud speakers just quit working. I have done all the suggested steps from support to try and fix it including a factory reset which I didn't want to do because something inevitably goes wrong, and I was right. The factory reset did not fix my sound issues but did jack up multiple accounts and other things I'm still trying to get back in to.\nThen after playing the game going thru all the suggested steps with Google support and the dreaded factory reset a support person told me I was out of warranty so there is nothing I can do even though I did nothing to the phone, there's no damage it just quit making sound.",
