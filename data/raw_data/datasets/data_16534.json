    "title": "Pixel 2 - Black screen during call - proximity sensor or firmware?",
    "content": "Noticed a couple of days ago that when I am on a call, the screen stays black and I cannot interact with it - can't hang up, can't select anything.  I did some research, and it appears to be tied to the proximity sensor?  I've tried several things - downloaded the ap that tests the sensor (it says 0cm at all times), did a factory reset (which of course is a major pain), played with the display auto-brightness, went into Developer mode and turned off all sensors.  Nothing has helped.  Right now it looks like I will need another phone.",
