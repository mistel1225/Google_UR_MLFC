    "content": "I'm looking for an SOS feature like the Galaxy has where you can press the power button 4x and it will send an SOS emergency text and location data to designated contacts. I know the Pixel 3 doesn't have this, but is there a good app I can download? I've found several online, but it doesn't seem like any still exist on Google Play for download. \n\nSpecifically, I need one that can be triggered by either the power button or shaking the device, not going into an app to press a button. \n\nThanks in advance!",
