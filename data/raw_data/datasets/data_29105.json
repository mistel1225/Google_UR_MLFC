    "content": "I'm trying to connect my pixel to the WiFi by using the WPS push button method but there doesn't seem to be an option available to do that. Usually on other phones I would just select the network I want to connect to, go to \"advanced options\" and select \"WPS push button method\" or something along those lines but I can't find anything similar on this phone. I tried Google search to see if pixel simply doesn't offer that option but there's no information available. What am I doing wrong?",
