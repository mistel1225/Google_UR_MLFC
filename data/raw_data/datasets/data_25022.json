    "content": "when I try to set up different notification sounds for different apps (i.e. snapchat's default ping, or facebook messenger's custom sounds in the app), the system default sound (whatever it's set as) overrides it, even when in some apps I've changed the sound for notifications. I still have one notif sound for every app and can't find a way to fix this issue.",
