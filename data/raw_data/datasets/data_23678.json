    "title": "2 XL camera crashes most of the time",
    "content": "Camera app crashes almost every time I open. Front camera works fine. For a while, when I could take pictures, they had big green dots in an x pattern in the middle. That has gone away, for now, and any pictures I manage to take seem fine. I have tried using other camera apps, updating everything, uninstalling the camera app updates, safe mode, clearing storage and cache, etc. Contacted support and was told it was hardware. My issue didn't start until yesterday and with it working sometimes on top of all of the other similar issues other people are having since the last update, I am wondering if it might be better to see if it is fixed in a future update. Otherwise Google's solution is to pay about $110 to get the camera replaced, which I don't have and may or may not fix it. Any ideas?",
