    "content": "A couple months ago my iphone went completely dead and stopped working, computer couldn't wake it up or recognize it, Best Buy geek squad couldn't do anything, it just became a chunk of metal. I got a Pixel and have never been able to figure out how to get my photos from iCloud (which I can log into on my computer) to my phone, without screenshotting and emailing them one by one which I told myself I would eventually do but really would prefer not to. Can anyone help? Thank you!",
