    "content": "This is a Pixel XL 16MB phone. First I tried to clear all of the caches in the manager. I think I over did it and  ultimately  Google play would open but nit display any  programs to load or a list of my programs. I did a factory reset last night and am back to my original problem. One other interesting fact is about six weeks ago I had to hard reset my phone because it said \"database corrupted\" but I got most of my stuff back. It worked fine until last week.",
