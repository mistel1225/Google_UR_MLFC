    "content": "I am using the Bose wired headset when talking on the phone and the microphone works well in it; I hear great sound, but my own voice is being muffled by the noise cancelling, and I can't find anything in the settings that allow me to control whether or not and how loud my voice is heard over the headset speakers.  Can anyone help!",
