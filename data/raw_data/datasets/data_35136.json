    "content": "My phone notified me that there was a security update available. I've been trying to install it for a while now but for some reason it won't install (it never gets past 0%, even when I leave it for a couple of hours). I have a solid wi-fi connection, ~30 GB free, and always attempt to update when my phone is fully charged, so what could be the problem here?",
