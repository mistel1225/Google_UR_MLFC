    "content": "It randomly has become extremely hard to type on my phone. I am writing this and correcting so many errors. It just started today. It doesn't register half the letters I type and picks other ones I didnt. The faster I type the worse it gets so I have to type in slow motion with great difficulty. \nI have restarted my phone and cleared cache AND data from gboard, it did not fix anything. My phone is up to date and was working fine this morning. Please help, it is so hard to type.",
