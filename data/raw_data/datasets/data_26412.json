    "content": "As said in the post description, I'm having issues with the flashing green screen on primarily the lower half of the phone but this has steadily increased to the whole screen over the past two or so weeks. \n\nI started using the phone mid October 2019 and these issues started appearing three days into use. Over the past month I have reset, reset to safe mode and done a factory reset but nothing seems to have stopped the issues. \n\nIf there are any suggestions as to what I can do please let me know. The flashing screen sometime renders the phone unusable as I can't see past the green flashing.",
