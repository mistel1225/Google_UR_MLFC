    "content": "I bought my Pixel 3 directly from the Google online store on October last year. Ever since I bought the phone it's been acting up when I'm on calls. At some point on a call the phone would freeze. When this happens I can still hear the other person clearly but the other person can't hear me. Apart from that people complain a lot that they can't hear me well on calls. \n\nIt's obviously not the speaker since I have no problem when sending voicenotes on Whatsapp. \n\nLately it's been having another issue. I am not getting any notifications when the phone is on sleep mode. Whenever I turn on the screen I get all the notifications  popping up together (whatsapp messages, Skype, etc).\n\nI live in the Dominican Republic and from what I've been hearing it's a problem with the hardware and I will have to send it to an official store. The problem is that there aren't any Google rep stores in the DR and sending it to the states means paying for the delivery and having no phone for about 10 days. \n\nHope someone can help me out with that. \n\nThanks",
