    "content": "I want to purchase the Pixel 5 in the german Google Shop.\nIts not possible.\n\nFirst, i tried with my Paypal account. It got removed because it \"has been deleted\", which is hilariously wrong.\nThen i tried my credit card, but the transaction got declined: \"Ein unerwarteter Fehler ist aufgetreten. Bitte versuchen Sie es sp√§ter erneut. [OR-PRAT-02]\"\nOf course it within my limits.\n\nI am using my browser Firefox on PC and have FIDO2 activated. Maybe this is one of issues?\nIf anyone else has this problem too, have you tried using Paypal balance?",
