    "content": "Hi.  I recently purchased a new google pixel 3.  I do so on its reputation for the camera (still and video).  I plan to use it a lot for hiking pictures and videos, especially from viewpoints on the trail.  When testing the still/video camera on a recent hike, I noticed that when I used the video camera and panned slowly from a viewpoint on the trail, the playback occasionally \"jerks\" or hesitates.  It does it every 5-10 seconds.\nSettings for video:\n  Back Camera video resolution: HD 1080p\n  Front camera video resolution: HD 1080p\n  Video stabilization: On\nNeed someone from Google to respond as this issue is a very important problem for me (based on why I bought the camera).\nAndroid version: 9\nSecurity patch level: March 5, 2019\n\nMuch thanks for any help.\n\nKen",
