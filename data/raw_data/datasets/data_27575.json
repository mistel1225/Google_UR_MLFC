    "content": "My phone raises the media volume on its own, when I try to bring it down it just keeps raising it by itself like a ghost is doing it. It can stop momentarily but persists to do the same thing no matter what I do. I restarted my phone and it went into no command then i rebooted it and it turned on but the problem is still happening. Please help me fix this!",
