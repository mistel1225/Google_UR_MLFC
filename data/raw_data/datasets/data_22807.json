    "content": "Pixel 2 XL shuts down when connected to a charging cable. I've used different cords, plugged into different outlets using different plugs that go into the outlet. I'm even in a different location, hotel, and it is doing it here. Happens more than 85% of the time plugged in. It will usually charge but not without shutting down. I've had two instances lately where it has not charged.",
