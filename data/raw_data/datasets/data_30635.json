    "content": "The usb-c port doesn't work all the times. I realised about this problem when music started to stop playing while having the earbuds connected. And then I found out I have the same problem when i try to charge my pixel 3 with a cable. (Usually I use wireless charging)\nSo the phone would charge only if the cable is leaning towards the right side. I can feel the end of the cable moving a little bit while it is plugged inside of the phone. Leaned on the left it doesn't charge, leaned on the right it works.\n\nClearly this is very annoying, especially while using the earbuds because for example I can't put my phone in my pocket or else the music is stopped.\n\nTo be sure it wasn't the cable problem I tested this with 3 different USB-C cables (Google and Apple originals) and the original pixel earbuds.\nIn order to exclude damaged cables or accessories I tried them on my Macbook and they work properly.\n\nIs there anything I can do to fix this problem?\nThank you.",
