    "content": "After installing the latest May 05 Android update, I'm starting to see small notification popups when I try to unlock my phone or switch from wifi to mobile data. The messages in the popups could be, 'screen_unlock' or 'check_timejob' and so on. I did not enable any notifications settings but I'm afraid if this is malware or if my phone got compromised.\n\nHere is a screenshot when I unlock the phone.",
