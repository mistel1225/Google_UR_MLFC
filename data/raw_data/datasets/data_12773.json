    "content": "Just paired my new Pixel 5 to my Honda Civic 2015 audio system (stock).   My car radio now plays audio through the car speakers, but my radio shows \"No Device Connected\".  This is the first time this has happened to me in this card.  Previously, my Pixel 2XL, 3XL, and 4XL paired with no issues and I could control media playback through the radio touch screen.\n\nI've tried deleting all previous bluetooth devices, restarting my phone, and pairing my Pixel 5 repeatedly to try and fix this issue, but I always get \"No Device Connected\".  Has anyone gotten this issue before when your Pixel 5 to car audio?  If so, what are ways to fix this?",
