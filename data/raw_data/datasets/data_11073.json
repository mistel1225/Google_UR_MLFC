    "content": "The Google Pixel 4 XL stopped working in October. We called Google who referred us to a store (UBreakWeFix) to get the phone repaired under warranty. After two days at the store they claimed it was nothing wrong and if the problem continues I need to contact Google for a replacement since it is still under warranty. I have tried to contact Google several times and have not been successful. Please help me replace this phone. It is still under warranty until January 278th, 2021.",
