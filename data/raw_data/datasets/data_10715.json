    "content": "My home WiFi displays saved but show 'Failed to connect to the network' whenever I try to connect. I've tried connecting the device using the device MAC address, still no luck. \nThis has been happening every 2 days. It usually gets fixed when I move to the device MAC address but this time it isn't helping.",
