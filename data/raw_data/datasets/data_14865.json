    "title": "after october security patch pixel 2XL wont work, random shutdowns.",
    "content": "I have restarted the phone, all apps are up to date and I don’t have weird apps on the phone, all apps are from play store, im running the latest update on my pixel 2XL (including the oct patch update). Battery is good, have plenty storage space.\n  The phone is restarting frequently it goes from soft reboots to hard reboots where the google logo is stuck and it wont move. And all of that happened after I updated to the October security patch, had the sept one and my phone ran smoothly with no issues till now. I do know the latest update of the pixel will be released on December to finish the pixel 2 lineup support but please fix this before then. It is irritating, it doesn’t matter if im talking on the phone or if it is charging it will restart all of the sudden. Also i forgot to mention that when you restart the phone the screen will flash several times before it can actually restart the phone, something that i havent seen since i have the phone.\n\nEdit: this is a verizon pixel 2XL BTW. tried finding a method to go back to android 11 sept but looks like i need to have the bootloader unlocked. please help :(",
