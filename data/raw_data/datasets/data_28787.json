    "content": "I did not find a relevant spot on this page where I can post this. This is NOT a question rather a feedback.\nI had purchased Google Pixel 2 XL phone on a January 2018. The Audio adapter that came with the box worked barely for 6 months. Thankfully the product came under warranty and I was sent a replacement by Google completely free of cost.I was happy with the service then. \n\nUnfortunately, it's been barely 1.5 years since I bought the phone, the second adapter stopped working once again. Called up customer care and tried all the little tricks that was instructed like restarting, updating etc. etc. nothing worked. I was asked to purchase a new adapter from Flipkart (Only site where Google accessories are officially available in India). \n\nWhen I looked up the price on Flipkart it's freaking Rs 1440 whereas it's only $12 (Rs. 858.79) in US !!!!\nNot only the price is irrational ,there's a huge quality bug since this doesn't last more than a year! \n\nI was so happy with my phone but now I see it more as a baggage than a device considering the maintenance it comes with.\n\nA huge frown from me!",
