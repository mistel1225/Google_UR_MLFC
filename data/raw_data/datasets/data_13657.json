    "content": "Extremely disappointed that I'm not able to get my hands on the pixel 4a here in Hyderabad. I've been waiting for months, somehow managing with a damaged screen with the hope that I'd eventually be able to get this phone.\n\nWhy advertise and hype so much on flipkart, when the phone is out of stock / not being delivered to the pincode  (not sure why that's the case in a major city like Hyderabad) in matter of 30 mins?\n\nSomehow feel Google doesn't take its customers in India very seriously, the pixel 5 wasn't released - and now we can't even get the 4a.",
