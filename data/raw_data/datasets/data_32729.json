    "content": "I recently received a replacement for my Google Pixel 2 due to an issue with the charging port. I inserted the SD card from my old phone into the new one and went through all of the start-up procedures. Afterwards I received a text from Verizon to restart my phone. Since then, it has been stalled on 'Pixel is starting...' along with a loading bar. \n\nI can access settings and wifi, but I have been unable to open any apps or the access the home screen.\n\nI have reset the device several times. There have been no additional notifications with the exception of one SMS message which I have been unable to access.\n\nPlease let me know if anything can be done.",
