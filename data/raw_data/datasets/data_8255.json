    "content": "I contacted google about a defective phone I got from Amazon, they replaced it within a couple weeks, but that phone was defective. I then called and asked if I could have a refund because this was the 2nd defective phone I received from them within a month. They originally said they couldn't because I bought through Amazon but made an exception since this was my 2nd phone. (I think awesome I'm glad they can do that) I then spend the next 2 weeks calling customer service trying to get a shipping label, and it was always an excuse on why they couldn't (had to send IMEI, then they asked for the proof of purchase the next day, then the following Monday after the weekend they say I need to \"authorize\" them to process the refund. I do this and another 2 weeks go by before I hear anything, so I then xall them. And the specialist says that they can't process a refund because I got it off of Amazon. Despite all the previous calls and emails I sent. I ask to be connected to someone else and she refuse, so I decided to just get another replacent phone even though I just spent a THOUSAND dollars on a new phone because I thought they were going to honor their refund we talked about. Now I'm about a 1300 dollars for 2 phones when if they just said no in the first place I never would've bought a new phone. And to top it all off when I asked to be connected to their customer service survey they just hung up on me. Has by far been the worst customer service I've dealt with to date and I wish I neve supported google and has me wanting the unwire everything that's connected to my Google home and never support another google product again..\nIko",
