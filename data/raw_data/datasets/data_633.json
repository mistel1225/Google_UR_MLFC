    "content": "Every time I go into my google calendar app I see it sync and I get a \"Sync error\" message bubble at the bottom of the screen (see screenshot below).\n\n\nI get the same thing if I manually trigger a sync by tapping the 3 dots at the top right of the app and then tapping \"Refresh\".\n\nMy calendar events seem to be syncing properly, but getting that message constantly makes me a bit paranoid. Is there some way to fix this, or to at least figure out what's causing the error message?",
