    "content": "Google has restricted voice unlock (via Smart Lock) to selected tasks. Opening apps and making calls is no longer possible hands-free (although dictating SMS is still available).\n\nI understand why Google has done this — for security.\n\nBut…\n\nThis is a problem when driving, because here in the UK, we are not permitted to touch our phone at all while at the wheel. So, for example, when stuck in a major traffic jam, I can't telephone my destination to let them know that I'll be late.\n\nSo…\n\nHow can I make calls and open apps (such as Waze) hands-free while driving?\n\nThanks",
