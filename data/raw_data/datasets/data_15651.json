    "content": "Are you kidding me???? Even though I lost contact with help support and only got an automated response when I tried to re-establish contact to start a new chat, Google does not allow a new window since someone is already working on it. How dumb do you think I am???? No one is working on it. Tech support has ghosted me and I can't even reach out to a different person. Now what are you going to do to block me from getting help? Lock this question so no one can reply???",
