    "content": "I have a pixel 2 and pixel 3. I don't like to speak loudly when I am on a call, and just to be clear it's not like I am whispering. Is there any way to boost my voice audibility after the noise cancellation is done. For example the same way that the call volume can be adjusted the microphone gain should be able to be adjusted whilst in a call. I hate it when the other person I am taking to has to repeatedly say hello to because they cannot hear me. It's just demotivating. I really like the pixel phones I have the 2 and the 3, and both suffer from the same problem. My s7 edge is slightly better, I think it has a better baseline for the amp gain. This issue just drives me nuts. This is issue is not just with selected calls but all calls. So please I beg you to do 1 of 2 things or both. Either: include a feature in the next feature update for the pixel 2 and 3 such that the microphone gain can be adjusted the same way that the call volume can be adjusted. Or increase the baseline gain.",
