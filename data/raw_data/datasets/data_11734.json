    "content": "I must admit that I have been messing with the volume buttons out of habit, clicking them at times to make the volume increase or decrease every second. I'm unsure if there could be anything stuck inside the port but I have not cleaned it yet. Family has told me that there is no way to clean the inside of a Google Pixel USB port.\n\nI have had this phone for more than a year. And now after all of that time, no pairs of different sets of headphones or port adapters will ever route audio, regardless of what I try. Even charging it can become an issue at times, since having a charging cord facing a certain way is often the only way that the phone can be charged properly, but the stand works for wireless charging.\n\nDoes anybody have any idea what I should do? I do not have or ever had (or at least I don't think) a Warranty for my phone. Should I just have somebody look at it anyway and see what I can do? Or should I leave it this way and settle for a different solution?",
