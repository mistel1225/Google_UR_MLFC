    "content": "I have auto adjust brightness enabled, which works fine, except outdoors in sunny conditions.\n\nWhen out in the sun I want it to be at maximum brightness. \n\nHowever, it only turns to max if I angle the phone directly towards the sun. When I hold the phone normally, it will reduce the brightness and make it harder to see. \n\nIn my precious phone, I would just manually override the brightness, using the slider, to max. \n\nOn the Pixel though, the slider is already at max, even though the brightness is NOT at max. I can only drag to make it even less bright. \n\nThis is very annoying and makes the phone hard to use outside in sun.",
