    "content": "Is there a way to move the position of the Clock on my Lock Screen? It's currently in the top middle portion of my phone and I can't seem to find a way to move that. With my old phone it did give me the option to move it (ex. Top right corner or left corner) but I've tried looking in my settings and I can't find anything. Not sure if this is even an option with this phone. I am able to change the style of the Clock but not where it's located. Thanks in advance for the help.",
