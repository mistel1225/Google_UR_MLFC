    "content": "So I got an update for my phone and when it was restarting, it got stuck on the booting screen. After an hour of not touching it, I finally hard reset it and it automatically turned on and got stuck again. So I go hold the power button+volume up and then hold volume down to get to a menu where i select 'recovery mode' from there I get to a screen that says 'No command' where i hold power+volume up. After this, it takes me back to the screen where i selected 'recovery mode' but this time it says on the bottom 'ERROR: Operation Denied'\n\nYea plz help as I cant even factory reset",
