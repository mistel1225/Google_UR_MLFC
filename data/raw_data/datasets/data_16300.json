    "content": "The past few days I have been experiencing instant battery drain that will take me from over 70% battery to 1% in a matter of seconds. I factory reset the phone this morning, and the issue proceeded to persist. Phone is a Pixel 3 XL. Notably, the phone recharges to almost full capacity in 20-30 minutes after this happens. \n\nNot sure if this is a battery issue or a software issue, as the issue started soon after Android 11 OTA rolled out. \n\nBelow is a screenshot of my battery life taken AFTER I factory reset the phone. There are no nefarious apps that I can identify. ",
