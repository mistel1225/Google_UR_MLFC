    "content": "I returned my Pixel 3a for replacement for a battery bulge. The support person told me they would ship once the tracking information showed that I shipped my phone. My old phone has now been shipped and received and I haven't heard anything about a replacement being sent. I'm seeing some horror stories in the Community posts about weeks to months to get a replacement. It's impossible to be without a phone in COVID times - everything requires you calling from a parking lot. I've been borrowing a phone when I have to run an errand. \n\nWhat's the realistic actual timeline to get a replacement phone back? We've blown through the timeline the specialist told me to expect.",
