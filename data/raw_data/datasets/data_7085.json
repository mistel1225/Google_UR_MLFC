    "content": "I have a Pixel 4a running the stable version of android 11 and I have my screen timeout set to 30 seconds of inactivity. But for some reason the screen fails to turn off when the phone is left idle. Unless I don't lock the phone via the power button, the phone's display remains on. Restarting the phone is a temporary fix for now, but it keeps happening every now and then. Is there a permanent fix?",
