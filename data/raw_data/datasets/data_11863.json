    "content": "My screen went completely black one night while on the charger and never would turn back on. Vibration still worked but black screen. I have filed a claim a long time ago but never received a shipping box/label. The email shipping label button on the page gives me an error please try again later. How do I get new label so I can get this thing shipped off?? I have been trying to find a way to contact you guys for over 2 hours and the whole page just keeps giving me the run around. If I would of known it was going to be this difficult to own one of your phones I would of never bought one. So ridiculous.",
