    "content": "My Pixel 2 XL refuses to connect to my home network, even when its set to be unprotected. When i attempt to connect it states that it first fails to save the connection, than that it is unable to connect to the network.\n\nI have reset the network settings multiple times, and have booted into safe mode as well without any luck. I have also made sure that i am on the latest version of android as well.",
