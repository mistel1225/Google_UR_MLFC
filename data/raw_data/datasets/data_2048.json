    "content": "I know the original Pixel series is EoS but I wanted to sideload a custom ROM (E.G ParanoidAndroid or LineageOS) and was worried about a hardbrick/softbrick. Will you guys at Google refuse service 1. Because it EoS and 2. Because I tried to load something myself? I'm super worried about doing this and want to make sure with someone certified first. Also, If I hardbrick, is there a way to fix it? I'm good with PC things but not Phones.\n\nWith great thanks, UntrustedInstaller.",
