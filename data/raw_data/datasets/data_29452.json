    "content": "Hi there, after July security update my pixel touch starts to be unresponsive and/or trigger the wrong gestures. \n\nEx: by typing on keyboard I get notification center fully open. Really annoying\n\nI've already performed a full erasing but the bug is still there (also in safe mode). How can I solve? Thanks\nFun fact: if you lock and unlock the phone glitches vanish and you have time to reply text",
