    "content": "My main phone camera in the Pixel 3A is dead. I bought this device at Saturn in Treptow, Berlin DE.\n\nI would like to exercise my right for the warranty and have the phone replaced with a working one.\n\nI already tried all the possible fixes and the camera does not work.\n\nI know under COVID there are extraordinary circumstances but I cannot let the warranty expire just because of this, I could not find any suitable alternative to have the phone replaced as it would normally happen.\n\nThanks.",
