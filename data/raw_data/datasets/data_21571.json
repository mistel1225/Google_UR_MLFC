    "title": "Why is the battery life on the pixel 4 so bad?",
    "content": "The first day I used this phone and took it to work. It sat in my pocket from 8am until 2pm apart from occasionally using it to check a text or photo. I checked the battery. I was down to 50%! With only 20mins of screen time. It's now near the end of the day and I'm down to  25 percent after enabling battery saver and just over an hour's screen time. No power intense apps were used. \nBrightness was low, dark mode was on, now playing was off etc.\n\nHow is this meant to be a practical phone? This is borderline useless. I am extremely disappointed in this and honestly would like my money back and probably never buy a Google phone again. This is a real disappointment after coming from a Nexus 6p and Huawei p10 which despite their age have a better more useable battery life.",
