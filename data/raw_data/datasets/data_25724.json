    "title": "Pixel 3XL battery drains fast after 30%",
    "content": "At 30% battery starts to go down to about 15% in 5 minutes then battery saver kicks on and then I have mere minutes to get my phone on a charger or it dies completely.  Google assistant checks battery and apps and says nothing is wrong.  Talk to Google support though assistant and they tell me there is nothing wrong.  I've tried hard and soft resets(that's what she says) and resetting my phone. Nothing.  I watched the notification count down hours to minutes in mere seconds before the notification shuts off.  They wanted to take my phone for up to two weeks and then send me a replacement.  When I had my Nexus 6P they sent me a replacement phone first and then I was to send the old phone back right after in the same box.  I went from a Huawei P20Pro to this because of the Trump China issue and I now have a garbage phone.  5 months I have had this phone and I now feel helpless to do anything and gave up a great phone for garbage.üëç",
