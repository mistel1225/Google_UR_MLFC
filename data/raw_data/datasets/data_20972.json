    "content": "Hi, I have a new Pixel 3a. I have taken a few photos. I have downloaded Google Drive onto my PC and set it up. I then selected each photo on the phone in \"Share\" and selected google drive, and added them to the folder. They show up on my PC - brilliant! I took an extra photo to see if it would automatically send it. It didn't. How do I get photos to save straight to google drive automatically as I take them? Thanks",
