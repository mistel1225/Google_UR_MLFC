    "content": "My pixel continues to restart itself. I have done two factory resets and have not installed any default apps other than what the Pixel installs on it's own. I've tried using only the wall charger and the USB charger to see if there's some issue with the battery.\n\nI am now out of ideas. What advanced troubleshooting techniques can I perform? Thanks.\n\nEdit: When running in Safe Mode, the phone seems to have no power issues.",
