    "content": "I'd like to save photos from my Dropbox app to my phone (which will back up to my Google Photos) but when I click \"Upload to Photos\" nothing happens.  The pictures never appear on my phone.  This has happened with other apps too, not just Dropbox.  I've tried selecting \"Save to device\" which downloads it as a file into my Files app.  I then open my files app, click the share button, and choose \"Upload to Photos\" and it still never appears neither on phone nor on my Google Photos.",
