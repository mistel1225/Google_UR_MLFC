    "content": "I'm using the Gestures for camera. (Quickly open for camera). When I double tap the power button, I expect that Camera App would appear. But it appears as another app's camera feature.  How could I set it back to Double tap for \"Google Camera\" without deleting the other app. Thanks.",
