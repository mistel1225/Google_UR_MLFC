    "content": "When I press the + sign next to the current network, I press Download simcard, I press next, the phone checks networkdata and then asks me to scan QR-code from Vodafone. Which is very strange, since I have an esim from T-Mobile. And it's weird because there is nowhere in this process that you can select from which carrier you want to add an esim.\nAfter scanning the T-Mobile esim QR-code, it gives an 'Incorrect QR-code' error, and says I should contact Vodafone. Which would also be weird because they have nothing to do with this phone.\nAdding the code manually also gives an error.\n\nI bought this phone without a subscription to a carrier, at belsimpel.nl.",
