    "content": "When on a call the microphone works fine. But as soon as you switch to speakerphone the other person can't hear anything.\n\nAs far as I could gather the phone switches to the top microphone when speakerphone is activated. Seems that it's not working. \n\nTried a few other apps as well. Whatsapp, Google meet, native phone app. All have the same issue.",
