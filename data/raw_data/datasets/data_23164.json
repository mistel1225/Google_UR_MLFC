    "content": "I am having a problem with WhatsApp Calls when i leave the phone in Vibrate Mode ! \nIt vibrates only once (short vibrate like receiving sms ) and the call continues in complete silent . I have all notifications on and also vibrate calls are on . I am being forced to leave the phone in sound mode to not miss any call ! Anyone has experienced anything like this ? Other apps work fine ( viber )\n\nThis problem is only on lockscreen",
