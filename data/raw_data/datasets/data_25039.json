    "content": "I just got my Pixel 3a yesterday and updated to Android 10 and the camera. I tested the night sight at night, but the picture was just dark. Is the night sight suppose to have a flash or something? I'm I doing something wrong or is there a problem with my phone?\n\nI thought the night sight mode was suppose to work in an area where it's dark?",
