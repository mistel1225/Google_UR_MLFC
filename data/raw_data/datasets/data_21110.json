    "content": "My phone is just over a year old, it randomly turned off and started rebooting constantly, I can't turn it off as it just turns itself back on, gets to the google logo then restarts itself again! It's not been damaged in any way and I didn't even touch it for it to start doing it !, I've no warranty or money to fix it An I'm so frustrated as I still have to pay for a phone that doesn't even work ! Has any one experienced this, how did you fix it IF it can even be fixed !",
