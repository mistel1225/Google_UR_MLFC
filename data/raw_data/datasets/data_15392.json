    "title": "Recently updated my 3XL only to have pixel imprint vanish entirely as if it never existed..plz help",
    "content": "I've obviously cleaned the fingerprint sensor, I opened in easy mode, I performed a factory reset, I uninstalled any apps related to gestures or sensory things. Uninstalled/reinstalled gravity screen.. \n\nWhat I find most troubling is when I go to security settings the option for pixel imprint is just completely missing now as if it was never on my phone. \n\nThis has been my main way to unlock my phone for quite some time and contributed to me getting the phone in the first place.. is there no 3rd party software app/apk that would reinstall pixel imprint to its rightful place? \n\nPlease help get pixel imprint back or I would much rather just trade this for an upgraded pixel as this is faulty, or if that is unreasonable and I'm also not just trying to upgrade my phone and as my phone is still in excellent condition (cosmetically as well as internally, aside from the pixel imprint completely missing) I would gladly exchange it for the exact same phone with the working pixel imprint.. please, just anything you can do... Thank you so much...\n\nSincerely, R.S.",
