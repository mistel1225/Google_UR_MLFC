    "content": "My Pixel 3 had an issue where sometimes it would malfunction by the screen flashing bright, rapid, irregular flashes, and now it is completely unresponsive and will not turn on. I've followed all the troublshooting steps suggested by the support center, but nothing works. \n\nI also can't get get a hold of anyone through the \"Contact us\" buttons because it says the options are closed. I am studying abroad in Ireland, but I bought the phone directly from the google store and had it shipped to me internationally. I would just like to talk to a human about how I can get it replaced, since I've only had it since March 13th.\n\nThanks!",
