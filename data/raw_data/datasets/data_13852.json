    "content": "I have an LG STYLO 5 and an insurance broker guy I went to high school with hacked my Google acct and my Gmail emails. I used my STYLO 4 and I've found that I've been sandboxed?? What do I have to do to 1. Get back into my phone. 2. Get control back and my emails. My Google account has pics and videos of my son And more stored in my Google photos. I have been to metro they tried factory reset no help. Now I can receive calls but can't see past the welcome/language screen unless I put my former Google email and password. I've called cooperate, the tech dept. And LG tech. And tried Google. No help!! But my info from my old phone is in my STYLO 4 and it says it's sansboxed. And shows his name, company, Ip address, phone number, address and I don't know what to do??? Fn metro and google",
