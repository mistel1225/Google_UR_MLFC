    "content": "I'm a full-time telecommuter with a house full of hardware converging to a Ubiquiti router and thence a sorely taxed cable modem.  Just hypothetically: if I had a USB-C ethernet adapter -- and if there were to be a cable vendor outage -- could I temporarily run my network off my Pixel via USB tethering, by hooking that to my router in place of the cable modem?\n\nHas anyone tried an arrangement like that?  Would like to know if it's even in the realm of possibility...I know it sounds like \"stupid network tricks\", but it would be neat if it worked.",
