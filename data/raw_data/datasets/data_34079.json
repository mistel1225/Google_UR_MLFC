    "content": "When I first got my phone, it would show the Audible audio controls on the lock screen, but not the Spotify controls. Then, without me changing any settings, it stopped showing the Audible controls as well. I have checked the option of showing sensitive material and it's turned off (that is I've selected to show me everything). Is this a common issue?",
