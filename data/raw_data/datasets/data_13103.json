    "content": "Last night my phone was workikg completly fine. When going to sleep i put it on  charge as I usuallu do, and I woke up to my phone not responding at all. The screen is blank and nothing shows up. I was trying out the help page and nothing. The only thing is that when i plug it into the computer it seems to be responding. I would long press the power button and the computer would disconnet or connect the device. Im not sure what the problem is.",
