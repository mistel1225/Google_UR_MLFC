    "title": "New to Pixel & Google UI, Need better understanding of Hands Free",
    "content": "I'm coming from Windows 10 Mobile with Cortana.  I felt that hands free worked well with Cortana because I always got a verbal response to everything, specifically reading and sending texts while driving, which kept my eyes off of the phone.  I have adjusted all settings I could but Google assistant does not always verbally confirm!\n\nI received an email today, \"Apps to Help Me Communicate\".  Two of those Apps are Google Text-to-Speech and Voice Access.  Now, wouldn't those two apps already be in use within Google Assistant during hands free?  Should I download them?  How do they interface with other Apps?  Will they make \"Hey Google\" work better during hands free?\n\nI have been thinking about installing Cortana; I like Microsoft and have had success with Cortana, but if I can get native software to work, I would prefer that!  Also, I do not have an interface to any of my vehicles so the Google software for driving will not work.\n\nThanks for any help",
