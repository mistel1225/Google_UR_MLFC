    "content": "Hi.\nI bought \"Refurbished Pixel 3xl\".\nThere has never been a situation that is considered a customer's fault after receiving a smartphone.\nMost of the features seem to work fine, but there is one problem.\nWhen you use voice call functions of applications like KakaoTalk and Skype with GIGA WIFI 2.4ghz, 5ghz, you will get \"strange noise, the crackling noise, the noise of the fan running\". A very small but clear noise is heard from the top of the smartphone that is not seen on ordinary smartphones.\nIn LTE, symptoms do not appear first, but may appear later.\nThere are no symptoms when using regular currency.\nIt is inaudible to the ear of the elderly and noise is recorded and audible.\nI wonder if the symptom is considered a defect in the Google Pixel Smartphone Service Center.\nIf the symptoms mentioned are not determined to be self-defective, there is no reason to return the Pixel 3XL from Korea to the United States.\nPlease, reply. Thank you.",
