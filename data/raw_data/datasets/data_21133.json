    "content": "My Acer Chromebook spin 11 has exactly 6 months since I bought it, but like 3 or 4 months ago I connected headphones but sound was ringing in the speakers. I have already checked if the headphones were damaged, but nothing, I changed headphones, but nothing. I surf on internet through guest session, and my own session, but in neither of these ones the headphones work.\n\nIf you know how to solve this, could you please write?",
