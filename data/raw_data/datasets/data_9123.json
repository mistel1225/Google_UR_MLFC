    "title": "Does Pixel 4a with Android 11 detect malicious links in text messages? How do you know?",
    "content": "How do I know if a link in a text message is malicious or not? Does Android 11 detect malicious links in text messages and lets you know? Or will I have to resort to a third-party virus protector software that does this? And please don't simple say 'don't open suspicious links', because there are some texts with nefarious links that don't look suspicious. And if I do need a third-party VP software, then why is everyone telling me that VP is built into Android 11 and in the Pixel 4a and I thus don't need VP software installed? Thanks.",
