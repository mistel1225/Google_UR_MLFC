    "content": "Recorded 1/4 slow motion, works fine\nRecorded 1/8 slow motion in low light, works fine\nRecorded 1/8 slow motion in daylight, very jerky & stutters\n\nSee the samples here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89EIlS58F9U\n\nAny idea why this happens and how to resolve it please? With this jerky video, 1/8 slow motion is completely unusable according to me.",
