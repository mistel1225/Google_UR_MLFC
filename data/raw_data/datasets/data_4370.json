    "content": "In order to listen to music I have to hold my phone and headphones just right. If I push the lock button music stops. I can't put my phone in my pocket when I exercise. I've tried new headphones and that didn't work. I've tried Amazon music and Siriusxm and both give me the same result. I have not tried a new headphones adapter. This issue has been going on for several months now. Today I noticed that my phone had a notice that said it was charging when my headphone adapter was plugged into it. Any suggestions?",
