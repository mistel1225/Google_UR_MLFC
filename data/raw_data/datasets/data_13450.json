    "title": "Why does Chrome display a different tab's content when I click on a text box to type?",
    "content": "Often when I press/click on a text entry box on webpages (e.g. PhpBB forums) in a Chrome tab, the keyboard pops up, and the contents of a different tab appear. This prevents me selecting text or the cursor position. However, when I type, the display reverts back to the correct tab. Clicking again will switch the tab display again.\n\nSee the screenshot for an example: compare the URL bar to the screen.\n\nThis has persisted through reboots and the update from Android 10 to 11.",
