    "content": "I had submitted my device (Pixel 3a) for an issue fix via B2x and after that, I have been literally running after google device support guys on email for support and update. They are really too slow is responding and at times they don't even respond. I am really worried as to what kind of service will I get and what will happen to the device. Seriously I never expected such a bad experience from google.\n\nplease let me know how can I escalate this issue.",
