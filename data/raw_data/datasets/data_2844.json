    "content": "My phone screen is not responding to my touch, and I cannot find a recent backup from my mobile on the google drive. The service repair company says they will do a factory reset on my mobile, but I will lose my data. I am not able to copy the data on my computer, and also not able to back it up now. Since the phone doesnt respond to my touch, i cannot connect it to my laptop, and choose \"MTP\" to copy photos. I tried soft wares that will use the usb connection with the mobile to extract data, but since I cannot change my device settings to enable usb sharing, I cannot use that. I do not want to lose my data now.",
