    "content": "I've had this issue since day 1 with my Pixel 3a XL and can't find any info about it. Not sure if it's the screen or the Gboard but I have a feeling it's the latter.\n\nEvery once in a while, but not always, while swipe-typing words via Gboard, it goes berserk and starts just adding tons of 1- and 2- and 3-latter gibberish words as I swipe, even when not lifting my finger. It probably happens about 3-5 times a day.\n\nI thought maybe it was Gboard but have tried all the suggestions about force-quitting Gboard etc. but to no avail.\n\nI also think it might be the screen itself because sometimes I play a mini golf game where you pull back from the ball and release to indicate force, and the ball just (sometimes) releases when I'm in the middle of pulling back.\n\nI don't think it's a \"dead zone\" on the screen because it's very intermittent. But maybe related? Has ANYONE else experienced something similar and is it a 3a XL issue? Or a Gboard issue? Or something bigger OR is it maybe an isolated defect in my hardware?\n\nThank you!",
