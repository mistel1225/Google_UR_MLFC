    "content": "Whatsapp will occasionally show there is no connection to the internet, while all other applications connect without a problem. I've tried restarting, turning off my phone, wifi only, sim only, airplane mode with wifi on, resetting permissions and nothing has worked. I'll also get occasionally signed out of WhatsApp desktop. \n\nPlease help!",
