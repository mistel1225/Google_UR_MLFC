    "content": "Hi everyone - I've recently been having some issues with my camera on my 4XL. I haven't been having much luck narrowing down if it's a hardware or software (camera app) issue and the keywords I've been using and searching for haven't been helping me solve my specific issue. I'm aware of the Pixel 3 \"camera shaking fiasco however, mine doesn't seem to be exactly the same. While in video mode or using the view finder to take still pictures for that matter, the \"video\" rips or tears. This issue also gets recorded on video. The things I've noticed are:\nIt seems to happen no matter the orientation\nIt seems to rip/tear more when I pass vertical objects, almost like the stabilization has something to do with it.\nIf I have my ear near the phone, which is difficult to do, I can sometimes hear the optics clicking, this may mean nothing\nMy phone is still under warranty until May 2021\n\nHere's a video of what I'm seeing, more of the rip/tears are at the end. Chose the woods because of all the vertical trees. Hopefully the quality of this example is high enough:\nhttps://vimeo.com/519594905",
