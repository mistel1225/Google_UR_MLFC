    "content": "I want to purchase Pixel 5. I am from India and I am really disappoint to hear that Pixel 5 is not launching in India. You guys should launch the device in India. This is really annoying that you guys do not consider Indian market as important. You guys should give importance to Indian market as important as much as you give importance to US and UK. After seeing the review of the phone I am really desperate to buy this phone but I don't have any option to buy.",
