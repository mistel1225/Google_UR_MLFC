    "title": "Google Connectivity Service used almost a gig of data on my last cycle. Is this normal?",
    "content": "My data usage was much higher this month due to just starting to drive for Lyft. Top data usage was 1. Spotify: 2.20gb, 2. Lyft Driver: 1.01gb, and 3. Google Connectivity Services:700mb.\n\nSpotify usage makes sense. Lyft Driver makes sense - if they are disregarding my downloaded Google map of the city I drive in, even though their map is supposed to be an integration of Google Maps. \n\nHowever, Google Connectivity Services seems a bit high to me, and I don't know what's making it so high, yet nowhere near the others in quantity. The only thing close is messenger, at 693mb, from sharing photos. It seems like, as a VPN service provided by Google that we might not get charged data for using it. it also seems like if it is protecting us all the time the data usage would be much higher, since there are apps on the list that have used more data.\n\nCan anyone help explain this?",
