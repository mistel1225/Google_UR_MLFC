    "title": "Pixel 2 XL running low on storage because of photos and videos",
    "content": "So, I'm running low on storage because there is 25 Gb of photos and videos out 64 Gb. When I connected my phone to my pc to transfer all of them, I simply couldn't find them. Where can I simply find them? I looked at every folder and there isn't anything there except some few. From what I read on this community, the phone back ups my photos and reduce their size on my phone. I just want to move them to another device and free some space on my phone.",
