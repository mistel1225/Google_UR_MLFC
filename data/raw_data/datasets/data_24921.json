    "content": "I want to disable swiping up or swiping from the corner activation for Assistant and only use active edge (squeeze) activation. I can not find this setting anywhere, and it would be disappointing if Android didn't include the ability to turn this off.\n\nEvery time I touch the phone to lift it, the assistant activates. Since that immediately turns on the microphone and waits for someone to say something, this is annoying when in public or listening to the radio/tv/podcast. It also seems like it's asking for privacy trouble.",
