    "content": "I have 4 phones that use usb-c, and I'm using 2 original google chargers.\nMy 3 Samsung's charge no problem, but the pixel won't respond to both chargers at all.\nThe port is clean, nothing drastic or traumatic has happened to the phone, and the pins are intact.\nEventually the phone died and now I can't even contact google since I don't have another google phone.",
