    "content": "Hi. My pixel 3 xl has recently started making noise when I have a new notification, even though I have the device in vibrate mode. I have checked the volume settings many times and have ensured I'm in vibrate mode, but still it insists on making a chime. This just started happening after a recent software update, so thinking it could be related. Any idea what is going on?",
