    "content": "Changed the battery, left it charging for many days before turning it back on as i had to wait for a touch screen replacement. When I installed the new screen, the battery level was at 1% when I powered it up. Left it overnight and it ended up charging to 98%. Then, it started losing charge even though the phone was pugged in. Installed the app Ampere and it showed the same thing (losing charge whether or not it was pugged in).",
