    "content": "At around 8pm last night, I suddenly stopped receiving text messages on my Google pixel 2xl. I can send and receive calls, I can send texts, but I don't receive any. No other problems. Factory reset my phone, still not working. Called my carrier, they can't figure out why and issued a trouble ticket. I updated to Android 10 a week ago, don't know if that did it. Help!",
