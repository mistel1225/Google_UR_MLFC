    "content": "I have been having issues with my pixel 3a camera, specifically when trying to edit the pictures.  Here is what happens:\n\nTake picture\n\nGo to edit picture (light/colour/pop).  \n\nThe phone will then do the processing wheel forever.  I can minimize out of the app, but if I go back in it will continue the processing wheel.  If I exit out of the app, when I reopen the app, it will shortly go to a black screen.  I can exit out of that, but the same thing happens if I reopen it.\n\nI have tried:\n\nrestarting phone.  This will remove the black screen problem when opening my phone app, but the processing wheel freeze still happens if I try to edit.\n\nI have force stopped the app, and cleared the cache.\n\nAny help would be appreciated.",
