    "content": "How is this even possible for Google to launch pixel 4a with this price. Google is doing cheating to pixel 3a customers by launching pixel 4a with $349 price tag which is $50 cheaper than pixel 3a. How could it even be possible to launch a next generation of pixel phone while is cheaper than previous models. This makes pixel 3a owners aggressive. Google will not even provide a upgrade program. \nPixel 4a has better ram and better processor than pixel 3a for cheaper this is ridiculous. \nHow could they cheat to the customers of pixel 3a. Now what they have to do haaa. This is not fare for Google to do this kind of pricing. Then what about the pixel 4a 5G that should also be cheaper than which comes around $299. \nFinally this absolute partiality for pixel 3a customers.\nIn India there even about $100 extra price adds to the original price  for the tax  purpose.\nThis is not fare to decrease the price of next generation pixel than previous",
