    "content": "my pixel 4a has a black screen and is COMPLETELY frozen. I cannot get the reset to work (tried holding power for 30 seconds, power + vol up, and power + vol down). I feel the feedback when I push power, or touch the fingerprint sensor. It's not ringing when I find my phone or call my phone, but is still connected to my wifi router.",
