    "content": "I am running Android 11 on my Google pixel 64gb.  I noticed that my system storage was at 20gb so I decided to do a factory reset. When I did this, the system storage was at 13gb.. 2 days later I'm at 15gb.  Anyone else experiencing this problem? And if you are, how did you fix it?",
