    "content": "I have a Pixel 3a and this morning when placing it on charge it briefly recognises the charger then stops. Also the screen flashes in between the normal white symbols and the red and black symbols of low battery. I am not moving or touching the phone when this happens. Can some one help me? Is this a software problem or a hardware problem?",
