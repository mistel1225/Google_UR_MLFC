    "content": "I recently set up my new device. When people call me, their voice is very quiet. I have my call volume turned up all the way. I restarted the phone to see if that would help, no luck. This has happened with multiple callers. Sometimes it'll get a tiny bit louder, but then it'll go right back to being quiet. I thought maybe I wasn't used to where the speaker is, but there's no difference when I press my ear to various spots. There's no crackling or interruption, just a low volume. They can hear me fine. I don't have a case yet, so nothing is possibly getting in the way of the speaker.",
