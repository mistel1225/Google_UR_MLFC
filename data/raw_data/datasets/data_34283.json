    "content": "If I select a custom image, I can choose \"lock screen\" or \"lock and home screen\". If I select the latter and then go choose a stock wallpaper, it only provides options for \"home screen\" or \"lock and home screen\". It seems to prevent me from having a stock lock screen with a custom home screen.",
