    "content": "After installing the June 2019 update, my Pixel 2 XL is shutting down unexpectedly and \nbluetooth devices sometimes won't allow being enabled for phone calls. \n\nRestarting the phone and re-pairing devices don't help. Only turning off bluetooth entirely prevents the shutdowns.\n\nI would give more details, but this site claims I'm violating community policy when I do.",
