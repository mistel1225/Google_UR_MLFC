    "content": "I have made a movie with the movie Maker in the pixel assistant.  I'm trying to use a song that I have purchased and downloaded from the Google music app.  \n\nSongs I transferred from my iPhone show up, but not the music I purchased. (Again, I did download it after purchasing it, and the song is available off line in the music app)\n\nHow can I move it to the folder that is accessed with the movie app?\n\nThanks!",
