    "content": "I just switched from a Samsung Galaxy S8+ to the Pixel 3 XL and was very disappointed to learn that I'm unable to exclude specific apps from Do Not Disturb (DND).  Due to tons of spam callers, my phone is always on DND.  I allow phone and text from my Contacts but I am now unable to allow audible notifications from Messages and a few others, such as triggers from my house cameras.  This is huge for me and I'm considering switching back to my Samsung.  This other post here seems tell me that I'm of few people that would be interested in this feature.",
