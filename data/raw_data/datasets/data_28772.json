    "content": "My family still uses the Kik app for group chats. I've had my Pixel 3a for 2 weeks and have no problem getting Kik notifications to come through as push notifications or on my lock screen. But just recently they just stopped coming through. It's a pain to have to open the app everything I want to see if I have any new messages. I want notifications in real time. I haven't changed any of my settings at all and went through all the Kik troubleshooting ideas.",
