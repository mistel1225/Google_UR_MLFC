    "title": "Why is WiFi calling NOT available on the unlocked Pixel 3A",
    "content": "The option to turn WiFi calling on is NOT available on the unlocked Pixel 3A I purchased at Best Buy.\nI used the chat support option available on the phone itself and the representative was unable to find the option to turn on WiFi calling because it did not exist.\nI was told to go back to the store for assistance because my carrier does support this functionality.\nA Best Buy representative told me this feature was stripped from all the unlocked Pixel phones by Google so even if my carrier supports it I cannot use it.\nI need WiFi calling for work so I returned the phone and was charged a $35 restocking fee.\nWhy does Google not make this information public so that consumers can make an informed buying decision?\nYour online instructions on turning on WiFi calling are incorrect because step 4 of option 1 states \"Tap WiFi calling. If you don't see this option, it’s because your carrier doesn’t support this feature.\" This is NOT true because my carrier does support it and I have used it with every other phone on their service.",
