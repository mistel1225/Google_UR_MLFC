    "content": "I have the Google Pixel 2XL and had to do a factory reset. My calendar was the only thing that I can not restore my events. I am going to assume it is all lost. I only have the one calendar and do not share it with anyone. Any chance there is a way to recover it? Also, any way to prevent this from happening again? Ugh! The first and last time I try to use a pattern to unlock my phone!!  Thank you for your help!",
