    "content": "(Google Pixel 2XL) to take a screenshot I currently need to hold power and volume down. This doesn't work very well and will, more often than not, require MANY attemps before successfully taking a screenshot. When I look on the support site I see that other pixel users can simply hold the power button and tap screenshot. Is there any way for me to change my settings to this?",
