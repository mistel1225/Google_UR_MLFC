    "title": "Increased Data consumption on Pixel 2",
    "content": "Is anybody else experiencing recent issues with data usage? I've had my Pixel 2 since they first came out, I have 4gb of data on my plan, and usually only use about half of it. For the past 2 months the phone seems to suddenly have started using significantly more data, and I can't seem to understand what is causing the problem. I use wifi at home so I'm only using data for checking facebook or occasional websites when I'm commuting to/from work, plus a couple of games. (Nothing new during this period) \n\nLooking at my settings, it seems that Chrome is using the most data, which I do find strange given that I haven't really changed my browsing habits. I'm pretty sure when I checked in the past that Facebook was the biggest data eater. I've since turned on the data-saving options that are available, but it doesn't really help me to work out why it's suddenly changed so much. I'd rather find out something causing the problem and get rid of that.",
