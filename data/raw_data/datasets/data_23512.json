    "content": "So I've had a pixel 4 for a few months now and by far the worst thing about it is the GPS. It doesn't matter what navigation app I use, I'll be driving down a road and it constantly thinks iv taken a side street and starts spouting rerouting suggestions. I have tried: restarting the phone, turning on accuracy mode (it was always on), calibrating the apps, reinstalling the apps, updating the phone.... And sometimes I lose gps signal 100% and it doesn't come back until I start the phone. But still the accuracy is absolutely awful. Is there anything else I can try or is it time to try talking to support?",
