    "content": "For a few days (maybe a week?) now, my battery on my Pixel 3 has been draining *much* faster than usual. When I go to battery usage, and get the breakdown that shows what percent has been used by what, more than 90% isn't accounted for. (For instance, when I check right this second, I get get gmail 3%, ambient display 2%, phone 1% and messages 1%)\n\nHow can a non-visible process use so much of my battery? How do I figure out what process is involved, and/or get rid of it?",
