    "title": "Pixel 3 keeps switching off (sometimes before it fully boots, sometimes a minute or so after)",
    "content": "I was charging my phone through the night, on my wireless charging stand.\n\nI noticed through the night that my phone was off and the \"battery symbol\" was flashing middle of the screen (I figured I hadn't placed my phone on the wireless charging stand correctly and it had died).\n\nNext morning I woke up attempted to charge it, and then switch it on. I got as far as the Google logo and then it crashed. Later in the day I managed to boot up successfully and get about a minute of usage before it would crash and switch off again (screen just cuts out). I noticed battery was around the 69% mark.\n\nAfter this spell, it has returned to crashing before I'm able to boot up.\n\nI have managed to reset to factory default but that does not seem to have fixed the issue.\n\nThanks in advance",
