    "content": "My back camera will randomly stop working and also not work for third party apps. I've tried all of the troubleshooting tips. The only thing that makes it work sometimes is restarting the phone. Then it will work for a little, and then not work again. If I want to use the camera, I'll have to restart my phone again.\n This is the error that comes up when I try to take a video. The screen is just black on the camera tab.",
