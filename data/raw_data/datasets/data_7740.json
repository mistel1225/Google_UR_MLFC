    "content": "Hi all,\n  I recently flashed my Pixel 3a XL using stock image and Android Flash Tool from https://developers.google.com/android/images \n\n  Before I flashed my phone, there's nothing wrong when I took photos. But after I flashed it, I found it weird that even though I'm not tilted, the camera app says I'm tilted. If I tilt the phone, it says I'm not tilted.\n\n\n\n\n  I have already tried reboot, reboot into safe mode, uninstall camera app update and reinstall the update, none of them fix the issue.\n\n  And I also use the \"bubble level\" tool in Google search, it shows my phone is tilted. Unless I lived in a house that's tilted for 20 years and I never noticed, there's definitely something wrong.\n\nWhat can I do to fix it? \n\n\nThanks",
