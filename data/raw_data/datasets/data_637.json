    "content": "My Pixel 3 is stuck on the G logo screen with loading bar under it for over 2 hours now - I've read other similar reports from past years and Android versions and I followed advice to restart 7 times in a row in case it's a system upgrade gone wrong but each restart sticks on the G screen forever. I really don't want to opt for a factory reset and lose my data if possible!",
