    "content": "My husband and I both have Pixel 3s.  We turned on nearby sharing, have identical settings for bluetooth, location, etc.  He can (and has) successfully shared photos and videos with me.   My Pixel, though, doesn't give me the option to share via nearby share, period.  We've tried everything under the sun to get it as a choice, but it just doesn't exist.  Suggestions?",
