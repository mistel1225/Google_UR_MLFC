    "content": "while playing music on my car's Bluetooth system, my screen doesn't show the album or song that is playing. I just recently switched over from the pixel 3 XL to the Google and the Google pixel 3 did it just fine. Now it doesn't do that at all and my screen says unavailable... it's almost like the software on the pixel 5 is interfering with the connectivity with information that should be displayed on the screen. Anyone else have that same issue?",
