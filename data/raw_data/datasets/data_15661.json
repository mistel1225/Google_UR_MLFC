    "content": "I do not get texts when I turn my phone on in the morning that were sent overnight by friends or relatives. This happens continuously. People call me hours later or text me hours later to let me know they had texted me the night before.  They even send screenshots. First phone this happens with. Iâ€™ve had Verizon, Sprint, and T-Mobile. And I have always received texts that were sent overnight after turning the phone on in the morning with all my other phones.",
