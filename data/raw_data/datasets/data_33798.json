    "content": "When listening to music or podcasts with my USB C Pixel Buds, my Assistant continually interrupts. I either hear a thumping noise and she says, \"Sorry, I didn't quite understand that,\" or she skips to the next song. If I'm in a browser, she reloads my page continually. This only happens with the ear buds plugged in. I have disabled and re-enabled Assistant multiple times, cleaned the port, and restarted repeatedly. I'm running Android 9.0 on a Moto x4. Thanks for any help!",
