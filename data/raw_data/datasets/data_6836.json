    "title": "Phone App - Dial Out or Pick-up, no buttons visible - cannot hear anything - only hangup button",
    "content": "Seems to have happened after yesterday's update.  This is not the same as putting the phone up to your ear and the screen getting locked out bc of a buggy photosensor.  If I place a call the phone will show the number dialing but I hear nothing, see none of the buttons either and only can see the hangup button.  I'm not sure what is going on but I cleared cache and then deleted files for the phone and that worked for 1/2 a day and now we are back to the same.  I also seem to have the issue with picking up a call about half of the time as well.  \n\nAny suggestions?  Photo attached.",
