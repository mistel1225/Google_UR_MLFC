    "content": "I have my Pixel 3 for less the 2 years and it turned off at night because the battery ran out but when I plugged the phone to charge again it never turned on again. I left the phone charging overnight but in the morning I couldn't turn it on.\n\nI tried:\n- Charging with the original cable and brick\n- Charging wirelessly \n- Everything on this list: \"Fix a Pixel phone that won't charge or turn on\"\n\nAs of now, the phone is still turned off but it's kinda warm, so something must be going on.\n\nAlso, the USB-C port does not work properly, it only works with the charger but not with the original headphones, and sometimes I have to flip te cable around for it to start charging (even though it shouldn't matter).",
