    "content": "I've had my pixel 3XL about a year now and it has never had a problem until this morning. When I went to lock the phone everything worked fine but then to unlock my phone pressing the power button does nothing. I have to spam it for almost 20 seconds before the camera launches and I can back out and unlock it with my pin. I've reset the phone, checked for software updates, cleared my setting cashe and every other answer I could find online but noting helps. Any more suggestions?\n\nThanks",
