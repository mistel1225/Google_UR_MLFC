    "title": "DTMF Tones Not Accepted By All Services",
    "content": "I have a Pixel 2 and most dialer systems accept the tones from my phone just time.\n\nHowever, the tones are not recognized by Fifth Third Bank, and the dialer system my dentist uses. Based on other posts I've seen online, it appears I'm not the only one with this problem, or that it's limited to these two systems.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/pixel2/comments/agea73/dtmf_tones_not_working_cannot_open_my_apartment/\n\nI am able to get through their prompts by using a different DTMF tone generator:\nhttp://onlinetonegenerator.com/dtmf.html\n\nI was not able to get through their prompts when I used the Simply DTMF Tone Generator on my phone. \n\nMaybe those dialer systems aren't following certain standards? Even if it's not the Pixel's fault though, I need some sort of option to get through the prompts without having to pull up a separate website / app to generate tones.",
