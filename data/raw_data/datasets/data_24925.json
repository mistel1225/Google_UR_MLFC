    "content": "Hey everyone don't think I've posted on here before but thought I'd ask you guys about an issue we are having with one of our pixel 2 phones every time we open the camera app the phone keeps just shutting off and rebooting itself.. I've tried doing a factory reset to it same results turn it on and off restarted it same thing even went into the file cleared the cache and data same thing everything else works fine but the camera app just shuts off the phone to reboot no matter what we do sometimes we get abit lucky and it will stay on for a little bit longer than it normally would but then just phone just reboots again I've honestly got no clue what's going on at this point it's weird but I thought I'd ask if any of you had this issue with a pixel 2 or suggestions on what Todo i did look more into this after and have found out the update has been causing the app to crash and the pixel launcher to crash but wanted to see if anyone else has been having this problem or causing the phone itself to reboot cause it seems really odd x.x\nbut yeah everything else works perfectly fine but soon as the camera app is open instant phone reboot so in the end i decided to side load a different camera app to see if that worked got the camera pc app by Cstark27 and that worked perfectly fine which is good but soon as try and use the pixel camera app instant reboot.. \nI have heard that the newest update has been causing alot of problems with the camera app ether it's that or the phone itself I'm really not sure but it is weird.",
