    "content": "I received my new Pixel 3 XL on Saturday.\n\nI've noticed during voice calls placed onto speaker mode, and during Duo video calls, that I can't hear anything from the other end of the phone call. It's like I have the other person's mic. \n\nI have restarted the device and checked call volume is turned up, but to no avail.",
