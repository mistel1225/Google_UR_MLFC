    "content": "My Pixel phone died and won't reboot. I have already exhausted the various options and am no longer trying to repair the phone. But I want to erase all my data before recycling the phone. The only way I can \"communicate\" with the phone is by connecting it to my PC, where it shows up as a device named \"Qualcomm HS-USB QDLoader 9008\".\n\nMy question is: is there a way to erase the phone from the PC through this device?\n\nThanks in advance!",
