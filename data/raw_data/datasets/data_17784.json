    "content": "The monthly security update can  only be installed via LTE. When connected to wifi the updates don't install. The screen flickers between updating and checking update. But once you are back to LTE it starts updating. Facing this issue since February 2020. Issue both with PIXEL 3XL and 3AXL. I have changed the router, tried in safe mode, switched WiFi to unmetered, have done factory reset but the issue still persists",
