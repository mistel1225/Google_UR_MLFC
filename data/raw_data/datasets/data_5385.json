    "content": "Since one day the bluetooth on my Pixel 4a keeps switching on and off automatically. I've tried a factory reset, empty cache and forced stop of the app but this doesn't work. After the factory reset it functioned normal for half a day, but I'm experiencing the same problem again.\n\nDoes anyone have the same problem and can Google Community help?",
