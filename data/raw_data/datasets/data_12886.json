    "content": "I'm using my Pixel 3a to stream performance content over both Facebook and Zoom. This works okay using the internal microphone but I'd ideally like to take a direct STEREO audio feed from my mixer. Is this possible? And just to stress, the key issue here is a STEREO input.\nI assume that IF the phone is capable of doing this that some form of adapter would be necessary? Anybody already doing this?\nThanks in advance for any help.",
