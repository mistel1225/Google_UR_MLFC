I bought the phone in Canada but I'm currently in Nigeria, so I want it to be shipped to me in Nigeria immediately. Once I receive it, I'll get a phone repairer here to help me fix it. So please how do I purchase this pixel 3a screen from google right now from my location in Nigeria and have it shipped to me in Nigeria. Please help me with this. Thanks",
