    "content": "Last night I was about to go to bed and like I usually do I plugged in my phone and it took about 15 seconds to start \"charging\" not even \"rapidly charging\", 10 seconds later it stopped charging then it started charging again, when it's \"charging\" it's not actually charging though, when you go to battery it says \"Not charging\" while it's plugged in. I'm using the official charger that came with the phone, no clue if it's a hardware issue or a software issue or a charger issue, it seems to be working with my brothers OnePlus charger, it would say \"not charging\" for like 20 seconds then if would charge, same thing happens when I plug it into my laptop, idk what's going on but I'm pissed",
