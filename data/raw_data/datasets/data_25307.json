    "content": "Pixel version 1 updated to Android version 10.\nAudio is not working no notifications.\nWhen attending to the calls, I can hear the other person clearly, however on the other side I am not being audible.\nEven the headphone jack there is no audio coming.\nI believe when Android 10 is launched the architecture planned was only for newer version like pixel 4 which didn't posses these hardware.\nGoogle please fix these drivers for the hardware!!!",
