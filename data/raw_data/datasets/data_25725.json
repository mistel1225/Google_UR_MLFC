    "content": "The screen on my Pixel 3a has developed an issue where there is a line/column/band that is not responding to touch. You can't tell by looking, there's no visible lines or such, but it's noticeable when trying to use the keyboard for example and can't press letters that fall within that part of the screen. \n\nI downloaded an app to test the screen where you use your finger to colour in the screen, and here you can clearly see the dead/unresponsive area. See screenshot image. \n\nIt happens in Safe Mode and is still happening after a Factory Reset.\n\nAnyone seen this before? Is it likely related to a recent update? ",
