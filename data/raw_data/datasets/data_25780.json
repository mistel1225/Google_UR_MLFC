    "title": "Folders (not albums) in Google Photos on my Pixel3 did not backup, evident when setting up new Pixl3",
    "content": "My Pixel 3 no longer rings, only a screen popup for calls, the alarm doesn't sound, the handsfree speakerphone is inoperative, yet I can play voicemails and music. I did a complete backup. \n\nWhen they sent me a replacement I switched the sim card and activated the new one in the Verizon Store. While the photos came through as far as I could tell, NONE OF THE FOLDERS CAME THROUGH which I setup to organize my thousands of photos. These folders scroll horizontally in the Google Photos App next to the Camera folder and above Albums. THIS WOULD BE A HUGE LOSS so we reactivated my original Pixel 3 with the phone that doesn't ring!\nQ: How do I backup or transfer these folders?",
