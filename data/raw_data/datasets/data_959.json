    "content": "Hi team, \n\nI wanted to order an accessory which is showing coming soon from last 2 years. https://store.google.com/product/usb_type_c_usb_type_c?hl=en-GB\n\nI know I can somehow find a way out on forum to get email address for support but don't want to out so much efforts again. \nCountry: India\nPhone : pixel 2 xl\n\nYou guys come up with great phone, I love pixel 6 specs but, you know what I will not go for it and also won't recommend anyone though I love pixel 2 xl which I'm using from 3 years now. \n\nBad support, no service center in india, any issue with phone then have to courier it to mumbai vendor who doesn't even have a spare phone as substitute for some time. \n\nTell me one more simple thing, why the chat option been removed from ask Google ?\nAttached is the screenshot, I need someone to answer how can end user go to contact option if all the options are just links and not relevant topic ?\n\nTake this to executive level pls.
