    "content": "My pixel 3xl is sometimes not reachable when people try to call me and sometimes I can't start a call since it try to connect but nothing happens. I don't know the reasons, but sometimes restarting it can solve it.\nCarrier company can't solve it so I suppose it is a phone issue. \nDoes anyone experienced something similar? Do you know how to solve it?\nMany thanks in advance",
