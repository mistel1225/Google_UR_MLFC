    "content": "I would like to assign one ring tone to be used for calls received from people in my contact list and a different ring tone for all new/unknown callers.\n\nI could do this in a previous version of Android by creating a group containing all of my contacts and then assigning a custom ring to everyone in that group.  Anyone not in my contacts therefore used the 'default' ring tone, which I knew meant it was a call from an unknown caller.\n\nThis was a great way to know when to bother answering.  Is there some way I can replicate this on my Pixel 3 with the latest version of Android?",
