    "content": "I have recently updated to the November update on my Pixel 4 XL. I had seen this problem once before, but it quickly went away. Now, I found a consistently with the issue. \n\nWhen my screen brightness goes below 15 percent, all the colors wash out. This is very unusual and it is only when the screen brightness is below 15 percent. When it is at 15 or above, the colors are normal. \n\nI have tried restarting the phone several times, but it doesn't fix the issue. Help! It is very annoying to use at night.",
