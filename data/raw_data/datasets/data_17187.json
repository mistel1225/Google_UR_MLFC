    "title": "My phone wont turn on after getting slightly wet in rain.",
    "content": "i got wet in rain and pixel showed a warning that the USB devices are disabled to protect against any liquid. After 15 mins, the device got switched off. Later, i left it to dry (it was just wet in a drizzle of rain). This morning onwards, it wont turn on. Not even the battery symbol was shown. \n\nI tried keeping different chargers, but unable to get anything sorted.\n\nI have tried doing the troubleshooting as well, but no luck.\n\nAny support please?",
