    "content": "My earbuds can work on tws plus mode, but my pixel3 can only connect one of the earbuds not both, it seems like tws mode, another earbuds is connected to the first one not the phone. So can pixel3 work on tws plus mode? What should I do if it can, Or if not, maybe can update software to support, because Snapdragon 845 support tws plus mode.",
