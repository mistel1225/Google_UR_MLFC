    "content": "Earlier today (about 1:50 pm EDT) my phone randomly made a loud highpitch, long noise. My phone stopped working for about 20 seconds as the phone just beeped at max volume, then after the beeping stopped and my phone powered off. Then turned back on, everything on my phone is normal but this noise is really scary. Is this a problem?",
