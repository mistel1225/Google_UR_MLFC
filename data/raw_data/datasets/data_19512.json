    "content": "There's an issue with either Pixel phone or Android OS that calculates the Google Photos storage as internal storage, I've cleaned up all the app folders inc. telegram WhatsApp etc, I have read similar posts with the same issue and no solution! Contacted Google before but they weren't helpful! Last time I figured out that resetting the phone will reset the internal storage usage but after couple of months my phone storage is close to capacity again!\nCan Google fix this issue for God's sake! We can't keep resetting our phones every 2 months and many ppl even don't know what's the cause of it!",
