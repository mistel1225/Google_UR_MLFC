    "content": "Updated to Android 10 last night and played around with new settings.\nToggled Dark Theme on & off and now the Google search bar at the bottom is only showing as black.\nI've been into the Google settings and reverting to default, but the change doesn't take effect - the search launcher still shows as black.\nIs this a known bug? or am i missing something?\n\n\nThanks",
