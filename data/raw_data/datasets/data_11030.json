    "content": "I was part way through set up and data transfer. I was at the point where I tried to set up facial recognition.  I had set a pin.  I think I had not given my google account password. I accidentally pressed the power button and it went off. When I restarted the screen has the lock icon, and \"unlock for all features and data\".  How do I do this?  Do i need to reset?  I don't mind losing the  data!\n\nGill",
