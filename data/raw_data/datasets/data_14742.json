    "content": "Nothing seems to work. Did you get an intro and description of the new features? I didn't. So far none of the new features work except the screen record. No app permissions have been reset. No media player in either Google Play Music, YouTube, Stitcher Podcasts, or Audible. And no chat bubbles and any chat apps. I am really disappointed.",
