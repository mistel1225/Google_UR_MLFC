    "content": "Almost every time I open an app with a settings button in the upper right corner of the app, like the 3 dot icon, for example, I recently started getting a pop up box right below that icon that will say \"More Options\", or something similar to describe what that button does. Can I remove this? It's super annoying. Please see attached screenshot to see what I'm talking about",
