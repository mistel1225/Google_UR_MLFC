    "content": "I am over this new pixel 5.  Reboots randomly with no obvious reason 25 times a day.  Did all the usual... Factory reset,  removed apps, cleared cached etc etc but no cure. All updates are installed.\n\nGoing back to Samsung s21 tomorrow which is a shame as I batted through every pixel phone since they started.\n\nQuality control is just plain poor\n\nI'm over it. what a waste of money and time",
