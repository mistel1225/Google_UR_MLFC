    "content": "My Google calendar on my 3xl is not working. It duplicates every single event I schedule, and when I delete one of the duplicates, it deletes both occurrences. I live by my calendar, and this has made it unusable. I've tried uninstalling and looking for duplicate calendars to no effect, and other calendar apps have the same exact issue (likely because they sync with Google calendar). How do I fix this?",
