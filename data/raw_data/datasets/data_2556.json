    "content": "Yesterday evening I was watching a YouTube video on my Pixel 1 XL when suddenly the screen got stuck, I figured it crashed so I forced the mobile to turn off by pressing and holding the power button after which it won't turn on again or response to anything at all. \nI charged the Pixel the whole night to try again today, but the phone is still completely unresponsive.\nI have held the power button for +30sec with and without volume down and up and together, every combination, still no response after many times.\n\nWhen connecting the charger to a wall outlet or laptop it's also unresponsive. The laptop does mention something being connected, but the phone is off so I am unable to do anything.\n\nDid the phone just randomly die on me while it was being used and working completely fine?\nI live in a country without authorized Google repair partner's, what do I do?",
