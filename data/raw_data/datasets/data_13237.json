    "title": "Aggressive battery draining after Android 10 update on Pixel XL",
    "content": "I have a pixel XL which was performing perfectly fine until I have upgraded the OS to Android 10. The battery is getting drained super fast after the upgrade. Previously my phone used to retain charge for 10-12 hours after a full charge. Now its dying within 3-4 hours of minimal use. I rebooted the phone, cleared the cache, deleted unnecessary apps without any improvement. Last night when I went to sleep, it was having 65% charge. I woke up today to see that the phone is totally discharged. \nI have reached to pixel support team and they are not acknowledging the problem with the update.",
