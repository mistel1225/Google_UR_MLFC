    "title": "Unable to download ICICI Mobile Banking App - iMobile",
    "content": "Hi,\nI have seen that few of the applications which I try to download from the playstore show this message. Attached screenshots for reference.\n\nComing to iMobile by ICICI, I have not installed this app before. I generally search on google to find the latest .apk file but that also expires after the update happens.\n\nWhat could be the issue for this? I have also upgraded the firmware to android 11.\n I require this app for my banking purpose but, can't download.\n\nPlease look into this matter asap.",
