    "content": "Hey Guys, \niÂ´m a bit frustrated with my Pixel 5 right now. \nIt seems to have problem when using the voice record feature in Whatsapp. (which i use a lot)\nIt does work, but my voice is very quite and the quality is bad.\n\nMust be a software thing tho since the microphones on my device are totally fine when using other applications such as video recordings / Calls /...\n\nAnyone got the same problem or even better a solution for this?\nThx",
