    "content": "My fiance's phone has an issue to where she can't hear me if she's using speakerphone or if we're on Google Duo. This just started happening within the last two or three days.\n\nWe have tried the following: using different apps, rebooting in safe mode, deleting recently installed apps, resetting network settings, having bluetooth on and off, and factory resetting the phone. After resetting the phone, we tried a regular phone call using speakerphone with no apps / updates installed. Then we tried installing only google duo, and video chatting. None of thee above worked.\n\nVerizon sent her a new pixel 3a, and it is also having the same exact problem. We set the phone up, and tried a speakerphone phone call immediately after booting it up, and still no sound. We tried Google Duo, and she still can't hear me.\n\nSpotify, YouTube, etc all play sounds normally. It seems as though the issue only persists with video chatting and / or trying to use speakerphone.",
