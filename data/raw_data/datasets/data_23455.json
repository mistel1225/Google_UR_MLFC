    "content": "My Pixel 4XL no longer boots to home screen...it will reboot fine but gets stuck on PIXEL IS STARTING. \n\nI've tried safe mode and recovery modes but not 100% sure what to do. \n\nI want to avoid factory reset as I want to get some physical media off of the phone first. I tried connecting to a PC and selected USB File Transfer but it never would mount the drive. \n\nCan I get my media off of this without a factory reset or can a recovery/safe mode option work?",
