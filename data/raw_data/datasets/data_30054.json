    "content": "Loving my Pixel 3 camera for documentary video but way too often, I'm losing sharpness with even the slightest of zoom when trying to get close ups of flowers. If I move the camera in \"macro style\" then I get the \"move back to focus\" screen warning and if I try to keep minimum distance and zoom in then I lose edge sharpness in the resulting video.\n\nWould a clip on macro or zoom lens deliver sharp results if I wanted close ups ?",
