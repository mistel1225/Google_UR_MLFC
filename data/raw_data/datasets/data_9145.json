    "content": "My phone stopped detecting my current  SiM card yesterday. I added another sim card in it and same issue. When I place the SIM card in another device , it works in other devices just not my current Pixel. I called Rogers support who deduced it's a device issue and told me contact you. I have also reset my network settings numerous times, airplane mode on and off etc . Nothing has worked! Help!",
