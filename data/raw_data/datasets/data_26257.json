    "title": "USB C connection is very loose (earphones/charger)",
    "content": "I have a Pixel 2 and I am experiencing some issues with my USB C port. No matter what I plug in (charger or earphones) it struggles to connect.\n\nI have to press the connectors in really hard for it to connect. The slightest touch and then it comes loose again and has no connection. This means often the phone does not charge unless in \"the perfect position\" and I cannot use headphones (USB C) as sligtest movement disconnects it. It is like I cannot insert the USB C far enough.\n\nThe charger/headphones also only work one way the cable is plugged in. I thought it was omni-directional plug?\n\nI have extensively cleaned the port and cables but it does not work.\n\nThank you for any assistance.\n\nP.S. I had to access this forum via Firefox browser because Chrome could not display the category menu.",
