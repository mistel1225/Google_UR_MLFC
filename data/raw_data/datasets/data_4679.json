    "title": "Pixel 4a 5G Speakerphone sometimes Won't Work until phone restarted",
    "content": "I'm now on my 2nd Pixel 4a 5G, and the speakerphone has again become flaky.\nThe problem is that on some calls the speakerphone button doesn't workâ€”\nthe phone remains in non-speakerphone mode.\nRestarting the phone usually (but not always) solves the problem for a period of time.\nA friend also on her 2nd Pixel 4a 5G has the same problem.\nIt's almost certainly a software bug, so another replacement isn't likely to help.\nBut Google Support has nothing else to suggest.\nI've followed the Nexus-Pixel from the original Nexus One,\nbut problems with the Pixel 4a 5G may finally drive me away.\nI think it no coincidence that the trade press is reporting a decline in Pixel loyalty.",
