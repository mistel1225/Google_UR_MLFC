    "title": "My google pixels mic and sound stop working after around 5-10 minutes After I start it up",
    "content": "My google pixels mic and sound cut out shortly after I start the phone up and I have to restart the phone to get it back only for it to cut out again, it was not an issue before the android 9 update and I don't know how I can fix it. I've already factory reset my phone and that only helped it last a day before the sound and mic started cutting out. I'm unsure on what to do and I would like some assistance with the problem as it prevents me from making calls and listening to music.",
