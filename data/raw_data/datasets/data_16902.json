    "content": "The volume down button appears to be jammed (although the button itself is not physically jammed as I can hear it click). I have already tried resetting the phone, which actually creates a bigger problem since when I press the power button with the volume down button still in the jammed position the phone goes into rescue mode and still remains jammed.\nI cannot get past this stage. I cannot find a way to contact Google through their support page.",
