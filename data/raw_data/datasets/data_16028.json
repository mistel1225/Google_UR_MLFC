    "content": "Can someone tell me the return policy on the Pixel 4a? I ordered 2 on the first day available and bought them directly from Google. I was very disappointed with the faded screen colors but couldn't afford much else. \nHowever, (we are on TMobile) we have constant problems with making/receiving calls here at home. Visitors with other phones (Apple, Samsung, Motorola) have no problem making or receiving calls while in my home - even those that are also on TMobile.\n\nWe have no choice but to try other phones. Is it too late to return these Pixel 4a's?",
