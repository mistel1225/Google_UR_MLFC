    "title": "Pixel 4a: What's App notifications come with and without sound although settings are not changed",
    "content": "Hello community,\nMy Pixel 4a receives messages on what's app and shows them to me on the lock screen but sometimes with and sometimes without a notification sound, or sometimes with a delayed sound, or if I get 3 messages in a row, it only makes the notifications sound once ... I tried all online help hacks i could found but couldnt fix it including: restart phone, set back to origin and put on all my data manually, deinstall various apps to see if they interfer, enable unlimited data access, switch off opimization of battery for the app, delete cache of what's app, of course switch on \"all notifications\" in the notification option. Also i checked if there are any rules set, but nope, it says 0 rules in the system option and i have the latest update",
