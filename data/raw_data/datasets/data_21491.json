    "content": "Hi there, I've recently ported to another service provider (which I have used in the past with no issues), and now phone calls will not work - I cannot make or receive phone calls, however texting and using mobile data works fine which is strange.\n\nI tried this Sim on a different phone device which worked - I was able to make calls from the other phone. Therefore it is not an issue with the service provider. \n\nAny ideas on what I can do? I have restarted multiple times and manually selected the network, but with no luck.\n\nThanks!",
