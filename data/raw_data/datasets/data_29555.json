    "content": "My Pixel 2XL has been very flaky on WiFi after the latest June updates. WiFi connection reliability is very poor, I'm unable to do much while connected to WiFi. Other devices on my home network have not had any WiFi issues, so I believe this is a pixel only problem. I have found other users reporting similar issues on Reddit.",
