    "content": "I am using the Sudio Nio earphones. They fit great and the sound volume is fine when I'm listening to calls. However when I am listening to music or audiobooks the sound is soft. If I'm walking on the road with them I can't make out the words of the audiobook.\n\nI have turned on the \"Disable maximum sound\" option but there is no change in volume thur far.\n\nSeek your assistance.",
