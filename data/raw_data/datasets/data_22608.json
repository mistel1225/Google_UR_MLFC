    "content": "Since yesterday my Pixel 3 has stopped loading certain websites. It just seems to take a long time to load then freezes Google Chrome. I'm able to access the same websites on other devices (Pixel 2 and laptop) using Chrome on the same network. I've tried clearing the cache on my apps and I've tried accessing the websites using 4G and nothing seems to work. \n\nHas anyone else experienced similar issues? or does anyone have any advice please?",
