    "content": "Post the recent Android 10 updates my Pixel 2 XL's RECENT calls phone list ... i.e. Call history is not getting updated immediately after any Dialled /Received/Missed calls..... Although magically after few hours.... it gets updated to the RECENT CALL list.... but immediately after the call... it's not visible.... I also recently did a Phone app update.... but no improvement...... I am forced to use Truecaller dialler to check my latest/recent phone call history list for dialled/recived/missed calls",
