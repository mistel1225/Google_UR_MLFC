    "content": "I keep having this issue where apps are resetting when I leave them for another app or just turn off my phone for even just a moment. At first I thought this was happening on a single isolated (game) app, but then I noticed that it was happening on other apps too (apps that are not even game related or taxing on the phone itself). This even happens when I only have 1 app open.\n\nAnyone else having this issue?",
