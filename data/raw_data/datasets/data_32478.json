    "content": "So I received this phone as a replacement for one which had a fatal camera error. Got really excited, set it all up... But now after less than 24hrs of using this phone it occasionally and speradically locks itself, sometimes a few times in a row. I've tried rebooting in safe mode, changing the auto lock settings and even factory reset it. And I don't have a magnetic ring or case. The problem seems to be happening less frequently but still an issue. I'm really disappointed and would be grateful for some help.",
