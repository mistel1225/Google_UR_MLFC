    "content": "No notifications on notifications bar or notification dot on app icon.\n\nAll notifications were on, turned off and turned on again. Phone restarted several times. Gmail disabled (cannot uninstall/reinstall on Pixel) and re-enabled. Still no notifications.\n\nEmail is available as soon as it comes in so there is not a syncing issue with the account.\n\nI called Google One support and they directed me to post here.\n\n - 12/9/19 Still an issue and waiting for a response",
