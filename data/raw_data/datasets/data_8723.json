    "content": "My Pixel 4a has died - cannot charge and cannot power up. I have made arrangements to ship it to Google Help Center to see if they can fix it. But how can I do a factory reset if there's no power at all to my phone. Is it even possible? I worry about sending my phone in without doing it.\n\nThanks,\nShannon",
