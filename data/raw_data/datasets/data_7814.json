    "title": "Pixel 3. After Android 11 update, unable to open downloaded PDFs. Says file is corrupted or invalid",
    "content": "Open PDFs from trusted sites/email/links. Successfully on other phone or computer, and same file was able to open prior to v11 update.  Uninstalled adobe pdf, and installed google off, and same issue.  The files seem to download first and then open in app.  I've done it where one replaces the file with a fresh download, or even opened up recent ones.  Older pdf files prior to update seem to open.  Seems could be an issue with how they are saved on the device?",
