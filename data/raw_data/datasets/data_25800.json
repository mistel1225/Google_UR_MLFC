    "title": "Using Gmail on Pixel phone and wanting to send to a Label from Contacts",
    "content": "So in Contacts I have created a Label around my family (a distribution list so to speak).  On my computer I can run GMail, create an email and enter the name of the Label and it identifies everyone in my family.  Works great.  Problem comes in when I do the same thing on the Pixel.  Open the GMail app, click + to create a new message, type the name of my Label and GMail can't resolve the Label.  So far the only way I have found is to open Contacts and click on the 3 lines next to Search, select the Label, click the 3 dots on the right and have it generate the email.  This is not an intuitive way to use a distribution list.",
