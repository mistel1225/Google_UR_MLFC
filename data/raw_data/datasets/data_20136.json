    "content": "Bluetooth connectivity between my Pixel 4 and my 2015 Mercedes Benz ML350 became very unreliable after the June 5, 2020 Android  update.  Before that date there was rarely a problem connecting. Now, it connects maybe one time out of ten.  Often, it connects right away, shows 5 bars of signal strength, then immediately displays \"No Service\". The phone service provider is Google Project Fi and I am in a metropolitan area.",
