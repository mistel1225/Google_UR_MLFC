    "content": "I tried lots of spam blocking apps, pretty much all of them. I found that HiYa (making it the default phone app) combined with YouMail (making it the default Caller ID app) gave the best results.\n\nNow I just learned the Google Phone App now has a Spam Blocker and a new feature called \"Verified Calls\" which tells you if a business that was pre-verified is calling and why.\n\nDoes anyone that's used all these apps know how well the Google Phone App Spam features stack up against the other apps? Is it good enough to basically replace these other apps can/should it be combined with these other apps for maximum blocking?",
