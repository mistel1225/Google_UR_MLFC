    "content": "Pixel 3a and AUKEY EP-B40 Latitude Wireless Earbud.\nYes I know how to pair, and I followed the instructions, and I've tried rebooting the pixel and turning both devices on and off in every possible configuration/order -- I've tried everything I can think of.  \nThe pixel DOES find all the other bluetooth devices in the area.\nThe aukey earbuds DO still pair with my iphone.\n\nAny ideas? Very frustrated. Thanks in advance!",
