    "content": "Very noticeable battery issues just days after warranty expired. All requests for warranty exchange were declined - and I just accepted it.\n\nFast forward another 4 months. About an hour ago, I took off my case and was shocked to see that battery case is SWOLLEN! The phone is literally on the verge of catching fire or exploding.\n\nQuestion: Are there any known cases of Google doing the right thing and exchanging the phone, or should I just throw it away before it blows off my leg?",
