    "content": "Android 11 update is a buggy mess that should have never been released in this state. The performance on my phone had been severely downgraded. Apps that had run smoothly and consistently on Android 10, are crashing repeatedly, sluggish, broken messes now. The phone itself gets hung up on standard activities and actions.
