    "content": "The gestures for skipping songs (or as far as I can tell any gestures at all) do not work. I don't mean they do not work sometimes, I mean I have never one single time since getting this phone gotten them to work. I've checked that the related features are turned on, I've moved the phone out of its case, I've tried restarting it. It's pretty disappointing because it seems like a fun feature.",
