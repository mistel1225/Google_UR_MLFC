    "title": "Google Pixel battery inop after last update. Only displays 1% but lasts all day. Confusing.",
    "content": "Once unplugged from a full charge (original factory charger and tested on multiple outlets), battery drains to 1% within two hours, yet lasts all day. This happened the same day I updated my software. Frustrating because I never know if it is actually going to die on me any minute. \n\nI have completed a Factory Reset, restarted in Safe Mode and taken it in to Verizon.\n\nVerizon just told me to buy a new phone... Seems awfully convenient.",
