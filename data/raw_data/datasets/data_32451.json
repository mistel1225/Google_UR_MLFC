    "content": "I have a google pixel 1 with android 9, security patch level april 5, 2019.  The phone is now constantly vibrating.  it gives two short vibrating pulses in a row, followed by about a 1 or 2 second gap, then two more pulses, over and over and doesn't stop.  it started right after i ran the security update yesterday, before that it never happened before.  it seems to be related to notifications, one time going into whats app and clearing unread chats stopped it, but any hidden or ignored notification seems to cause my phone to start buzzing and freaking out again.  rebooting the phone didnt help either.  as soon as the notifications come back, the phone goes crazy again.\n\nany help you could give to solve this would greatly save my sanity as the constant vibrating is driving me insane.",
