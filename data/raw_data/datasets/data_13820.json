    "title": "My phone screen is not responding in a very specific area.",
    "content": "There is an area about 2cm in height from the top of my phone down and the screen doesn't respond in that area. I cannot tap on a search bar at all, not even sometimes. I can pull down the notification center but that's it. When I do pull the notification center down once (not showing the settings option), only sometimes does clicking on things like the flashlight or bluetooth icons work. Between the icons, and the clock at the top of the screen, the screen does not sense touch at all. This area is exactly where most search bars are in apps such as the play store, chrome and so on.",
