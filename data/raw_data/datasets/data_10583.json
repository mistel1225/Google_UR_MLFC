    "content": "My Pixel 3 can't boot all of a sudden, I tried everything to reboot it but all failed. I consulted a native phone repairer, and I was told that the battery of the phone remains well, so it seems there's something wrong with the other hardware like system board.\n\nI bought this phone 2 years ago, and it's warranty has expired.\n\nI'm in China now, I wonder if there's any possibility to ship the phone to US or somewhere else to examine and fix it? If yes, how much should I pay for all of this approximately? If it's impossible or too expensive, I'm afraid I have to consider buying a new phone. :(\n\nI really love this Pixel 3, and it cost me much. I feel quite sad with its malfunction.",
