    "content": "Just received google pixel 5, compared with my old BQ Aquaris, the screen is so white.\ni mean, white is not white is a litter bit yellow.\nAll the settings are touched but still with some yellow tint.\n\nAlso read previous post, but my doubt is, if it is done on purpose or it is an issue in my mobile.\n\nas not too much people reported, seems like a screen bug.\n\nalready talked with the sales shop but they do not know if it is a normal colour or not.\n\nSo, please resolve my doubt.\n\nRegards.",
