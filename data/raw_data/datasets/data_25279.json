    "content": "I'd like for the phone to default to the Home screen every time I unlock it.  I don't want it to open to the last app I was looking at before locking. I just find it annoying. Is there a setting for this? \n\nI suppose I could get into the habit of swiping up before locking, but it would be so convenient if I could set a default instead.",
