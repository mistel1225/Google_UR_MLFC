    "content": "My Pixel 3 doesn't recognize any USB connection - charging works fine, but when I connect headphones or USB cable to any computer/car, it doesn't recognize it at all. \nonce headphones or USB cable is connected, USB menu is disabled. using developers menu I can set it to 'Data Transfer' (or any other option) but it doesn't do anything. \n\nI've already tried to reset the phone and cleaned the socket. Nothing seems to help.\n\nAny ideas or suggestions?",
