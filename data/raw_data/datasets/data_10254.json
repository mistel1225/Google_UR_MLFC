    "title": "Since the casing is magnetically reactive steel, can you safely mate the phone to a magnetic holder?",
    "content": "I used a magnetic mount in my car for my previous cell phone and had affixed a metal plate inside the casing so it would attach. The Google Pixel 5 has a steel case and I noticed it will mate directly to the magnetic mount. I'm just a little concerned if the magnetic field might cause some issues with the stored data phone or possibly corrupt firmware. Will it be fine, or would it be better to get an external casing and use a steel plate on that?",
