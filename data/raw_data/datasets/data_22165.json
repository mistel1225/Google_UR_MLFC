    "content": "My parents live in a rural area and high speed internet is not available, so no WIFI. They have unlimited data on their phones (hot spot data is not unlimited). They watch Netflix on their phones but want to cast that to the TV. Is this possible? Chromecast requires WIFI, I believe. A wired connection to the TV would be ok, but I don't think the 3a transmits video this way. Is there a workaround?",
