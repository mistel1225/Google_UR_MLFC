    "content": "I was on a phone call. I started to hear the Google AI say something about recording. I though it was the other person phone. What I could make out was push # key to start recording and push ## key to stop recording. It got into a loop. I had to end the phone call to make stop. Then there was a voicemail from my phone with nothing but dead air on the voicemail. 3 hours on Google support chat no progress. 7 different support team members. No solutions.",
