    "content": "Beating a dead horse here BUT PLEASE - can someone tell me how to bypass the lock features of the PIXEL 3? I simply don't need it. I have it set to lock after 1 minute but to REMAIN unlocked on my person, in my home and near a secure device - this lap top (which has never been locked in 4 years). Except for the time delay -  none of those settings work!\n\nI have never lost a pair of eyeglasses, a wallet or a pocket comb for that matter. I won't lose the cell phone. In fact - in my town if I did leave it somewhere I would want someone to pick it up and call me from it to tell me they found it. This cell phone remains in my pocket or in a belt sheath whenever I am away from home. I don't need the Google police protecting me from my own stupidity.\n\nI will be happy for a fix that allows me to turn off/on at my choice - which most weeks would be NEVER - but this constant lock up is driving me nutty. OK to send me a private email if this is a top secret Google procedure. Smiley face here!!.\n\nThanks very much. \n\nDusty",
