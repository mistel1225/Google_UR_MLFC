    "content": "Hi, mine is a Google Pixel 2XL, my 3rd one!  The sound-clarity, during conversations, is atrocious, even on speaker phone! I keep asking the other person to repeat themselves.\n\nWould a 3rd party App (say, a graphic equalizer) be safe to use with the phone?? IF so, would ANYONE know of such an App?\n\nThanks a million for any help!\n\nLone",
