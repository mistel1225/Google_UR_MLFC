    "title": "Pixel 3 Bluetooth headphones - connects but sometimes won't play through them",
    "content": "My Pixel 3XL will sometimes (~50% of the time) CONNECT to my bluetooth headphones no problem, but will not PLAY SOUND through them - it continues to play sound through the phone's speaker. When you click on the \"phone speaker\" button to try and select another device, it doesn't show it.\n\nTroubleshooting:\nThe device DOES have \"Media Audio\" checked\nThe device DOES work with other phones\nThis problem occurs with MULTIPLE DEVICES (different bluetooth headphones)\nRestarting sometimes, but does not always, fix the problem\nHas been occurring on and off for about 18 months now\n\nPlease advise, very frustrating - this is only the worst of a tall stack of bugs I've experienced with my Pixel 3 XL (speakerphone mic doesn't work, wifi randomly turns off and have to restart to get it back, Chrome randomly loses internet, bluetooth randomly disables, ...) - I got a Pixel thinking it would be the smoothest/cleanest Android experience, now will never buy a Pixel again.",
