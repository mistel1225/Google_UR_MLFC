    "title": "Nothing but problems from Google Android Pixel Security Update - August 2020",
    "content": "This update has caused nothing but problems on my phone. Had to restart because the phone was lagging by 30sec-1min post update. Will not connect to android auto anymore. Will not connect to PC via usb anymore. Bluetooth AEC is all messed up. When you start a call its all good then within 10 seconds it goes so low you have to crank it all the way up on the bluetooth device no matter if this is a vehicle or headphones. Is there something I can do to try and reload the security update or roll it back till google programmers get this fixed. Its so bad I am almost ready to go Apple for the first time. To add insult to injury my family member's phone (same model, bought same time) is working just fine!",
