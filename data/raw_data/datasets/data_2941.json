    "content": "How can I disable (and preferably remove) the Emergency call button? I've hit it twice by accident now, and the next thing I know, I hear someone on my phone saying \"What is your emergency?â€œ\n\nThe button is just in a very bad spot. Almost anywhere else on the screen would have been ok, but where it is now makes it WAY too easy to accidentally hit the button. The last thing those good folks need is a million Google Pixel users making accidental calls to 911. ANY help would be appreciated. And Hey, Google! Move that thing in Android 12!!!",
