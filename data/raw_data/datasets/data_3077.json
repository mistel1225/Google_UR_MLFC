    "content": "Now that I have lots of app icons over a number of home screens I would like to re-arrange everything into an arrangement that suits the way I work with the phone.\n\nI know I can do this on the phone by dragging icons back and forth but I wondered whether there is a virtual interface on Chrome, say, that would allow me to rearrange everything on my PC and then have that reflected back to the phone?",
