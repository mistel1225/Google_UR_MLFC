    "content": "Hello, \n\nSince June 2020, I have been having issues with my phone's power button. It will not unlock the screen to wake it up or put it on camera.  I'm getting frustrated because phones are expensive and I got my Google pixel 3 in December 2018, so it is not in bad shape at all.  I have tried restarting my phone, clearing the cache, deleting apps, making room for storage, etc.  It was working more recently, then my phone updated and it is happening again. \n\nWhat do I do? \n\nThanks!",
