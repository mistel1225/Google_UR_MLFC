    "title": "Pixel 2 Phone Settings Needs Camera permission to operate???! Suspicious much??",
    "content": "I'm utterly confused as to why the settings app requires  the use of camera while on the app. Is there a reasonable reason for this? Knowing Google it just seems like another discrete way to get user data without their permission. Additionally the Google app won't let you choose the option of \"Use microphone while app in use\" and only lets you pick either use ALL The Time or Deny. Another fishy example. Does anyone know the reason for this or has anyone found a workaround to not allowing the Google app to use microphone at all times and only when using Google Assistant or the app? I emailed support but they were of no help with this.",
