    "content": "Assistant doesn't work. No swipe left to \"cards\" screen. The search bar at the bottom will only search apps instead of web search. I went to play store and it showed the app as not installed, so I reinstalled it. Still nothing. When I try to access assistant in settings, it just goes to home screen now. WTF?",
