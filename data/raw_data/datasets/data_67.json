    "content": "Hi.\nI had an Android 11 update pending for some time (the update is from 1'st of June 2021) and yesterday phone decided to install it without asking. After the update was installed and the phone rebooted I've noticed several issues:\n1. Time and Date are totally wrong. It is 24'th of June, 11.35 a.m but my phone shows that it is 2'nd of April, 9.22 p.m.\nVery restricted internet access. The phone acts as the internet connection is there, but the icon shows no internet access, and apps are booting up but are never able to sync with the servers. On the other hand, I was able to call for an Uber without any problems. Unfortunately, I'm also not able to \"Check for system updates\" so if there is any patch I'm not seeing it.\nMessaging apps (Android messages app and Signal) are showing chat history only until the moment of the update. All messages I've sent or received after the Android update are not displayed. The only option to read a message is to read it in the notification popup (as long the message is not too long).\n\nPlease HELP! I'm not even able to reliably set an alarm to wake me up in the morning -_- \n\nP.S. I've already rebooted my phone several times. Nothing changed.",
