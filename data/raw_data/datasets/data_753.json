    "content": "My wife's pixel 3 rear camera hasn't worked for 6 months. I contacted support and completed all the steps that have been suggested clearing cache, resetting the phone, installing a third party camera app and even trying android 12 beta (she upgraded to the 4a 5g) but I still get the error message \"something went wrong\". I believe this is a software issue and I wonder if this is just with one carrier or multiple. I have the Verizon one and i know someome that has the Verizon pixel 2 with the same issue.",
