    "content": "Hi so I bought the Pixel 4a and I came from a Samsung Galaxy J7 Neo, one of the features the previous phone had was that when I recorded a video with music playing in my headphones, the music would be included in the video. It made for good content and I miss it dearly, I am unable to do this in my Pixel phone so I wanted to know if there's a fix for this issue. \n\nThanks!",
