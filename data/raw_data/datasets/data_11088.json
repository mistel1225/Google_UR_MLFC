    "content": "Cast array of bugs on my new pixel 5.  It feels like I paid to be a beta tester.  Random reboots, music starts playing randomly. Android Auto broken (I often have to reboot the phone to make it establish a connection).\n\nI would seriously tell anyone to avoid a pixel in it's first 6 months of release.  It's the same every times.  My pixel 2,  pixel 3 and Nexus devices before that all had problems for many months after launch, and plenty of hardware problems to go along with them.\n\nDid Google test any of this stuff, or was the release date decided long before the products were completed.",
