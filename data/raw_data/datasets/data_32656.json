    "content": "Hello.\n\nI own a Pixel 3 since November last year. In December it suffered an accident and the screen cracked. Since I ordered the insurance, I paid the $49 fee and got the screen replaced in an authorized place. The phone worked fine so far, but some weird behavior started.\n\nThe first thing I noticed was the displacement of the wide-angle front camera. It was higher than the other one, causing the pictures to show a round black border. A few days later seemed like the whole inners of the phone got loose.\n\nBasically, if you shake it, you can feel that some stuff are completely loose inside it, and it can randomly turn off. Some of the phone features stopped working, as the compass, volume buttons and the \"squeeze\" for the assistant.\n\nA few minutes ago, the phone was in my pocket when I noticed it was off, this time there was no shaking that woke it up. My phone is dead.\n\nNow I'm not sure how to proceed. I don't think it is my fault the phone got \"unglued\". All the fixes done to the phone were done in the insurance place. Now, is it still under the warranty? Any clues on how should I proceed with it?\n\nThank you!",
