    "content": "I had facial retouching turned off on my phone but somehow it got turned back on and I had already taken a bunch of pictures (which look worse with retouching - why that's a default setting I will never know).  Is that a filter that can be removed after the fact?  For the life of me, I can't find anything in the phone/camera on that or in these forums.",
