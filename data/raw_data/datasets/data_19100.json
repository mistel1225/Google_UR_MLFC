    "content": "I am noticing my Pixel 4 heating up rapidly when I use the camera.  I have an application where I need to take a set of 100 or so photos in quick time (say 5 min) and I can see a temp rise of almost 10 deg C during this time.  I am noticing a similar situation after just a min or so of shooting video.  It's getting to the point of not being usable.  \n\nI would love to hear if anyone else has experienced similar issues or if there is a workaround.  \n\nThanks.",
