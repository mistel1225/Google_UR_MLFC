    "content": "About 5 times a week, at seemingly random yet important moments, my Pixel 4XL decides that it doesn't want to wake up. It will wake up for a second, to screw with me, then go black. No button, or shaking, or any other action will remedy the situation or otherwise wake the phone up.\n\nWhile this is sort of annoying on it's surface, it's such a bigger deal than a little frustration. I am a Google fan boy. I have over thirty nest/Google products in my house. My phone is the key to my car. It's how I pay for things. It controls every aspect of my home. It has become essential to every activity in my life. And this phone's performance is absolute shit.\n\nGoogle customer service casually suggested that I do a factory reset just to see if that might fix the problem. That rubs me as insincere and not understanding of the situation at all. While I'm happy to go through that hours long process, I'd prefer to know that it will actually fix the problem. So my question is, is the face ID or related wake up issue a known bug that a factory reset will fix? Or is the phone just shit and I should go get an iPhone?",
