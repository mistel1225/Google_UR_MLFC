    "content": "I am trying to reset phone. The instructions say after factory reset or erase all data which I have done, it then says scroll down and tap reset phone button. My phone does not scroll down, there is no reset phone button, there is nowhere to enter my pin to complete reset, that is my issue. I am trying to send my phone back to google for credit, It's an original pixel, that i just replaced with a pixel 5. Thank you",
