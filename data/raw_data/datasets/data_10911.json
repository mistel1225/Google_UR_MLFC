    "content": "I installed a widget app called Chronus and went to install a date/weather widget, but it didn't fit the home screen so slide over to another screen. I deleted the widget and widget app. Now the pixel launcher is adding the 1x4 quick access panel and google assistant panel to the bottom of each of my screens, including new ones. I can't find a way to fix this. I tried flushing pixel launcher cache and tried rebooting.",
