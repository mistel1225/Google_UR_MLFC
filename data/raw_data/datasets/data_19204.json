    "title": "How to get photos from Pixel phone onto Windows 10 computer",
    "content": "I have connected the phone to the computer and attempted to import using the photos application on the Windows computer.  I receive the message \"We can't find any photos or videos on your device. Add some and try again\". What is the cause of this? I have no problems importing photos from my Huawei phone but the camera is better in the Pixel so I would rather use it.\n\nI am surprised that I have to ask a question on a forum just to learn how to perform a simple task like transferring photos from a common phone. Another reason to hate Google.",
