    "content": "I have a Pixel 3a that is out of space.  Most is used by photos that are old and were on my Google account that were synced to the phone.  I have everything backup up but I want to:  a) move all the old photos off my phone. b) keep only the photos/videos I've taken with the phone on the phone c)  NOT to delete the old photos from my Google account d) my new photos, both current and future, taken with the phone to be downloaded to my Google account so I can access them from other devices.  I've seen ways to do some of these things but not all of them and I am very worried I will delete the old photos by accident when I remove them from the phone.",
