    "title": "Pixel 1 manual and auto focus aren't working",
    "content": "Ok so, for unrelated reasons, a few years ago I had my first pixel replaced with a refurbished version.\n\nThe refurbished phone had issues with focusing within a month of using it.\n\nBy that point, I was out of warranty to get it fixed. Google support staff had me try everything including clear my cache, reinstall the camera app, use safe mode, factory reset, etc. None of those steps worked.\n\n* Critical Point: A third party app called Open Camera allows you to manually control the camera focus. This is NOT automatic focus. It's manual. Manual focus on the third party app couldn't even adjust the focus. So the issue isn't the laser sensors. It's the camera itself.\n\nWhat I want is simple: an acknowledgment that this phone has a fundamental fault with its camera that isn't a software issue.\n\nFor years, you guys have refused to acknowledge that it's a hardware problem, and have consistently insisted the problem is from software.\n\nYou guys wouldn't stand by your product or acknowledge it was faulty, and tried to get me to pay for repairs on a phone that was broken out of the box.\n\nAll I know is that, until you acknowledge my complete disgust with the way you handled this, I'll never buy a pixel as long as I live.\n\nOh yeah, I've also shared my experiences with others and talked two people out of buying the Pixel 3.",
