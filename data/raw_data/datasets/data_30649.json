    "content": "I bought the pixel 3xl and have been using it for over a 2 months now. From the very beginning, I have experienced a buzzing sound while talking over the phone. Initially I thought it might go away as I use it but that didn't happen. The buzzing is only heard when I am on call. The speakers work fine when listening to any other content. The issue has been bothering me for a very long time and occasionally the phone heats up a lot too while talking on the phone.",
