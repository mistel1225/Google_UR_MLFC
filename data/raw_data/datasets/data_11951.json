    "content": "I woke up one day and my pixel's screen was not working. At first if I tapped on the screen some kind of color would flash but now nothing happens. Every horrible google troubleshoot article about screens not working tells you to use the screen to factory reset, but I can't use the screen?? And now random alarm clock tones are going off for times I did not even have registered. I've tried holding down the power button and volume button but clearly it's not doing anything. My phone is still under warranty so I can send it in, but they say to factory reset it before sending it in even though I can't cause the only way to factory reset it requires me to be able to use the screen! Is there any way to reset it by connecting it to my computer?",
