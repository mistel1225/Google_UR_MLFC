    "title": "Brand new Pixel 5 freezing for 3 - 10 seconds at a time",
    "content": "This Pixel 5 was purchased yesterday. During normal use, the phone will become completely or mostly unresponsive and freeze up for periods of 3 to 10 seconds at a time. An example of mostly unresponsive: I may be able to pull the top status bar down when the active screen has frozen, but I won't be able to interact with the top bar otherwise. \n\nThis seems to be happening regardless of which or how many apps are active, how long the phone has been on, etc. Restarts do not fix the issue. This issue can occur after a fresh restart when no apps are open. It just occurred as I was trying to write this sentence. \n\nAny ideas to fix this are appreciated. I have seen others posting about seemingly identical issues but was not able to find any official response.\n\nLet me know if I can provide further information.",
