    "title": "Original Pixel XL - Premature Shutdown - Battery Drain - Android 10",
    "content": "I have an original Pixel XL, since 2017.  Use daily for work.  After the Android 10, the battery life was cut in half.  At the most I am getting approximately 2 hours of active use.  The battery under Android 9 would run approximately 4 to 5 hours of heavy use.\n\nRecently, the phone started shutting down with between 20% and 30% of power still shown on the indicator.  After reading through the troubleshooting notes, I performed a hard reboot after I had charged the phone to 100%.  After the phone rebooted, the battery indicator showed 73% battery life.  I placed the phone on the charger and it charged another 25 min approx and reached 100 percent again.  Another hard reboot, and the phone still showed 100%.  If I use the phone under heavy use after the hard reboot, my battery life is closer to 4 hours again.  However, it seems there is an App or a setting under Android 10 that is affecting both the battery life and the accuracy of the battery indicator, because after some use, the phone will return to it's previous behavior and require another hard reboot.\n\nI have two Pixel XL phones and these issues only started after the upgrade to Android 10.  I also own a Nexus 6, still going strong and recently purchased a Pixel 4 XL.\n\nI am hoping that Google is paying attention to these posts and provides a fix for their original Pixel customers instead of leaving them hanging with a final update to Android 10 with inherent battery issues.  Their loyal Pixel / Nexus customers don't deserve this issue to be ignored.",
