    "content": "Simply make it so the album art isn't blurred like it now on the lock-screen. Super lame that it's blurred now and you can't even change it properly. Please revert this as it was one of my favorite Android features (coming from an ex iOS user...) I hope I'm not the only one bothered by this.",
