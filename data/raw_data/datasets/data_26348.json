    "content": "My phone no longer connects to my data plan\nI cannot screenshot as I used to be able to by holding down the power button and selecting screenshot - doesn't seem to be an updated way to screenshot\nApp interactivity issues\nApps do not seem to be interacting with each other\nI cannot see notifications if I am in an app\nMy contacts list is not syncing with my other apps\nI cannot easily switch between apps like I used to\nI have to restart my phone sometimes to close applications because the left arrow button does not work anymore\nI cannot swipe down on my phone to open up the notification bar\n\nThese are just some of the problems I have noticed.\n\nI now have to insert my sim card into my old iPhone and carry 2 phones around.  This is ridiculous.  And your help center needs to improve - there appears to be a lot of open forums regarding Android 10 problems, and no one to help.  Consider having a support desk like the Apple Genius Bar.\n\nAlso seriously consider regressing all updates to Android 9 while you debug Android 10.  How can people work and stay in touch like this?  Disappointed.\n\nUpset Customer.",
