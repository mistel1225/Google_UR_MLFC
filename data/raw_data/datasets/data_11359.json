    "title": "Pixel 4a out of stock since over 2 months now",
    "content": "I think the phone came to India over months back and had an inventory of ~25K to ~50K.\n\nHonestly would like to know when is the Pixel 4a stock coming back. Did Google not foresee that not launching the Pixel 4 in India would make Pixel users wait for the next phone? \n\nI don't think Google trusts themselves in the Indian market. The PMs and Ops heads are obviously sleeping. I'm very disappointed on this has turned out. \n\nP.S. What was the rationale of not launching the Pixel 5 in India? Was it to focus on 1 phone and make that sell? Well you've failed at that too.\n\nShame.",
