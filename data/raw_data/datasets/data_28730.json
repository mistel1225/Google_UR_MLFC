    "content": "I have switched to Google pixel 3xl & below are the issue I have being which i suggest should be upgraded by Google team.\n\n1) we have dual camera in front but face unlocking feature is missing\n\n2) we have option for Swipe fingerprint for notifications but it cant be used as scroll ( we get couple of apps for the same )\n\n3) we have best camera in device but selfie's can't be click with the help of fingerprint sensor or any button.\n\n4) we got great speaker on device but even on 60% of volume device vibrate\n\nHowever we can still use this feature by using third party software but that will take usage space on your device \nWhere as this all can be included by Google & we can save space for other things.",
