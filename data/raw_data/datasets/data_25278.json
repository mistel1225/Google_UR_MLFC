    "content": "Where is the option to turn off screenshot noises?\nI have set system notifications to silent and turned off my shutter sound in the camera app, for what that's worth.\nI do not want to turn off the notification altogether. I just want it silenced or at least quieter.\nThey are silent when I am in DND, so clearly I'm not in a country where this is illegal or something. It is both inconvenient and ridiculous to turn on DND every time I want to take a screenshot.",
