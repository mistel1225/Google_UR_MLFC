    "content": "Hi everyone. I managed to lock my phone by forgetting my unlock pattern on Pixel 4. I restored the device to factory settings and find last backup on my Google drive that I want to use to restore my phone. I had the same option during installation but it prompted me to enter pattern that I forgot at the first place. \n\nIs there any way to get my old apps and all the communication back?\n Thanks for your help",
