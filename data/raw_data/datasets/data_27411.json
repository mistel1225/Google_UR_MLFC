    "content": "When there's an incoming call, the screen wakes up, as suppose to be. I turn the screen off to mute and ignore the call. But the screen switches up again. And untill the call is dismissed, every time i turn off the screen it wakes up.\nCan't find the option for this in the settings... Is this a problem?",
