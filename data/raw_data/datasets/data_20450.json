    "content": "So this is an interesting problem I'm encountering. My volume is pretty low so I doubt my issue is because of volume. However whenever I play games that have music or sfx with low base or high pitch the speakers crack. Sometimes it's the bottom others it's the top. Phone is brand new...this concerns me about the life of the phone. Help please!",
