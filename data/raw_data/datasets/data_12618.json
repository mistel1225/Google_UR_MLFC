    "content": "Wi-fi roaming is not working on my new Pixel 4a. \n\nMy wi-fi set-up at home consists of two access points - one upstairs, one downstairs, both operating on the same SSID.\n\nWhen upstairs, every device in my house apart from my Pixel 4a switches automatically to the nearest access point - this is the case on my LG G7 (Android 10), an iPhone 6, and three Windows 10 laptops.\n\nCurrently the only way to force the 4a to switch is by restarting the phone when upstairs - but even then it doesn't always lock on to the strongest signal. Not ideal for a brand new phone...",
