    "content": "I received an email from Google today that looks legit asking me for system logs.\n\nI did not contact support about this issue, but I have commented on the problem in these forums, and I am experiencing the issue as described in the bottom of the message from support.\n\nI can see that the message is 3 parts cut and pasted together.\nTop part is hello I understand your issue.\nMiddle part is how to create and attach log.\nBottom part explains how the feature is supposed to work...\n\nThe problem is that the top part explains a different problem that I don't have on a P5 which I do not own.\n\nI replied back explaining this and the rep said sorry top but was a typo, which is understandable due to cut and paste...\n\nStill seems slightly fishy to me, and I am wondering if one of you could look up the case ID number and/or confirm the email address that I was given to see if this is legit or not as I would love to help.\n\nThanks\nScott",
