    "content": "My headphones recently started acting up. I can't skip a song or control the volume anymore. And every time I plug them into my phone, the volume goes all the way up on its own, or it mutes itself. It also makes it so my phone can't turn off when pressing the off button, so I have to wait until the screen turns off.",
