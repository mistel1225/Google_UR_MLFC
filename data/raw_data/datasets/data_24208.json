    "content": "My 6 month old Pixel 3 gave u the ghost yesterday...refused to recognise my SIM and wifi won't turn on just out the blue. Spoke to Google & they came to the conclusion the device needs to be replaced..ok fair enough.\n\nHowever 3 days later and after numerous calls to the support centre, they are still not able to place an order for a replacement as they are having \"issues\" on their side. They can't tell me what issue is, just that they are of course looking at it but no timeline of when I can get a replacement. So until then I am offline!\n\nHas anyone else had issues like this trying to get a replacement? It's pretty poor from Google...this is my first Google phone and possibly my last if this is how they treat customers! Attached is their recent \"helpful email\".",
