    "content": "I've tried charging it with no results. It was at 78% the last time I used it this morning. When I tried to use it again it wouldn't turn on. When I first tried to use it this morning there was a black screen with something about it being compromised  and it had a green line that said try again so I tapped it and that's when the screen turned on but it was super slow. I tried to restart it but the screen just stayed black. I couldn't even tell if it was on. I kept trying g to turn it on and it wouldn't,  that's when I charged it but it still wouldn't turn on",
