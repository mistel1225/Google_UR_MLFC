    "content": "Purchased my very first Pixel a few days ago. The Android 11 system was taking about 5GB memory until about an hour ago.\nThis evening I decided to erase the 8GB worth of photos from the phone storage since they were already backed in the cloud. As soon as I did that the Android 11 System went up to occupy 12GB of space. Upon doing a full factory reset the system jumped to 14GB. What is going on over here? This is very very strange and makes no sense. Pretty much by following what Google recommended (making space on the device by erasing photos that are already backed up in the cloud) all that \"gained space\" is now taken by the system.",
