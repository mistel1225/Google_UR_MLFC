    "title": "DND not only suppresses ringing it also makes it impossible to answer phone.",
    "content": "When I have DND on it's impossible to answer the phone - meaning I can not see a way to do it.  If DND is on then of course I do not want the phone to ring.  But I can't even see that someone is calling me.  In fact I only know that there is a call because my Chrome browser tells me.  (That might happen because I use Project Fi)  So today I was in a Zoom mtg so of course I turned on DND.  But then I couldn't answer an important call that I would like to have taken.  Since DND is under \"Sound\" it doesn't seem logical to me that I don't even see that someone is calling me.  I'd sure like to see this fixed.",
