    "title": "Pixel XL Stuck On Logo Screen/Crashing/Not Recognizing Touch to Unlock",
    "content": "I have a Google Pixel 3 XL that stopped working suddenly. It was stuck on the Google logo screen with a white background for a while, but now it'll sometimes load to my lock screen. However, when it does get to that point, the phone isn't recognizing touch and won't let me unlock my phone. It's also booting with a green-ish tint. After a few seconds or a couple minutes, however, it usually crashes/completely turns off. When it does manage to stay on the lock screen, my bluetooth earbuds can connect to it and I can play music by using my earbuds' touch functions, so am hoping there's some way to save it?? What can I do to save my phone/the data? All help is appreciated!",
