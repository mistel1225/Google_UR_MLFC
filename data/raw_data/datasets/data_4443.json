    "content": "Since Tuesday morning no app on my phone will open. I had to uninstall and reinstall Halifax and sky news to get them to work. I have cleared cashe, restarted, turned off and left for 10 mins but the same issue. None of the apps will open or stay open. I have one called storeware which opens the front page but then closes.",
