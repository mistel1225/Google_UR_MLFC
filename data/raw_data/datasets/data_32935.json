    "content": "Tried connecting to my pc after a patch on Android 9. You hear the \"dong\" and it charges OK.\nHowever the ability to select what you want to do with the connection has gone.\nThe USB ports on the PC work with other usb hardrives.\nChanging cables that previously worked have no impact.\nRebooted both PC and phone have no impact.\n\nNever had problems before except since patch  dated 5 March 2019",
