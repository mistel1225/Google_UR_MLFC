    "content": "Hello guys!\n\nlately I have noticed that I am not getting notifications on the phone in the real-time when it supposed to come. Etc whatsapp messages, Snapchat notifications, Instagram, Emails... You name it.\n\nWhat I have realized is that I can see that the Wi-Fi connection gets a \"Limitation use\" or loses the connection but then reconnects again but whenever that happens then I will stop continue getting any notification and I need to turn off and on pretty often. \n\nWhat is working is that everytime I turn on to 4G instantly I am getting all missed notifications. \n\nI have asked around in my house and nobody has that issue and I do realize it is only on my side and what I have tried to do is:\n\n- I have bought new Router just incase (Still same issue)\n- I used same SSID for 2.4 and 5GZ (Still same issue)\n- I have seperated 2.4 and 5 (still same issue for each band)\n- Rebooted multiply time, even shutdown during the night (Still same issue)\n- Tried through Safemode (Still same issue)\n\nAnd I believe thats about it.\n\nI am using Google Pixel 2 XL and I am using Android beta 5 (This did happend before Beta aswell) and this have been working fine until 2 weeks so I am sure it is nothing related to Beta I believe since I have tried to search around for those problems in beta and nobody seems to have that issue. \n\nI would appreciate all kind of help!",
