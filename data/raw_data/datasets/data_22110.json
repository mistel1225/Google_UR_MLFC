    "content": "Three-way - conference calling is screwed up on my Pixel 2xl.  Worked fine with att for 1+ Year, now switched to Verizon and I've no consistent performance.  Hang up on callers when trying to merge and often routes me to my own voicemail on occasions.  Sometimes it works fine.  Any suggestions are welcomed!  I need 10-20 three calls to do business and no one seems to have an answer.",
