    "content": "I got my phone in June, in broke in August and was replaced by EE. Then my charger broke, EE said that I need to go to the manufacturer, so now I am stuck trying to get Google to just send me a new charger. As you'll know there customer service is appalling. They sent me a link to this to escalate, with no direction how to. I'm now thinking it's all just a mickey take! Help.",
