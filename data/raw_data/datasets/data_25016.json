    "content": "I have an Admin user (i.e. 'Owner') account on this phone as well another another user (we will call 'User 2') and the Guest account. Currently anyone can create another user while on the lock screen and not logged into the Admin account.\n\nHowever after my phone has been rebooted, no one is able to log in to the Guest account, any of the other user accounts, or able to create a new user. They are all blacked out until the Admin account has been logged into.\n\nIs there a way to get around this? Or must the Admin account be logged into EVERYTIME a user wants to restart the device?",
