    "title": "[Pixel 4xl] Volume randomly increases to max when connected to bluetooth device",
    "content": "This has happened a handful of times since I got my phone 1 month ago. It only happens when it is connected to a bluetooth device like headphones or a speaker. I'll explain what just happened a few minutes ago. I was listening to music through a BT speaker (let's say at volume 5/10), then I paused the music to make a call. After the call, I started the music again which was playing at the same volume, but when I unlocked my phone, it automatically jumped to max volume and when I tried to decrease the volume the side buttons on my phone, the volume did not decrease. I had to use the volume slider on the screen to decrease the volume.\n\nI saw a post about someone's pixel 3 having a similar issue, but I couldn't find any resolution to this problem.",
