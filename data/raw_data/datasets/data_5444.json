    "content": "Cleared storage and cache in Playstore\nChecked that there are no downloads pending\nConfirmed that there is the latest version of Playstore\nRestarted several times\nTried to download different apps and noticed that it works fine with some of them. However, it crashes when trying to download Instagram, Facebook etc. The size shouldn't be a problem as I tried to download big games and that worked.",
