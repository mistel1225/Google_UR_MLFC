    "content": "There is issue in connecting to my home wifi network. It works fine until I switch to mobile data and back to wifi.\n\nAfter I switch to mobile data, and when I try to connect to wifi, the wifi name is not visible at all.\n\nIt has been going on for few days now. Restarting the phone works. But it is not a viable solution, as I have been doing multiple times every day",
