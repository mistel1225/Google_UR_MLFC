    "content": "In this past two weeks, my Pixel 4 has shutdown due to low battery after instantly draining with minimal usage. Once time, it was sitting on a table and another time I was holding it. When I was able to see it happen, the battery percentage indicator in the notification area descended rapidly to 0 before shutdown. I had to connect a charge to power back on and take the screenshot below. The phone \"charged\" more rapidly that is typical from this \"drained\" state.",
