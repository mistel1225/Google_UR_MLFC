    "title": "Pixel Call Screen keeps letting through spam calls, and at full volume",
    "content": "I use Call Screen on my Pixel in the hopes of blocking Spam calls from ringing through.  It catches most of them, but sometimes, and increasingly more often, it will intercept the most obvious of spam calls- a clearly computer generated voice saying my car warranty has expired, or my social security number is on fire, or whatever they say, and allow it to ring through to my phone.  To make things worse, whenever this happens, the ringtone plays not at whatever volume to which it's currently set, but full, sure to wake up everyone in the house, maximum volume.  I've searched all over and can't find a setting to change this.  What's the point of call screen if it's going to allow the most obvious of spam calls to get through, and why does it have to be at maximum volume?  All it accomplishes is maximum annoyance.",
