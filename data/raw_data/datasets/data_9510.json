    "content": "This is a random problem. On my Pixel 3 and on my wife's Pixel 3 XL it sometimes continues to ring while on a call. It has happened both in making the call and receiving the call. I believe it started after the last update. Anyone else experiencing this? If it is a bug, is Google working on it?",
