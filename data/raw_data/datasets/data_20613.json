    "title": "Unlock with fingerprint is gone after Android 10 update -- please help!!",
    "content": "I updated to Android 10 yesterday and the ability to unlock my pixel 2 with fingerprint ID is gone.  I deleted the 4 existing fingerprints and input them again.  The fingerprint sensor itself is certainly working, but using it to unlock the phone is not working any longer.  When I did the new inputs, the small vibration was there and the new fingerprints went in fine.  When I try to unlock, there's nothing. What a pain! Why is this happening after OS updates?  Why would Google not check this when sending out an update when they know it's been an issue with earlier updates and patches?  ARG!\nReply",
