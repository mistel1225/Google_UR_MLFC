    "title": "MULTIPLE messages + Battery drain!",
    "content": "SO frustrated with this phone!!! Switched from iPhone end of December, and wish I never did! Everyone receives texts from me NUMEROUS times. And sometimes even hours after. I've had picture messages send 7 times or more!! It's insane! It's so embarrassing...and annoying to the recipient!! Or, I just won't even receive an image. Including from my boyfriend in the same house! Also, battery decided after FIVE months to just take a crap. I have my phone on the charger at least 3 times a day, and I am hardly ever on my phone except to take pictures and text!",
