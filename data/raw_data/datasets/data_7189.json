    "content": "I've noticed the display on my Pixel 5 flickers slightly as the display refresh rate adjusts from 60hz to 90hz and vice versa. Turning smooth display off prevents the issue, as does forcing 90hz in developer options. It is more noticeable with dark mode activated. I'm assuming this is a similar issue that Android 11 created on the Pixel 4.",
