    "content": "Hi there,\n\n1. My Pixel 3 started in a reboot loop.\n2. I contacted Google Support\n3. I was able to Factory Data Reset the device.\n4. The reboot loop continued --> therefore, it's a hardware issue (link: https://imgur.com/vsdq90m)\n5. Since my phone is out of warranty, tech support directed me to UBreakIFix (3rd party tech support partner)\n6. I brought my Pixel 3 to UBreakIFix\n7. Technician at UBreakIFix conducted a diagnostics test, thought it might be the battery, replaced battery, reboot loop problem persisted.\n8. UBreakIFix official diagnosis was a Motherboard issue\n9. Went back to Google Support, was told there's nothing they can do. \n\nMy phone is only 18 months old. I've done *everything* in my power to fix this device but it's a hardware issue that cannot be fixed. Google's own 3rd party repair provider said as much. \n\nSo what am I supposed to do at this point?",
