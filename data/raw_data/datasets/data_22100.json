    "content": "My google pixel 2xl worked without any issues, evrrything was great but suddenly it started shutting off by itself. Also, when plugged in to charger it doesn,t shut off but when it's not plugged in it does it all the time. Sometimes once every 30 minutes and sometimes every 5 minutes. I really don,t understand what's wrong with it because it worked perfectly a few days ago. I think problem might be with the battery because sometimes it charges strangely fast and sometimes it becomes low real fast. So please if anyone could help me to resolve it myself",
