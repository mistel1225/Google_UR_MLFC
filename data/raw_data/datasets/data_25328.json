    "content": "My screen will randomly not turn on.\n\nWhen I double click the power button, it vibrates like the camera is being turned on - but all i get is a black screen \nWhen I tap the power button, it vibrates like it is waking the screen - but all i get is a black screen \nWhen I use my fingerprint, it vibrates like it has just unlocked my phone - but all i get is a black screen \n\n\nI just did a factory reset - again, the depressing the power button for a few seconds - like turning on a new phone - results in a vibration of just having awoken the phone - but all i get is a black screen... 3 hrs later the screen finally tured on. \n\nAfter getting my phone set-back up - I switched my phone screen to \"always on\".... let's see if this fixes the problem.\n\nHas anyone else had this issue? What is the real fix?",
