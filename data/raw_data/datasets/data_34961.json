    "title": "Same Question as Jerry Waller from 11/11/18. Phone sluggish to wake from lock screen.",
    "content": "I have a Google pixel 3XL. It has recently within the last 224 days stopped waking up from the lock screen. I try double tap, I try fingerprint, I tried pressing the power button and the phone will not immediately wake up. It does eventually wake up but takes minutes sometimes.\nI tried a factory reset twice now as well as not installing apps oh, or uninstalling apps I do have. The phone is only about a month old.\nI've seen some listings on Reddit that appear similar oh, but not quite the same. My specific issue occurs when the screen either turns off or I press the power button to get to the lock screen oh, and then try to wake it.",
