    "content": "I have a WiFi connectable camera which i can see and connect too, but because it has no active internet connection my phone wont stay connected to it. With my previous phone there was an option called \"Auto switch to mobile data\" which would allow me to stay connected to the WiFi network but keep my mobile data on instead and that way i could still have an active internet connection whilst being connected to the camera.\nI don't see that option in the Wi-Fi preferences where i use to have it in my previous phone and i have also used the option Mobile data always active within the developers option but that doesn't see to work either.\nIs there a way to keep the WiFi connection and also keep my mobile data active?\nThanks",
