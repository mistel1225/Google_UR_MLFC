    "content": "Hi. I had to sell my Pixel 5 due to not working VoWiFi in Poland. \n\nI know - altough i don't understand why - Pixels are too \"exclusive\" to reach certain markets. In central and eastern Europe there are lots of customers who would really love to have a top camera clean android phone for a price lower than Apple or Samsung has. In my opinion Pixels would sell better in developing countries rather than in countries dominated by Apple or Samsung. I think that Google's policy when it comes to phones is not prioritized to sell phones and make profit.\n\nAnyway, is there a chance that modern or future Pixels will get a support for 5G / VoWiFi / VoLTE for network operators outside Germany, France and UK? I can import the Pixel from Germany on my own, but it's useless for me as long as it doesnt at least have working Wi-Fi calling and I can't make it work on my own. \n\nAnd there's one thing. Why does Google treat us as some kind of \"worse\" market than other and doesn't provide its products here? I think that equality is a fancy thing now.",
