    "content": "I've tried to copy data from an older Android phone to my new Pixel 4a. Only a fraction of the apps copy over, and I downloaded all of them from the Play store. I am using a cable to transfer and only the apps that are published by Google are copying over. Others such as Instagram, NYT news, etc are left behind. This seems like a lot of work to manually retrieve all these apps again. Is this expected?",
