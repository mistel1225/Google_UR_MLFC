    "content": "I had issues with my pixel phone headphone jack so I used my warranty. I was sent a refurnished phone and sent my defect phone back. Per the Fedex tracking number it was delivered on 19October to the google warehouse. \nI was charged for the phone ($961) on 22October. I opened a case right away and now it's day 5 without a refund. \nI've spent hours on the phone and have embarrassingly broken down in tears not getting my money back. I have bills due and need to buy groceries....\nI need help from anyone who can lend a hand. Is this a scam? I thought google was a reputable company?",
