    "content": "I setup a phone as my son's account.  He is a member of our family link.  However my situation is that my Son's account is the phone admin.  I understand you can't change that without factory resetting.  So I went to factory reset with his account but the option is disabled and if I try I receive a message \"Action not allowed.  If you have questions, contact your IT admin\"  How do I factory reset this phone?  Pixel 1 Android 10",
