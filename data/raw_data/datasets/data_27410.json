    "content": "I just update my google pixel 1st gen to Android 10 Beta Patch 3, and i have some issue. Screenshot that I just took 1 minute ago won't appear as the most recent photo and won't appear at the top but at the bottom for some reason. and also if I screenshot something, the screenshot photos will not appear on Instagram's gallery so I can't upload it on my instagram. this is really uncomfortable for me, please let me know as soon as possible. Thank you",
