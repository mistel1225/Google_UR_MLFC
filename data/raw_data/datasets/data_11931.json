    "title": "Pixel 4XL disconnect from WiFi after Android 11 update.",
    "content": "Just like many others I have encountered an issue after Android 11 update where my phone loses internet connection while still technically being connected to my WiFi. I have tried factory reset, network setting reset, use device MAC, changing WiFi channels, 5GHz and 2.4GHz, etc., basically any network changes I can think of. My wife's Pixel 4XL hasn't been updated and she has no problem staying on our WiFi.  If anybody has any idea what else I can try to fix this issue I would really appreciate it. In the meantime, Google needs to identify the root cause immediately and stop pretending this problem doesn't exist or this is the last Google device I will ever buy. And stop killing a downgrade path for your customers, if there is a critical OS update issue, give people an option to downgrade until you can release an update that resolves it.",
