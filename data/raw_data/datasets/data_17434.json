    "title": "Constant Aw Snap error in Chrome only in Google domain on Pixel 2 XL",
    "content": "While using Chrome, I encounter constant Aw Snap errors and loading delays, but only within the Google domain.\n\nThis impacts any Google.com site, as well as any AMP page accessed via Google search.\nWhen I search with Google via chrome, the results page will load as expected. Then about 10 seconds later, the results page will crash with an Aw Snap error.  Subsequent searches have a long delay before loading the results, and frequently crash before loading.\n\nIf I use Firefox, all Google pages and searches load instantly and without issue.\n\nSites outside Google are not impacted.  If I click through to a direct link from a Google AMP page, it will not crash.\n\nI have tried all steps as detailed here, with no improvement.\nhttps://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95669\n\nI am running Android 10",
