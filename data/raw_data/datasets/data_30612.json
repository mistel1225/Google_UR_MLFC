    "content": "Hey Internet and Users on the forum.\n\nI've been using my pixel for the past 6month or so.\n\nThis afternoon, the screen suddenly went black without any sign. \n\nIt is still responsive though, as I can still feel the rumble when I put my finger on the fingerprint reader.\n\nIt can also be connected to my PC and recognizable.\n\nI have no Idea why this is happening. \n\nI am able to turn it off manually by pressing the home button long enough but still no Google logo.\n\n\nPlease help me out, guys. It's my second google phone failing and can't buy another one.",
