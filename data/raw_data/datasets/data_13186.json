    "content": "I am using Google pixel 4.  Today I downloaded an xapk file and thought it could be installed by changing the extension to apk. The result is still unable to install after modification. Later, I downloaded the xapk installer, and changed back to xapk. There were warnings that I didn't pay attention to it. After the modification is completed, the file disappears from the download folder. It can only be found by searching, and cannot be deleted or renamed. When moved to a safe folder, it will show that the file cannot be found. When viewing file information, the display path is still in the download folder. So how can I delete itï¼Ÿ",
