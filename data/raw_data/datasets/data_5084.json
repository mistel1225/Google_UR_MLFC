    "content": "I bought Pixel 4a in Jan 2021. I used it with protective case for 2 months(protective case also touches the screen corners). From Feb security update, the touchscreen started showing problems on lower half of screen, the gesture navigations stopped working. Then based on feedback from different users, I downgraded to Android 10, but the issue persisted.\nFinally I sent the device to Google Support and they fixed the touch screen. Apparently the touch screen was not working and hence they replaced it.\nI am using this protective case - \nhttps://www.flipkart.com/caseology-back-cover-google-pixel-4a/p/itmc1d1e9049d87d?pid=ACCFZ9C6G2CYAQ7J&lid=LSTACCFZ9C6G2CYAQ7JPGEXYZ&marketplace=FLIPKART&q=pixel+4a+case&store=tyy%2F4mr%2Fq2u&srno=s_1_2&otracker=search&otracker1=search&fm=SEARCH&iid=ce95f3f0-77b6-422e-99cf-77fc9960d5bc.ACCFZ9C6G2CYAQ7J.SEARCH&ppt=hp&ppn=homepage&ssid=bhaxvrmo1s0000001616044265816&qH=79fab02a48eb0daa\n\nNow I am in dilemma if I should use the protective case or not and would it create touch screen issues again? \nAre you using screen protector with Pixel 4a? If yes, did it create any issue with touchscreen for your phone?",
