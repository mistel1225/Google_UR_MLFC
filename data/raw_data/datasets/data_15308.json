    "content": "I have rebooted in safe mode to no avail.  The Google charger is plugged in. The \"plug\" image will come on and flash green briefly.  Then the \"battery\" image will appear with the lightening bolt.  The next \"charging battery\" image will appear but no animation for \"charging\" will happen.  If the power button is held on, the \"google powered by android\" screen will appear but will go back to black before the GUI.  No matter how long the charger is plugged in, there is no change to this process.  I have updated to Android 11 on the Pixel 2.",
