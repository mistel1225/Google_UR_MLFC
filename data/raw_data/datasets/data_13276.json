    "content": "I recently got a mint condition Pixel XL (First Generation). I noticed that the phone stops backing up / uploading photos to Google Photos when the phone goes to standby / sleep mode. I was hoping it would back up all photos when I check it after a few house but it always stops.\n\nBy the way, I also updated to Android 10 and that didn't help. It actually made the battery life worse so I might revert it back to 7.1 or some other version of android,\n\nFirst time Pixel owner so any help to streamline this would be a great help. Thank you in advance. Keep safe everyone.",
