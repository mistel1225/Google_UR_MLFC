    "content": "Hey all, I have a brand new Pixel 3 and out of the box I have updated it to Android 10, November update.\n\nFor some reason, I am unable to get these features to work,\n\n- Active Edge, for Assistant and Silent phone...Made sure battery save is off, turned it off and on, changed to lowest sensitivity, but still not working.\n\n- Double tap to wake only works when there is a new notification, but when the screen is off, it doesn't wake.\n\n- Lift to wake is totally not working at all. Sensors seems fine when I was looking at Gyro and Gravity sensors using the Sensor Multitool app.\n\nAny ideas if this is a software problem or I would need to rma the phone?\n\nThanks,\nWarm regards,\nJohn",
