    "title": "Pixel 3a XL Fingerprint Hardware not available",
    "content": "Hello dear all, \n\nMy Pixel 3a XL about 2 weeks ago started to present issues with the fingerprint unlocking stating fingerprint hardware not available. Restarted the phone twice and the issue seemed to have gone for a few days and everything working again. \nIn the last few days, situation reappeared and now the restarts won't solve anything. \nIn addition, under security settings the fingerprint functionality is no longer present.\n\nCan someone advise or at least have some ideas over the problem?\n\nThanks\n\nMÃ¡rio",
