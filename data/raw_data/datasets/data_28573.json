    "title": "Pixel wifi constantly drops and battery life much reduced",
    "content": "My Pixel is suffering from two serious issues that pretty much make it unusable.\n\nPlease note: I've tested this using different wi fi routers and have reset the Phone twice and updated it to the latest update. I haven't installed any apps (beyond the ones that come with it).\n\nWifi -  Unless I'm less than 2 - 3 meters away from a router the connection will drop after a few seconds.\n\nBattery - It drains very quickly. A full charge will last 3 for 4 hours on standby. And it charges slowly.\n\nOther than that, the phone operates well. And it's quick as I haven't installed any apps.\n\nIs this just because the phone is old or a hardware or software issue?\n\nIs there an app that can diagnose the problem?\n\nCheers,\n\nLawrence",
