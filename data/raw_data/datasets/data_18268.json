    "content": "I have had a recent issue where my Pixel 3 refuses to connect to any internet connection after it runs out of battery or after I turn it off manually. After the phone is turned off and back on, any wi-fi the phone previously recognized has \"limited connectivity\" (which basically means that there is none), and if I try to use my LTE network, it claims to be connected, but will not run any internet based services. The only solution I have found to this problem is factory resetting my phone. I have had to factory reset my phone three times in the past five days, and the problem is becoming a nuisance. Any help is extremely appreciated.",
