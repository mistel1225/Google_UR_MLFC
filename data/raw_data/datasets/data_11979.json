    "content": "Every time I start new audio (play/pause button and skip button) my screen turns black before displaying the lock screen. I have experienced it on Spotify, Youtube Music, and Google Books (for audiobooks). My lock screen media controls still work but as long as I am playing, pausing, or skipping my screen locks up.",
