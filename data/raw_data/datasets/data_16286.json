    "content": "I have 1st gen Pixel. Recently got Bluetooth ear buds. Last couple days, I will be watching something on YouTube, listening thru my bluetooth connected ear buds, then I get a phone call and the call will not come thru to the ear buds. Bluetooth connectivity will still be activated, ear buds on, settings all set up for phone calls to connect to them, but the phone will not switch the call over to bluetooth. So I have the ear buds in, but I have to hold the phone up to my ear to take the call. Then, just today, after just such an occurence, said phone call was over, I went back to YouTube and the videos would not play. Tried switching videos, shutting app, restarting phone, uninstalled TikTok, restarted phone again, disconnected and reconnected bluetooth, restarted phone again.... still, no video playback on YouTube and I still dont know whats up with the phone calls not connecting to the ear buds. Is it time for a new phone? Any suggestions (other than getting a new phone)?",
