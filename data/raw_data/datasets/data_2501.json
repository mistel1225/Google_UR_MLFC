    "content": "I bought a Google Pixel 4 on Amazon, and it was supposed to come SIM-unlocked. It did not. There is seemingly no way to tell which carrier it is locked to, and my provider (Boost) says they cannot unlock a phone. Is there any way to unlock it myself, or is my only option to return it and get a new one?\n\nI have tried Boost's customer service line, and I was told that my SIM ICCID is not compatible with the device. But their website says this model *is* compatible.",
