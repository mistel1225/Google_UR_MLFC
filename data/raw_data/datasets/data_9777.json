    "content": "Yesterday i was able to make calls, recieve messges and all was fine. Now i get this \"No SIM card\" message. The phone recognizes the card and i have to eneter the PIN code. It even knows which carrier its is from (Orange), but i am unable to make calls, send messages or use data. I tried reseating the SIM, clearing network settings, using safe mode, even factory reset...nothing works. The sim works fine in my old phone.",
