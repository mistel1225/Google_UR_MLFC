    "content": "Hey guys,\n\nI'm having an issue where randomly my phone will freeze and I will have to hold down the power button for 10 seconds for it to reboot.\n\nThis started happening straight after I charged using a new charger cable and socket (not sure if this is at all relevant)\n\nI have also tried using my phone whilst in safe boot mode which then gave me the same issue.\nI have done a factory reset also.\nIf I reboot my phone I am able to use it with no obvious issues until it freezes on me again. \n\nAny ideas?",
