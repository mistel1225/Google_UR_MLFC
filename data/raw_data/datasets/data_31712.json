    "content": "Ok so I've had 2 pixels and 2 Google accounts and I'm not sure why/how but it appears like some of my photos are backed up to one and some to the other. I want to get rid of one of the accounts but make sure everything is on the other one. when I look in my photos and switch accounts, account1 has photos going back 2 years more than account2, but when I remove account2 from the phone half of the photos disappear.",
