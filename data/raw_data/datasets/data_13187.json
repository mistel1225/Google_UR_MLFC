    "content": "Flipkart have mentioned that google pixel will be back on sale at today 12:00pm. I tried to buy   it sharp at 12:00pm and it’s still not deliverable my location. This is really worst experience I came through so far of google & Flipkart. why can’t you guys directly sell your products by retailers or direct to customers through your website. Really disappointed.",
