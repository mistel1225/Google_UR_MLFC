    "content": "I recently bought a second hand 32gb google pixel about 2 weeks ago, is a really nice phone but now ive noticed that the mic, earpice and headphone jack does not work. Have tried rebooting into safe mode, will work for a few minute then all three will stop again. I also tried factory reseting but still no luck. I have tried contacting Google but as I live in New Zealand I don't think any google support is provided here. The person I bought it off is also no help. I have also noticed that after restarts while it works for a little bit, the phone tends to get really hot, when it stops working it becomes normal. \nCan anyone help with this?\nThanks Zacky",
