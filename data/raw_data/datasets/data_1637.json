    "title": "Not getting sports updates in Google Discover feed",
    "content": "I follow a couple of football teams and if there is a live match I get notifications of the live score. However I don't get any sport updates in my Google Discover feed. However on a different Google account I get both the notifications and the sport updates in Discover. These updates include upcoming games, league tables, current live score and post match news and videos. I'm really not sure why on my main Google account I don't get these updates in my Discover feed as I have no hidden interests. Has anyone else experience this issue or have any idea how to get these updates to appear in my feed again?",
