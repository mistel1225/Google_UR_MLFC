    "title": "As soon as my phone connects to a Bluetooth device, it calls itself",
    "content": "When my phone connects to a Bluetooth device (my car and wireless headphones) it registers that it is on a call and thus will prevent any other media (so the radio won't come on in my car, and I can't listen to music or video via my headphones). I have to \"hang up\" via the Bluetooth device before I can continue normal operation. So if I look at my phone, it doesn't register that I am on a call, but if I want to listen to the radio, I have to press the hang up button in my car before it comes on. I have tried restarting all devices as well as resetting everything.",
