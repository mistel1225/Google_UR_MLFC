    "title": "Pixel3 Unresponsive to power button and fingerprint reading",
    "content": "My phone does not turn on when I press the power button or place my fingerprint on the reader. I have tried setting off google assistant by squeezing the sides, speaking to it but the screen remains black. I really do not want to do a factory reset so I have tried restarting my phone every time this happens. It used to rarely happen but is now happening almost everyday.",
