    "content": "It is easy enough to take a picture with a playmoji in it but not so easy to take a video.  When I select More > Playground, the shutter is switched to picture mode so there is no video button.  It is possible to get a video by holding down the shutter button.  But holding the button down for a minute or two is not very convenient.\nIs there any kind of way around this or even a fix coming?",
