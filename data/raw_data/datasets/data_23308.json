    "title": "Why my pixel 3xl having issue when playing dark scene video, looks like broken pixel",
    "content": "Is it normal for dark scenes to looks bad on the Pixel 3 XL's AMOLED screen?\nGreetings,\n \nLooking to find out if the following is normal of all screens or if it is a specific defect on my unit:\n \n-Watching the intro to the movie Arrival, the camera is I think panning along the ceiling and it starts off dark (pitch black); the transition on my screen looks terrible; even though I am supposed to be seeing a uniform black (at least initially I think) I see like large patches of distinct grades of black on the screen that move all over the place. Sorry, I don't know what to call them (patches, smudges, like large pixelated pacmans?). I didn't even know what I was looking at until those annoying things went away when there was finally light in the scene.\n \n-Watching a YouTube video, where there was a plain black background, no camera moving, just a background, and there were bullet points being placed onto the background as they were being explained, the annoying moving pixelated pacmans are jumping all over the place.\n \n-So basically I now realize that the patches are present anytime there is black.\n \nIf it is a natural thing, could someone tell me the name of what is happening so I can further read about it. Thank you greatly!!",
