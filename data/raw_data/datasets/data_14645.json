    "content": "Since Android 11, media controls have changed location inconsistently. Before, all media controls appeared at the top of the notification tray. Now controls for some media (Spotify, Chrome) appear in quick settings, and others (Podcast Addict, GoneMAD) appear at the very bottom of notifications, below conversations.\n\nShould this be happening? How can I get all media controls to appear in the quick settings?\n\nI've attached screenshots to demonstrate what I'm seeing.",
