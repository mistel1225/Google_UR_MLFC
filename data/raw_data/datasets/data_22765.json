    "content": "My Pixel 3 will have LTE then suddenly go to 3G then just no mobile data connection at all sometimes for a minute or two. Then comes back to either LTE or 3G. I have sent the first phone back with the same issue and even my replacement phone is still having the same issue. I have reset the network settings and even have a new sim card I know it is not that. All my apps I have used on other phones in the past with no issue. My husband's phone a Galaxy J7 has no connection issue. So I know it is the phone. I am regretting getting the Pixel 3 now. Maybe should have gone with a iPhone or Galaxy. Any other suggestions to help stop the connection issue? Or are we all stuck with it until Google fixes it?",
