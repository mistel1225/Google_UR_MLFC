    "content": "Shipped my phone in for a repair...FedEx tracking indicates it was received by Google on 9/25. The repair page still says \"waiting to receive device.\" \nI have contacted support several times and they keep saying that they're having a specialist look into it, but nothing has changed. \nHow do I get a refund or replacement for what is clearly a lost phone?",
