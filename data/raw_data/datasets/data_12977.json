    "content": "I was adjusting the battery optimisation settings for a few apps. When listing/showing \"all apps\", I noticed a few strange apps.\nSome of them: Kai, Sam, Victor - all of them had multiple entries/listing. On app details for these apps you can \"force stop\" them, but not disable or uninstall.\n\nAnyone else experiencing the same? Any ideas what these apps are for?",
