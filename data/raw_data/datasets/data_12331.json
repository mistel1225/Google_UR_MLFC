    "content": "Whenever listening to Audio on my phone via Bluetooth, it starts out great then after a few minutes it starts stutter and then cutting out. And then totally cuts put when the phone is locked.\nThis happens on Bluetooth earphones, speakers etc. This has only started since the android 11 update!\n\nThis whole 3rd-party-app-blaming is rubbish.\n\nIf so many people are reporting an issue with stuttering Bluetooth connectivity after updating the OS, then it must be a software problem!ki\n\nGoogle needs to take responsibility and fix these bugs. I cannot factory reset my phone and have 3 apps on (including Spotify) but the issue is still third party.\n\nIf the update isn't compatible with some of the world's most popular apps, then in my opinion the fault lies is the OS.\n\nI have tried all the work around and it just doesn't work. I can't enjoy any music on my commute or other wise. It is super frustrating. I love this phone but having that kind of rudimentary issue is reAlly disappointing and affecting.",
