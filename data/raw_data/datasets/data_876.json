    "content": "Hi, my pixel 2's battery needs some love and I'm considering sending my device to Google France for a battery swap. But I've read online that the device we receive back is sometimes permanently bootloader-locked. This is a big no no for me as I want to be able to install custom ROMs or root my device. How can I make sure that my device won't be bootloader-locked after a repair? Do I get some sort of refund if they send me a locked device in return? Thank you.",
