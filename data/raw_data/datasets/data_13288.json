    "title": "Pixel 3a won't charge after Android 11 update!",
    "content": "I updated a few days ago and now my Pixel 3a refuses to charge when it's plugged in unless my phone is turned off or in Safe Mode. \n\nIf Ieave it on, the phone doesn't charge or it restarts over and overwhile plugged in. This week at work I had it plugged in and within 5 minutes my phone restarted 3 times without me doing anything when it was supposed to be charging. The screen flickers while it's plugged in and supposedly \"charging\". Apps crash and the screen blinks. \n\nWhat am I supposed to do? Turn my phone off while it's charging all the time? What about when I'm driving for hours and need to run Maps and have it plugged in? I'm confused why it is only charging in Safe Mode or turned off. I deleted any recently downloaded apps to see if it would work again and it doesn't. \n\nAlso: taking away the screenshot button when holding down the power button was not a good idea. I had to switch my display to the three button navigation because holding down the power button + volume button didn't work for screenshots (literally nothing happened when I did that). Absolutely ridiciulous. I'm so mad I updated to Android 11. This is NOT a hardware issue either. I have used the same charger that came with the pixel phone and it worked fine until this update.",
