    "title": "\"Create link\" sends Invalid Dynamic Link when sharing photos from Pixel 5, but works from computer.",
    "content": "I tried sharing a video that I took with my Pixel 5 via \"Create link\" within Google Photos from my Pixel 5 and emailing it to myself. \n\nOnce received the link in my email:\n1. I tried opening the link from Outlook via Pixel 5 and I receive \"Can't find link\" / \"This link has been deleted or the URL is invalid\" error message\n2. I tried opening the link from Outlook via computer and I receive \"Invalid Dynamic Link\" / \"Requested URL (https://photos.app.goo.gl/deDXDLiDgV4crBS59%3Cspan%20id=%22ms-outlook-android-cursor%22%3E!~OMSelectionMarkerEnd~) must be a parseable URI, but possibly incomplete to be a DynamicLink.\nIf you are the developer of this app, ensure that your Dynamic Links domain is correctly configured and that the path component of this URL is valid.\"\n\nIf I share the same video via computer from my Google  Photos account, the link works.\n\nHow do I fix this issue from my Pixel 5? (This did not happen with my Pixel 3, only since I started using my Pixel 5).\n\nThanks, Charles",
