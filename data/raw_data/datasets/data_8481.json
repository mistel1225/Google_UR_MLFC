    "content": "I have google pixel 3 xl bought from google store NYC. Unfortunately I was given refurbish Verizon varient which I never asked. However the order has put one of my friend and now I can't contact him to get order ID. But Verizon is telling that they are not registered my device on their stock and they can't unlock the bootloader to use the Esim with other. I just asked from google support but they are not going to unlock the bootloader and asked me to wait until software update come. I don't know what is the fate in future. Please let me know in details.\nMy device is google pixel 3 xl.\nThanks and regards",
