    "title": "Pixel 3 XL insufficient brightness outdoors",
    "content": "Hi, I have a Pixel 3 XL and I'm sure this was addressed somewhere else but my brightness isn't very good outdoors. From my understanding, the 3 XL gets only up to 444 Nits of brightness, which isn't very good especially when you have cheaper flagships with much higher brightness. I recently came across an article on XDA developers that state that the 3 XL can get up to 525 Nits of brightness with Root. My question is will Google ever send out an update to maximize the brightness manually by the user? Hands down, this is one of my most frustrating gripes with the 3 XL because even at full brightness, I struggle to see the screen. \n\nI don't want to go through the work of rooting my phone and changing the maximum brightness that way but at the same time, the screen is frustratingly dim. C'mon, Google.Send out an update or something to make the display brighter.",
