    "content": "I have noticed that since the Android 10 Security Update 5th June 2020 (which updated to my phone overnight), WiFi Calling no longer works. The signal icon now displays an X and the \"EE WiFi Calling\" text normally viewable when you swipe down from the top is no longer visible. I live in a dead signal area so this is pretty inconvenient.\n\nI have tried:\n\nRebooting phone (several times)\nTurning WiFi on and off\nTurning Airplane Mode on and off\nTurning Wifi Calling option on and off\nTurning Mobile Data on and off\n\nNone of the above has solved it. Any ideas? Thanks.",
