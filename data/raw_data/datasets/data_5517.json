    "content": "When I try to voice dial on locked screen, the response is \"Got it, but first you'll have to unlock your device.\"  I have selected my bluetooth device as a \"trusted device\" in smart lock settings.  I have also selected \"Allow bluetooth requests with device locked\" in Google app settings.  What can I try next?",
