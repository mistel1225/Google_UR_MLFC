    "content": "Hi, first time Android user and have had the pixel 4a 5g for a week only.  I don't get any notifications for missed calls on the locked screen. I have to unlock the phone and check and there's usually a dot next to the phone to indicate I had a missed call. If I try to change the notifications settings for the phone they are all disabled and the only one I can change is the \"Allow notification dot\" (I attached a pic). Can I fix this or is it a fault phone?",
