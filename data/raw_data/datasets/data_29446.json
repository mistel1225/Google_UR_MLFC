    "content": "Autorotate, gyroscope, light sensor and squeeze are not working. All these options are enabled in the settings. I installed Sensor lab, and everything apart from network activity is flatlined.\n\nI have tried everything described in the posts below, including:\n- resetting Google app cache\n- resetting app settings\n- swapping sim card\n- rebooting in safe mode\n- last resort of a factory reset.\n\nNone of these make a difference. \nThis has been happening for a few months now, and is quite frustrating always ot have to adjust brightness and not being able to take photos and videos in landscape. Once, after a reboot around a month ago, all sensors started working again, but on the next reboot everything stopped again, and I haven't managed to get them working again. \n\nThese are the posts I checked, none of which provided a solution:\nhttps://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/3086868?hl=en\nhttps://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/3194922?hl=en\nhttps://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/1717632?hl=en\n\nDevice is less than 1 year old and under warranty.",
