    "content": "I was gifted  a new charger from the Apple store (USB-C) which is suitable for a pixel 3. I charged it overnight as my battery was dead however it won’t turn on. I have tried holding both volume and power button for several minutes and nothing. The phone was purchased on a plan and my provider has agreed to send it away for repairs or replacement. My question is how do I know it’s backed up? Does it automatically link to my google account? Is there a way I can check?",
