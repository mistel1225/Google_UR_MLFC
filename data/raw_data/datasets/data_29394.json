    "title": "Phone starts rebooting in my car. Even when 3XL is turned off. Device is not connected to Bluetooth.",
    "content": "Can't do anything. Phone is unresponsive during this. When I turn on the car phone starts rebooting continuously. Bootloop. Even if I turn phone off before I get into my car. It's an older model Mazda 6. Phone is NOT connected to the car. It once was, but it started bootlooping after a call. Then I tried a factory reset. After the factory reset the problem above arose. But never paired it again. When I walk away from the car the 3XL starts working normally again.",
