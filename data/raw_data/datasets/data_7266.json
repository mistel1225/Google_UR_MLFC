    "content": "I was wondering if anyone knows of anything I can do or apps I can purchase to make my Google pixel 4a 5g phone work again after briefly having it emerged in the bathtub after I accidentally dropped it in there.\nNothing comes on it's pure black BUT it DOES ring, although you can't answer it turn it off or on, you can't see anything at all. Any suggestions?? I do NOT have insurance on this phone so any help really would be truly appreciative thank you so very much!!",
