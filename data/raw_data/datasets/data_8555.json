    "title": "Since the December update, Waze and Google Maps instructions cannot be heard.",
    "content": "Only a portion of alerts in Direction notifications are heard from Waze and Google Maps. Only happens when I'm connected to my car via Bluetooth but the instructions are set to come out of the speaker on my phone. I hear things like \"Turn left\" rather than \"Turn left on Main Street in 1 mile\". If I am listening to music playing over Bluetooth to my car, the full instructions are played correctly through my car speakers.",
