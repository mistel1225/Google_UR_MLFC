    "content": "My Pixel 5 has a very slight but noticeable delay on the keyboard, especially the outer keys e.g. P, L, Delete etc and when double tapping a letter. It's infuriating to type with.\n\nThe scrolling and flick to scroll is also very laggy.\n\nThis seems to be worse when charging.\n\nI've changed my screen sensitivity to high but it doesn't help.",
