    "content": "It worked before I updated my phone to Android 11. Actually after uploaded to 11 there are so many other problems and this is just one of them. I feel so bad for this upgrade and I do not suggest anyone upgrade top it.\n\nSo come back with this no beep issue,  I searched the internet and tried to set up Accessibility,  it didn't work for me. Any other ways? Thanks!",
