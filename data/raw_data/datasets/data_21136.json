    "content": "Videos and music aren't making any sound on my Pixel 3a. At first I thought my speakers were broken as I had spilled water on the phone prior, but notifications, calls and alarms come through loud and clear, so it has to be a software issue. I've already reset my phone and it didn't help.",
