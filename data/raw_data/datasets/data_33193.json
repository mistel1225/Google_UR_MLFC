    "content": "I have checked all permissions and they seem to be where they need to be. Trying to point any major sharing app (Facebook, Insta) to Google photos instead of \"gallery\" generates an error when it tries to download the image. Going to photos and trying to save the photo to my device doesn't seem to work. I can't find the downloaded file anywhere a reasonable human might look for it. I know I can share to these apps from inside the photos app but that is backwards to my brain - I want to easily access my photos from Instagram or messenger. That's how I'm used to it. What gives?",
