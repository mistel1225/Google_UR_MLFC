    "content": "I think there's something wrong with my Pixel 2 XL. It's difficult to exactly describe, so I'll give examples.\n\nExample 1:\nI'm connected to WiFi and I'm on the Amazon Flex (driver delivery) app. I switch off WiFi to switch to 4G, and the app returns an error due to lack on connectivity (even though I clearly have good 4G signal). Hence I can't check in at delivery destinations. Restarting the phone and re-running the app fixes this.\n\nThe same happens in other apps, when I switch from WiFi to 4G.\n\nExample 2:\nCompletely randomly (as it seems to me), I'm told I have no network connection on apps like YouTube and Spotify when I clearly do have connection and can access the internet. I either have to wait a while or restart my phone to fix this.\n\nExample 3:\nI'm on Instagram or Facebook and I lock my phone while the app is still open. If I unlock my phone (back onto the app), the app doesn't refresh. I need to close the app and reopen it to get it working.\n\nI've already reset my network settings, but this hasn't changed anything. I'm on android version 11. Does anybody else experience any of these issues? Any advice?\n\nThanks",
