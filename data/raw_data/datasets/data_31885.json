    "content": "Yesterday when charging, my pixel suddenly begin to keep rebooting continuously. Only by entering the fastboot menu and click \"power off\" when it is not charging could I shut it down. Then, I have tried:\n1. apply a rescue OTA to it but could not go on at a certain step.\n2. click \"restart bootloader\" in fastboot menu to factory reset it, but it did not respond.\n3. take out the SIM card and try 1 & 2\nnone worked. Wish I can get some help here :)",
