    "content": "Well, I've tried to back to configure push message display at the bottom end of the phone, however, I did forget on how I did it before. I looked all over my settings and nothing came up. I looked on how to configure system setting display it wasn't there. I tried everything. Now I'm on the ocean on a leaky boat getting ready to sink. If anybody can get me to turn into a dolphin so I can swim into the safe sea, much of help will be totally obliged.",
