    "content": "My first Pixel 5 died with a bad mobo/corrupted OS and won't start.  I got a replacement shipped to me.  I had recently updated my plan with AT&T that included a backup app for photos and movies but hadn't installed it yet as I've never had a phone die on me before.  Is there any way to recover the media that I had on the old Pixel 5 if it can't start?",
