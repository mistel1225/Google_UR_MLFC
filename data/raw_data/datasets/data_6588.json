    "title": "Pixel 3 Will Only Charge After Reboot or When Turned Off",
    "content": "My phone has been doing this for a couple months now. It will not charge via the charge port unless I reboot it (with cable already inserted) or turn it off and plug it in. I have tried with several different cables and blocks, including the OEM charger, but nothing works. It will charge wirelessly without a reboot, but not corded. Iâ€™ve tried in safe mode and done a factory reset. Issue still remains. Has anyone else seen this happen before? Anybody have any idea as to a solution?",
