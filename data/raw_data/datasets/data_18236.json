I am not manually deleting them, is there any way to retrieve the voicemail that are disappearing? Because some voicemail that were important to me have disappeared this way. Also is there any way to stop my voicemail from continuing to disappear?\n\nAlso, on the other hand, my call history goes all they way back to the beginning April 2018. \n\nI appreciate your help!",
