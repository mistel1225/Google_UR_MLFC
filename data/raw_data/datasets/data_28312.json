    "content": "After installation of Android 10 on my Google Pixel 2XL, it works great. However, on Slack when I swipe left to right, the new gesture closes the app. Previously, swiping left to right in Slack would present a left pane with the Slack channel. Now it just closes the Slack app. I am enjoying the new gestures without the 3 buttons at the bottom. How can the swipe left to right in Slack be restored so that the left pane presents itself with the Slack channels.",
