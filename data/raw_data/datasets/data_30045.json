    "content": "Hi all,\n\nMy question is, what is the difference between using the Data Transfer Tool and using Google's Backup/Restore Account method when setting up a new phone. \n\nIn my private case the transfer is from Pixel 1 to Pixel 2. Do the two methods yield the exact same result, or are there nuances? \n\nTo elaborate little further, what I'm interested in, is a as complete clone as possible of my old phone. Including app settings if possible. Also, would RCS/MMS messages transfer intact using the above two methods? For example, when doing the same process on a PC, there are very common and simple software solutions that clone the hard drive exactly, 1:1.\n\nThank you in advance!",
