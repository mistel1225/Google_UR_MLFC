    "title": "My Google Pixel 2 XL does not detect the USB-C cable plugged in for charging or file transfer.",
    "content": "Charging often works after resetting my device, and then doesn't work again after some time on battery power. There are random occasional vibrations as if it were plugged in, when it isn't charging or plugged in. When plugged into a computer, the Pixel will briefly recognize a device for a second then show no options for device connectivity.",
