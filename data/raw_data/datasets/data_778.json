    "content": "I don't know about other Google Pixel 4XL owners but personally I am yet to receive the April update. I find that a bit odd because I know every month its usually released on the first Monday (which I've seen it's released this time) and usually I can download it right away. But right now it's still not available for me yet. Anyone else with a Google Pixel 4XL not receive it yet?",
