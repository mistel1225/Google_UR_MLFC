    "content": "On a daily basis I get spam texts that are marked as suspected spam in Google Messages, but they're still delivered with a notification to the main Messages screen. \n\nThe messages all have the same format but come from different numbers, so I'm doubtful that the time I've spent reporting several hundred of them to the on-device 'intelligence' has had any real effect.\n\nCan we have an option to disable notifications for suspected spam?",
