    "content": "I tried everything, just need a replacement of my phone as this problem won't be solved. I bought it in Germany but moved to Azerbaijan since then. I payed extra money to register the IMEI here in Azerbaijan and then this terrible thing just happened yesterday after of more than month of usage happened. How should I return my phone? Who to contact. Here everything seems to be about forums. No real personal support or chat with their worker or any email or phone number contacts. Please people HELP me as I am shocked that I have to live such things through with my brand new phone I paid 949 euros. The screen just started flickering like crazy and it only gets worse and worse. I have blinded my eyes because of that already. Tried all the 3 steps with software fix versions....",
