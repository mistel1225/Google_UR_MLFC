    "content": "My phone started rebooting by itself whenever the battery reached 30%, then started to do so at 60% and 70%. Whenever it starts rebooting it is stuck there and then it shows the battery icon as if it was drained, the phone won't turn back on unless I plug in the charger. Now my phone holds for about 15-30 minutes before it reboots again. There's no specific app that is causing that (sometimes when I try to unlock it, it does the aforementioned). Battery usage shows nothing unusual. I have tried restricting background battery usage, reboot, restore factory settings, app updates and phone update. Nothing worked.\nMy phone is fully functional when it's charging and nothing wrong happens.\n\nCheers",
