    "title": "3 different Pixel 3, all with issues, one died. Google has the worst after sales service.",
    "content": "Hello,\n\nGot two brand new Pixel 3 two years ago (September 2019).\nAfter one year of careful use, one ended up with microphone while the other with camera issues.\n\nGoogle replaced both phones with two refurbished Pixel 3 which in my opinion was not fair.. A 700 EUR phone under warranty should be replaced with a new phone.\n\nAnyhow, I have accepted the offer and after 6 months, my refurbished phone got bricked.\nGoogle support gave me the best solution \"Your phone is no longer under warranty. Sorry for the inconvenience.\".\n\nThe local service spot told me it's a hardware problem and it's not worth fixing it. 700 EUR for two years is ridiculous.\n\nMy first smartphone was an IPhone 3g and after that I got almost every Nexus and Pixel released.\nUnfortunately, Google has hugely disappointed me.\n\nThanks",
