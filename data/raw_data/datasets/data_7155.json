    "content": "Hi,\n\nI switched from an s10e to a Pixel 5. I am shocked that the Pixel 5 is missing basic features like being unable to unlock using a pin without needing to press okay to confirm. \n\nFurther, you cannot schedule Pixel's always on display to turn off during certain hours, like when you're asleep. \n\nPlease consider adding these options. \n\nThanks!",
