    "content": "I need to return the defective device after getting a warranty replacement. I can't find a shipping label in anything I received with the replacement device. I thought that would be no problem, went onto their website and filled out a form to request a new label. No reply, not even an acknowledgment that they got my form. I've tried calling Google store's number, but they say they can't answer right now due to limited staffing. I've called Assurant, the insurance company that handleswarranty replacements, and they can't help. They keep giving me the same Google number and web address that I've already used. I'm running out of time before my account gets charged for the phone that I can't return.",
