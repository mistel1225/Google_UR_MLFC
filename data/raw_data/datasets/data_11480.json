    "content": "Media control notifications will constantly reappear in the notification shade and on the lock screen hours or days after I viewed the content. For example, I listened to a podcast one night and every 30 minutes or so, the controls would pop up again for that same podcast. This continued for about 6 days until it switched to a random youtube video.\n\nA factory reset did not fix.",
