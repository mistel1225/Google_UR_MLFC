    "content": "Hi All,\n\nI have got the following problem. I freed up 6GB from my phone storage (pictures) a week ago.\nI did not take any pictures (I have 4 photos on the phone now), and installed maybe 3 apps at most. And today after one week the 6GB is literally gone and my phone is almost 99% full. I checked all folders trying to locate any large files which could have come from other apps but there is nothing I would have from the last week of the total 6GB size. I really think I would even struggle to find 1GB in total from anything from the last week.\n\nDoes anyone have a similar issue? I have been struggling with storage since the beginning.\nI have already noticed that videos are just huge on Pixel  3a - 3 minutes video is 1 GB. \n\nBut loosing 6GB without any new files? \n\nDoes anyone have a similar issue?",
