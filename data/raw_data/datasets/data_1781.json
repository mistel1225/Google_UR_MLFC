    "content": "My phone was working a few hours ago and kept in charge before sleeping last night.  When I woke in the morning it was completely dead.   \n\nI tried leaving in charge for a couple of hours, but nothing is coming on (no battery indicator on screen).  I also tried plugging it into my laptop for 30 minutes and still no response.  \n\nFinally tried to check if it is a screen problem by holding the power button for 30 minutes and waiting for 2 minutes afterward.  Still Nothing.\n\nThe charging cable and brick is original pixel's and my husband has pixel 2xl and when I plug it in with his device, it is charging perfectly fine.\n\nAny other recommendations?",
