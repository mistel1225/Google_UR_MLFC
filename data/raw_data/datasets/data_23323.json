    "content": "I had to shut off the motion yesterday as a last resort because it seems the light wind from my very small fan shuts it off.  I tried other things prior to this to no avail.  Today was the first day since I got it on the 31st of January that my alarm went on and stayed on.  Could someone please explain why the slight air movement would to this?  Thank you.",
