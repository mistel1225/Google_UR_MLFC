    "content": "I just noticed when taking my phone out of the case that the back is separating, as if something is pushing it from the middle (battery?). I contacted Google and, while they agreed that it could be the battery swelling and could be dangerous, they said that my 18 month old phone is out of warranty and they can't fix it. \n\nWay to go, Google, selling a $800 phone that self-destructs after 18 months. I'm incredibly disappointed that you will not stand behind your products.",
