    "title": "My screen is frustratingly insensitive.",
    "content": "It's super frustrating because I regularly have to click/select buttons 6 or 8 times before it registers. Combine that with its considerable lag and things get mis-selected all the time. \n\nI purchased in 2019 December, and promptly  installed a screen protector. I suppose I should remove the protector for a fair test, but I hate the process of cleaning and undusting when reinstalling it. And I seem to recall the lack of sensitivity before I installed it. I also wonder if it could be a problem with my biology: my fingers too dry, or moist, or something. \n\nAnyone else have this problem? Or a solution?",
