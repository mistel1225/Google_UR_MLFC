    "content": "Hi, \n\nI have a brand new Pixel 3a phone (used it for two weeks now). And within the first two days of using it, it started overheating when the hotspot was on or when I was using WhatsApp Video and shutting down randomly. Zoom is impossible to do on the device, and it'll shut down within 5 minutes unless I have an iceblock on the back of my phone. Mind you, I am closing all apps running in the background and only connected to the data network of my provider. It started glitching during WhatsApp voice calls, sometimes turning the screen black (with not heat notification) and a frozen interface (all black). The only way I can get around this is to hold down the power button for at least 7 seconds to turn it off and on again.\n\nEach day I use it, the issue is growing more frequent and worse. It has been updated to the latest specs and it has plenty of storage space. I also have killed apps that I thought could be an issue, but every day when I try to use it for video calls, voice calls via the internet, or have it working as a hotspot it crashes miserably. \n\nSince it is a brand new phone, I think it may be an issue with the hardware.\n\nBest,\nAllison",
