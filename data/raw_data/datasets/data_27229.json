    "title": "Worst Customer Service Ever - No Stock of Phone",
    "content": "My Pixel had many unresolvable issues and Google concluded it would be best for me to send the phone back to them for a replacement (under manufacturers warranty). I was also told this may take c.5-10 working days at the very most. With that trust, I sent my phone off on 19th September. They’ve had my phone since 25th September and I’ve called multiple times asking why I don’t have my phone. Each time I get another conjured up response - from “Your phone is still in transit” (despite DPD confirming delivery) to “We are still investigating the issue with your phone” (not true as another representative confirmed that Ithis wasn’t the case). \n\nThe excuse they’ve settled with for now is that they don’t have stock of the Pixel 3. Yes, ladies and gentlemen, Google apparently does not have stock of its own flagship phone ... \n\nThis honestly astounds me - I’ve spent hours and hours talking to customer service and I still don’t have my replacement phone.",
