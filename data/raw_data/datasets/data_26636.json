    "content": "My in-warranty Pixel 3 device has dead pixels in the top right corner of the screen. I contacted Google customer support more than 2 weeks ago and they said that they'll replace the device. For the past two weeks they've been giving me nonsense about a mysterious 'technical issue with their RMA system'. Contacted a customer support supervisor and he completely ghosted me after a couple of emails. Where can I get help with this faulty device? Is there anyone at Google who can help or I'm out of options at this stage? \n\nGoogle, we love your software, but if that's the best you can do with hardware, please focus on ads and leave the hardware business to more credible hardware companies. Thank you!",
