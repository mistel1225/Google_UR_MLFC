    "content": "I accidentally enabled sync from another GMAIL account, other than then main account.\nSo now I have most of them duplicate and some of them are obselete.\n\nSo now I want to cleanup the Synced data. I tried these:\n\nDisabled Sync for second account.\nCleared Cache / storage for Contacts and Phone.\n\nStill I see the contacts are there. â€Œ When open such contact, I see that it shows both Duo & WhatsApp also in that, though not editable.\n\nHow can I unsync? I see many suggestions from internet, but not working in the current Pixel (Android 9)",
