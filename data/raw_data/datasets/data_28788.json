    "title": "My pixel 2 XL is very slow, even after factory resetting.",
    "content": "My 2XL became extremely slowly today(no plugging in charger). I rebooted it, slow. After factory resetting, still slow!! And both the rebooting and the resetting took much more time than usual.\nIt seems that the phone can't run more than 2 tasks at the same time. For example, when installing the updates in play store, another app in running just had no response and suggested to close.\nI can't use it as normal. I have no idea how to deal with it.\nAny help and advice would be appreciated.",
