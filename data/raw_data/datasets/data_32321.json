    "title": "Ambient display blinks once after waking it with a double tap.",
    "content": "I have the ambient display on. I like to double tap to wake up the whole screen to see my notifications. After the screen goes black(turns off) and the ambient display comes back on, the clock and everything will blink once. I'm not unlocking the phone all the way, just waking up the screen. I'm not sure why it's doing this and wonder if there is a fix. When I see it in the corner of my eye, it looks like I'm getting another notification but it's just blinking that one time.",
