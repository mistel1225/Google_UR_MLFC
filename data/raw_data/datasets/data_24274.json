    "content": "I live in China but bought my Google Pixel 2XL in the UK. Every function used to work fine if my VPN was connected (asides from having to clear my cache everytime I want to download something in the Play Store). However, recently no Google apps work - YouTube, Gmail, Google Assistant etc. I can't update my phone to the latest version either as that doesn't work too. Help!",
