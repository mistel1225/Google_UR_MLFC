    "title": "Pixel 3, Won't charge and headphone jack not working.",
    "content": "My pixel 3 does not charge unless\n1. The usb c cable is in a certain orientation, not either of the two possible ways to put it in.\n2. I restart the phone before charging it, otherwise it doesn't matter what orientation I put the charger in, it won't charge.\n\nAlso using the usb-c port as a headphone jack does not work. I thought it might have been the headphones but I have tried the usb-c adapter to 3.5mm with multiple headphones and no audio whatsoever.\n\nOne odd thing I've noticed is that sometimes the phone thinks it's charging even though it's not, I get the little notification at the top saying its usb-c port is connected however it is not.",
