    "content": "I use my Pixel 3 for work and personal comms. I have set up contact lists (Friends, Customers, Suppliers) and was wondering if I can assign different ringtones for each group (Pixel calls it \"Labels\") so I can tell by the ringtone what type of call is incoming.\n\nAs I have over 1200 contacts in my phone I would rather not have to go to each one and manually set the ringtone, thank you very much.",
