    "content": "When I plug in my phone, I do not see the notification that it is charging via USB. This is a problem when charging from my computer. I cannot select the notification in order to change what the phone is supposed to do, like transfer files.\n\nI know about the developer options *BS*, but a) it didn't work for me; file transfer does not connect my phone to the computer for file transfer and b) it still doesn't show the notification, which the help files seem to indicate it should.",
