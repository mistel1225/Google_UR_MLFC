    "content": "My Pixel 4 XL that I bought at launch has had a significant increase in battery drain over the last couple of weeks. The phone also shuts off when the battery falls to 22%. I tried a factory reset and that did not help. My usage has not changed and there are no new apps. Do I just need a new battery or could it be something else?",
