    "content": "I used a lapel mic with a headphone jack and a Google-made usb-c adapter on my Pixel 2 just fine. But then when I upgraded to Pixel 4, it sounded awful--it sounded \"hot\" and loud and the background noise was horrible.\n\nI stupidly assumed it was the lapel mic's fault (that it got damaged somehow) so I bought a brand new one, but this time with a usb-c connection built in. Same problem. \n\nDid Google seriously worsen the support for external mics from Pixel 2 to Pixel 4?\n\nIs anyone able to get external mics sounding good with Pixel 4?",
