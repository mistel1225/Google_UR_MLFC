    "content": "For years now my phone will stop displaying the temperature at random and sometimes it makes sense in that I don't have data or data is turned off but other times it just doesn't show. \n\nOften if I wait long enough it randomly returns other times I have to search a forum like this and be reminded to force stop the Google app and clear data, or something to do with an update to get it to finally work again.\n\nWhy!? This has gone on for years for me with different pixel phones, it's evident from forums that it's common over the last several years for others. Why don't you fix this?",
