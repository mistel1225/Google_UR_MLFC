    "content": "I have been in contact with support regarding my phone. I was told it's covered under warranty but because I'm stationed overseas (it was bought in the US), they forwarded it to EMEA support. Cool. Except now I'm getting ignored. It's been a week and a half since they first sent it. I did another chat and the agent said he'd have them email me and was \"positive\" I'd hear back within 24 hours...it's been 4 days. Is there any other way to actually contact them?",
