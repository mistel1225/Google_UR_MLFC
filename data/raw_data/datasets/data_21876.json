    "content": "Not sure what all those reviewers are complaining about battery life...mine is always 100%. Ha ha. \nWell, I know its not that but it seems to be stuck at 100% for several hours and a few times I restarted it and it showed the expected 90-95% or so drop. But  I really dont think that should be the work around as that would be so atypical these days.\nCouple things...phone is only 72 hrs old and we have 2 of them and they both do this...\nAnyone else having this?",
