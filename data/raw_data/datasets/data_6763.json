    "content": "Hello there!\n\nI have a Google Pixel 2 XL that I upgraded to Android 11 late last year, but until today I noticed that I can no longer connect it to my DJI Mavic 2 Pro drone's remote control using a USB OTG cable.\n\nI've read on forums that this is a widespread problem on the Pixel 2 and 3 with Android 11. With Android 10 this connection worked fine for me.\n\nI'm worried that Google won't fix the problem as my Pixel 2 XL is out of warranty and out of support.\n\nHas anyone managed to solve the problem?\n\nI have factory reset my phone and at least now I can connect it to a PC with Windows 10. Before the factory reset it didn't work.\n\nAny idea how to make the USB connection work like on Android 10?\n\nIf Google doesn't provide support or a solution, can I downgrade to Android 10?\n\nThanks!",
