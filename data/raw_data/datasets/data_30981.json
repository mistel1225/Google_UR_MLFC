    "title": "Can you use the eSim with Google Fi and insert a Nano Sim with another carrier?",
    "content": "It would be nice to use Google Fi for Phone calls, but use another carrier for high data usage. I have another carrier that provides me 8GB a month for like $30, Google Fi would charge like $10 per GB that could be upwards of $80 a month. I like that Google Fi has the best coverage but I sometimes need a hotspot and that would make Google Fi unaffordable. If the Pixel would allow me to use the eSim with Google Fi and then toggle to the Nano Sim when I’m going hog wild with Data, then that would be the perfect combination. I can’t get a war answer on this, some people say I could but iId have to manually toggle between SIMs and others say it’s not possible. Does anyone have a clear answer on this? Thanks!!!",
