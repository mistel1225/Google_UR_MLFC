    "content": "I need suggestions regarding pixel 5 Cause My iphone 12 pro max was set to come from Dubai to India but seems impossible cause of Covid.\nWhile looking through the camera specs of the pixel 5 it showed that as compared to pixel 4a it only has an ultrawide lens as an addition and rest of the camera features are almost same as pixel 4a.\nSo need views and suggestions regarding pixel 5 does it have a better camera quality than 4a in aspects such as 1. Portrait mode. 2. Nightscape mode. 3. Low light photos.\nLast but not the least main thing how is the 4k recording in pixel 5 is it good enough ?\n\nDoes Pixel 5 camera quality is upto the level of S21 ultra and iphone 12 pro max ?",
