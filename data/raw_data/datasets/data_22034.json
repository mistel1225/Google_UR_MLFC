    "content": "I was playing a YouTube video on my pixel 3a when suddenly the video stopped and the screen went dark. I can still hear pings and alarms and when I use fingerprint login or press the power button i get a flash of the sim pin screen with a notification before it dims to black again inside half a second. When I restart the phone (by pressing power button for 15ish seconds) i see the Google animation (swirling dots) for maybe 5 seconds before that just goes dark too.\nThis happened 2 days ago. I've got it into safe mode but can't tell if I have options there as screen is too dark to see. Currently I'm waiting for the battery to die to see if I can wipe to factory settings. I'd bring it to a pro but the country is in coronavirus lockdown. Is it worth waiting a few weeks?",
