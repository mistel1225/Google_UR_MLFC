    "content": "When I open or go to another app or window and hover over the chrome app it will show the open windows but not what is going on. Everything will just be frozen. For example, when I play a youtube video the audio will be there but the video won't be playing, it will just be white. Internet Explorer doesn't do this and I need help doing the same for chrome.",
