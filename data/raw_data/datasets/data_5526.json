    "content": "The Always On Display on my Pixel 4A is acting buggy. After I lock my screen, it should show the time, and other info, and then on 2-3 seconds it should become black & white and also dim the brightness, but it keeps showing that in color, and in full brightness.\nAnyone having the same issues? Any fix?",
