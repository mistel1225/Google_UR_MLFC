    "content": "so I have had the phone for like 3 months now. It started off really well and I loved it and I still do. For some reason, it has been REALLY laggy recently. I am not sure why but opening apps takes ages... sometimes even just swiping through menus or swiping takes really long. I've even had to restart it a few times as it got unresponsive. I am not sure what is happening, but I was expecting those issues a year or two in, not just 3 months in. Any tips?",
