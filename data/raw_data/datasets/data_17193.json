    "title": "Pixel 3 battery melted damaging the motherboard",
    "content": "One day my phone suddenly started showing remaining battery capacity stuck at 6%. The phone did get charge and was working fine but the battery indicator was completely broken. After a week or so, the indicator slowly went down to 1% and the phone started to reboot randomly. After talking to Pixel support, they recommended that I take the phone to a Google certified repair shop.\n\nThe repair shop diagnosed the issue and determined that the phone battery had been melted and damaged the motherboard! There is no way to repair the phone and it needs to be replaced. \n\nThis seems like a major manufacturing flaw and a safety risk to me. The day that the issue started, I wasn't even using my phone. I was just carrying it in my pocket. I think Google should investigate and fix potential software or hardware problems causing this. \n\nGoogle support has been very unhelpful. The phone is outside warranty and they didn't even offer covering replacement cost. \n\nHas anyone else had the same severe issue with the battery damaging the phone under normal usage?",
