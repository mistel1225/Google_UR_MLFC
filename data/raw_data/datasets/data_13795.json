    "content": "Dear Google and Gcommunity ,\n\nFour years ago I moved to Italy and I have been a long time user of Google services. I am currently on the market for a new smartphone and I would like to know if is there any possibility that the new Pixel5 will also be made available in Italy just like the Pixel 4 and 4a (especially when Italy's 5G network is well established at the moment).\n\nSincerely\n\nL. Martins",
