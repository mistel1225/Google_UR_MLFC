    "content": "I had my Pixel 3 with me when I was playing sport and left it in a waterproof bag on an artificial turf. When I picked it back up the battery showed a 0% charge and I was unable to get any charging/discharging stats out of it. I completely discharged the battery and full charged it again and the battery life seems the same but I am unable to get those charging stats back.\n\nAnyone experienced anything similar?",
