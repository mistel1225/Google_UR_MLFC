    "content": "Hello,\n\nI'm not sure who to address this to, but I sent in my Pixel on on 10/2/20... \nThis was after Google Store Support saying that they would replace it under warranty, and if I send my phone back in, within a week I would have my replacement.....\nWell,,,,,, it has been 2 months now, and I have been ignored by chat repeatedly, and I am on aprox 40 chats back and forth with the \"Our team is checking on it, will get a response in 24-48 hours..... Well,, in 24 -48 hours I get a copy/paste of the same message.....\n\nIsn't 2 months a little much, when you promise 1 week???\nIs this the new standard these days??\n\nThanks,\nDustin T",
