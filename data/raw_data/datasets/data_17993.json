    "content": "I backed up my Pixel 3XL before having it repaired today.  While it was being repaired, I turned on my old Samsung phone (just to use Chrome over WiFi).  When I got the Pixel back and went to restore it, the only phone backup showing was one from my Samsung, apparently made (automatically?) after I turned it on.  How do I access the slightly older backup from the Pixel?",
