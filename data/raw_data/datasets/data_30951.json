    "title": "I'm experiancing the \"buzzing\" / Vibrating camera issue but google doesn't answer.",
    "content": "So almost everytime I use the front facing camera be it in Snapchat, FB Messanger or even the camera app the phone starts to vibrate. It's sort of a static buzzing/vibrating and renders the front facing camera completely useless, and the person on the other side of the call (in videocalls) can hear it. So I have to flick between the front and rear camera a few times before it stops. Also happens when I'm using the front camera and the phone bumps something.\n\nThis is not my video but this is the issue: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxV6tmbd1Co\n\nFound some answers online that says to contact google for a replacement, so I have requested a callback through the built in support but they never call me back. Anyone knows how to get a hold of them. From Spain.\n\nCheers",
