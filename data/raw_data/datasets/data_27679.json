    "content": " I've had my little Pixel for a while. Up until February, it worked great! No issues, and the battery lasted long and charged fast. However, its battery life has been getting progressively worse at an alarming rate. \n\n At first, it was alright; dying at 20% and even 30% was understandable. But it only got worse. This morning, I woke up at 9:50 to take my dog outside. Decided to go ahead and perform some app updates while I was at it. Lo and behold, not even at 10:00, my phone died. It was at 100%, and when I rushed to stick it on the charger, it said 3%. \n\nThis experience is making me wish I hadn't bought a Pixel. Any way I can fix this? Battery saver worked for a couple hours when I started using it, but the Pixel overcame that obstacle to continue to ruin my experience with this brand.",
