    "content": "My screen keeps getting random flashing green horizontal lines which build up until it cut to static. I just have to tap the screen and it works again. Also, it will occasionally turn off the screen and it seems to still be on and unlocked, just with no light so I can't tell.\nI have tried eliminating excess apps and storage space and restarting the phone a few times.\nAnything else I can do or could I get it replaced?",
