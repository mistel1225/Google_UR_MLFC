    "content": "I'm having an odd problem with my Pixel 3 XL. More precisely with the device's camera. The camera works perfectly fine when it is functional, only problem is that it is functional around 40% of the time. It seems that at random moments, the camera simply stops working or doesn't turn on anymore. In fact, it leaves me on a black screen and the app crashes after a few seconds. When using an app that uses he camera (e.g. Snapchat) the app will show a message saying that it can not open the camera. Often times, the camera will be working just fine until I switch from front facing to back facing, then it will freeze, turn to black, and not be functional for an unknown period of time.\n\n I tried fiddling around with it to understand the problem,  and sometimes I need to switch from front to back a couple of times until it stops working. I also tried restarting the device many times and it seems to temporarily fix the problem until the camera stops working again. Factory reset had the same effect. \n\nAnother thing I noticed is that whenever the camera is in its \"dead\" state, I can't turn the flashlight on either (the button is greyed out), which leads me to believe that it is a hardware issue? But when the camera works it looks absolutely perfect which means it might be a software issue?\n\nI have searched online and haven't found any solution to my problem, it would be nice to know if anyone has experienced the same issue and if a solution has been found.",
