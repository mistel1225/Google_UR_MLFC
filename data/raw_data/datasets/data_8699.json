    "content": "Bought a new Pixel 5, which came with USB-C headphones. Work fine on the 5. Want to also use them on my old 3a XL, but when I plug them in nothing happens. No message, no headphone symbol, no detection, audio still outputting through the speakers. Google articles say the 3a xl is compatible with USB-C digital audio which I believe these headphones support. \n\nThe USB C port seems fine as the phone charges normally. Tried safe mode, tried rebooting the phone, tried cleaning the port of dust / lint which was suggested by another thread I found but none of those of worked. The only hing I haven't done yet is a factory reset but prefer to leave that as the last resort obviously as it's quite a hassle. Anyone have any ideas?",
