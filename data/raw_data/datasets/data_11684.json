    "content": "Okay, I'm asking for a friend. She did a factory reset on her google pixel,  twice, and gave the phone back to her parents. The phone was in her parents' name, but she wanted to start gaining her independence. This happened several months ago, but now her parents are claiming that they are able to read the text messages. Is this possible after a factory reset? \n\nThank you",
