    "content": "My pixel 3 rear-facing camera stopped focusing all of a sudden, without any drops or damage. Spent hours trying all the troubleshooting, has to be a hardware problem. Reading around seems like a common problem,  but not finding a repair shop that can find a supplier with parts to fix the camera.\n\nOnly reason I switched to Pixel was for the camera, shame it didn't make it past 1 1/2 years.",
