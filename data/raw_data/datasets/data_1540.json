    "content": "Hi, I installed Android 12 Beta 1 on my Pixel 3. It worked great for couple of days but the lock screen started crashing after restarting. I went ahead and hard reset the phone, but phone setup keeps on crashing on \"previous pincode\". \n\nThe bootloader wasn't unlocked before, so I'm not aware of any solution except I need access to developer options - which seems impossible.",
