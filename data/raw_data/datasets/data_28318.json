    "content": "I succesfully set up my new Pixel phone two weeks ago, but then I had to wait to get my new sim card in the mail and had to continue using my old phone in the meantime. Now that I have received it, I want to know if it's possible to set up the phone again so all my new messages ecc. are moved as well?\n\nIs that by doing a factory reset?  And will I have the option to set it up from scratch the same way as I did when I first turned it on for the very first time after doing a factory reset? It worked perfectly, I would just like to do it again, so that all of my data and the text messages that I received in the time period between setting up the new phone for the first time and actually being able to use it are all there..\n\nOr is there an other way to transfer just the latest text messages from my old phone (Newxus 5)?",
