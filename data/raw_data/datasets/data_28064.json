    "content": "Ever since upgrading my Pixel 3 to Android 10 I've been having issues with fingerprint login for various apps. The Chase app no longer allows me to use fingerprint login and other apps will require me to re-enable the fingerprint login feature every couple of days. I tried deleting the fingerprints I had and saved new ones but that didn't resolve the problem. Anyone else experiencing these issues or know of any solutions?",
