    "title": "May 2021 Security Update Bricked Pixel 3 xl; Google Support Could Not Fix",
    "content": "Device restarted after dl and installation.  Finished charging and checked mail and device worked well.  Powered down, the phone is off.  Not sleeping, off.   No lights, no warm back, and no vibration when plugged into electric outlets, power strip and chromebook.  Back up phone and lamp worked in all of those.  All ports and cabling cleaned.\nOver one-hour with customer service and no joy (NOTE: When trying to force loading into bootloader, hold power and volume down keys for ninety(90) seconds, per Google Support Chat).  \nGoogleFi account suspended pending repair or new phone purchase.\n\nI am fortunate to have a backup phone, Moto 7, on AT&T, as well as the means to purchase a replacement.\n\nAre there any other steps for me to save P3xl?",
