    "content": "Pixel 3a purchased 9 months ago. The oleophobic coating started smearing in frequently used spots on the screen within a month. Then, tiny chips started appearing in the screen. At first I thought these were dirt specks and I'd clean the phone; but no, they're chips.\n\nI've never had a phone do this before. It's in a folding case that protects everything. I'm still making payments on this phone. Is there anything I can do?",
