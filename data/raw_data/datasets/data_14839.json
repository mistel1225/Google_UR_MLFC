    "content": "I've noticed that whenever I turn on my internet (LTE or WiFi), most of the apps are unable to access it for literally a minute or two. Like Google Maps or WhatsApp just don't work immediately, and only start loading things after a couple of minutes. But there are some things that work immediately, like doing a Google search from the search bar on homescreen. What is causing this issue? I've also noticed that this never happened once when I was in India for 5 months, but the moment I reentered the US, I started seeing this behavior.",
