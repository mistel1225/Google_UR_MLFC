    "content": "Well this morning my face unlocked stopped working. First it said that the face sensor was not available then later on in the morning it said could not recognize face. I deleted face data and tried to redo it and during setup it said face enrollment didn't work. \n\nI contacted customer service on this issue and she recommended a factory reset, which I was reluctant to do. I was told that is would definitely fix the problem.\n\nWell i reset my phone, lost all my ringtones, my sms photos and I'm sure other things. Not to mention wasted my entire morning on this to no avail. It still does not work. \n\nThe customer service rep told me to email back with the results after my factory reset, which I did. No response back.\n\nI can't believe I have to go through this with a brand new phone. I've had the nexus 6p and pixel 1, 2, 3 and 4XL and i have NEVER had any issues with any phones, nor had to reset any of my phones until now. \n\nI won't even get into the horrible battery life. I've disabled all these nice new features so I can use my phone all day.",
