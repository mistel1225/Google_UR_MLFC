    "title": "Pixel 1 when I make a call on the phone app, the pixel becomes unstable & won't play any sound",
    "content": "Problem started in early May 2019. When I make or receive a call on the phone app the app becomes unstable and never switches to the ringing screen. The System UI then pops up as not responding, and crashes. Anything with sound such as YouTube, recorded videos, phone calls then doesn't play or work, nor do trying to play test ring tones. I have tried a restart this does not fix the problem, safe mode the problem remains. After a factory reset the problem appeared to be fixed as sound came back, and YouTube would play, however as soon as a call was made or received the problem reoccured. Standard device with only apps from Google Play. Is running all the latest updates.",
