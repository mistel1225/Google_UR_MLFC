    "content": "I've just purchased a pixel 3, my last device was an android running Oreo. On my old device, I could put DnD on to total silence, which muted all sounds and notifications, as well as haptic feedback. I cannot find how to turn haptic feedback off with DnD, instead I have to go into settings and manually turn it off. Am I missing something?",
