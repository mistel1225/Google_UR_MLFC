    "content": "I had been using my hone for only a short time this morning and suddenly the screen stayed black. If I hold the power button for 10 seconds the Google logo appears and it looks like it will turn on but everything stops as soon as I let go of the power button. If I continue to hold it will do the swirling G thing with \"Powered by andriod\" at the bottom but then it just goes back to Google logo with a continuous loop.  I tried a hard reset but nothing works without holding onto the power button.  Phone was charged at 90% when the issue occurred.  I work for the military overseas so I cannot take my phone to a licensed repair tech.",
