    "content": "My phone worked fine on my 2020 Ford Edge wireless charger until a few months ago. Now I constantly get messages on my Sync 3 head unit that my phone is misaligned on the charger...which it isn't. I see this is a common issue that some blame on an update in March. I hope there is a fix very soon, or I will be forced to switch to a different brand of phone. This is becoming a deal breaker.",
