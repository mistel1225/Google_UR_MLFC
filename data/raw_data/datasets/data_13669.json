    "content": "My device exhibits strange lighting behavior from the top in the status bar area.\nIt is some \"white taint\" that stays for a few seconds. Most obviously when pulling up and down the app drawer.\n\nConfused? Watch this video. https://photos.app.goo.gl/XiMRG3YLjf5XcMNN6 \n\nI barely set up anything. No non-Google app installed. Screen Brightness around 55%, \nDark Theme on or off and Night Light on or off, this happens. It gets worse with Night Light off. \n\nSince writing the post, the \"white taint\" stayed, even after restarting. \n(video was with Night Light on, photo is with Night Light off)\n\nIt is gone when opening settings:\n\n\nAnybody else experiencing this? \n\nThanks in advance.",
