    "content": "Out of the blue today my screen got a black/purple splotch in the top right corner. Over the day the purple splotches have spread out over the entire screen and it looks like ink.I moved from having the original Pixel to the 3a and I noticed there was a lag in speed in the 3a occassionally and it seemed \"glitchy\" sometimes. I called Google customer service and they have set up the replacement, however I noticed it is a refurbished replacement. This seems ridiculous given that they provided me with a defective phone to start. I am completely frustrated with google from how long it took to get the phone originally to all of these issues and now having to get it replaced. Has anyone else experience these issues with the Pixel 3a and with Google?",
