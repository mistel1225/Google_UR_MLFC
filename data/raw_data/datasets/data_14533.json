    "content": "Hello all,\nJust got my Google Pixel 4a a few days back, so I’m on a new phone.\nI was trying to change my WhatsApp notification sound (not WhatsApp-ringtone). For some reason, every time I try to do so, I am presented with the selection screen for ringtones not notification sounds. This seems to be a WhatsApp related problem; I didn’t have any issues with other apps.\n  I have already been in contact with WhatsApp support about this, but they said, that this is an isolated android problem and that there isn’t anything they could do.\n  Yes, I have restarted my phone and yes, I have reinstalled the app.\n  Any ideas? Did anyone have similar issues before?\n  Thanks in advance.",
