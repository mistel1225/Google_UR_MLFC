    "content": "I was told that my device was two days out of date and need to update to Android 11. So I did. Everything seems to be working smoothly. After the restart I discovered that nothing really changed on my phone. And I couldn't find the screen record feature, cuz it isn't there! Also missing, the media control centre and any other claimed new features.\n\nBut the system info says I'm running Android 11 and up to date.\n\nAm I the only one experiencing this problem?",
