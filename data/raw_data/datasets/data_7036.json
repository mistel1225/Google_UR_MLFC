    "content": "I'm using pixel 4a (Indian unit). When I have the maximum volume for ring and notification, it sounded louder so I decided to reduce little bit. So I had set volume which was just next to maximum. But it sounds too low.\n\nSo maximum volume sounds too loud and the next level to maximum sounds too low.",
