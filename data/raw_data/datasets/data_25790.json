    "content": "I am unable to search through call history. In my Samsung and Apple devices I can start to dial a number. The dialer will populate a list of all incoming/outgoing calls. Even if the number is not a contact.\n\nHow do you search for phone numbers that are not contacts, without scrolling through history.\n\nHow do I filter outgoing and incoming calls?\n\nIs there a dialer similar to Samsung?",
