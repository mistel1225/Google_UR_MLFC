    "content": "This should not be that difficult. Does anyone know how I can record a video using the front facing camera so that the finished video looks the same as I saw it as I was recording? It always flips it when it's done. I've searched everywhere, noone seems to know. The funny thing is that there is an option for this for photos but not for video... Google, why do you guys continue to make phones? I truly don't understand and now you guys don't even have chat support?",
