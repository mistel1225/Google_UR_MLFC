    "content": "So, when I point the camera down the auto focus goes crazy and keeps trying to focus. I contacted Google Support and told me that the phone was, a hardware problem and told me to go to a UBreakIFixIt shop or something. Any other solutions? I heard it was a laser autofocus issue and when I told them they say that they couldn't provide a answer (That's what google support told me)\n\nBut hey, atleast there support is better than a company which has a logo of a fruit. \n\n(also it's the 1st Gen Pixel)",
