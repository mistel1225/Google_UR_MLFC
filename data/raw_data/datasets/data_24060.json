    "content": "Today, my Pixel 3 suddenly started asking for a password when I have been using pin/fingerprint to unlock my phone. I don't recall setting up a password when I first configured my phone and I exhausted all my passwords in the attempt so the phone was factory reset. When I tried to restore my Pixel 3 backup on Google Drive, it also asked for a password (I am assuming the same password), so I can't restore my old settings. I am on 3 more attempts before my backup gets deleted so I am just going to leave that be.\n\nWhy did this start happening after 9 months suddenly? Can I do anything about this?",
