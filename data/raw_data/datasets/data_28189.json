    "content": "I've had my Pixel 3 XL for less than a month and twice battery has been drained to a low (Red) level the next morning after leaving it plugged in overnight.  The power cord connects, clicks in, well and and appears to be charging at first.  However the next morning when I unplug and start using the phone I quickly get a notice that the battery is low.",
