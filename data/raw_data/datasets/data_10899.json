    "content": "I recently bought Pixel 4a. It came with Android 11 September 2020 security patch. So, I tried to update to November 2020 patch. But, I am not able to update. It says that my phone is already on the latest. Please find the attached screenshot. I tried with both WiFi and mobile data. Nothing worked. Safe mode/Factory reset also didn't work.",
