    "content": "Hello all. I have recently encountered major issues with my pixel device. The most infuriating of all is that I can't plug in headphones when the phone is on, and if I do, it makes a loud clicking noise very rapidly. I have to restart my phone, hope it works, and then I'm good to go. If I somehow make it that far, when watching YouTube on headphones the Google assistant activates randomly and the volume drops randomly. The video also pauses sometimes. Another issue I have been encountering is my device randomly crashing/freezing/restarting. I have checked the water damage Indicator and it is white. These issues have appeared closely after the Android 9 update I'm pretty sure. Any help would be greatly appreciated.",
