    "content": "my phone turned off randomly (at 40% ) and I couldn't turn it back on by pressing or charging.NOTHING would work for more than 12 hours. came back to life today but tried to use it and battery went down quick. out it on charge it wouldn't charge as fast as it normally does. scared itll happen again. unreliable as I've had a phone like this a month ago and it kept rebooting and I got an exchange for this one. the screen glitches aswell alot",
