    "content": "The same day I updated to Android 11, my phone started to shut off when I use the camera when the battery was around 25%. Now, when It's still at 50%, and I use the camera or try to watch a video, it shuts off, sometimes restarting or sometimes needing to be manually restarted. If I plug in the charger, it works fine immediately.",
