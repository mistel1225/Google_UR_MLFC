    "title": "My phone cannot connect to a mobile network",
    "content": "About 2 weeks ago while I was using my phone, it suddenly disconnected from my mobile network, upon restarting it, the problem refused to go away, and as such I powered off the phone or 5 minutes and it reconnected again. Next time this happened, the phone refused to reconnect to the network for a whole week, no matter what I did, and now about last week it disconnected from the network and refuses to connect.\nStrangely enough, only the mobile network is affected, I do not know what to do, I even called my carrier and asked them about this and the only thing they told me is that I have to check the phones settings, which didn't help.",
