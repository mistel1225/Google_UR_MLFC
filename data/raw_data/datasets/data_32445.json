    "title": "NO SOUND THROUGH MY USB C CONNECTED EARBUDS!!! HELP!",
    "content": "Despite working previously, my Pixel 3 will no longer play audio from any source when I'm using wired headphones. I've tried using both the headphones that came with the phone, as well as my own headsets that I plug in via the dongle, but the sound still plays from the speakers as though nothing is plugged into the phone. I just don't understand why its not recognizing my headphones...\n\nThe port still works for charging the device, so after multiple device resets and tests I just don't know what to do!!! My device is only a month old! The port looks clean and undamaged. There is nothing wrong with the headphones or the dongle because I never used the USB C earbuds that came with the phone until now where I'm having this problem. I have seen some suggestions with disabling Google assistant (something of that sort. But I use it all the time and idk how to even disable it). \n\nSo HELP!",
