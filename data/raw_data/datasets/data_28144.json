    "content": "I use The Weather Channel app for my weather updates. I want to remove the AccuWeather provided temperature from my lock screen, but can't figure out a way to do so. See screenshot: I want the cloud icon and 55F, just below the time, removed from this screen, as I already get weather info from the Weather Channel app (see banner lower on screen). Note: I use the Nova Launcher. Also, I have just updated to Android 10. Any ideas? Thank you.",
