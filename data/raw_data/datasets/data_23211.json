    "content": "I live in an unsupported country (New Zealand), bought a Google Pixel 4 from Australia. Phone is great overall but the camera app suddenly got very choppy and video has constant frame drops in different situations. There is a very apparent glow coming from the bottom of the display when the screen is fully black. Very irritating when watching videos or movies during dark scenes. I'm just wondering if I would be eligible for a warranty repair or replacement as I live in an unsupported country.",
