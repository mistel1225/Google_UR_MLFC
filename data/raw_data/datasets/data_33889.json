    "content": "Where to begin? Since a few weeks ago, my Pixel will crash and restart by itself; my Bluetooth will randomly stop working; camera will crash; and my Outlook app crashes too.  I've had the phone for just over a year.  The battery lasts barely 12 hours and I'm not on it all day (I work) and I charge it every night.  I've tried a factory reset (hard reset) and only 45% of storage is used.  The phone is not yet paid off, help me.",
