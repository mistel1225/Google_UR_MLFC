    "title": "Getting the \"Couldn't process fingerprint\" message for the past couple of months. Pixel 2.",
    "content": "For the past two months or so I have been having a problem with the fingerprint sensor on my Pixel 2. When trying to use the sensor I get the \"Couldn't process fingerprint\" message. When this happens the only thing that will fix it is to restart the phone, so it seems there's nothing wrong with the hardware. \n\nYes, I have reset my fingerprints, and yes I have done a factory reset. I have also removed SwiftKey as it seems to have a bit of a reputation for interfering with some hardware.\n\nI'm not too sure what do to next. I use OTPs extensively so the fingerprint reader is kind of a must for me, but restarting my phone several times a day doesn't seem like a reasonable solution.",
