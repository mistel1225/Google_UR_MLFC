    "content": "Since the last update my Pixel 5 suddenly stops charging in the middle of the night. Sometime I wake up with just 52%. \n\nIt shows as if it's being charged but actually isn't receiving any \"juice\".\n\nIn my car wireless charger, both from Xiaomi, it stops charging after 1 minute. It's not a problem of the chargers. \n\nFix this ASAP, please! It's really annoying.",
