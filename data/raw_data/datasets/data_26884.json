    "title": "Notification volume increases when game is open",
    "content": "When I'm playing any game on my Pixel 3, the volume of notification sounds are significantly louder than what the volume settings indicate. This only happens in games though, since the volume stays the same in other apps like Chrome or Facebook.\nMy system and apps are all up to date, I've tried turning off bluetooth, and restarting the phone. The only thing I haven't done yet is a factory reset, but I'd prefer to do that as a last resort, but my data is backed up if a reset becomes necessary . My phone is un-rooted and un-modified. I tried searching online for a solution, but the only answer I found was to turn off Dolby Atmos for gaming, but that only applies to the Galaxy S10 series.\nAnyone else have this issue? Any help would be appreciated.",
