After updating to Android 11 the touch sensitivity of my phone got worsen and now the centre part of the touch screen from navigation button to to top of the screen does not work. But sometimes it a sensitivity comes and I can use the phone normally. And afterwards again the issue starts. This is happening everyday now after Android 11 update..
