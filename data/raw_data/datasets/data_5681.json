    "title": "Call volume on Google Pixel 3A is too loud, and it doesn't respond to the slider or buttons.",
    "content": "The volume is so loud that the phone basically sounds like it's on speaker phone, and it doesn't get louder or softer when I change the volume settings. I have tried changing them on the call volume slider, on the call volume slider in Settings, and with the volume buttons.\nI haven't tried a factory reset, but I have looked for hearing aid compatibility in settings because I saw that turning off hearing aid compatibility helped some people. However, I did not see an on/off option; it was just an option to connect to a hearing aid. \nI have also tried turning the volume all the way up and all the way down, but that didn't change anything.",
