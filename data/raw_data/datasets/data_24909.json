    "content": "Whenever the on screen volume starts showing up out of nowhere, I disconnect my Bluetooth headphones and it stops doing it. I'm assuming it's something with the connection. Ideally I want to fix it completely, if not I want to find a way to remove the icon from popping up on screen. This way even if it keeps messing up. It doesn't show up on screen.",
