    "content": "I have recently had to have my pixel 1 replaced under warrantee. Before I returned the phone, I backed it up to the cloud (google drive). I know that the backup worked because I had already reset it and successfully restored from the backup once before returning it. I now have my new phone and when I attempt to restore it from the cloud backup as I set it up, I am told there is no backup. \n\nHow can this be? I haven't deleted anything from my google drive since backing it up. Any help would be greatly appreciated!",
