    "content": "My brand new Pixel 4 XL is spontaneously displaying a random, blurry image on the lock screen. I've had t about a month.  It started right after I bought it and has happened 4 times.  Two of the images were badly blurred faces.  The other two were too blurry to identify at all. This is totally unprompted - ie, not connected to incoming calls, etc.  The image disappears once I unlock.",
