    "content": "I've used pixel 4 XL for several months now, and today I met my big brother who is 2 years older than me. What really shocked me was my phone instantly unlocked by my brother as it recognized his face as mine. \n\nAs I described we're even not an identical twin and yes we look like brother but we completely don't look like twin.\n\nOther face recognizing solutions like windows hello or IPhone's Face ID never mistake us for each other. I think this is huge problem, and wonder if there's anyone who experienced the same issue.",
