    "content": "Hello :)\n\nGreetings to all !\n\nNow, why at all should i buy a pixel 4 if it's just meant for a bigger camera upgrade ? SD 855 is a wiser choice as 855+ is almost applicable for gamers round the corner. Agreed üëç \n\nBut, what about the motion sense feature which gets unlocked even while we're asleep ? Eh üëÄ \n\nCome on amigo you should've provided a powerful security system alongside the motion sense if this is the case. I mean am I not really speaking something which should be a safer tool for us ?\n\nComing to the battery life, when there are OEMs who manufacture phones with 4k mAh, why not google after its 3 successful predecessors üôÑ Still going back to the past with 2.7k mAh battery health ?\n\nWhy have you left the epic 3.5mm jack yet again this time ':( ? Hopefully expecting it for G 4a :)\n\nVerdict : Request Google to push an upgrade that really acts as a safety measure to us against the motion sensor which wakes up even during sleep. \n\nHope Google is updated for the name it owns :-)",
