    "content": "Phone refuses to get on LTE or 4g, unless O reboot. Eventually it goes back to 3g only. I've lived in the same spot downtown Portland for five years and never had an issue with Sprint. The phone simply refuses to be on anything but 3G making it very hard to use. Rebooting temporarily fixes it. This started since last week's Android update. Also there is no option to enable or disable 4G and LTE anymore in settings, there used to be but now it is gone.",
