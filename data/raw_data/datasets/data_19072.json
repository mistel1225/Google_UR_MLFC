    "content": "Hello everyone! A new phone, after installing Android 10's July 2020 update, it takes a lot of time to charge my device (5-10 hours to get 70-100%) via original adapter Type-C to Type-C.  \nAny advices? I ve been through several hard reboots and still the same situation, I don't really want to go for a hard reset. Thanks",
