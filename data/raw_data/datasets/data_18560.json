    "content": "Nothing because I obviously need android for dummies, with all these apps and secret apps and downloads, and not having the option to close or uninstall apps.   Having my phone accessible to hackers,  among many other things. Constantly having to check the last time apps have been used. Passwords,  emails ect... this is more complicated than a computer. I have a manual, that doesn't explain a damn thing.   Please fix all these issues.  This is ridiculous,  I have been hacked. Reset my phone and then again see new installed apps.",
