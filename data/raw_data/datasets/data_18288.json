    "content": "My Pixel 3XL rings once and drops the call. If I clear the phone app cache it will work normally until there is about 150+MB in the cache, then it reverts to dropping incoming calls. I am having to clear the cache a couple of times per week. I have applied all available updates and all other functions seem to be working properly.",
