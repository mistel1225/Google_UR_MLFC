    "content": "My Pixel 2 XL updated to Android 10 couple of days ago. Here are the issues that I encountered:\n\nExtremely slow on seeing the picture right after it's been captured using the Camera app and the Google Photo app.\nCamera app starting up quite slowly sometimes.\nYouTube video and audio both got frozen for a second while being played. At least two or three times per video.\nThe loading time for posting a video on Instagram got way too long, the app would crash sometimes.\nUnable to download apps on Google Play. Google Play always crashed when the download started.\nNo sound on incoming calls. Couldn't hear anything from incoming calls. (Tested calling in & out on my other phone, I can confirm that only happens on my Pixel 2 XL with Android 10) \n\nThis Android update is turning my Pixel 2 to almost a brick. How can I downgrade to 9? Lol\n\nWhat other issues are you guys facing?",
