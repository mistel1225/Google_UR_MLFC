    "content": "I've switched off and on my device numerous times. Remove and inserted sim card too. Tried changing network to 2G, switching off, setting it back to 3G/LTE but nothing seems to work. This happened right after I got this June 5 security patch update. I mean even time there is an update, there comes a new issue with this device. I seriously think sometimes why on Earth have I spent a fortune on this phone just to be anxious and restless about it. That's it.",
