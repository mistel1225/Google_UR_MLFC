    "content": "I am trying to return my Pixel 4Xl. As of November 1st I was still well within the 15 day return period. I never received the return option on order page, so I called for assistance. They said they were having trouble creating the return label and that my request had to be escalated. \n\nFast forward 2 whole weeks and I still haven't gotten a return label. I've called multiple times and they can't seem to figure out how to issue a label. \n\nAny thoughts on how to move forward? \nI've never had a bad experience with Google support up until now, but this has been terrible.",
