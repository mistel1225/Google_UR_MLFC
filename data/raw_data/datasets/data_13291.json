    "title": "IMEI number doesnÂ¡t belong to my Pixel",
    "content": "I got my Pixel 3XL listed as NEW on a website that imports Phones from the US to Spain, When I opened the box and checked the IMEI both matched (the one in the settings and the one on the box), but when I search it on the google website it says it's a pixel 3 white Instead of a Pixel 3 XL Black (the one I have).\nThe sticky note on the box does say Pixel 3 XL black with the correct IMEI, the phone is also displaying that number, but in many websites it says that it's a Pixel 3 White.\n\nOther than that My Pixel's power button doesn't feel as clicky as my Pixel 3a, the Battery seems to darin way faster and I would like to know wheter my pixel is still water proof or not.\n\nThank you <3,\nChali",
