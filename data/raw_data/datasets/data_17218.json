    "content": "As long as I can remember, my Pixel 4 XL disconnects from my car's Bluetooth once I turn the screen on if my phone is in power save mode. Not when I turn the screen off, but once I turn it off. I never had this issue on my Pixel 2 XL. The issue happens only when in battery save mode and at any battery level. I factory reset my phone two months ago and that did not solve the issue. I also went and allowed no battery restrictions on the system Bluetooth app. It is really starting to drive me nuts because sometimes it just does not reconnect to my Bluetooth.",
