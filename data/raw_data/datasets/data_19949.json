    "content": "When I do a \"Hey Google, play Dark on chromecast\"\n\nI get a \"Sure, Dark from Netflix.  Playing on Living Room TV...\"\n\nHowever, nothing actually happens.\n\nIn an attempt to resolve this I have:\n-restarted the Chromecast, Phone, and network devices.\n-Turned off \"Tap to Translate\" in Google Translate.  (I had recently enabled this feature, but believe it is unrelated)\n-unlinked Netflix, and performed a factory reset of the Chromecast.  And used the Pixel 4 to setup the Chromecast again.\n\nThis used to work flawlessly, but appears to have stopped working after one of the Phone Software updates.",
