    "content": "My phone went from working completely fine to being completely dead overnight. It won't turn on or charge and is completely nonresponsive.\n\nI went through all the troubleshooting steps (holding power button down for 30 seconds, pressing power and volume down buttons simultaneously--nothing has worked) and then brought it to a uBreakiFix location. They weren't able to repair it, and they said they had two other Pixels brought in on the same day with the same problem. They wonder if the issue might be related to the March software update, which at the least has clearly caused all kinds of issues for many people on this forum. \n\nThe estimated cost of repair is so much that it's probably better if I just put that toward getting a new phone. I'm mostly posting here to say that this seems to be a far more prevalent problem with Google products than other brands and I probably will end up switching brands. This is by far the worst experience I've had with a company in terms of responding to an issue that doesn't seem to be the fault of user error.",
