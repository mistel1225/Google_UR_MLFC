    "content": "I have created a document on Google Docs and I want Google Text to Speech to read it back to me on my Google Pixel device. However when I open the document and select the Text to Speech icon, Google reads everything on the screen EXCEPT the text in the document, so for example it reads out the document name and the colour of the text it even reads out every character on the keyboard, noneof which I am interested in hearing; basically it reads out everything except the text in the document which is infuriating. Why won't it just read the text?",
