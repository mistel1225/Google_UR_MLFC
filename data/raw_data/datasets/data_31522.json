    "content": "For the first month of use on the pixel 3, i would go for 8.5 hours on light use and battery would get to about 65%.\n\nFor the last 5 months i will go the same time period and the battery would be completely dead, even last night my battery was on 45% and i woke up in the morning to it being dead.\n\nI have tried factory resets and all battery saving tips to no avail. Also the charger post is now extremely difficult to get it to recognize a charger in it.",
