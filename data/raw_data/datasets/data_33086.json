    "content": "I have noticed that when I am in DnD and receive a text message I do not get a sound notification. The second text does trigger the sound notification. I am not certain that it is only while DnD is active, though I think it is.\nI am using the Pixel 3 on Google Fi, have the latest security updates, and am using a custom sound for the message tone. \nAny ideas?",
