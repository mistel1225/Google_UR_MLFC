    "content": "When I had Google Fi, the mobile hotspot on my pixel 2 worked just fine. As soon as I switched to Verizon (... Verizon definitely has mobile hotspot... Worked on my iPhones before I made the switch to pixel) the hotspot feature no longer works. When I switch it on, it turns itself back off after a couple seconds. I figured this would be fixed or addressed by now (this started happening months ago), but I haven't heard anything about it and it still doesn't work. What's up with this?",
