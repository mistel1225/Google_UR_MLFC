    "content": " Having a bag with squarish animations on Pixel 3a while opening any application. This problem started after update on android 10. I noticed it after December patch. I'd like to notice that's better of changing something in new update on android 10 to fix it, because some of my friends with Pixel 3a have this problem and suffer from bad performance. So, that's why we rather to get new update than we and some other people who notice that make phone replacement. So, you can see video on YouTube showing the same squarish animations on Pixel 3a XL (and the guy even doesn't notice anything wrong haha). Time code is 3:44 - 3:56  https://youtu.be/DxhgUcmDpFM  \nI'm also having the same issue with Pixel XL, so it's not an only a problem on p3a models, but the issue with android 10. I'd like also to have an advice for this.\nI'd pin video, but idk how",
