    "title": "Pixel 4 XL; other party sounds like a robot. Possible root cause discovered.",
    "content": "If you find yourself in a phone call with someone where they may for the entire call sound like a robot or it may alternate between sounding normal and then sounding like a robot.\n\nBoth you and the other party are probably communicating over Wi-Fi calling.\n\nThe other party needs to adjust some settings on their router to resolve this issue. Specific to my issue, the other party had a router I configured.\n\nBy default a fresh install of pfSense will put an automatic setting in the firewall for ISAKMP UDP Port 500. DISABLE IT. That's it.\n\nThe robotic call quality I believe is caused by the router dropping UDP packets when dealing with two WiFi callers. Good luck to you all.",
