    "content": "I have a pixel 3xl which I received recently as a replacement for another faulty pixel 3xl.\nOnly had it for a few days before noticing that it randomly shuts down but also the GPS connection is weird. It can locate me when stationary but doesn't track properly. Location jumps all over the place and I can't get directions on Google maps or a history on strava.\nContacted Google help and tried all their suggestions but nothing worked. They said theybwpuld organise a replacement and then told me they couldn't.  For the last 2 week's I keep getting told it idbwith a \"specialist\" team and they appreciate my patience. Does anyone have advice or contact details if anyone in Google uk who can actually do something? The scripted responses I occasionally receive are useless and annoying. I don't understand why they don't just replace but I'm also not sure if I want another as so far it looks like these phones just don't work",
