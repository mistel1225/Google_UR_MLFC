    "content": "What needs to be done with a pixel 3 before updating to a new Android version?\n\nMy first pixel 3 downloaded an update from Android 9 to 10 but would not reboot to a working phone - and could not access Recovery mode.\n\nPhone has been replaced with a refurbished device and I am informed that the device is now out of date.\n\nDon't want to end up with a second pixel 3 that could also end up non-functional.\n\nAny hints on clearing memory or some other procedure before I allow the update to download?",
