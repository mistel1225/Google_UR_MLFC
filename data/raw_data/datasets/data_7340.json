    "content": "So, before doing a factory reset, I made sure to back up the phone. The backup and syncs were successful. But, many of the SMS messages didn't make the 25 MB mark.\nTo me, that means that it wasn't successful. It should have at least told me that it didn't back everything up.\nin any event, is there per chance some other way of restoring the rest of the SMS messages? I'm on AT&t if that makes a difference.",
