    "content": "I have a Pixel 3xl and just updated to Android 11. I see that you can no longer take a screenshot by holding down the power button. I also read this can be done by selecting screenshot by swiping up from the bottom of the screen. However, all it shows me when I swipe up is my recently opened apps. The \"select\" and \"screenshot\" features that the update says should be there...are not there. How do I fix this?",
