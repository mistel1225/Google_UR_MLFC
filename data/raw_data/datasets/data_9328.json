    "title": "I cannot share my location on my apps (WhatsApp, telegram), it says my location sharing is disabled",
    "content": "I cannot share my location on my apps. And when it is that I try from Google Maps it says that my device is not permitted to share location. But I went through all the permissions and it is able to share location so I don't know why I keep receiving that message. I restarted my phone. I updated both WhatsApp and Telegram and Google Maps. I checked all my location sharing settings. I have enabled location accuracy and all the required location permissions and I'm still getting that message. The phone doesn't know how to locate where I am. Even when I press the fix button for the location sharing it doesn't do anything",
