    "title": "Pixel 4 XL speaker issues - robotic sounding callers",
    "content": "The last few times I have spoken to someone on my phone, they intermittently sound like a very tinny robot.  The time before last this only lasted maybe 10 seconds, but most recently the issue was present for most of the call.  I tried putting them on speaker but same issue.\n\nThere did seem to be some effect from me rotating my phone - moving it around, but that might have been coincidental.\n\nPhone is just over 1 year old and in very good condition.  No other issues until recently.\n\nThanks",
