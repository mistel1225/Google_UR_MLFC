    "content": "I have both a Pixel 2 phone and a Pixel Slate chrome tablet but when I go to my Google account it only shows 1 device which is sometimes the Pixel 2 and other times the Pixel Slate. This also means that when I try and install an app on my phone it sometimes says it's not compatible because it's being seen as the Pixel Slate tablet. Does anyone know how I could fix this, I signed out of my account and re-signed in on my phone but that didn't help but I don't think I can sign out of my tablet without doing a powerwash which means setting it all up again. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",
