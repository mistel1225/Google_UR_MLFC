    "content": "Two days following updating my Pixel 2a to Android 11, I was attempting to screen capture using the power button. When that didn't work any longer, I pressed the Vol keys randomly.  Now the phone is \"TALKING\" all the time stating every key or screen buttom pressed.  I MUST GET THIS TURNED OFF but do not know how or even what this mode is call or why it exists!  Help please.",
