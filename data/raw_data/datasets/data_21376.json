    "content": "Hi there!\n\nHello, soo best way to describe the issue is if you look at a fluorescent light it looks like it's flickering. That's what my screen occasionally does since I got my new Pixel 4 four days ago (I love it! But >n< !). I thought it would be a one-off but it has been enough that I'm bothered and posting here :(\n\nIts not constant and when it happens it stops when I\n - turn off the screen (put it to sleep)\n- adjust the brightness\n- wait it out\n - turning it off always solves it.\n\nIts happened the first night I got it :(\nAnd it occurs when im using chrome, Android Messages, or doing nothing...  Basically it can happen any time anywhere. Even right now.\n\nTouching the screen does intensify the shades of flicker (darker/brighter) when it is flickering\n\nAlso the color is changing slightly when it happens, so idt it is like intense process frame rate issues. Especially when im reading a text message. I also double checked and asked the family - and they see it too, so it's not my eyes!!\n\nI really like my new phone but im having a fairly lousy experience and would really like this to be resolved. \n\nThank you so much!",
