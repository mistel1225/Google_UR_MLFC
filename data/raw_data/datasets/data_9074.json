    "content": "I have a google pixel 2 XL, as of a day ago it has begun to turn off as soon as i place it on charge. I have tried numerous cables and charging blocks all in vain. Additionally I have booted in safe mode with no result and completed a factory reset also with no results. Are there any other fixes I can try or am I stuck in this position from now on? It charges just wont allow me to use it while it is charging. I have seen the other posts and they havent been answered or the solutions I have already tried hence I am asking again.",
