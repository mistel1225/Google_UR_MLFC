    "content": "Pixel 4a doesn't work on LG Smart TV and other OS other than via Chromecast as a mediator. \n\nI am saying that this restriction/limitation wasn't disclosed by Google in their product information page on Flipkart's website where they (Google) are selling Pixel 4a product in India. Therefore, this is an unfair means of trade and commerce which violates the provisions of Sec 5 and 6 of FTC Act in US. This may be a punishable offence.",
