    "content": "Started randomly today. Phone is fully charged with the original charger that came with the phone. Even in safe mode, if I lock the phone or let it lock automatically by sitting idle, the screen will not wake back up when the power button or fingerprint scanner is pressed. The only thing that makes it work is keeping it plugged in to the charger. I've tried using the always on display and that doesn't help it at all. I know other people have had this problem but I can't seem to find a fix for it",
