    "content": "My Pixel2 has been a bit cranky the past couple months. Had issues with the charging port, did all the tricks to finally get that  resolved. Then the screen was going black whenever I placed a call. I just cleaned the screen and proximity detector really well, seemed to work. Now, it's been shutting down whenever, with ample charge. Previously ,I'd wait a bit and restart, or plug in restart in a bit. This time, nothing's working. I get the Google sign, the spin, then it shuts down. a few times before that, the battery sign was blipping on the screen a few times, and it's nearly full. Any ideas or suggestions are appreciated.",
