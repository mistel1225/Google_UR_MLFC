    "content": "I am unable to stay in a text window, whenever I send or receive a text, I get kicked to the message apps overview screen where all my other texts are and I have to re-select the chat(both 1-on-1 and group). Sometime it even kicks me out to the home screen.\nIn essence, I can't send or receive texts in a continuous stream, rather after every incoming or outgoing text, i have to re-tap the convo and then I can type a reply.",
