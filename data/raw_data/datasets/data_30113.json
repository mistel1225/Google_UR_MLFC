    "title": "GPS Tracking (through apps) gives me different mileage since June 5th update.",
    "content": "I use MapMyWalk to track my runs.  I have noticed my speed has been quite a bit slower the last two weeks.  I was getting worried as my pace as drastically dropped.  I wasn't sure what was happening.  Then, I noticed a few days ago that my \"half-way\" landmark was not lining up anymore (I had to run a bit past it to reach half-way)\n\nI run various lengths, but most often will run 3.25 miles. I compared some of my recent runs and it appears that up until two weeks ago, where I would complete my 3.25 miles, now I am only at 3 miles. So, I am having to run an extra quarter mile.  \n\n I have ran some races the last few years and my tracking has always lined up fairly closely to the mileage of the race, so I am fairly confident that my mileage was correct before the latest update.\n\nNot sure what to try.  I did test out another app today and seemed to have the exact same mileage as MapMyWalk (although I did not try it while running).  Done the normal things - restart phone, turns GPS on/off, etc.  \n\nAny similar issues or ideas?  Can I undo the update?",
