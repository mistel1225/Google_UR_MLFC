    "content": "My pinch zoom stopped working a couple month ago and I've tried contacting Google support and finally was told that after the June update, Pinch zoom and double tap zoom is no longer a feature for \"ALL\" Google Pixel phones. \n\nFrom Google Map to Google map, pinch zoom does not work anywhere.\n\nIs that true?? Does all of your pinch zoom stopped working or Google just pull a pile of xxoo and tried to shut me up?",
