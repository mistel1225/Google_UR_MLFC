    "content": "My phone powers off and goes on a boot loop. However, if I plug in the charger, it boots on perfectly. I can even use the device, however after a few seconds after unplugging power it dies again. Initially, I speculated it's a battery issue, but first I tried to factory reset and it didn't help. After that, I moved back to Jan Security patch and the phone worked fine. However the problem came back this week, no I have not updated the phone but still it goes into bootloop. Currently I'm using the phone with AC adapter and it works perfectly fine. So is the a motherboard problem or a battery problem? Sadly, I stay in India which means there is no support for Pixel 4 XL here, so any help from the community would be really appreciated.",
