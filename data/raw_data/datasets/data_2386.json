    "content": "When I compose an email in Gmail on my new Pixel 4A 5G the default currency symbol is £.  I need to hold the £ key and select the € symbol every time I need to use euros in an email which is pretty much all the time!  My language is set to English (Ireland).  I have two keyboard languages installed:  Irish QWERTY and English (UK) QWERTY - there is no English (Ireland) keyboard option available.  If I select Irish Qwerty from within the app the currency defaults to € but the keyboard is set for Gaeilge which is not helpful if I want to write in English.  I usually have the keyboard set to English (UK) QWERTY which allows me write in English but the currency defaults to £!  This affects nearly everyone in Ireland!  The only solution is for google to make an English (Ireland) keyboard available.  Microsoft does this why not google?",
