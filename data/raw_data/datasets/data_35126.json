    "title": "Need to fix the proximity sensor on my Google Pixel 2xl frequently. Goes black and doesn't respond.",
    "content": "I try to make a call and the screen goes black and doesn't respond.  I can still talk on it, but can't turn on speakerphone, use the number pad or even open anything else.  I try to turn off by holding power button but it takes little bit before it will respond.  The only way get it to work again is by restarting my phone, then run a proximity sensor fix on the phone and then it will be work fine.  It may last a week, 2 weeks, 2 days, just until decides to quit.  I have had this problem for months and have been looking for a solution.  The only thing is running a proximity fix but I shouldn't have to keep doing this all the time.",
