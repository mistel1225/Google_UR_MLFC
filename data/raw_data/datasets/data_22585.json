    "content": "Ever since I upgraded to Android 10 I no longer hear a Call ended tone (if I'm on Vibrate) when the other person hangs up. If I turn the Ring volume up the smallest amount possible I hear the Call ended tone just fine. What's more is that if I'm using a bluetooth headset while on Vibrate I hear the Call ended tone. This only happens when I'm holding the phone up to my ear. I've talked to tech support and the issue persists even when booting in Safe Mode. \nI'm using a Pixel 2 with Android 10. I let the software keep all apps up to date. I even just performed a factory reset to see if that would fix the issue.",
