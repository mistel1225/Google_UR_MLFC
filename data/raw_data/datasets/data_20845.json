    "content": "Took a few photos while outside on my pixel 3a. Came back home and found that the HDR+ was still processing. I restarted the phone and now the photos have not been processed at all. The quality of these photos are much worse. Took a few test photos after and the HDR+ processing seems fine again. Is there a way I can fix the photos that haven't processed?",
