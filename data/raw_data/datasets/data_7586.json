    "content": "Hello,\n\nWe are developing an app that uses BLE Beacons to update data from a remote device.\n\nUsing an app like NRF Connect we can see the number of BT devices around. Where as other devices see 12-14 the pixel 3a sees only 2-3.\n\nI'm not sure I can roll back my device and definitely do not want to as permissions have changed so much in Android 11 that you HAVE to use a new device to ensure it works. \n\nPlease Please fix the issue.\n\nThanks Tim",
