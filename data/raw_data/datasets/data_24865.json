    "title": "CaptivePortalLogin keeps stopping since June security update",
    "content": "Since the June security update was installed on my Pixel 2, I have been unable to use public WiFi networks that require a signin page - the response from the phone is \"CaptivePortalLogin keeps stopping\". When I do an Internet search for this problem, I see other users complaining of the same problem after installing the June update. e.g.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/bzdfy3/captiveportallogin_keeps_stopping/\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/bz4rht/captive_portal_login_keeps_stopping/\n\nI did a reset on the phone and that didn't fix it, so I'd say it's Google's screwup...\n\nNick",
