    "content": "I uninstalled and reinstalled Google Earth and have called or texted customer support several times.  I have friends who have the identical Pixel XL phone and their Google Earth works fine.  I like my Pixel phone and was planning to buy a new one when they come out in October, but having a popular Google Ap like Earth not work on a Google phone is very disturbing to me.",
