    "content": "Hello,\n\nI tried to make a whatsapp call but I got the error below:\n\n\"Couldn't place call. Make sure your phone has an internet connection and try again\"\n\nI am sure that my internet connection is working and have tried turning on and off my mobile data, using wi-fi instead of my mobile data and reboot many times but nothing works. In fact, the intended recipient of my call saw my missed call but can't pick up the call. I would appreciate if anyone can let me know what's the solution to this issue. My phone is a Google pixel 3 and my android version is 9.\n\nThanks,\nStanley",
