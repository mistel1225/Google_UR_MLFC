    "content": "Hi\n\nI just upgraded from a Samsung S8 to the Pixel 4, but transferring my pictures over has, for some reason, changed all the dates on the pictures. Some are okay, but some have picked up the date/time that I transferred on. Some have just completely random dates now - there are pictures that were taken within minutes of  each other that are now in my phone as being taken months apart.\n\nDoes anyone know how to go through and amend the dates, or redo it so they transfer with the correct dates?\n\nMany thanks\n\nSteve",
