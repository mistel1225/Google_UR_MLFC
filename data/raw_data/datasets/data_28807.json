    "content": "Hi there, question; since this morning in my Pixel 3 taskbar there suddenly is an App (NOS) and it has a lightning icon in it.\nIf i want to remove it (long press) it just says \"install\" and \"app info\".\nI got on te phone with Google support and they adviced me to go to the Play Store and remove it from there. \nI told him that i didn't install it, so i can't remove it from there either.\nHe told me that if that didn't work, i need to contact the app developer. \nIs there anyone who has had this and know show to fix it?\nAnd is there anyone who knows what the lightning icon in the NOS icon means?\nScreenshot is added.\nRegards",
