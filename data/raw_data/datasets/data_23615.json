    "content": "Hi, I have been using the Barclays Mobile Banking App for contactless payments for well over a year with no issues. All of a sudden, payments are being declined at the merchants side. \nThe app gives a payments sent notification but the merchant terminal then declines.\nI have been in contact with Barclays and they have no issues. The debit card for the account works fine. I have reinstalled the app a number of times and ensured all setting are correct. \n\nI have been having this problem for a couple of weeks now. any advice?\nI would switch to Google Pay but Barclays dont support Android.\n\nthanks",
