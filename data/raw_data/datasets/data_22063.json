    "content": "So I recently just upgraded to Android 10, and now all of a sudden messenger, Facebook, snapchat, pretty much all the major messaging apps outside of the preinstalled sms app can only see my camera roll, cant see my downloads or any other folder. Just my camera roll, and considering I don't use the camera itself all that often that means these apps can only see like 10 photos, anyone have any suggestions on how to fix this?",
