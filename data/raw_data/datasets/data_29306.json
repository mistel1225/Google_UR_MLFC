    "content": "I'm simply trying to have Android open links to directions in citymapper Google assistant open citymapper when I ask it to take me somewhere. I have searched everywhere and found that in 2016 people were having the reverse problem: https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/58u8lq/how_do_you_control_the_default_apps_google/\n\n\nI also found an article by Google: https://support.google.com/waze/answer/6291190?hl=en detailing the process for getting Waze as the default. I have tried the steps in this article for citymapper and they did not work. \n\nCurrently I have maps set as \"do not open supported\" links under my phone settings, and this at least allows me to choose citymapper when I open a link for directions in other apps - for example, in Yelp. \n\nI was wondering how I would:\n1) Set citymapper as my default navigation app so I don't have to keep selecting it in apps like Yelp when I want directions\n\n2) Set citymapper as my default for Google assistant\n\nI'm not sure if this is an issue with citymapper, my own incompetence, or with Android/Google refusing to let competing apps be the default (I really hope it isn't this one) but any help would be greatly appreciated!",
