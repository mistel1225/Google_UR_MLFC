    "title": "Wifi hotspot not working Aug 2019 update",
    "content": "I have a Google Pixel 3 XL that I bought off Google.jp for use during work in Japan. I alternate countries and have been swapping sim cards without issue.\n\nI depend on my main phone providing wifi to all my portable devices as I go about my day. The device is about a few months old and I have had no issues with it. It was around the last few days that I started being unable to use the Pixel's wifi hotspot. I have followed the suggestions on this website, resetting my waypoint and connectivity settings to no avail.\n\nThe Pixel would display on activation that it is broadcasting wifi hotspot but no other device is able to detect it. Bluetooth tethering still works but its as imperfect solution as I have 4+ devices working off of its waypoint at any one time. I've even tried disabling security protocol but no waypoint was detected. Typing the waypoint information into my other devices, they are still unable to detect the Pixel's waypoint.\n\nThe only thing that has changed on my Pixel was the new update that was pushed to the device within the last few weeks.\n\nPlease help.",
