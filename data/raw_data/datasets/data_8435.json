    "title": "Pixel 4a no sim card detected",
    "content": "Hello, this phone is brand new and it stopped detecting my SIM card. I bought it from a private seller face to face, but it's brand new, it's supposed to have warranty. I took the plastics and ripped the seals off the cables on the phone's box. It would be insane for it not to have it, and it would be a first of all the products I've owned in my 38 years.\n\nI say this because I already saw some other suggested posts where \"diamond\" level agents have told customers to go back to their retailer, even if they bought it from private sellers on eBay. It shouldn't matter. It's still a new phone. It's production date is, quite literally, not over a year back.\n\nThe phone simply stops recognizing the SIM card at random points during the day. Usually I solved it by opening the tray and closing it, which is not normal. Then yesterday the phone didn't recognize the SIM at all, no matter what I did. The SIM card works with no issue on each and every other phone I've tested it on besides the Pixel 4a. \n\nI am only doing this post because I can't reach anyone in customer service in Google, which is pretty insane. No chat, no phone, no e-mail. \n\nPlease, help. This is a new phone and something is wrong with it. $349 may be nothing to some, but it is a lot of money to me. And I am apalled at having to resort to posting in a forum to get support for a smartphone. I've owned smartphones since the original iPhone, and this is a first. I understand COVID, but you can work this out from home. You really can. There's no excuse.",
