    "title": "I've just started getting notifications that \"messages is processing an incoming text\". Why?",
    "content": "Messages from certain contacts (all good friends I text w often) who are also (I think) all iPhone ppl, are suddenly triggering my pixel 2xl to send me a notification first saying \"messages is processing an incoming message\" or something just like that. It was only 1 person, now its 2. The alert can't be swiped away and it creates an annoying lag as half the time the message comes in and is trapped underneath the notification! I haven't changed anything in settings and neither of them have either. I have tons of iPhone contacts this doesn't happen with too though and even with these 2 ppl, it doesn't happen every time. Does anyone have this problem or even know what I'm talking about? It's only about a month old. The 2nd persons notifications just started today and I need this shut down before it's happening all the time with everyone.",
