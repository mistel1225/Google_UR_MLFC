    "content": "I just bought Pixel 3a XL phone. The only issue is that I cannot change the lock screen wallpaper from the default black (shows date and clock). I can change the style fonts.\n\nI have no issues changing the home screen wallpaper or style fonts using the same command page that asks if I want to change lock page, home page, or both. Using wallpaper that came on phone not 3rd party app. So if anyone else has this issue I would appreciate knowing how you fixed it?  \n\nPS I don't use a password etc. to unlock. I have searched other sites, and YouTube tutorials, but find no match for this issue on the 3a. Other than factory reset or take back (none in stock at Best Buy to do quick replacement plus not sure won't be on next phone).",
