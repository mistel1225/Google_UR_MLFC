    "content": "The issue of a buzzing speaker is known and I have returned my device to Google, repaired, and returned. Within 1 week my speakers are doing the buzzing cutting out again. The adaptive speaker update is useless and I am looking for a more permenant fix. Pressing the glass and back frame clears it momentarily. \n\nAny suggestions are helpful. I will be calling support in the next day or so.",
