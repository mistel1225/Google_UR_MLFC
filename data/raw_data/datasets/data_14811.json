    "title": "Getting support with actually getting a Pixel 4XL fixed/replaced",
    "content": "I asked and was accepted to receive a replacement phone after the 50% battery issue made my 4XL almost useless, as I am in the outback of Australia.\nI was told that Toll Group transport would pick it up, and I said \"I am 700 km from their office. They won't pick it up\". That was based on prior experience getting Toll to pick something up.\nOn the day they were to arrive, I was at the house all day. No appearance. No surprise. Same on 3 subsequent booked pick up days. Additionally, Toll rang me from Manila and asked to confirm whether the phone had been picked up. Toll had said it had been picked up. It hadn't and they hadn't been near my village so I didn't miss them.\nNow I'm dealing with a succession of \"teams\" fobbing me off with \"escalations\" of my problem.\nI eventually sent the phone by post to Expansys in Hong Kong using the same address the labels from Expansys and it has disappeared.\nAfter market support by Google appears non-existent, likewise the assistance from Expansys, since I am unable to make the point that I had advised them not to use Toll Group to get my phone to Expansys. Three separate emails refer to the fact that Toll would not pick it up.\nToll Group has more negative reviews online than any other transport company. They are liars. Google needs to protect itself and pick this ball up themselves, and maybe get one or two native English speakers in their \"support\" chain.",
