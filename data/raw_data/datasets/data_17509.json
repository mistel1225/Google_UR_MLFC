    "title": "Incomplete mp3 transfer from s8 to new pixel 3 plus",
    "content": "Recently purchased a Pixel 3 XL because, I'm sick of Samsung sloppy code and clumsy UI. I have thousands of mp3s on my Samsung's SD card. When I use the Samsung smart connect, it only transferred a portion of my mp3's. So I attempted to use the Google pixel system to grab the rest of them. When I access the SD card, for a split second you can see the missing titles but then they disappear, preventing me from selecting or transferring them. All of the music was purchased legitimately or ripped from CDs I personally own. DRM is not an issue here. So far I haven't been able to find any relevant help on my own in the forums. Any assistance would be greatly appreciated as, aside from the single issue I am beyond happy with everything the pixel has to offer at this point.",
