    "title": "Pixel Original Photos count against Storage Quota",
    "content": "I have chatted with 6 different customer support agents from Drive & Pixel team and no one was able to support, so hoping someone here is able to :)\nI am a Pixel 2 owner and I have the promotion active that Photos & Videos taken with the Pixel and uploaded from the Pixel should not use up the Storage Quota I have.\nUntil 2020, before Drive and Photos split, the older Photos I have from 2018/2019 show up in my Drive in original size however showing 0 bytes of Storage Space.\nHowever, now, Google Photos shows using up to 7 GB of my storage quota. \nWho can advice how to manage this and how to ensure that the photos while kept in Original size, and not lowered to High Quality, still do not use up storage space as per the active Promotion.\n\nI have read and already tried the other suggestions from the forum and have talked to 6 agents, no one seems to be able to support, and specifically Google Photos does not have a dedicated Customer Support team, so I am running out of ideas.\n\nThanks a lot in advance for any answers to this!",
