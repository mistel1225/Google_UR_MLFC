    "title": "Pixel 3 XL won't connect to WiFi or detect SIM after reboot",
    "content": "For around a year, every time my phone is turned off/rebooted, it \"can't detect\" the SIM card anymore once it's turned back on. Although, when I check SIM status, it still sees basic details. It just says it's disconnected. Additionally, my phone won't connect to WiFi anymore when this happens which makes it difficult to try troubleshooting by updating system software or creating a backup (I know I could back up on my laptop, but I would really prefer not to) and factory resetting my phone. \n\nI know that it's not a SIM issue because I've tried the SIM in other phones and other SIMs in my phone with the same result. \n\nI have gotten it to work again a few times before with combinations of turning off and on, removing and reinserting the SIM card, and factory resetting. But I would like a long term solution. Since every time I turn my phone off, it usually guarantees I'll spend about an hour trying to fix the issue. This also leads me to avoid turning off my phone which I don't think is healthy for it in the long run. \n\nI've tried a lot of things that have been suggested to me and even went through the pixel phone support chat where I ultimately was suggested to factory reset my phone. I really don't want to have to factory reset my phone every time it turns off.",
