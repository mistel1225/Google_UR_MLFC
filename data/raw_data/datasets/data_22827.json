    "content": "Hi \n\nNFC has stopped working. \nWireless charging has stopped working. \n\nBack of the phone is coming off. I can see into the phone through the small gap. The glue keeps coming off here and there. I suspect its to do with the phone overheating though I'm not sure.   \n\nAlso the battery cuts out between 6-20 percent.\n\n\nPlease help.",
