    "content": "About 8-9/10 when I try to use my assistant it just freezes, as you know when assistant works properly it opens with a animation of a rainbow coloured outline around the display, a little white light shining from the bottom to the top, and you are greeted with the verbal message \"Hi! How can I help you?\". However most of the time now when I try to open my assistant whether it be through the squeeze feature or the corner swipe, the assistant triggers the rainbow animation and little white light, but no greeting, and when this happens it just doesn't work at all, you cannot ask it anything, and it just stays there frozen until you try again, I only started having this issue when I updated to android 11, is there a way to fix it?",
