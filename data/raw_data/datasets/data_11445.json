    "content": "Hello,\nmy problem started with \"Canâ€™t load Android System\". I tried this: https://drive.google.com/file/d/18ZWAxd3qa1p61ZtFhbz-fGr66FJCqviM/view\nbut when I try to start \"Recovery mode\" the Pixel rebooted. So I run Factory data reset and after reboot there is Fastboot mode with green Android on back and green \"Start\", but with error \"ERROR: Slot Unbootable: Load Error\". When I try \"Recovery mode\" there is black screen for a second and I am back in Fastboot mode. Sometimes there is: \"ERROR: BootLinux Failed: Not started\"\n\nWhen the Pixel is connected to USB and I run \"fastboot devices\" I can see \"HT82.... fastboot\"\n\nThank you for your reply.\n\nMichal",
