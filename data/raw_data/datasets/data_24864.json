    "content": "I've looked in here to see if anyone else is having this problem but haven't seen anything. Basically the title says it all. The battery generally lasts a long time, but I'm noticing when it gets down to about 20 or 25% the battery just dies extremely quickly (less than a minute, maybe more) even with battery saver on. I'm not sure if this is a battery issue or a software issue, possibly not showing the correct % in my notification bar. I've done a factory reset on the phone, but that didn't fix it. Anyone also experiencing this?\n\nSorry for any typos, posting from mobile.",
