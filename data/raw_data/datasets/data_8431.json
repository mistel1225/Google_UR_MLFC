    "content": "Hello,\n\nI've been having an issue where my Pixel 4 XL disconnects from my car's Bluetooth when I play audio (e.g. Spotify or YouTube). Calls also no longer work over my car's Bluetooth. My phone can connect to my car's Bluetooth just fine when no audio playback or call is taking place, but right when I try to do one of those things, it disconnects.\n\nI've already tried unpairing my phone from my car (forget device) and repairing it. No luck. This seems to have been caused by the January 2021 Android 11 update. Is anyone else experiencing this issue? Or is it perhaps a known issue that the January 2021 update is causing this issue?\n\nThank you.",
