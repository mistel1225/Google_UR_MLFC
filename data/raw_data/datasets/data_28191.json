    "content": "Hi,\n\nAfter updating Pixel 2 phone to Android 10 and updating the google photos app to the recent version, the photos are not showing up in the app. However, the photos can be accessed via file manager. But the file manager strangely stores the photos in different folders with date which is a bit irritating to check individual photos as the thumbnails are not visible from the root folder. Photos marked as favorite are also not visible as a separate album in google photos app. Has anyone able to resolve this issue or a workaround for this?\nPS: None of the photos are synced to cloud. \nThanks for any response",
