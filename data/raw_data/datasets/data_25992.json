    "content": "Hello,\n\nI have been having a bug since the upgrade to Andriod 10 on my Pixel 3 and I cannot get it resolved.\n\nWhen I connect to the wifi network at my work (public open network at a public school) the phone will reboot.  It did not have this issue when I was on Android 9, but since the update, every time I connect my phone, or it auto connects as an open network, my phone reboots.\n\nI have connected while in safe-mode, and have the same issue of the reboot.  I also have tried factory resets and replacement phones.  I know other Pixel users have had this issue at my work, but other Android devices are fine.  \n\nAre there settings I can change on my end to prevent the reboot or is this just something I have to live with as part of Android 10?\n\nThank you,\n\nKevin",
