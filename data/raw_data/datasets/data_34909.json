    "content": "I would like to upload an entire folder from my phone's internal storage to my google drive. When I use the 'files' app, I select the folder and the options give are copy to, move to, compress, etc. When I go to my Drive app and tap add, it will not allow me to add an entire folder of documents, only each document individually. Surely there is a way to do this without installing a 3rd party app?",
