    "title": "Pixel 2 - Android 10: Lock screen will not turn off after notification or checking time.",
    "content": "I believe this has only happened since I've updated my Pixel 2 to Android 10, but currently I am unable to figure out why my locked screen refuses to turn off after a few moments of getting a notification or when I manually check the time.\n\nI am aware of this thread: https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/13641689?hl=en, but it is not working for me. I already had those settings set to how they were before: \"Always on: Slider is off\", \"Double-tap to check phone: Slider is on\", \"Lift to check phone: Slider is off\", \"New notifications: Slider is on.\"\n\nI have checked to see if it is linked to the \"Screen timeout\" setting, but is not (IE: tested with 15 second timeout but it still remains on.\n\nMy phone already has a miserable battery and this glitch is making things far worse. I WANT to see notifications on my lock screen, so I'd really prefer not to remove it all completely to attempt to get around this.\n\nThanks for any help.",
