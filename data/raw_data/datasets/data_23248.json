    "title": "Pixel II XL Bluetooth issues",
    "content": "For the last 4 months, I have been having problems with my bluetooth connection from my Pixel II XL to my 2011 BMW 3 series.  I keep the operating system up to date and am currently on 9.  As odd as this sounds, I think that my phone corrupted my car's bluetooth system somehow in its two way communication.  My car first would drop the connection 10-30sec into playing a song with an unpleasant high pitch beep.  Then overnight, my car would forget all phones connected, including my wife's phone.  I had the car battery replaced, and had the whole communication system reprogrammed in the car.  But the issue was still there.  BMW is quoting $1,400 to replace the whole communication system;  but, I have a sneaky feeling that this will not fix the problem and that the phone has something to do with this.  As you can imagine, I do not want to spend $1,400 that I won't be able to get back, only to find out that there either is a problem with the phone or that the phone somehow corrupted the bluetooth in my car.  I tried all of the standard steps in the forum many times over.  Also, my phone pairs perfectly with my wife's 2016 BMW so I think it is a mismatch between the older car system and my Pixel II XL.",
