    "content": "Hi transferred all my photos and videos to my Google One account about a week ago before the issue popped up. I bought the 100 GB plan. So I had no photos or video on my phone. then yesterday my phone started saying that it is running out of space in that it will not operate fully. Within that message it says that I'm storing 84 GB of photos, yeah when I go into the storage section under settings it only showed a picture to and said that I was using less than 100 megabytes for photo storage. It seems as though my phone is counting the photos that are being stored on the cloud as being stored on my actual phone, which shouldn't be the case because I purposely bought the storage for the photos to be transferred over using the smart storage manager. \n\nwhy is it counting the photos that I have in the cloud as if they were stored onto the phone?",
