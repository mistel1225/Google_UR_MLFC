    "content": "Prior to a few weeks ago when using navigation and a phone call came in and was accepted the nav map would remain full screen and I would get a phone dot on the side of the screen. Now the phone call screen overlays the nav map completely. Any idea why this is happening (app update?) and is there a way to get the old behavior back?",
