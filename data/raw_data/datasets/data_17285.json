    "content": "Hi,\n\nI want to put some screentime limits on my son's android phone.  But he tells me that the native app for doing this only allows him to have one account on the phone and he needs access to his school account (which is on an exchange server) and his gmail account (personal).  I have tried to put apps like digital well being but he was able to stop it in the background from recording so it didn't help.\n\nCan someone please help me? Just want to restrict the time he spends on certain apps without monitoring what he is doing.  And he needs to have access to both accounts.  He has a Google Pixel 3A phone.\n\nThanks",
