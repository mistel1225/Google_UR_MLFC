    "content": "Hey, guys, recently I upgrated to the version 11, but I got a problem on battery level and time setting. The battery level is always 100 percent, when the battery runs out, it shut down. So how can I fix the problem? When I turn on the device, the time is not correct, can't get the network time, two problems that I can't solve. Could any one please help me ?",
