    "content": "I have Google Lens suggestions enabled so that I can use the camera app to open QR code menus at restaurants. However, before the link will open, I'm promoted to enter the security pattern. This is annoying as the phone was already unlocked and half the time I lose the link or something resets after I enter the pattern. Is there a way to disable this?",
