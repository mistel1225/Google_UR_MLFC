    "content": "When I noticed that Google Pixel 3 took off the screenshot option from the power button, I was disgusted. Having that feature was a modern, quicker & efficient way to screenshot as opposed to pressing the volume down/power button, which Google is going backwards in convenience. Google Pixel informed me that user feedback is why they went that route. Well, if Google decided the read the numerous forums they would plainly see that a lot Pixel users are very upset by this. Google Pixel, please bring this feature back!",
