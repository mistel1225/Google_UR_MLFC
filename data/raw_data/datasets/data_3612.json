    "content": "Greetings,\n\nI've noticed a green vertical line on the left side of the screen appears sometimes. Essentially, if the screen is pressed hard on the lower left side of the screen, the line will appear and then disappear when I let go. Rarely it gets stuck and shows it continuously.\nCan anything be done about this? Surely it's covered by warranty.",
