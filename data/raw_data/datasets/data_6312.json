    "title": "Battery life has gone downhill on my Pixel 5 since the February update",
    "content": "I purchased two Pixel 5's back in January one for my Wife and one for myself. We both came from Pixel 3 XL's we instantly noticed how amazing the battery life was. 6 hours of screen on time and 1.75-2 days of charge. Then around the 2nd week of february we noticed the battery was hardly making a day anymore. We both haven't installed any new apps just the February monthly security patch.\n\nBelow is my battery back in January when I was showing a friend how amazing the battery life was.\n\n\n\nI will take screen shot the next time my battery is at 12%",
