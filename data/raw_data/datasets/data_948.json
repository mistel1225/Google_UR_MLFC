    "content": "My phone can't find my cars Uconnect device and it won't pop up. But it's showing me everything else that I'm able to connect too. I followed the instructions for connecting the device everything else is working fine. It's saying that my device isnt on or in range. However, I'm in the car and I made sure that my Bluetooth is on for both devices.",
