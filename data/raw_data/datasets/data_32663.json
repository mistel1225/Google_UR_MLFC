    "title": "Charging and USB Tethering Will Disconnect If Moved In The Wrong Place",
    "content": "I have been using my Pixel 2 XL for a year and a half now, and until very recently I had no problems with charging and USB tethering (I use USB tethering frequently as my 4G data is better than my ethernet).  However, since around January, charging and USB tethering have both been flimsy and unresponsive and I have to handle my cables delicately in order to avoid disconnecting randomly.  I first noticed it with my rapid charger that came packaged with the phone; if I moved the phone slightly it would stop charging and I would have to press it back in in order to make sure it wasn't working.  But I noticed this was also happening with two other USB-C cables I had.  And I've noticed that when I attempt to USB tether, I would plug my phone into my PC and it would start charging, but the option to USB tether wasn't available, and I would have to position the phone and cable in such a way that my phone that the option to tether would become available.  I'm not sure if this is a Pixel issue or if this is an issue with my phone's charging port.  If anyone knows any solutions or ways to fix this, please let me know.",
