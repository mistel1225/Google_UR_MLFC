    "content": "When pausing any given app, I receive error message \"can't pause [insert app name here], then the app will go into pause mode.  Also, at times I'll have to hit the pause button up to 10 times before the app will pause.  \n\nI don't ever have the app I'm trying to pause open, nor do I have my system overloaded with open apps or processes, and it doesn't matter if I'm in regular boot or safe mode.\n\nAny idea why this is?",
