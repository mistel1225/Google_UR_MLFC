    "content": "I just bought a (new) Pixel XL; mostly the phone seems great but the bluetooth range seems to be literally around 2 or 3 feet. The headset I am using I was using on my last phone (and the one before that) with no problems at all, and I could walk to different rooms without issue. If I set the Pixel down on the counter and take 1 step, I get static and sometimes it even disconnects.",
