    "content": "Hi guys.\n\nRecently, my friend gave me his Pixel 3a that he bought from Best Buy. Later, I found out that it's a Verizon model. When I tried to insert my SIM card, it says that the \"SIM card is not supported. Ask Verizon is this device can be unlocked. Tap here for contact details.\"\n\nI don't know what went wrong here. Verizon tech team told me they have unlocked my phone. But, until this day, I'm still unable to use any other SIM cards. \n\nDoes anyone else have the same problem?",
