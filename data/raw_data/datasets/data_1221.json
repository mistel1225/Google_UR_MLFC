    "content": "A few\n days ago myself and two friends did the small May 2021 security update. I have a Pixel 4 XL, and own of my friends has the same, the other a Pixel 5. \n\nSince then our otherwise reliable and solid battery life has dramatically decreased, even when the phone is not in use. We have monitored our phones during the last few days, and there is noticeable difference, to the point where we have to take a charger to work with us to ensure the battery doesn't drop to zero. \n\nHas anyone else experienced this same issue, and do you know of a way to fix it? Thanks.",
