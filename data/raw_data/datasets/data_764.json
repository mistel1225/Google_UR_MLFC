    "content": "I've factory reset my Pixel 4A. I am using the phone I need the data to be restored on. There is no 'old phone' so when I try restoring the data and it's sending a pin to me, I don't receive the pin because it thinks I have another phone? How to I get around this. I've attempted too many times now I have to wait two hours to try again. Please help. IDK what to do as I am a new Pixel user.",
