    "title": "I upgraded to a Google Pixel 4 XL, with Android 10, Sprint. The phone is constantly going to Roaming",
    "content": "Sprint customer service has tried 7 times to help me (all the standard software fixes, resets, reset mobile SIM, etc) but nothing works. They even fully replaced the phone with a new Pixel 4XL but it still occurs. They ask me demeaning questions like whether I'm in a rural area, or suggesting a tower is down. But, this occurs in urban centers, and the people I'm with (even wife on same Sprint plan) has full LTE while mine goes into Roaming. I have to restart the phone each time to get back into LTE. I'm at a loss, and considering complaining to Sprint once again in order to get a Samsung (I have only ever had Samsung smartphones, and now I'm realizing I made a massive error by trusting Google to make a usable device)",
