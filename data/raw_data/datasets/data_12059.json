    "title": "Home and back buttons stop to work in Android 11 with Pill Gesture Navigation",
    "content": "After updating Android to 11 with October 2020 security patch on my Pixel 3a XL the back and home buttons stops to work, using 2 buttons navigation bar, every time i switch from 2 apps using the slide gesture.\nI have to wait a randomic number of seconds until they turn to work. Reboot doesn't solve the problem. The problems occurs also in safe mode. Sometimes the buttons stops to work indefinitely and i have to long press the power button to reboot the phone.\n\nI have opened a bug request about, but are almost two weeks that someone from \"Android team support\" will contact me \"shortly\" but probably they forgot about me. Google support improves everyday, great! I'm not english so I don't know if the sarcasm is understandable, so I write it explicitly: I'm sarcastic and increasingly pi***d off by bad google support and total absence of attention to customer satisfaction.\n\nThe bug request is here and is attached a video which demonstrates the problem: https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/171369792\n\nAny type of help or light signal from google would be appreciated. As i wrote in the bug request, i cannot absolutely reset the phone.",
