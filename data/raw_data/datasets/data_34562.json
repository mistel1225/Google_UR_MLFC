    "title": "I recently did the recent security update now my 1st gen Pixel will no longer connect to wifi.",
    "content": "After February security update (done on evening of 2/6), I can't connect to wifi at work or home.  At work I thought it was just the network so didn't think much of it.  When I didn't connect to my home network, I realized there was a problem.  I have reset the modem/router, restarted the phone, toggled wifi and airplane mode on and off, toggled \"turn on wifi automatically\", reset wifi, mobile, bluetooth, etc.  I've done every possible thing to fix the problem that I could find online short of a factory reset...  Any advice?",
