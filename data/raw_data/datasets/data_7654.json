    "content": "I've set a routine to happen when I turn my alarm off. Great... No! Why can I not move the 'play the news' routine that seems to be stuck at the bottom?\n\n2 parts of my routine are play *radio station* on kitchen speaker and play the news. I want the news to play and complete first on my phone, then when that has finished, start playing the radio on the kitchen speaker. This currently doesn't happen as when I go into the kitchen part way through the news, the radio is already playing so I have to turn it off to hear continue to hear the news. \n\nI can not move the 'play the news' routine's and can not add another one after it. It is fixed as the last routine.",
