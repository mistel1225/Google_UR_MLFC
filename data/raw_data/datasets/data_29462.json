    "content": "Good evening, i've just purchased a google pixel 3 off ebay, and im wondering how to verify that's it's new. \n\nThe tamper tabs weren't broken, and the phone/accessories were all securely wrapped in the protective packaging. I also ran the imei on https://store.google.com/repair and it has warranty until feb 2020. Im wondering why it's not longer as ive only just purchased it? \n\nHow do i check the device hasn't been refurbished etc.\n\nmany thanks",
