    "content": "Hey. Was wondering if anyone would be able to help figure out why my screen app is using up so much power and my battery is draining so quickly. Also is that a regular power output for Android system. I find my battery percentage dropping too quickly and it's quite concerning because I do not have access to a charge outlet most of the day and this device is brand new\n\nEDIT: I should mention battery doesn't drop while idle only while using. Which is the most unusual part it can go from 80% to 70% in a matter of minutes not even an hour.\n\nEDIT: Take in mind I have every battery saving setting on. Adaptive brightness off. Constant battery saver. I'm always on survival mode with this battery. Honestly it's always a battle.",
