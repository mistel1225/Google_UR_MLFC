    "title": "Pixel Plays Randomly After Leaving Car",
    "content": "I will regularly listen to podcasts or Pandora on my Pixel through USB while driving (it's via Android Auto).  I shut my vehicle off, remove the Pixel from the USB cord and go about my way.\n\nAt a random point thereafter (I've tried timing it and get different intervals), my phone will pick up playing whatever I left off listening to.  This problem seems to be app agnostic as it will happen with PocketCast, Pandora, or anything else I'm randomly using.\n\nIs there maybe a setting I'm missing? Is this a known bug?  It's more of an annoyance than a problem, but definitely something that shouldn't be happening.\n\nAny help would be appreciated.",
