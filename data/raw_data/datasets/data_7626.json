    "content": "I am using gesture navigation on my Pixel 5 and when I slide up and hold from the bottom to open the Recent Apps, there is no haptic feedback.\n\nI tested this on a Pixel 4XL and there's definitely a haptic feedback.\n\nThey are both on android 11.\n\nIs anyone else experiencing this?\nWhat can I do to fix this?",
