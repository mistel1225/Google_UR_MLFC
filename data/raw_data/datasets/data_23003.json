    "content": "My phone is just two months old. For last few days, i am experiencing this problem of noisy speaker while calling. Secondly when i tap speaker button, it works fine at start but suddenly volume goes down to the level as if speaker is turned off. I tried switch to safe mode but problem persist even in safe mode in which all third party apps including WhatsApp is disable. Please help me to overcome this problem.",
