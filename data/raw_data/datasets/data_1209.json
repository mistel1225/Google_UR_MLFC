    "title": "Cannot hear incoming caller when answered on phone....",
    "content": "Using a Google Pixel 2 XL. \n\nWhen I answer a call on my phone, I often cannot hear the other caller, but they can hear me and complain that the audio quality is very bad. I have learned that I can switch to a Bluetooth headset and so far every time that works. So I am using that as a work around in the meantime.\n\nThis is a new issue that has recently started after doing a factory reset of my phone in an attempt to resolve another issue. Calls for some callers on the same carrier will always present the issue, and for other callers it is an inconsistent issue (yet to be seen if it is a consistent issue once it starts).\n\nWhat I have tried so far: I have already done a factory reset (but can do again if I must), I have cleared the phone app cache and storage, tried turning Bluetooth off (issue still present), removed all Bluetooth devices and then reconnected, and removed any app that I could live without. The only Bluetooth devices that are paired now are my Plantronics V5200 headset and a Garmin Fenix 5X.\n\nNext to try is to answer and switch to speaker phone as a test.\n\nAny ideas or suggestions are welcome. Hoping to resolve this and upgrade to a Pixel 6 later this fall but if it cannot be resolved I may need to purchase a Samsung device before the Pixel 6 is released. My phone must be reliable as a phone above anything else and right now it is not.\n\nThanks!\n\nFrank",
