    "title": "Maps crashes and restarts my phone while navigating",
    "content": "When I’m using google maps to navigate (ie. as a gps), it will suddenly shut down my phone and restart. After restart, when I try to open maps again, it shuts down and restarts again. This has happened many times while I was on the road, making it really unreliable as a gps.\n\nThe battery was always high, and the temperature in my car was always warm, so it shouldn’t have been caused by either of those two issues (sometimes when it’s too cold, this happens too. So I always make sure it’s warm in the car If I need my phone...). \n\nDoes anyone have this issue? It has left me stranded and lost a few times.",
