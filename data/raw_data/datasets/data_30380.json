    "title": "Google Assistant not responding to my voice",
    "content": "When I try to access my assistant hands free on my Pixel 3 by saying \"Ok Google\" nothing happens. This is a problem when my phone is locked and unlocked. I've tried retraining for my voice, turning the assistant on and off, making sure the setting is turned on to access while phone is locked, enabling the audio recording, checking for updates and turning the phone on and off. I have an OtterBox Defender case on it without a screen protector, but it doesn't seem to make a difference whether it's on or off.",
