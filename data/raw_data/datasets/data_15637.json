    "title": "Pictures not saving and can't attach photos from messaging apps after Android 11",
    "content": "Since my phone updated to Android 11, when I take a picture I get the HDR+ processing notification, then when it goes away my picture is not saved, I also cannot pull up my photos from the camera app.  The circle is just grey and clicking does nothing.  Additionally apps like Messages, Hangouts, and Discord no longer pull up my photos when I try to attach a photo in the app to a message.  Tried checking all permissions and have made no other changes myself other than upgrading to th buggy Android 11.  Having other issues like the multitasking bug, and the new file manager is terrible.  Would be great if we could roll back the version because this one was not ready for release.",
