    "content": "My phone is almost two years old. It won't charge. I am using the phone's charge and tried other USB-C. I turned it off to charge but it just turns the phone back on but without charging. I took the case off, I blew air into the port, I'm not sure what to do or why this is happening. Any suggestions?",
