    "content": "This morning my phone won't charge. I plugged it into the charger that came with the phone. I also tried a charger in the car and a charger now at work. A few times I was able to get it turned on with 50% battery or so it says. But then it shuts off and will not turn back on. What is wrong and can this be fixed, the phone is what purchased earlier this year and is not even a year old.",
