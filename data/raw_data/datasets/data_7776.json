    "content": "Before December 18th I was able to connect my phone via Bluetooth to my 2011 Ford Escape. It seems as though there has been updates and that functionality no longer works.  I've tried forgetting the connection in my bluetooth settings on my phone and in the car and setting them back up.  I've cleared the cache and storage of the bluetooth system app on my phone.  I've reset the audio back to factory on my car. I've also tried changing the AVRCP version to other versions with no luck.  The last thing I haven't tried is factory resetting my phone.  Any suggestions?",
