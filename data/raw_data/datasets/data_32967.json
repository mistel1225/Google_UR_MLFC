    "title": "Any possible way to use Sunrise Alarm without Pixel Stand? (I hope devs see this)",
    "content": "I have a Pixel 3 XL, and I'm extremely let down, since these phones aren't cheap, that I can't use the Sunrise Alarm app, which is already loaded onto my device, without spending another $80 on the Pixel Stand when I don't need any of its other features.\n\nDon't need wireless charging or Assistant, or any photo features from it.\nAll I want to do is use the first-party application already loaded on my phone that could wake me up with light from the display.\nThere are other apps but they have ads and would have questionable reliability and support.",
