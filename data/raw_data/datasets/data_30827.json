    "content": "While using mobile data my battery drains extremely fast. I get  1.5hrs OST. The battery will drop a percentage every few minutes with the screen off as well.\n\nWhen using WIFI I get over 4hrs of OST. This wasn't an issue when using Android 7 but after 8 and 9 the battery drain while using mobile data had gotten worst.\n\nWould replacing the battery fix this issue?\n\nThanks",
