    "content": "I am getting a new Google 3A XL from USA through a relative. It will be used permanently in India. Will the warranty cover be available in India, even when it's purchased from USA? I have read a few posts saying that the warranty covers \"country from where the phone was purchased\". Couldn't really find an answer in Google warranty terms and conditions. Can anyone assist?",
