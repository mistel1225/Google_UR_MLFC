    "content": "I really want to test out a Google Pixel. It have been a long time I used an Android device and I really want to try the best Android. Sadly I am stuck in the Apple ecosystem and bought the new iPhone 12 and I want to try out the Pixel 5. \n\nAlso I wanna show my friends what Android is really about. iPhone have become a luxury and as a dev I think it is really bad idea. \n\nPlease someone get me a Pixel 5. Itâ€™s just too much overpriced in India. 699$-99,000â‚¹ what the hell is wrong...\n\nPlease Google show some mercy on me and get me a Pixel 5 for this Christmas ðŸŽ„",
