Every time when I try to access the \"Tipps & Support\" section in my phones settings, the Google Play Services are crashing. I even started my phone in safe mode to access the support but it did not work either.\n\nSo please can someone help me to get access to support? I have actually another problem with my phones backup that I want to get solved and where the GSuite support handed me over to Pixel support that is not accessible for me right now. :(",
