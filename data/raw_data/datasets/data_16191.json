    "content": "My pixel 3a phone is dead after 1 year and 1.5 month. Tried all steps suggested on this page https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/7167687?hl=en No charging signal indication on the screen, the screen is not broken but completely in black. When connecting with the charger or the computer, the phone vibrated then nothing more happened. Is the issue in the battery or screen? The previous day I put it in the bike basket together with a bottle of water somehow the water spilled, but the phone was still usable though not very responsive; the next day i used it to make a call successfully then all of sudden it was completely dead. Very frustrating...",
