    "title": "Pixel 3 battery drains rapidly once it reaches 12%",
    "content": "My phone went to 12% battery and the notification came up saying it will last 30 minutes until dead. I swiped the notification away and checked my battery, already at 11%, now 10%... It kept losing 1% per second. This has happened before ever since I updated to the new Android 11 a few weeks ago. I just restarted my phone but that doesn't seem to help.",
