    "content": "Ok, for a year now I've been messing with trying second line apps to send/receive calls and I'm always having issues with call quality.  About a half a year ago, I figured saving $100 wasn't worth loosing my job due to unreliable communication, so I added another phone and line to my Verizon account.  That, if course, worked great.  But my bill was getting insane.  I had some months of our bill approaching $600!  So, I started dropping lines to get it down.  I'm thinking $100 is a lot just so I can have two phones to separate calls.  So, I just switched my samsung note 20 for a google pixel 4.  Think I already like pixel better.  Think I'm a pixel guy now.  But, the pixel has the option when people call you that it will prompt the caller to state who's calling and why.  Perfect, now I don't need to answer calls after hours work related.  But, I can't have that feature on between 8-5.  Is there any quick toggle or, better yet, a way to schedule that feature to turn on and off like a scheduled sound profile?",
