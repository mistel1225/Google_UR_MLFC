    "content": "So, my Pixel 4 does not always ask me if i want to save a password when signing into an app or web page.  since i use the firefox browser, and it always asks to save web page sign ins, i can save them there (although i would still prefer them to save in the phone or to google passwords).  but the main problem is applications.  AT&T for instance, the phone will not prompt me to save the password when i log into the app, but on the lowes app, it did and saved it.  there are others too.  in settings, i made sure that autofill is on.  what am i missing?  thanks!",
