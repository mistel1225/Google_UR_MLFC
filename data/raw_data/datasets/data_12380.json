    "content": "After I did the update, my phone is stuck at 17%. I contacted Google and they said I would have to contact Assurant and pay the fee. Has anyone been able to fix the issue? I hate that I have to pay when it's the update that completely messed up my phone. Guess we'll be waiting for another class action suit ðŸ™ƒ",
