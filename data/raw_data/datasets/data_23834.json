    "content": "After the recent Android update, I started facing this issue where the speaker doesn't work after I disconnect my Bluetooth headphones. I tried disabling and enabling the Bluetooth, changing the \"Play media to\" to \"this device\" while the headphones are connected, and turning off the headphones.\n\nNothing worked, now I have to restart the device to get the speakers to work any time I connect my Bluetooth headphones.",
