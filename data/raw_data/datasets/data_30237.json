    "title": "Google Pixel 2 charging cable no longer charges phone. Other USB C cables work but...",
    "content": "...those cables also are not entirely reliable. They don't go most of the way into the port like the cable that came with the phone, if they are slightly bumped the disconnect. Sometimes they disconnect even if nothing has happened to them and they only charge slowly. If my phone doesn't start at 100% the next day I sometimes need to charge it throughout the day and that can take hours. I don't know if it's a problem with the port on the phone or with the cables but it's frustrating. I've had this phone for a year and a few months.",
