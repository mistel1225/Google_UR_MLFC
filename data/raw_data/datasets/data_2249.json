    "content": "This is not a serious issue but it does seem to bother me to some extent. This issue has been occurring over the course of a few months and I have not been able to find the cause behind it. The keyboard on my phone seems to be placed in the middle of the screen, effectively blocking my view and making it hard to type. The odd thing about this is that this seems to be a problem exclusive to games and apps as this issue has never occurred whenever I press the search bar. \n\nIs there a way to fix this? I am not sure if this is a system malfunction or something else entirely.",
