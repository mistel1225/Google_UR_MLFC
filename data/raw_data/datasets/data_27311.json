    "title": "Google will not issue my pixel 3 refund after more than 3 weeks. Why won't they issue it?",
    "content": "Hello. I have had 2 pixel 3 refurbished replacement phones come with issues. I asked my customer rep to give me a refund, and they obliged. They said that it would arrive between 5-10 business days. I checked up after 2 weeks, and my rep said that \"since the refund was due to an exception from policy, it needs to undergo further review which will take a bit longer than the normal refund process. Give us within a week. The refund will be credited back to you; we just need to follow our process.\" \n\nIt has been a week and I still haven't received a refund. Upon checking with my rep, she said that the refund team \"can't provide a time frame\"\nThe rep has been super helpful, but the refund team is refusing to issue the refund. I am getting extremely frustrated with the slowness of the refund team. This is getting ridiculous and I am getting upset with how some teams in google support are not even trying to help.\n\nSomeone please get this fixed.\nThanks.\n\nA frustrated customer,\nJustin Pham",
