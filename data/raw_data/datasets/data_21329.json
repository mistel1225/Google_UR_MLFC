    "content": "I purchased google pixel 3 in Sep.2019. Last week it can not be charged and turned on. I called google customer service, nobody picked my call. I shipped    it to headquarter by USPS On May 1,2020 with a note inside. The tracking showed it had been delivered to Mountain View , CA 94043 by May 4,2020.\nThe question is: When can I get it back? Thank you.\nUSPS tracking: 9505516245040123411543\n\nZaowen Chen\n2816867017",
