    "content": "Hi,\n\nI lost my phone yesterday. Thankfully, I had the \"find my device\" on and it gave me a rough picture of where I dropped it.\nYesterday morning, I was able to see my phone battery percentage was at 70%. Later on I could see that it went down to 60% and also was able to \"play sound\".\n\nToday, however I cannot see my battery percentage and it can't connect to play a sound. (just says \"connecting...\")\n\nHowever, when I asked a friend to ring my phone, it did ring, meaning it likely isn't dead or stolen as I initially thought.\n\nSo my questions are:\n\nHow accurate is the tracker timeline if it's a route I've never walked before? The last place it's displaying my phones location is near a busy roundabout (the route I walked is very residential, so there aren't many landmarks. Would it show the last place the phone actually was at or try to predict where it is?)\nWhy is it not showing my phone battery anymore / not playing the sound? Is something wrong with my phone? Going by the rate the battery went down yesterday it should still have charge until tomorrow, and my phone not going to voicemail should suggest it's still on\nNow when I try leave a message it says \"secure requested\" - does that mean the message will definitely show or might?\nIs there anything else I can try?\n\nMany thanks for any answers!!!",
