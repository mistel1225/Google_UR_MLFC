    "content": "I have gotten frequent heat warnings that say some features may not work until the phone cools down. I don't notice a performance problem when it does this, so I am wondering if I can turn those features off to avoid the overheating problem altogether. Is there a list of features that are disabled when the phone reaches the heat warning about getting warm?",
