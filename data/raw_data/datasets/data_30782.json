    "content": "I have enabled 'sign in with phone' and I am getting the prompt on my phone, I confirm my lock screen, tap 'Yes' to allow sign in on other device, and then nothing happens\n\nI've resent and reconfirmed multiple times - nothing happens\n\nAny ideas? None of the support page options help or are relevant, like, my phone isn't lost, it's in my hand but the system just isn't working",
