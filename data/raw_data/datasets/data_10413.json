    "content": "I'm transferring my banking app to my new Pixel 5. At the point I have to enter an alphanumeric password, the input switches to a telephone keypad format with 3 alpha characters sharing a key with a number. I can't find a way of manually switching the keyboard format back to alphanumeric. I assume this is an error with the banking app instructing the device to change keyboard layout. Is this overridable by me?",
