    "content": "Under the security menu, I am getting a red icon next to the google play system update option. I have tried checking for an update several times before and after restarting my device but nothing is working. It is stuck in the September 1, 2020 update. I have seen many google search results talking about trying safe mode but from what I have read that does not work. Is there any other options I can try to fix this issue?",
