    "content": "My power button doesn't work at all, at times when I try to wake it up. Even the double tap to open camera feature doesn't work. At that point, nothing works. The thing I do to get out of that situation is hold the power button for several seconds. I'm not sure if this is a software or a hardware issue but it's quite serious. Please help me.",
