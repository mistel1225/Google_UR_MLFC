    "content": "Hello, my Pixel 3 randomly keeps restarting. Unless i have my finger on the screen or the button, it will just keep restarting. Help? I've tried cycling and that doesn't seem to work. I'm hoping that i won't have to hard reset, since I've had this phone for under a year, but I will. Any help is appreciated!",
