    "title": "Notifications stopped appearing even though the system registers them",
    "content": "A few days ago, notifications for all non-system apps stopped appearing (email, messenger, linkedin, games, etc).\n\nI've factory reset my phone twice, once with a backup and once without, but the issue seems to persist.\n\nOddly enough, for the first few minutes after reset, it seems like the notifications are working properly. I've checked to make sure do not disturb is off.\n\nThe odd thing is that the notifications are all listed as being turned on with banners, sounds, etc and notifications are registered. That is, when someone messages me on messenger, it'll say in the notifications settings page that I received a notification, but it is not displayed.",
