    "content": "So noticed I wasn't getting many notifications yet there were items in the tray.\nAssumed they happened when I want using it... But I've been using it and felt my watch buzz for a new email but didn't see a popup ... Yet there was a new icon in the tray.\n\nGo into that app's notifications settings and made sure Pop on was on... Then the next notification it \"missed\" and then sure enough the setting was set to off.\n\nThoughts?\n\nPlease no \"oh just do a factory reset\" sheets, that's such a cop out",
