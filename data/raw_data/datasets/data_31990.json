    "content": "Hello,\nI own a Pixel 2 XL for 4 months. It worked perfectly until one day I noticed that the phone was turned off when I picked it up. After some tests I found out that tilting the device or shaking it (carrying in purse/pocket) makes it turn off. The system is updated, no 3rd party apps installed, I tried restoring the device to factory settings. Unfortunately, nothing seems to fix the issue. Any advice? Thank you in advance.",
