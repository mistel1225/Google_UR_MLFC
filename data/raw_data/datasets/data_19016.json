    "content": "My phone crashes with only a black screen, does not receive calls, totally dead.  Cannot restart into bootloader or safe mode with the power button/volume buttons combinations. The phone most of the time is 70-100% charged when it happens and happen many times a day. To get to restart I plug into a live charging cord wait about 10 seconds then start it with the power button as normal.  I ran it in safe mode and it still happen after a day.\n\nThanks\nQuentin",
