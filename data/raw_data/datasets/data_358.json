    "title": "'Cannot read battery meter' on 4XL after most recent update.",
    "content": "Had no issues at all with the phone until I installed the most recent security update. Now my phone keeps saying it cannot read the battery and I've no clue what level my battery is at. I just have a ? In the battery icon.\n\nIt's also struggled to restart since, vibrating and booting up the screen (like when it normally boots up) then going black and repeating the process.\n\nAnyone else experiencing this? The 'solution' sends me to update my warranty, but I'm in the UK so that's not happening.\n\nThanks üëç",
