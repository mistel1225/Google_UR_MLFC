    "content": "I am thinking about getting a Google pixel 4a but I'm worried that features and updates and bloatware might be an issue, I have had a OnePlus 7 pro for about a year, but my TMobile edition has been a nightmare of delayed updates and features. Like my camera app that's the V1 camera app Even though I have android 10. The non Carrier version has had almost no issues, and it's frustrating that I am missing out on so many different features that OnePlus has to offer. I have heard that other phone manufacturers have had similar issues. But apple doesn't seem to have these issues. My question is will pixel phones have the same issues if so are there any android phones that don't",
