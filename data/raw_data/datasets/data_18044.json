    "content": "Dear team,\n\nI, Gautami Vinayan, have given my Google Pixel 2 XL device for a panel change on 17th March 2020. I understand that after which the lockdown has commenced. The lockdown has been lenient since the 8th of June and still, I have not received my device back. The alternative phone given to me doesn't even function properly because of which I am facing a lot of issues. The executive Mr. Shahrukh has also been following up with the higher authority team but still no positive response. As other B2X branches in Andheri itself have started working I don't know what's the issue with this branch. I had been told that the Skyline Icon building is in containment zone and yet I get the news that the building is working only your branch is closed. So I have lied about that too. I have paid for the repair as well and I need my phone back, I cannot manage with the alternative phone  If I won't get a positive response about when my device will be returned to me, I will have to escalate this issue to Police Officials.\n\nRegards,\nGautami Vinayan.",
