    "title": "The Android update last week has rendered my Google pixel useless. How can I recover?",
    "content": "Since the update last week my phone is incapable of calling, mostly unable to answer.  System UI hangs whenever there is an outgoing call and on most incoming calls.  It is unresponsive multiple times a day, mostly for no reason.  Also the phone restarts by itself and has reset my background image and stuff.  I have tried restarting/rebooting the phone multiple times.  Are there any steps I can do to make it functional again?  I have Android Version: 9. Security patch level: February 5, 2019.",
