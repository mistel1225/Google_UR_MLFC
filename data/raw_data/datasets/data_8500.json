    "title": "[4a] Audio & Call Issues: BT Audio skipping, Calls hanging up automatically",
    "content": "Been having some weird issues the past couple days (after the latest update) hoping I'm not the only one:\n\n- Listening to podcasts via BT headphones, the audio \"skips\" every 5 seconds. The podcast keeps playing, but there is a 1 second gap every 5 seconds. Restarted the phone, forgot & reconnected headphones, issue persists\n\n- Incoming & Outgoing Calls intermittently don't work. Outgoing: rings once and hangs up automatically. Incoming: pops up on the screen, but hangs up as soon as I answer.",
