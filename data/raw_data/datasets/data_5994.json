    "title": "Why does my phone have issues playing media and downloading applications?",
    "content": "I have internet connection, but it is as if I have limited connection. Music and video will not stream and applications will not download â€” this is what I've noticed. Everything else works fine, such as web browsing and messaging. This happens on two different Android phones. Streaming on a Smart TV via WiFi is fine. Playing PlayStation 5 via ethernet is fine. My ISP escalated it but I feel they have no clue. They had me change the radio channel but that didn't help.",
