    "content": "Yesterday my fingerprint scanner stopped working out of the blue,\nI did not drop my Pixel 2 XL nor get it wet.\nMy Pixel itself seems not to recognize any activity from the fingerprint scanner and third party apps say I don't have the necessary hardware.\nI have tried starting up in safe mode as well as factory resetting to no avail,\nWhat do I do now?",
