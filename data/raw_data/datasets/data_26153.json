    "title": "\"At a Glance\" calendar feed not updating regularly on pixel 3, Android 10",
    "content": "The calendar feature on \"At a glance\" does not refresh often. \nAt work I am always running between meetings, and I rely on a quick look at my phone to know where to go next. However, since upgrading to Android 10, \"At a glance\" calendars do not often refresh -- changes that were made 3 hours ago still haven't been reflected on the homescreen.",
