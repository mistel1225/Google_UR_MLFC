    "content": "Hi community,\n\nThere's a mysterious app draining my battery, it only shows '10510'. Initially it seemed to be Facebook, so I've uninstalled FB app and installed FB Lite instead.\nA couple of hours later, the main battery drainer was replaced for something called '10510', that also says 'used for 0 mins'.\nI can't stop the process nor identify its source, but it's killing my battery.\nJust to be clear, I've already restarted the phone a couple of times and also double-checked by killing all running apps.\nI'm in Android 11 beta.\n\nAny idea?\nThanks!",
