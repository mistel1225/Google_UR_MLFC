    "title": "Pixel 3xl does not charge but shows 0% and turns for a brief moment before shutting down",
    "content": "I've tried a couple different chargers, cables, and outlets as well as the original pixel charger. When plugged in the phone will show the battery/lightning bolt symbol and then show 0% with the rotating circles but does not charge past 0%. I can turn the phone on at 0% but it immediately turns off even while plugged in.\n\nA couple days prior to the android 11 update my pixel was shutting down immediately once it reached the percentage that turned on battery saver. It did the same a couple hours ago and no longer charges. \n\nWould I be correct in assuming that the battery has failed? If so, is this covered under warranty (I bought it through my verizon plan).",
