    "title": "Volume going down and then up randomly (Pixel 1)",
    "content": "About a month ago the volume on my pixel started randomly dropping for a couple seconds and then returns to normal. It happens while watching videos with my headphones in and sounds similar to when I recieve a notification and the sound drops, but no notifications show anywhere. Sometimes the video will pause on its own as well. The battery also has issues, but I doubt that is related since I had bad charging habits. I haven't tried factory resetting or anything yet because I don't want to lose any data I have on this phone. I bought this phone on amazon unlocked about a year ago (september 2018) and it was fine until now.",
