    "content": "This app will not stay open on my Pixel 5. If I click on it as an app it will not stay open. I can create a widget, which looks like a battery with the percentage and estimated remaining time. However, the settings and information screen won't stay open when I click on the widget.\n\nHere is the link to the app  https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fulminesoftware.batteryindicator&hl=en\n\nI was hoping someone in the community would try and install this app on their Pixel 5 and see if it works. Thanks for any help.",
