    "content": "My wife and I both have pixel 3 XLs. The past few days we can't talk to each other...the phones disconnect at exactly 30 seconds. The person who initiates the call gets \"timed out no response\". It doesn't matter who calls who. It's ONLY in the pixel 3 xl. As we have another phone on verizon (motorola) which works perfectly fine with both pixels. We can call other people with non pixel phones with no issues. We contacted google support and they had us uninstall and reinstall apps, reset settings, start in safe mode and none of that worked. If we try to call each other the call ends at exactly 30 seconds with the same error message \"timed out no response\". We've had these phones for over 2 years and never had this issue until the past 3 days. And it's odd that it's both phones at the same time but they work perfectly fine if we don't call each other. Anyone else experience this? Any help would be appreciated.",
