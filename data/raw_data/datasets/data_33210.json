    "title": "Pixel 3 intermittently strobes bright neon light across the screen. Tried troubleshooting, no change",
    "content": "Factory reset, still strobes afterwards. Operate in safe mode, still strobed. Turned off all ambient lighting settings, still strobing. Tried testing the affected part of the screen by dragging the Quick Settings bar to the bottom, it allowed me to to this and I could see (kind of) the settings menu behind the neon strobing. I tried taking a screen shot of the strobing, only got a photo of my home screen.",
