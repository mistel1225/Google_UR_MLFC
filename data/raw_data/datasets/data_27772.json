    "content": "Hi I received my Google pixel 3a xl a couple of weeks ago LOVE the phone so far. This morning when I picked up my phone it vibrates like usual letting me know that flip to shh was off but then hours later ALL of the vibration related functions of my phone stopped working. Even incoming calls and text messages won't work and I've had to keep my phone on sound since, I tried everything that I could find in the internet...even a factory data reset ðŸ˜«ðŸ˜«ðŸ˜«. And about an hour after it came back, and I put my phone to charge but some time after it stopped again and hasn't worked since. The phone received Android 10 like all other pixel phones, and I highly doubt it's the vibration motor, if not it wouldn't have worked again, just to add to it yesterday I was roaming around in Google and it froze on me a couple of times (maybe a software bug) but then acted normally. PLEASE I NEED HELP!!!",
