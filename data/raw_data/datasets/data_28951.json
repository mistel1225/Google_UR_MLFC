    "content": "Hi,\n\nMy Pixel XL(1st Gen.) was charging and working properly while I was watching YouTube on it. Suddenly YouTube Froze. I pressed the power button twice to lock and unlock the screen. But unfortunately, the screen never came back on the second and subsequent clicks. \n\nThere are no issues or cracks on my screen as I was actively using it when it froze.\n\nI've tried all methods to revive it including holding power button for more than 30 seconds and holding the power and volume down button for about a minute but this does not work.\n\nI've also tried with different and working pixel chargers but it also does not power the phone.\n\nI've also tried all the troubleshooting on your site related to this issue. None worked for me.\n\nPlease Help me. I live in Ghana.",
