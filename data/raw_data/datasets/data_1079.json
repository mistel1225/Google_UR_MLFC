    "content": "My phone completely turned off yesterday. It will not turn on, it will not charge. There are no lights on, I have tried the troubleshooting options, I have held the power down for 30 seconds, I have attempted to call it with other devices (it does not ring). I got this phone very recently and I would like to file a warranty claim and get a new one.",
