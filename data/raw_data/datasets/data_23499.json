    "content": "Hello Guys, I recently bought a Verizon Pixel 3a, it came as ''unlocked'' when I tried to put a new sim card on it gave me the notification that the sim card isn't supported, and prompted me to call Verizon to get it unlocked, I did call Verizon and they said the phone has no lock on it, and that it should be good to use any sim card worldwide, I called multiple times and got the same answer so they directed me to Google! \n\nHas anyone been through this before?",
