    "content": "My Sony Bluetooth headphones have active noise cancelling - I got them to help me concentrate at work and to make taking the bus better. There is a button I push to turn noise cancelling on or off on the left ear phone.\nWhen I tether them to my pixel 3XL phone, the noise cancelling button become the Google Assistant button! This makes it quite hard to listen to podcasts in a noisy environment without turning the volume up dangerously.\n\nHow can I get the Google assistant and the noise cancelling function to live together in harmony? Or failing that, how can I \"un-setup\" the Assistant and get the use of my button back?",
