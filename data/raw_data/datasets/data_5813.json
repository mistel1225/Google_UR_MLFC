    "content": "My account, my wife's and our daughters account the liked songs are gone and most of the artists we follow songs are greyed out in YouTube Music. Playlists only play one song. If we do play music it just wants to play the videos, and asking any google home speaker to play a playlist or album it says it's playing, but nothing happens.",
