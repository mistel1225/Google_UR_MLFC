    "content": "I (1) lost my device but (2) cannot find it on \"find my device\" even though it is (3) listed as linked to my account.\n\nI am absolutely sure I am signed in to the right account. (Please ask me how I know if you think I am mistaken.)\n\nI did not realize the device was lost for a several weeks. (It's not my phone, see note at end.) It is really lost, too, not misplaced; it might be anywhere.\n\nI realize I have probably lost it for good. But would like to try whatever there is to try.\n\nI have recently used \"find my device\" to find this device (you know, making it ring). When I did that, there were other options that would be good to do now, such as \"lock your phone\" and put a message on the lock screen. It provides these options for other devices I have. And, the device was listed!\n\nIf I could, I'd like to lock it and leave a message. Is there any way I can?\n\nWhy isn't the device listed with the others any more? Does it mean someone has wiped it and taken it over?\n\nI'll probably end up buying a replacement. When I do, I would like to restore to it my old device software and settings--to restore from backup. Will I still be able to do that? How?\n\nI just feel as though I am missing something obvious.\n\nFinal disclosure: The device is a Nexus 7, not a Pixel (though I do own a Pixel 3A, which is not lost). The Nexus help forum is long gone, so I came here. The issue is not device-specific.\n\nThanks for any advice.",
