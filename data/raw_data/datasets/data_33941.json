    "content": "Used the transfer tools from my Samsung to my new pixel. Still working on getting messages transferred but I think it will be okay. I cannot find the voicemail icon although I have received a voicemail message and retrieved it by swiping from the top of the phone down. Only other problem is my memos didn't transfer. Any suggestions on either situation? Thank you!",
