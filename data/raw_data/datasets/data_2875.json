    "content": "The first day after the April Android 11 update, my phone worked fine and like normal.\n\nThe next day after leaving it charging throughout the night, my phone has decided to stop working well/normally. \n\nThe screen doesn't open with swiping, only the power button. It also doesn't display the time or notifications while the phone is put down and not touched.\n\nWhile I'm using the phone, I can swipe down once to see the \"notifications screen\" but I can't swipe down again for the quick settings panel. \n\nWhile on the \"notifications screen\",  it doesn't display any notifications at all, even though I know there should be one because the phone still makes the notification sound.\n\nThe quick settings that I can access (wifi, bluetooth, etc), I can toggle on/off, but I can't access them as usual (tap and hold for a couple seconds).\n\nMy wifi works fine, but the top bar says that I don't have any service. When I'm not connected to a wifi network, I can't access any internet, but I can make a call and send a text, but I don't know if I can receive either. I've checked my phone service account, and things seem normal from that end.\n\nSome apps are being weird as well.\n\nI noticed an app missing, and when I went to get it again from the Play Store, it won't download. It just says that downloading the app is 'pending'. It's been saying this for over 20 minutes, and I am connected to a wifi network.\n\nWhen my alarm goes off, I snooze it, then do something else with my phone, the alarm going off overlays whatever I'm doing.\n\nI'm not sure how to fix anything, but it's all rather frustrating.",
