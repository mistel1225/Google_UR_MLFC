    "title": "Android devices having issues with new WiFi router/modem",
    "content": "I have three android devices (Pixel 5, Galaxy S8+, Google Chromecast with Google TV). When trying to stream Disney+, it is either extremely slow or won't load at all. I can't even look at my watchlist when it does load. Amazon Prime videos also extremely slow as well as any purchase Google Play movies. However Netflix and Youtube stream just fine and loads fast. This is across all three devices. The stupid part is my non-android devices (webOS on my LG CX tv, windows laptop) and all my mother's Apple devices have no issues whatsoever with streaming or downloading. I have rebooted the router and modem, my phone, uninstalled and reinstalled the apps that are having issues, and nothing is solving the issue.\nI have even run speed tests that show we are getting around 450 mbps download speed at the exact same time my android devices struggle to stream or download.\n\nWhat in the world is going???",
