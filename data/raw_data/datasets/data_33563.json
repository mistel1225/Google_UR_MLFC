    "content": "Starting last night my pixel 2XL has become unusably slow. It started abruptly after plugging in the OEM charger (cable and transformer in combo).\nIt took about 30 minutes for my phone to restart so I decided to do a factory reset. I am now in possession of a phone that has been factory reset but is still so unbelievably slow that I haven't managed to restore my backup.\n\nAny help and advice would be appreciated - I'm out of ideas!\n\nThanks",
