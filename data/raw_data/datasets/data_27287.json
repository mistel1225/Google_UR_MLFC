    "content": "Hi\n\nI am on Vodafone UK and since updating to Android 9 (continued in Android 10), my network connection is extremely unstable on the Google Pixel 3.\n\nI need to restart phone to get a temporary connection, which then drops off a few minutes later. I have got a new SIM from Vodafone, but issue still persists.\n\nI have also tried using the SIM on another phone (Samsung S9) and network does not drop.\n\nI have also done a hard reset on phone, and the issue still persists. \n\nAny advice?? I want the Pixel 4, but won't stay on Google if this issue cannot be solved =(",
