    "content": "When you enter your phone's IMEI at store.google.com/repair it probably says 'Unlocked'. \n\nMy second hand 3 XL does. I assume that refers to its network status, not whether the handset can't be accessed without a pass code, fingerprint or pattern?\n\nIf Google recognised the phone as being one it sold, it can safely say if it was sold unlocked. \n\nWhat about ones it supplied to the networks? How would google know if it's network locked? \n\n(Mine is firmly locked to its UK network EE.  It should soon be two years old and automatically unlock.)",
