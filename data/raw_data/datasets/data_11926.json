    "content": "Hello and thanks for your help. The trouble I'm having with the Google Pixel 3 XL is I have tried to add a photo to my contacts. When I select the photo from  gallery or Google photo nothing happens it doesn't go in. The only way I can add a photo to contacts is by taking the picture and that is not what I want to do I have pictures of them I want to put in there.  I've also had the same problem when I've tried to add a photo in my profile picture on parlor. The same thing happens The picture doesn't go in. any thoughts or suggestions would be greatly appreciated Thank you!  Jill.",
