    "content": "In the Google assistant movie Maker, if I select photos to make a movie, after I create and edit the length and music and touch the top right corner to save, movies do not save.  I'm a software engineer myself and can tell you it's a defect. I've had this work for me before, it's not my first movie. Also I've tried reinstalling the app and clearing cache and storage, to no avail.\nDetails",
