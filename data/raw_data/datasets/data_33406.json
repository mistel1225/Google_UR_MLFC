    "content": "I just purchased a new unlocked Pixel 3 and transferred apps and some data that were on my previous iPhone 6s. Just as I was trying to log into the apps (such as H&M and Instagram), my Pixel 3 prompted a window 'Continue with' that suggested my own gmail address and 2 OTHER UNKNOWN EMAIL ADDRESSES below it. I DO NOT KNOW who they are, those emails are NOT MINE, nor were they ever used to log into my apps! They are obviously not registered in my Accounts either. I bought this phone NEW and unused from another person, but is there a possibility that there's cookied information from the previous user? This is really creeping me out and scared there might be some spyware...At the least, I want those recommendations REMOVED from my login email options. Please halp...",
