    "title": "How to fix jerky video, frames dropped, with stock app and image stabilization",
    "content": "I've had two Pixel XL phones during the past two years and never had this issue until the last Android update (Aug 2019).\n\nWhen I'm using image stabilization for video in the stock camera app, every 30-60 seconds it jerks, it drops a few frames. \n\nIf I turn off image stabilization the problem disappears.\n\nIf I turn it back on, the problem comes back.\n\nI've already read of others who had this problem with previous updates and then a later update fixed it.\n\nAnyone else seeing the same problem?",
