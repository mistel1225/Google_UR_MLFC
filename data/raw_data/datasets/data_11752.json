    "content": "While watching a live stream on my Google Pixel XL (2016) my screen froze completely. I couldn't even restart it. I decided to let its battery die then try again. When I came back to my desk, it had shut off. I plugged it in and the full battery symbol came up. I then looked to the internet for help and read that I had to press the power button for at least 30 seconds. I did that and the screen went to the Google logo. Now it is in an infinite loop of the Google logo when I press and hold the power button. I got this phone from someone online after my old one stopped working just a few weeks ago. Is there a way to keep using this phone or do I have to get a new one?",
