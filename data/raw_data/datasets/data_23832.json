    "content": "Hello, I have issues with my pixel 1 that I can't seem to solve, since I do not have that much of an expendable income currently, I decided to buy a pixel 1 from ebay, the specs are amazing for the price and it is made by google so it seemed like a decent choice.\n\n\nMy issue is the battery drain, so I decided to download accubattery, after several charges it showed me that my battery health is 78% \"healthy\" which seems like a decent percentage, but the drain is horrible, today before going to class I had it charged to 100%, after around 4 hours of being idle \"airplane mode\" the battery is down to 84% charge????\n\n\nIs this issue related to the android 10 update? Can it be solved by installing a custom Kernel/ROM?\n\n\nThank you guys for hosting such an amazing support community ❤️",
