    "content": "Great! Now Google automatically installs provider bloatware on factory unlocked devices! Case in point: I have a Pixel 3 which I originally bought from the Google Store unlocked. The past months, I was running the Q beta but decided to opt out a few days ago. Naturally, my phone received the downgrade and I had to set it up again - no big deal for me. The thing that really bothered me: after I finished the setup, I found the \"My T-Mobile\" app as well as the \"T-Mobile Phone Unlock Status\" pre-installed.\n\nHere is the thing: I am not even a T-Mobile customer!\n\nIf I was remotely interested in any provider bloat, I can download that crap myself! Not cool!\n\n(Yeah, I know, Google probably will never read this.)",
