    "content": "Hi, trying to buy a charging cable for my Pixel 3a phone.  Bought 2 different ones USB-A to USB-C and both of them didn't work.  They were able to charge my tablet but not my phone.  After doing some research, it appears that some USB-A to USB-C cables will not work with some phones because the cable itself does not meet certain requirements (high-speed charging, etc.).  So it appears that not all USB-A to USB-C cables operate the same.  Can someone tell me what specific details are required on the cable for it to work on the Pixel 3a?  Thanks.",
