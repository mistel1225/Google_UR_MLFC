    "content": "Which car charger do you all recommend for the Pixel 5? I don't want my battery to be affected negatively by using the \"wrong\" charger. \n\nBelkin recommended this one but it doesn't appear to support 18w.... That won't mess up the battery in the long run? Which other car charger do you all recommend?\n\nThanks\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Belkin-Boost-Charge-Quick-Charger/dp/B07KC4TKRX/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=F7U076bt04-BLK&qid=1609126354&sr=8-1&th=1",
