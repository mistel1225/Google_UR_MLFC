    "content": "Car is a Hyundai Ioniq hybrid.  Previously had a pixel 2 communicating with car with no issues.  Now Android Auto will timeout after 15-20 minutes.  Have replaced usb-c cable with new Google own cable, following information from forums on this site.  Pretty much at a dead end now.",
