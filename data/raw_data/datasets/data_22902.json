    "content": "I had a Pixel 3, got a brand new Pixel 4XL, did the transfer stuff, my device ended up lagging when unlocking and swiping away notifications. \n\nI got a replacement device and same thing happened. I asked the same question on reddit and got a response.\n\nIt's the Pixel theme app. As soon as I created a custom profile (color and icon shape) the lag comes immediately.\n\nTerrible ugly lag when swiping away the notifications and unlocking the device slows down. \n\nReturning the profile to default, it returns to looking fine. \n\ni've deleted data from the Pixel Launcher and the Theme app, this does not help the matter at all. I don't know what is wrong.\n\nWhile not the best video, here is an example of the lag I see. https://imgur.com/gallery/AyrTlW7",
