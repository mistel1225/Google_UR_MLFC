    "content": "I have two email accounts. One is my Gmail account which was used to set up my Pixel 4a. But I almost never use that email. I added my regular email account as an IMAP  account, but when I tap on the Mail icon, I only see the Gmail account. How do I make my other account be the one that gets opened when I tap the Mail icon?",
