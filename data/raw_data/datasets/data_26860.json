    "content": "I recently bought a second hand 2xl with some screen damage, things have worsened since I bought it and now im looking into replacing the screen.\nAll replacements for the 2xl I have found seem considerably more expensive than other models, after comparing it seems like the 3aXL is the only other pixel model with a 6\" screen, would a replacement designed for the 3aXL be feasible for a 2xl? Or better to shill out for the real deal 2xl screen?",
