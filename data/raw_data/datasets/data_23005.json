    "content": "Hi Pixel people. I have a Pixel 2, no SIM is working in my phone but my SIM does work in other phones. I’ve tried factory reset among other things like solutions from forums but haven’t gotten success. I haven’t damaged or wet it recently or ever, neither have I upgraded it recently since the last upgrade was at the beginning of the year. Please can someone help or give me new ideas on what it might be or possible solutions, I have tried a bunch of stuff. Thanks everyone!",
