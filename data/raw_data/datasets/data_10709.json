    "content": "I have a Pixel 4. Since I updated to Android 11, I've noticed a discoloured rectangular box pop up every few seconds on the top right hand corner of certain apps. I've noticed it on WhatsApp, FitBit and other apps that have a coloured banner on top. \n\nThe size of the box changes sometimes, and the colour is always either darker or lighter than the main app colour, depending on which app it is.\n\nHas anyone else experienced this and been able to fix it?",
