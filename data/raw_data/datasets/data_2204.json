    "content": "When I try to voice to text \"comma,\" \"question mark,\" etc. it types the word in brackets Ex: {comma} instead. It worked perfectly yesterday, putting in the actual punctuation, but today it's doing this. Was there an update that changed this? And how do I change it back to typing in the actual punctuation marks? I'm using Android version 11. Let me know if you need any further info?",
