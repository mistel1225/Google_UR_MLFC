    "content": "I am an old pixel user (i.e. first Pixel Generation and then Pixel 2 XL before passing on the Pixel 3 whole Gen). I really want to purchase the Pixel 4 XL and I am planning to, but I live in the Middle East and that is the dilemma. I got my previous Pixel devices accidentally through in a \"Take it or leave it\" situations. However, the question that still remained unanswered and unsatisfactory to many is about When will Google listen to the thousands of us who adore Google devices and want to have and own them? when will Google offer the support needed for a vast numerous fanbase? I am talking here about Google store, after market sales support, maintenance....etc. Some may refer to the way of purchasing from US via a third party mediator like SnS and so but we want to get the option of ordering the Pixels without being charged a leg and an arm and without thinking about the hassle of shipping and customs extra fees if using other way of ordering stuff from US or any other applicable Google stores. I hope Google really listen to us this and give us the option, to say the least.",
