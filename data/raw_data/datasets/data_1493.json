    "content": "No matter what option I choose, whether it's to enter my old PIN, or use my google account instead, it returns to the copy apps & data screen. Obviously, since this was a reset, I don't have data from an old phone to transfer. And any time I tap \"Don't copy\" \"Can't use old phone?\" or \"No cable?\" brings me to the Verify PIN screen.",
