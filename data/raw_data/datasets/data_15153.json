    "content": "Got notification 2 weeks ago on the 3A that Android 11 was available. I have repeatedly allowed it to install, going to system update screen - no matter the length of time allowed, it won't install - stuck on the install screen with the activity bar in motion. I have a good wifi connection. Tried clearing Google Play cache, as someone mentioned that as a fix - no go.\n\nHaving heard of bugs with 11, I'm tempted to stay with 10, but eventually it will not longer be supported. Any advise?",
