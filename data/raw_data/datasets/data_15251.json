    "content": "Recorder app no longer transcribing audio. I know the previous answer was to clear the cache of the app but I don't know how to do that? \n\nAlso, is there any way to have these recordings transcribed post-recordng them? Hoping to salvage the two audio notes so they can be searchable.\n\nThanks.",
