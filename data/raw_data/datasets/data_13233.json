    "title": "Pixel 3 Camera Landscape/Horizontal Panorama Not Working",
    "content": "Google camera refuses to switch to landscape/horizontal mode when I try to take a panorama photo. Regardless of how I rotate my phone, it remains vertical. Even if I have auto-rotate on, tit refuses to switch to horizontal mode and even displays an error message saying I need to rotate my phone to take a horizontal photo but the camera does not switch no matter how I try to rotate my phone. It is infuriating and defeats the purpose of the panorama function if I can't make it horizontal. I didn't have this issue until recently, within the past few months. Nothing I try has worked, I've tried chaing my phone and camera settings and nothing works. The panorama function does not work horizontally anymore.  My phone, camera, system, etc. are all up to date.",
