    "content": "Recently when I was listening to a podcast with my headphones, I heard a buzz sound followed by the audio cutting out. I plugged my headset back into my phone and everything was fine. \n\nNormally when my audio cuts out, my source material pauses automatically without the aforementioned buzz sound, however this instance the source material continued to play rather than pausing. As of the writing of this post, I haven't encountered this issue again but I'm concerned this could be the sign of a greater issue with my phone rather than a one off issue.\n\nThanks,",
