    "content": "I have a Pixel 3 device and I have a problem with  the camera and Google Images app. When I take pictures in a camera and transfer them to one of the folders that I have set up and then take some more pictures some of the pictures I moved to the folder are simply deleted from it. I can only see it in the \"Images\" tab and should be downloaded back to the device and transferred to the folder back.\nThe problem is not resolved even if I set this folder not to sync to the cloud.\nIt is important to note that the option of \"smart storage\"  is not available (i turnd it of) \nI'll be happy to help you, I'm helpless.\nBest Regards \nYosi",
