    "title": "Pixel 3a XL not playing mp4 audio stream",
    "content": "Listen a lot to the local NPR station live stream via the NPR app that's only available in mp4 format. However when I try to listen on my new 3a XL, it tries to connect but times out. Went to another NPR station in the vicinity via the app and they have live streams available both in mp4 and mp3 formats. Selecting mp4 had same result (times out) but the mp3 played fine. Note that my previous phone (Nexus 6P) and tablet (Samsung Tab A 10.1\") have no issues with this NPR app.\n\nIs there some hidden setting on my 3a XL that I need to make that's poorly documented so I can play mp4 audio streams?",
