    "content": "I'm comparing color values on fabric, and when a photo is taken of the fabrics, and turning these colors in the image into greyscale you could see how close their color values are.. But, I don't see any settings in the camera on this cellphone that would let me turn the color photo of the fabric into greyscale (without having to export it to another program to do this). How do I get greyscale for the image without leaving the camera?",
