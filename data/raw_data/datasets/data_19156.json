    "content": "My brand new Pixel 4 XL camera app no longer works and keeps crashing when trying to open. The flashlight no longer works either. I cleared my cache, reset and restarted in safe mode. Reset to factory settings. What a horrible experience store associates that don't have a clue. Tech coach for over 2 hours and still nothing. Bad info, waiting for multiple callbacks. Told to contact Google. Google says they can't help with phone calls due to pandemic. Verizon sells crap products and then shrugs their shoulders. They offer a refurbished phone for a brand new phone that's a few weeks old. Thanks for nothing Verizon.",
