    "title": "Why Google Pixel 3A XL hardware is so fragile and buggy?",
    "content": "It is so fragile that screen will have internal fractures with no sign of external marks. It is paper thin. The hardware is so buggy even the google authorized service providers failed to get it right when given in service for the first time. What fails to earn my trust is that while the phone is in warranty and I may have a phone with internal hardware issues or packaging, the google won't replace the device or recommend buying another google phone by paying the price difference. The sole reason I purchased a google phone is the fastest availability of security updates so that my workplace/ enterprise apps can continue to run on it. I don't know, I may have to force myself to move to apple iphone for better hardware reliability without sacrificing the fastest availability of security updates on iOS. Making a last ditch effort to post my experience with the expectation of receiving some recommendations here because I do not want to buy a new phone every year.",
