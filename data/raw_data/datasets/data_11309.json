    "content": "I switched my active Metro PCS sim card from a Samsung phone to my Pixel 4a. Network settings on my Pixel show that Metro PCS is detected as the cell carrier, and I get a notification that I have voice mail messages, but I have no bars. I can't make or receive calls or texts. \n\nI've tried restarting several times, manually selecting a network, and automatically selecting network. It doesn't work whether the preferred service is 3g or 2g. The phone recently updated, but it still doesn't work.\n\nI've had to switch the SIM card back to the old Samsung just to have a working phone, but I'm really desperate to get the new device working. Please help!",
