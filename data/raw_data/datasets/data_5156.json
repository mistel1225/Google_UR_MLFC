    "content": "I recently got a Pixel 4A 5g. It has generally been a pretty good phone, but one feature is driving me absolutely up a wall.\n\nPicture this:\nYou're playing a game in which tools fall to the bottom of your screen. You drag them up from the bottom to the main part of the screen. However, about half the times you do this, the whole app gets dragged up into that view where you see all your open applications. \n\nScenario #2: \nYou're playing Hearthstone, and your hand of cards are all at the bottom of the screen. You try to drag from the bottom, up to the board. Again, every time you do this, the app switches out to something else!\n\nWhat can I do about this? I generally like the gesture mode of navigation, but had to switch back o the  3-button mode, because it makes games basically unplayable.\n\nDo I just have to accept that? Keep gestures on and then switch to 3-button-mode when I want to play a game?",
