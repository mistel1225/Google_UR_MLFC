    "content": "Hello there,\n\nI got my Pixel 3a XL for a week now and since yesterday I'm not able to charge it with the original fast charger that came with it. With a different USB A To C cable it works, though very slow.\n\nWhen I plug in the original charger one of the following happens:\n- Nothing. I have to flip the cable like in the old USB days (wtf)\n- It charges in a one second Interval. Meaning I hear the sound/vibration when it starts charging, but then it immediately stops charging, starts chargings, stops charging... and so on.\n\nI already factory reset my phone, which didn't help. I tried a different charger from a galaxy phone. Same happens there. Only with a USB A to C cable which is plugged in a PC I am able to charge...\nI don't think that there is dirt in there...\n\nWhat could that be?",
