    "content": "When I plug in my pixel three into the audio jack of my Honda cross tour the audio does not transmit into my audio system. This includes play music, Pandora, podcasts. I have checked and the cord is fine because when I plug into any other sort of device speaker whatever it works. Also, any other device connected to the A/UX cable to the Honda work fine.it’s just there’s something that seems incompatible between a pixel three and my 2012 Honda. Is there a fix for this?",
