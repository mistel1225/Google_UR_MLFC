    "content": "I've been having the weirdest problem lately. When I charge my phone and keep it in regular mode, it works ok but when I put it on airplane mode, the battery drains. The screen would be black but then lights up as if the phone was shut down and starting. Then a couple of minutes later, it happens again. Before I know it, the battery drains. Outside of airplane mode, it works fine. \n\nI charged my phone a few hours ago. Put it on airplane mode for an hour, the phone went from 100% to 77%. Took it off airplane mode, a few hours later its at 75%. \n\nHas anyone experienced anything like this? Any suggestions would be appreciated!\n\nThanks!",
