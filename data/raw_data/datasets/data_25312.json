    "title": "Strange -asking assistant to speak the date",
    "content": "This is very strange.  When I ask assistant for the date it mostly just pops up the answer instead of speaking the answer. It is intermittent.  I'll number everything so it's clear\n\n1. All day on 12/16/19 the Date would just pop up\n2. I erased the phone and put it back and redid the settings and date and time did not voice me back\n3 after 5 min the time started to voice me back but not the date\n4. After another 5 min the date started to voice me back\n6. As I was exiting off the highway my phone locked up and after unlocking it the date would just pop up again and the voice wouldn't work\n7. I get home the time would work but not the date\n8. I fell a sleep and got up the next morning and tried my old pixel 2 and both the date and time work perfectly\n9. As I put on the pixel 2 the date came back on my pixel 4.\n10 aftere 15 min the date went away again.  \n\nSteps I did to troubleshoot deleted cache and storage in google and put it back. I tried to uninstall new update but it wouldn't allow me to work it unless I put the update back. I also hecked other settings \nsuch as continued conversations, gestures etc.  \n\nA few other things I discovered.  \n\n1.If I went into the google search engine website and pushed the mic and ask it for the date that \nworked.  \n\n2  when the date wasn't working by voice by saying what the date today ?  -- it did work consitantly when I sate \"what is the date of this month\"  \n\nAgain intermittently It would respond to what is todays date.  \n\nAll other commands work \n\nPlease help",
