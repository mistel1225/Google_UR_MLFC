    "content": "Hello! My problem is that in the call mode both speakers work and create an echo (PIXEL 2). When I call someone, not only the upper speaker near the ear, but also the lower one works. The interviewee hears his voice from the lower speaker. What to do? I reinstalled the system, updates were installed, nothing helps.",
