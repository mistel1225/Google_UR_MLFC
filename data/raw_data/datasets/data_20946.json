    "content": "Everyday my phone troubles me as at some moment it stops receiving calls and even I am not able to call when I call it ends the call itself. In the other persons phone it says my phone is switched off when it isn't. I restart it to make it work but then the problem reoccurs. I have tried factory resetting the phone but even that didn't work. The problem persists even after 4 months. I have missed a lot of important calls due to the problem. Please help!",
