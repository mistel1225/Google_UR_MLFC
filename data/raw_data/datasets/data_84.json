    "content": "Hello -\n\nI recently had to do a factory reset on my Pixel 3 because it was stuck in a continual boot loop. When I am given the option to copy a back up, the back up does not show up as a choice. I can find it in the Drive app and also via Chrome on the phone and my computer. \n\nIs there any way to manually restore the back up from the app or the web?\n\nAll Google support is saying to to make sure I am logged into the proper Google account!\n\nAlso, I am running Google 11 after the reset so the version is higher than what is backed up as required.",
