    "content": "I've had the same cell number for 29 years and a separate Google Voice number and I normally get spam calls on both numbers on a daily basis. If after I let my Pixel XL screen them and they hang up I go to the Contacts app and mark them as spam. I do the same thing on my Google Voice app if it comes in on that number. Now both have lost the ability or option to mark them as spam. I don't understand what happened? Both apps? Why?",
