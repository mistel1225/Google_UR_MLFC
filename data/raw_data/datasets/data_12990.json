    "title": "Why my Pixel XL 3 settings always revert it's settings (e.g. clock, disp) after I restart my phone?",
    "content": "few days ago, I got my pixel turned black and boot-looped. Suddenly it fixed by itself and work normally (I don't feel any glitch or something). But the only problem I got, If I restart my phone, all settings like clock, battery, display, vibration for notification always back to factory default. Can I do something about it? Thank you.",
