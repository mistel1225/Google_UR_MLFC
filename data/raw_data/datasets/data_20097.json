    "content": "Chose the Pixel for it's camera especially for video and streaming. However the camera overheats and shuts down the phone after a few minutes and makes it useless for streaming. Never had this problem with any other phone. The only app running is Droidcam which links the phone to streaming software. Used it on previous phones with no problem.",
