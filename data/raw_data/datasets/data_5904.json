    "title": "Need single tap call answer on Pixel4A, Android 11. Stupid new swipe up.",
    "content": "I really hate swiping to answer my phone and my 86 year old Mother-in-law does not like it either. Used to be able, on previous versions of Android, to set Single Tap Answer. That seems to have disappeared. Now we upswipe. UGH, Who came up with this? ONe handed-single tap is the easiest way to answer. The elderly also understand the concept of touch the green button to answer and touch the red button to refuse or to later, hang up. Need this back.",
