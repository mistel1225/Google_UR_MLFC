    "content": "My search bar and some apps are crashing, but not all. I first noticed the kindle app crashing before it opened my library while I was at work, but I was using it before work today. Also crashing are the home screen search bar, gmail, prime music, and a sleep and alarm clock app. Photos, sms, maps, phone, and brave browser are not. Search bar and gmail still crash in safe mode. \nI've restarted a few times, left the phone off for about 30 minutes, no change. Android update is current. When looking at my apps, kindle and several others were updated today around 1600, shortly after I got to work, so I'm guessing that's related, but I have no idea what to try next.",
