    "content": "I can send contact cards but I can't receive them through Messages app from any phone, iphone, pixel, samsung, etc. .... I've tried calling GOOGLE to get their help and they weren't able to figure it out. I've tried to long-press the unloaded card to save it and then import it from the contacts app, but it's not working. I've tried clearing the cache memory of the Messages App. All the permissions for the Messages app are on except for location.  I'm super frustrated.... I love my pixel 2 but this is definitely frustrating and upsetting.",
