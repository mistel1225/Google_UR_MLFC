    "content": "Hi Pixel Team,\n\nI've recently purchased a Pixel 2 XL and been experiencing this issue for about 3 times a day randomly. \nThe UI was just unresponsive, I usually couldn't click anything on the screen but the physical buttons. Sometimes during that I could click some items but the screen responded really slowly. This issue would go away in about a minute, looks like there was some kind of performance spike. \n\nHere are 2 videos describing the issue: https://photos.app.goo.gl/yu39fzw3Skjs362B6\n\nThings I've tried but they didn't help:\n0. Update system to latest version (until 2020 February security update)\n1. Restart\n2. Factory Reset\n3. Reduce or increase Pointer Speed\n3. Use another launcher instead of Pixel Launcher\n\nPlease take a look because this affects user experience badly.\nThank you.",
