    "title": "Google: worst customer service EVER. Pre-ordered (2) Pixel 4 xl and only (1) $150 credit POLICY! BS",
    "content": "Preordered (2) Pixel 4 xl + Pixel 3 xl, spent $3500 CAD for (3) phones and they only provided me with (1) $150 store credit for the preordered. Asked if they can make an exception given the amount i spent and technically preordered (2) phones, they said no because of Policies. \n\nI have never seen a company so careless for customers who pay money and support their products. They advised that this no way to credit my account, provide discount, offer free products, etc. which is a completely false in my opinion. \n\nLast year Google did the same with the Pixel 3, where they launched the product and just over a month later they discounted the phone for black Friday. You would think with all the negative feedback Googl would learn, but sure enough same thing again this year with the Pixel 4. I didnt even ask for a price match and just wanted my preorder credit and which not unreasonable for a company the size of Google. The phone is okay (not the best on the market imo), but the customer service will ensure that I will never buy a Google product again.",
