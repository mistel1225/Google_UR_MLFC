    "content": "I commonly keep my phone in my right front pocket of whatever pants I am wearing when hiking/jogging.  During these activities I use two apps - Sports Tracker and Open Camera.  Unsure if these have any effect on the issue but mentioning them for completeness.\n\nThe Sports Tracker(ST) app drives two Bluetooth devices - A Wahoo TickrX heart band and a Jabra 35 earpiece (for voice feedback from app).\n\nOpen Camera (OC) is the default app when I want to take a photo, so is activated with a power button double click.\n\nToo often, I will find that the phone somehow gets active on the lockscreen in my pocket and tries to \"butt dial\" stuff.  I attach a screenshot instance of this.\n\nThen there have been a few times, like today, when somehow, the phone in my pocket went to airplane mode and I lost the connections to my BT devices through the ST app, ,which just happened to screw up my recording of a new personal speed record!  Annoying!\n\nThe only time I use the ST app on my activities in when I open it to press the LAP or STOP buttons.  I always click the power button to turn the screen off when done.  \n\nSame for the OC app.  After taking a photo, I click the power button to turn the phone off.\n\nBut still, I occasionally will hear the phone being active in my pocket and dialing stuff.\n\nAny ideas why this might be happening and how to fix?\n\nPhone is up-to-date with latest monthly fix download.\n\n-----------------\nThis is an example of my phone somehow becoming active inmy pocket on the lockscreen and trying to type my pin.  As you can see, the phone is locked.",
