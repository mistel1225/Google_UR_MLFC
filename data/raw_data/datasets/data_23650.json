    "content": "I have a google pixel 3. My phone and all of my apps are up to date. I have my phone set to dark mode and all apps that offer dark mode are also on dark mode without any issue.\n\nToday, my Gmail app suddenly no longer appears in dark mode. I tried to change the settings but the theme options/options to change Gmail to dark mode is no longer showing up in the app settings. I force stopped the app and it didn't work. I uninstalled updates, reinstalled updates, and it still doesn't work/show dark mode option.\n\nI restarted my phone, still nothing. I turned dark mode on/off on my phone and still nothing. \n\nI don't understand why Gmail stopped appearing in dark mode, why the option to turn on dark mode is no longer available in-app, and why it won't go dark even though my phone settings are set to dark mode. This happened from one to day to another and makes absolutely no sense. \n\nScreenshot attached showing my Gmail settings and how theme/dark mode is no longer there.",
