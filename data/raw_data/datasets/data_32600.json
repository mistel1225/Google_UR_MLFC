    "title": "Why didn't google replace my pixel in India when the vibrator motor failed for the 1st time?",
    "content": "Less than 2 yrs old pixel mobile of mine is facing the vibrator motor issue for the 4th time. Within 6 months of purchase it failed. I pleaded the indian customer service to replace the mobile but the showed me the doors to service centre and promised to ensure that the issue will not happen again. 6 months down the line almost a month before the warranty was about to expire, same issue, again service centre although I cried out loud that the device is faulty and having seen it to happen again I knew that replacement is not a fix. But in vain since in warranty I replaced it. Again in October 2018 it failed, again the same service centre, only difference is I am charged a sum of around Rs 1500 for replacement and service. Now it's been 6 months again it failed. Such a wonderful mobile but a bad experience for a faithful customer who used Nexus 5 earlier. I am sorry to say I would really like to also stop using all Google's services out of frustration but since I have no choice I can most dump the mobile and stick with medium range phones. Brian Rakowski did agree some time back in the news that the mobile has a lot of repetitive hardware issues and for such customers the device was replaced, but this I believe in US. I think as a India I don't deserve a service like this. I feel it to be total racism. \n\nI would like to finally Mr. Brian Rakowski, the VP of product development of pixel and my fellow indian CEO of Google Mr. Sundar Pichai for selling a worthless product with a premium price tag. I deserve this for believing in you GOOGLE.",
