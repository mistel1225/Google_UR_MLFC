    "content": "Suddenly, today, a number of my apps, including mail apps and key ring, have crashed (didn't even know some were running). I try to send feedback, but sending feedback crashes. I have freed over 3GB of memory. I have re-booted and started in safe mode and removed one new app installed a day or two ago. THis is on a Pixel XL.",
