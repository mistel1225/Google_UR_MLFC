    "title": "Face ID not verifying, crashing my phone",
    "content": "I've had the the Google Pixel 4XL since late April. So far as of a week ago my phone has been buggy and weird. Starting off, my phone continues to tell me \"Can't verify face\" though I've reset my Face ID numerous times, through the error I also get rebooted, my phone completely crashes on me. I've looked up possible problems with my phone, so far I've only seemed to have found \"fault battery\" or computing error. I was thinking about sending my phone to Verizon to have it repaired but I think I should get some insight or further information about my situation.",
