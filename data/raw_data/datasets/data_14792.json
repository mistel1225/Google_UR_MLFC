    "content": "On previous versions of Android I have been able to control the Audible app from my lock screen (play, pause, rewind, fast forward) but cannot do this on the Pixel 4a. I have been able to change the settings to allow other media players to show in the lock screen (e.g. Spotify, BBC sounds, Google Podcasts, Podkicker etc.) but am unable find any settings that allow me to see the Audible controls.",
