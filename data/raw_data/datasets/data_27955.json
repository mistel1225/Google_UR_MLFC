    "content": "Whenever I open the camera app it opens for a second and then closes. I noticed that if I try and use the front facing camera it is fine but when I switch to the back camera it crashes. \n\nThis started after I updated to the July Security Patch.\nI have tried resetting my phone, clearing the cache and storage of the google camera app and uninstalling updates and reinstalling them. \n\nI also noticed that sometimes it randomly works for a few seconds but can't focus and then it eventually crashes again.\nOther apps also hang when I try and use the rear camera.\n\nIs there anything else I should do before having to factory reset my phone or having to get a replacement?",
