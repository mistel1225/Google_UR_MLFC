    "content": "I've checked all the settings and notification options I can find - all the phone options for displaying are in the on position and greyed out. As far as I know I have allowed every notification possible to see it it will wake up the lock screen when a call comes in but I'm stumped. Right now I've activated the wee header option to see who's calling but it's not ideal - any help greatly appreciated. Thx",
