    "content": "I switched from an iPhone to the Pixel 3a about 2-3 weeks ago, turned off iMessaging and FaceTime connected to my email before I traded-in the iPhone.\n\nI was receiving group messages fine the first week, but all of a sudden have stopped receiving them. Not sure what could have changed.\n\nI've troubleshooted based on other threads similar to this one and haven't found a solution. Here is what I've tried:\n\n1. I de-registered my old iPhone from my Apple ID, to be super sure nothing is connected there.\n\n2.\"\nPlease open the Phone's Settings, search for the Apps and Notifications / Apps.\nThen App List.\nSearch for Android Messages App .\nOnce you open that app, in the top right corner of the screen you will see three parallel dots.\nYou will see the option \"Uninstall latest update\", please tap on Uninstall and confirm.\"\n\n3. I've also disabled \"Enhanced LTE\" in Network Settings.\n\nAnyone having similar issues? Anyone found anything that works?",
