    "title": "Do not have 5G on Pixel 5 on Spectrum Mobile - tried everything and no answers - HELP!!",
    "content": "I've been given the runaround from Spectrum tech support and I don't know where else to go.  I've tried everything to get 5G in my area (Greater Charlotte, NC area, 5G coverage in the entire area).  I've rebooted in safe mode, I've swapped SIMs from the Spectrum store, I have the plan, etc., etc.  Nothing.  Still LTE.  Whereas I know LTE is faster in a lot of cases, I bought a Pixel 5 and it should have 5G.  I've also had the SIM card reprovisioned a few times.  One lady hung up on me after telling me it was a Google problem and transferred me to a manless Google support phone number.\n\nI don't know what else I can do or try.  Please help.  Thanks!",
