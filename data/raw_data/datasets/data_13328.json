    "content": "Question is in the title, I expect to pay but I don't know where to go. Basically I'm asking for a shop, that replaces batteries due to usual degradation after 2 years and not because of a failure. As far as I know, Google only replaces the battery in the ladder case. I live in Germany and have Pixel 4 btw.",
