    "title": "How Do I Stop Pixel 5 Wallpaper From Changing Automatically?",
    "content": "Problem 1: I own a pixel 5, and I recently took a new photo that I wanted to set as my wallpaper for my home screen and my lock screen. After I set the photo, I discovered that it automatically changed to a pre-loaded stock photo, so I set it back to my photo. The next morning, it changed to a stock photo again. HOW do I keep my photo as the ONLY photo for my lock screen and my home screen? I don't want to see daily automatic changes to my wallpaper -- I just want to keep the same photo until I decide if I want to change it. Problem 2: I have an Alexa Auto unit which I successfully used with my Pixel 3. I erased the memory of the device from the Pixel 3 settings, but I cannot connect to my Pixel 5. Is this Alexa unit possibly incompatible with Android version 11? I also had a similar problem with a Google watch, and ended-up having to buy a new watch.",
