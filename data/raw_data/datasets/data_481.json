    "content": "I was experiencing issues with my phone so I backed up using Google One and the internal backup in the settings. I then factory reset the phone and restored it and everything seemed fine but a day later my text messages have vanished. I really need these old text messages for documentation. I've since reset the phone again and it did the same thing. It's like there is some other internal backup that is restoring and deleting my messages.",
