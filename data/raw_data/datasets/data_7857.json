    "content": "My mobile keeps switching off my data without me doing anything, which is annoying since I can't use my data and I don't have internet when not at home. I tried rebooting phone, checking battery saver options, turning it on several times, and nothing works. It does allow me to active the button, but as soon as I go back to the menu, is already off again. Any ideas?",
