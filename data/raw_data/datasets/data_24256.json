    "title": "Phone crashed and not switching on",
    "content": "My phone fell down on hard surface and crashed, I m not sure if phone battery is full or gone for ever, there is no charging orange light probably that too would have crashed. after pressing power button and volume low key for more than 30 secs, screen did switched on, google logo too appeared but again off showing battery icon. \nand android chest open screen does come but with message no command selected which i tried not less than 28 times but failed.\nI m not happy with the phone at all since I have bought December 2016. always space is the problem, not user friendly or its for tech savvy not for commoners, I could not delete multiple phone numbers in one go from contacts.\nIn compare to Note 3 I would give only 3* rating to google.\nArchana Bhalla",
