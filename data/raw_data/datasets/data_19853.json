    "content": "I've reviewed previous answers already. I bought a pixel 4 and the first day I immediately saw the flickering. I got the lastest update and the flickering continues. I don't have the device anymore so I can't test solutions.\n\nI don't think these questions are answered yet:\n1. Does it happen to all devices or some?\n2. The latest update didn't solve the issue, why not? Does it mean it's a hardware problem?\n3. Is it really a solution to lock the refresh rate to 90hz?\n\nThank you",
