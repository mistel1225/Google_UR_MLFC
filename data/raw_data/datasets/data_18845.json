    "content": "B2X Services were down for 3 months because of COVID-19 situation and before hand I had a mail conversation for the repair of the same. I was told that though the services are down whenever my Phone would be picked up and gone for repairing they would consider it's warranty as one-time and would repair it accordingly. But after the diagnosis is over, the dashboard says that my mobile is out of warranty and I have been charged an amount of 18000 INR. \nCan anyone help me regarding the same. I can even share the mail conversation details for better reference\n\nMy Phone's warranty ended on 8th April, 2020 and I had contacted them and raised the concern regarding the same on 27 February, 2020 and was assured of the one-time exception warranty concern on 27 March, 2020.\n\nCan anyone please help me out ?",
