    "content": "I am on my second Pixel 4XL. The colors are faded and washed out. Side by side with my Pixel 2XL using the same wallpaper of my dog on a bright red sofa, the Pixel 4 looks like all the colors are lighter, faded and have no saturation. I buy pixels because of a great camera. But with the Pixel 4XL, I look at all my Instagram photos and they are bland. What is the point of paying $1,000 for a phone/camera and having faded photos? I have tried all menu settings and configurations and am on a second phone with the same issue.\nAm I the only one? This is so disappointing because if Google doesn't fix it, I'll have to find another brand.",
