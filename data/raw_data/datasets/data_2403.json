    "content": "I want to cast to my Chromecast ultra using my phone. I used to be able to, and still can from Chrome Web Browsers. \n\nI can cast to my other Chromecast with no issues. \nI have rebooted rooter and unplugged Chromecast and reconnected both at same time. This is a one time cast fix. \nI have factory reset my Chromecast ultra several times. \nWhen adding my Chromecast ultra, the Google Home app says its been added but can't be found and phone\\chromecast ultra aren't on same network (they are and both on same bandwidth).\nWhen in an app to cast, such as Netflix, the Chromecast appears as an option, but the connection always fails. \n\nAny help? I'm going crazy!",
