    "content": "I bought my Google Pixel 4XL in December 2019. The screen out of nowhere turned green and black, and kept glitching. I restart it, power off, restore it from factory, and nothing worked. I took some videos of how my phone looks. At some point the screen go back to the original, but after a few minutes, the green screen begun again. My phone has been like this since 10 hours ago. I didn't crashed it, neither had some accident or bump with the phone. Which I why I am very concerned since I just bought it 6 months ago. I hope you can help me.",
