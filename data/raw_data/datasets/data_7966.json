    "content": "I am thinking of buying the Google Pixel 4a (or 4a with 5g). I travel to India often, and I usually use a Jio sim (4G LTE) sim there. Previously, my Jio sim has not worked with US bought phones. Will it work with Google Pixel 4a unlocked phone bought in US? Will the 5g version work in India?\nThanks",
