    "content": "Hi all,\n\nMost likely, this is not a pixel 3 related issue. Either way, maybe someone can help me here.\nStarting a week or so, the auto sync settings in the Settings->Accounts is turning on automatically automatically after i manually turn it off. Does anyone knows what setting/app may be responsible for this?\nOr, alternately, does anyone know a way for me to find the culprit? \n\nThanks in advance!",
