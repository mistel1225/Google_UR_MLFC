    "content": "After updating, my 3AXL will randomly shut off at night when plugged into a charger. I'm not sure if anything happens before it shuts off, but I've woken up to the 100% charged graphic about 5 times now. The update is the only thing that's changed, no new apps or settings or anything.",
