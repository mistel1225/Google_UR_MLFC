    "content": "INstead of using the quick switch adapter and the android charging cable, I just used the type c to type c cable that came with my new pixel.   The transfer is taking forever (admittedly a lot of data - it did not give me choice of which data to transfer.  My pixel battery will run out before data transfer complete.  How long should I expect data transfer to take?   My old phone says \"copying your accounts\" and the Pixel 4a says \"getting account info\" with arrows going both ways.  Thanks for any info/hints/help.  Should I just stop the process and try it again with the Quick Switch adapter?",
