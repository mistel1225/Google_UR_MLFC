    "title": "Phone Dead in morning after sitting on Pixel Stand overnight",
    "content": "Three times now my phone has been dead in the morning even though it was charging on the stand when I went to bed. I make sure it says charging rapidly before I go to bed to make sure it's on there right and everything is good so I was shocked to find it dead in the morning. No there were no power outages or anything like that.\n\nAny idea what could be causing this? Has anyone else experienced this?\n\nMy case is the basic Tech 21 case so I would not think it would be causing any real interference.",
