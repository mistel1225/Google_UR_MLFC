    "content": "I bought this phone brand new from Google for my father.\n\nIt's been a few months, and the back camera has stopped working. The front camera is fine.\n\nWhen switching to the back camera a black screen appears, and then nothing.\n\nWe've tried to clear cache, restart, but nothing. \n\nHas anyone experienced anything like this? \n\nUnfortunately, I'm trying to resolve this via Zoom and don't have direct access to his phone.",
