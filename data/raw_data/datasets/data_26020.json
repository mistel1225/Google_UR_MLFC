    "title": "\"Photos\" search/menu bar displays spurious suggestions which are unnecessary and distracting",
    "content": "In Photos, there is a search/menu bar at the top of the screen that is persistent.  In the bar there is always some search suggestion which has nothing to do with anything.  Today it says: Search \"safari\", of all things!  I find these suggestions distracting. Just the word \"search\" or the magnifying glass icon would be adequate.\nI have not been able to find a way to turn off the suggestions.  Any help would be appreciated.",
