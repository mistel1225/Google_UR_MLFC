    "content": "I've switched from OnePlus to Pixel 4A 5G.\n\nReally happy with the phone and very nice to get all the latest Android updates fresh out of the oven.\n\nHowever, with all the coming improvements, I am still lacking gesture improvements.\nIn particular, coming from OnePlus, I am desperately missing the usability of:\n- three-finger swipe for a screenshot\n- locked-screen circle swipe for turning flashlight on/off\n\nWhile the first issue could be resolved with a third party app, the latter one cannot as it requires core-, or system-level support.\n\nI am wondering therefore, is it theoretically possible that Google might consider such improvements in the future, or are those gestures somehow trademarked and patented by OnePlus so that it's impossible to get it into the stock Android?\n\nTo me, the openness of Android should in practice mean that it would get better by taking into use all the features that are developed by other manufacturers.\n\nAm I the only one?",
