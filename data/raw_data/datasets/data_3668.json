    "content": "I bought a pixel 4a recently and have been using it for around 3 weeks now. I just wanted to clear unnecessary data. I was checking \"Apps Storage\" in Settings and I noticed that the \"Google app\" occupies around 1 GB. I was shocked. I investigated further to look at the breakup of the storage and user data is around 800 MB. Is this normal ? Just wanted to know if you guys see the same. I have attached a photo.",
