    "content": "Some streaming videos are not playing clear, seems a bit fuzzy. I know the video itself is fine since I will play the same stream side by side on my new pixel 3 and my old Kyocera Duraforce Pro on the same WiFi network. The video is crystal clear on the Kyocera but fuzzy on the pixel 3.",
