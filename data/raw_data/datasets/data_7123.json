    "title": "Persistent Gesture Bar in Games",
    "content": "The navigation gesture bar at the bottom of the screen won't go away when I am in games. It blocks any touches on that edge of the screen, which makes some games unplayable. It is only the gesture bar that persists, not the status bar as others have had issues with. Restarting the device only fixes the issue for a few minutes. This only happens in games, doesn't matter if it's landscape or portrait.",
