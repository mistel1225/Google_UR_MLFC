    "title": "Pixel 4a weak vibration and missing vibration intensity options",
    "content": "I already contacted Google Support and they explained that it was a conscious decision by Google to remove Vibration intensity options;   can no longer select low, medium or high, we can only turn it off or on  .\n\nThat being said, I find the vibration extremely weak compared to my old original Pixel phone.  I can't even tell that the phone is ringing when it's in my pocket, which is absolutely a big deal for me.  \n\nPotential solution:\nDoes anyone know of apps on the Google Play store that are safe to use and can adjust the vibration strength?",
