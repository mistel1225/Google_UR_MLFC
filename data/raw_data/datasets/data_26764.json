    "content": "Hello,\n\nMy Pixel 1 phone started hanging up the calls since some time ago. It kept doing it so I simply bought a new phone: Pixel 2. However, after just getting the phone today I discovered that it is doing the same exact thing. Basically the calls hang up at random times. Sometimes right at the start of the call, other times after several minutes. Both on incoming and ongoing calls. I looked up the apps that have access to my phone calls, and there are only six (all google apps: Android Auto, Contacts, Google, Google Play Store, Messages, and Phone). I've noticed that when I call using Whatsapp the calls don't hang up. At least not so far. This is extremely annoying and I need to find out what is causing it.",
