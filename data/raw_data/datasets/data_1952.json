    "content": "Hi. I just bouht Pixel 4a 5G two weeks ago and recently noticed 1cm long blue line just above front-facing camera. It's located over the edge of the LCD and it's only visible in sunlight (UV?) even when the screen is off.\n\nIs it one of the sensors or LCD failing? Will this get repaired under warranty?\n\nThanks",
