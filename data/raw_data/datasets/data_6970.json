    "content": "I leased a Pixel 4 through Sprint. It worked well but now since T-Mobile bought Sprint, the Sprint antennas are being decommissioned and replaced with T-Mobile antennas.  I now have poor connectivity for cellular and data. I spoke with T-Mobile and they explained that T-Mobile is rapidly getting rid of the Sprint antennas and the Pixel 4 is not compatible with T-Mobile's system.\n\nIs there a fix to this or is my Pixel 4 now useless? I chatted with a Google rep for an hour and got nowhere.",
