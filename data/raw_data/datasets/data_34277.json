    "content": "I recently upgraded from a Moto Z Play to a Pixle 2 XL. I factory reset the Moto Z Play and my wife set it up and is using it as her phone. Since I activated my Pixel 2 a month ago my Google account continues to recognize the Moto Z Play as my default device. I have gone to my account settings and removed the Moto from my device list. No luck. When using the Google \"Find My Device\" app or using Google Home to \"find my phone\" they all continue to try to reach my Moto Z Play which I wiped and no longer use. This seems to be a problem across my Google account because every avenue to \"find my device\" tries to reach the XT1635. You will see that under device options I have the option to remove the pixel but I don't have that option under the Moto Z. You will also see that the Moto Z is not even a listed device under my devices in Google account support. Any help would be appreciated.",
