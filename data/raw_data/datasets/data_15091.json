    "content": "Pixel 3 extremely laggy post Android 11 upgrade. The phone is barely usable now. I have not installed any new apps in the last 6 months. Ever since the Android 11 upgrade the phone has become very slow and laggy. Something seems to monopolize the processor so that it doesn't work properly any more. Please help with this. Thank you!",
