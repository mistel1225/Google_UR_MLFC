    "content": "I need better sound quality for voice calls.  It is hard to understand some people.  Perhaps a graphic equalizer would help, so I can turn up the 150Hz - 1K area?  I did a little Googling and Verizon talked about turning on HD Voice.  Can't find that under Google fi's website.  I got better sound quality with my old OnePlus, but sold that phone to get the Pixel so I could tower hop on Fi.  Really don't want to go back.",
