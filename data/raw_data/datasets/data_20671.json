    "content": "My phone had a hardware failure and I was directed to UbreakIfix.  Staff there told me Google declined the repair and give me a phone number and reference number to get a warranty replacement.  The phone number isn't staffed due to COVID so I contacted Google by email.  I was told technical problems are preventing return authorizations from being created.   That was 5 days ago.  How can I escalate this?",
