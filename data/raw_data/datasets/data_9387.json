    "content": "I received my new pixel 5 in the mail and activated my sim card two days ago. Everything works fine except the front camera. During video calls and front camera photos I get colourful lines running through the image. I tried a factory reset but the issue persists. \nVideo calls are much worse. Is it a device problem or a setting I can change?",
