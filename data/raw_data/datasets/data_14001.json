    "content": "Hi, \n\nWonder if anyone can help please. \n\nDoes the Pixel 4a support output to an external monitor via USB C, such as the Asus ZenScreen Touch or the Pepper Jobs XtendTouch? \n\nI have a 4a on pre-order, but if it doesn't support the above I will probably cancel it which is a real shame!\n\nThanks",
