    "title": "Google Pixel 2 XL is dead and took e-mail verification with it, is it hopeless?",
    "content": "My Google Pixel 2 XL died months ago and I now can't access my main email account, EvanDMowbray@gmail.com. I have the phone number it was tied to, I have the back-up email (an old childhood email that I set up way back in the day before 2-factor authentication was even a thing), and I know the password, but I don't have access to the screenshot I took of the codes since those didn't carry over to my new Samsung device. The account is still saying it's tied up in my dead phone. I need help. I've tried the support ticket multiple times where it says they'll get back to me after 3-5 agonizing days to return with a big fat \"can't verify it's you.\" I filled out another one today after waiting a few weeks to see if that helped. What kind of information do I need to put out there to verify it's me? Previous posts have included specific Amazon account purchases, which I'm still logged into from my current computer. I even specified a purchase of a new vehicle which should still be getting emails from the dealership. I'm really at a loss, and seeing as though one of my Minecraft account tied to the email is going to migrate over to a Microsoft-specific new service, looks like I'm going to have to purchase Minecraft again because of it.\n\nBelow are some of the walls I keep hitting, by design of course, but frustrating nonetheless. Any help would be greatly appreciated.",
