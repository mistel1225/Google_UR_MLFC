    "content": "My pixel 4xl shuts off randomly when receiving texts from one of my contacts. It only happens with this one contact. It's very random, like it happens maybe 3 or 4 times a weeks. I will hear the text notification, and then it shuts off, it doesn't show that I had gotten a text or anything. Even after I turn my phone back on, it doesn't tell me I have a new text. The new text is actually marked as read, even though I haven't opened it.",
