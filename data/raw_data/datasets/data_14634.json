    "content": "I want to go back to my old FB Messenger chat bubbles.  Not a fan of the new bubbles at all.  I miss the red # of unread messages notification and having the option, upon opening a chat bubble, to look at the list of messages and stories without having to open the actual Messenger app.\n\nIs there a way to disable this new chat bubble nonsense and go back to the way it was?",
