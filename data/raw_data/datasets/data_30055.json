    "content": "Sometimes, when I charge my phone the charging is on and off in a loop. You can see the screen on and off and hear the plugging sound again and again.\nWhen I plug the type c to type c cable to my laptop, the issue is gone.\nWhen I use another charger (samsung charger) it does not happen.\nI must admit that the issue occurs sometimes and not all the time.\nSometimes I restart my phone and it still occurs and sometimes it does solve the issue.\nIt happened about 6-7 times and I have this lovely phone from January 2019.\n\nWhat should I do?\n\nThanks\nTal K",
