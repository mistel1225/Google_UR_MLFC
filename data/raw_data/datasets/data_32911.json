    "content": "Phone is working fine.. but the the buttons on the side (power, volume) are unresponsive. I have tried holding, double taps, etc. with no luck. I haven't let it uncharged so it's still usable, but have no way to safely restart or reset. Has anyone seen this before / have a suggested fix?",
