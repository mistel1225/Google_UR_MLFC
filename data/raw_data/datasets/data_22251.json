    "content": "Hello, \n\nThis morning my Pixel 2 XL said \"Cannot load Android system.  Your data may be corrupt.  If you continue to get this message, you may need to perform a factory data reset and erase all user data stored on this device.\"\n\nWhen I choose \"try again\" the device boots to the lock screen, then goes to a black screen, then to a lock screen, then a black screen, every other second.  Whenever I try to unlock the lock screen, it goes black too fast for me to put in a passcode. \n\nI tried to load the latest OTA from March, but my device already was running it, and after I did so, it still has the same problem.  I am trying to not have to factory reset my device and lose all my data.  Is there a way for google to fix this, or possibly save my data without a factory reset?\n\nThank you\nRory",
