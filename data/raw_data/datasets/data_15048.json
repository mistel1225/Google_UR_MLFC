    "content": "I have recently updated my Google pixel 4a to Android 11, i have dark theme on for my phone and facebook messenger. Since the update, when i open Facebook messenger, i see white patch on the top and bottom of the messenger, when i exit the app and come back, everything is fine. It only happens when i open the app for the first time. See attached picture for more details. I tried turning the dark theme off for both the phone and facebook messenger, and then turned it back on but it didn't work. Any suggestions?",
