    "content": "Noticed that while playing audio on my pixel 5 randomly audio will cut out from one of the speakers. Some times it's the top speaker behind the glass other times the lower main speaker. Seems to happen completely at random one side cuts out then comes back a minute later.  This happened rarely when I first got the phone so I thought it was most likely a software bug on a new phone, but as time goes on it's just gotten worse. \n\nIs this a possible hardware problem with the speakers or a simple software bug Google will patch?",
