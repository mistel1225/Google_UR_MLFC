    "content": "Upgraded from pixel 2 to pixel 5. The messages app (android) took a few days to fully load and start working properly, as others have experienced. It's working well now, but not all of my text history is there - only goes back just over a year and I have at least 3 years history. I also isn't merging one of my contacts, so now I have a \"new\" thread with them and the old thread as separate somehow.",
