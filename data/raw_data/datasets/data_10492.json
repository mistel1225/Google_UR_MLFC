    "content": "I am trying to screen cast to different TVs in my house (which normally work perfectly well with other phone devices).\n\nHowever when i search for devices in my casting option within pixel phone, it doesn't recognise any of the TVs.\n\nI believe there is a genuine software fault with my phone as i have now spoken to support chat which was hugely time wasting and the only solution they gave me was to spend money on multiple chromecast devices in order to cast my screen.\n\nI am desperate to find a solution to this or an answer to why this is happening ?",
