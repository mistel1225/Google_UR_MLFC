    "content": "I have a Google Pixel 4 XL and I am having issues with Driving Mode turning on randomly throughout the day. I have driving mode turned off yet almost daily it gives me a message that it is turning driving mode on unless I hit stop, even when I am sitting at my desk at work. Another issue I have is that when I am in my car and have my phone connected via Bluetooth speaker my Google Assistant rarely works. If I ask her to text someone it will display what I just said for a brief second and then stop and not even complete the command, and it's not just with texting either, it doesn't execute any commands when I have my car turned on. On top of that the Assistant does not speak anymore when the car is on. Is this a common issue or do I have a faulty phone?",
