    "content": "When I click a pdf file on a web side it does nothing or opens a blank page.  I sent myself a test email with a pdf file attached and when it came through it was renamed \"winmail.dat\" file that said I do not have an app to open it.  I downloaded the file and renamed it to a \".pdf\" and it still gave me a message that there was no app to open it.  I do have the adobe app loaded",
