    "content": "Why is google's warrant claim process so awful? Is it designed to deter people of filing claims? \n\nI had a month-old pixel 5 fall 2 feet and completely stop working. Google support says I can either mail it in or take it to a repair shop. The google-authorized repair shop after 2 days realized they couldn't fix it and they aren't authorized to replace it. THey say go back to google. \n\nThen google support says I need to send in the phone so it can be inspected first before it's replaced. What's the point of driving out in the middle of a pandemic to a repair shop if google won't authorize them to replace the phone?! and how many people are trying to run scams on google that they have inspect the phone detect the phone and push me through all these hoops?",
