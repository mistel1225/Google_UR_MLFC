    "content": "Nothing recommended has worked. My pixel ( either a pixel or a 2a... not sure) just died, went blank. Plugged it in, left it awhile, seemed to come back to my home screen at 100% charged then went black again and the most I get is a lit screen saying google.  I can’t find any info on my phone because I can’t open it!",
