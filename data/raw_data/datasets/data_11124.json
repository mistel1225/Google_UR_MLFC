    "content": "Hi all,\n\nAnyone else have it when you go into tips and support to try and contact google directly but chat or email, but it just is not there. I only have send feedback, nothing like what is described here: https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/7109524?hl=en-GB&ref_topic=7084203\n\nI'm finding it incredibly hard and now frustrating trying to get into some kind of actual contact with them.\n\nThanks,\n\nChris",
