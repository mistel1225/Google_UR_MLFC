    "content": "About a week ago, I pulled my phone out of my pocket after driving to work to find it was off. I turned it back on and got the notification \"Phone shut down due to overheating\". Mind you, this was 6:00 in the morning and about 65° F outside, and when I grabbed my phone, it wasn't even warm. So no reason why phone would overheat. Then on the drive home, it was over 80° F and it didn't overheat. The next day, I had the phone on my lap while I drive to work, and the same thing happened. Then it happened again at work while it was in my pocket. It's been happening one to two times a day now. Is anyone else having this random \"overheating\" problem?",
