    "content": "While I'm mostly happy with this phone I'm beginning to get frustrated by buggy built in app issues. Managed to fix the issues with texts that existed from the start, but now I'm finding the Do Not Disturb feature doesn't accurately work regardless of permissions and settings, nor does the routine for my alarm. DND has permission for my stared contacts to be able to message or call, yet my phone never chimes or vibrates when it's on and those people try to contact me. For my alarm routine I'm trying to make it so it tells the weather for the day, then plays one of my playlists from YouTube music app. I had no issues with either of these topics on my last phone which is a Pixel 2. I also find the Bluetooth extremely slow to discover devices, connect to new ones, and it won't discover my Bluetooth ear phones even though other devices not previously connected to them have no issues finding them.\n\nAny help is greatly appreciated as I'm regretting buying this phone since I'm sick of having to troubleshoot it.",
