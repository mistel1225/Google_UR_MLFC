    "content": "I found a problem after March update.when my pixel2xl is changing,the phone suddenly drop into black screen,even some color block appear on the screen. Especially I was using the phone. When I stop changing,the problem disappeared.\nThe more strange thing is, when I use PD quick change power adapter,the problem often appears,but the problem doesn't appear when I use QC change adapter. I promise the adapters are OK.\nIs there anyone facing the same problem?",
