    "content": "Need help...I've been searching all over and don't seem to see any posts with people having similar problem.  I woke up today and all apps on my phone are greyed out except the Phone, Play Services, Contacts, Clock apps.  I cannot even open Settings.  When I click on an app I get a message \"App Isn't Available...XXX app isn't available right now.  This is managed by Google Play Services\".  I can uninstall the app and reinstall.  If I do, the App becomes available again.  The problem is I don't want to have to reinstall every app but more importantly, the Settings are not even available.  Can I hard reset the phone?  Since Play Store is available I checked for updates (there are none) and also looked for any recent updates and nothing related to Google.  I only had 2 apps update since yesterday.  Have never had a problem and Installed Android 11 the week it was launched so it's been running for a while with no issue.\n\nthank you",
