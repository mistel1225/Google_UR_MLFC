    "content": "In 2020, the time lapse resolution was 1920 x 1080 and they played back at the same resolution on photos.  There was a update to 3840 x 2160  but now they play back at a fixed 360 or 720 after storing at high quality.   They are still at high quality if I download them.  If I click on settings or speed, on any computer, it advances to the next photo.",
