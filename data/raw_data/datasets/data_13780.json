    "content": "Hello,\n\ndoes anyone feel that, the front camera is performing poorly during video calls?\nThe pictures through the camera app are fine. But I belive that to be because of the post-processing.\nMy picture quality during video calls resembles phones that I used maybe 6 years ago. Is there any way to adjust that or do we have to be satisfied with the outdated sensor without post-processing in video calls?\n\nFor reference my P20 performs lightyears ahead in this (but yeah different hardware)",
