    "content": "After I quit Android Q beta 2 version and restored official Android I'm noticing rear camera issue- image distortion and focus instability. It shakes in video/photo mode. I tried safe boot, cleared apps cache, rebooting twice, restoring to default settings, tried another camera app and nothing has helped me. I'm not noticing same issue with front camera.",
