    "content": "Hello,\n\nAfter ~2 weeks after purchase charging got inconsistent, e.g. printing 'Charging rapidly' and not progressing at all or '5 minutes until full' at 12% of battery level and so on.\n\nWhat I already tried:\n1. A different cable/charger. Didn't help.\n2. Battery calibration. I drained the battery to shutdown and tried to charge the phone. It only got to 30% after 2 hours.\n3. Cleaning the port.\n\nAfter cleaning it almost doesn't get stuck but charges very slowly, more than 2 hours from 1% to 100%. Inconsistent time of charging is still here too. Should I try anything else or it's the right time to contact Google support?",
