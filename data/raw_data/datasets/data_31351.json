    "content": "The touch screen doesn't work at all. It illuminates, i can see the unlock screen, but not responsive to touch, I can't unlock, the interesting part is that it's charging. It wasn't dropped or abused in any way, used only a couple of time, like new. Help please. i tried to factory reset, without success.",
