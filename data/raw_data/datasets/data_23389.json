    "content": "Hi! So basically, today I had to do a test and therefore had to shut my phone down. Once I finished my test I turned the phone back on and for some reason, the always-on display hasn't been working, Google Assistant hasn't been responding to me at all (can't even summon her), no notifications at all, all I hear are the vibrations but no notifications. My service data would automatically turn off even when I turn it on from the settings. I can't even access the second portion of the drop-down menu (you know when you drag your screen down from the top, a menu appears, then if you drag it once more, the whole menu appears with quick access to settings and whatnot). The home button doesn't work, nor does the recent apps page either. When I click the home button or swipe up to get the recent apps, they just don't do anything, at all. I can't even download apps from the Play Store anymore; I can only update and uninstall. I've tried restarting, I've tried going into safe mode but it hasn't done anything. Also, when I go over to the settings to try to enable my data or enable dark theme, and many other settings, they just don't work. When I click on them they turn on then when I leave the page and click back again it's off. I really don't know what to do. This all happened this morning when I turned my phone back on and I'm hesitant about factory reset because it's too much and too long. Thank youuuu!",
