    "content": "It seems everyone knows there is a phone destroying battery drain problem with these phones. They went from acting normally to going from 100% to 0 in no time for no reason. I did an update one night that literally bricked my phone. It couldn't even start up again when it was acting normally just the day before.         \nI'm assuming it's a firmware update or a hardware incompatibility issue with the new Pi or Andriod 9. Here's the thing:  I've done everything they said to try to fix battery life. I've tried only using stock apps safe mode looking at every battery drain issue turning off literally everything and nothing works. I've changed from adaptive battery to non-adaptive. I've bought three different units of the exact same phone. ( 128 silver original pixel)  I replaced the battery. Nothing. Same issue. If google is going to purposely nerf phones as soon as they're out of warranty I think everyone should either boycott google and their products and just assume they've gone downhill as fast as these batteries or we get an answer on this and a real fix  I mean this month because this is an environmental disaster, unfair to their customers and downright evil. This is just basic scammer crap. Google caused the problem. They need to fix it.",
