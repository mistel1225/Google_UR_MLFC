    "content": "Just got my Pixel 5 a few days ago. I setup Bedtime from 10pm to 6am. Bedtime turns on just fine, I even like the \"everything turns black/white\", but when Bedtime turns off at 6am the DnD does not turn off.\nVery frustrating that I have to manually enable notifications every morning.",
