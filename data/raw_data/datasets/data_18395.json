I was to wait for 2 emails, one to confirm I wanted \"advance replacement\" and one with return shipping label for the defective phoned. It has been 2 days and I have heard nothing. Can someone please help? I need an operable phone for my business. CASE ID 6-7985000030629.   Thank you, Jason Hopper.",
