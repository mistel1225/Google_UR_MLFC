    "content": "My Pixel 3 XL has been having issues charging for the last few weeks. I have tried using multiple different USB-C cables and Google power accessories (I don't know what you call the block that goes into the wall). I have a Google Pixel XL that I'm currently using as my phone until I can find out what's going on with the phone. Anyone else have the same problem?",
