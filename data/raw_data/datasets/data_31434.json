    "content": "I got my new pixel early April. Just found out when my finger go over the Proximity and ambient light sensor, the screen turn off for a second. I first noticed it when taking pictures or swipe down for top options, but want sure what's going on. Eventually, I figured it happens every time my finger goes over the Proximity and ambient light sensor.  The black screen is very annoying. Please help!",
