    "content": "My Pixel 3XL is faulty and it was bought in the UK.  Contacted support team for replacement but they keep saying that the only option is to repair in India but I don't have a spare mobile to use for 30 days and neither interested to purchase a new one use for 30 days (till the faulty one repaired).  Please help me to escalate this case, it's been going on for more than one and half month.  No Supervisor level who is definitely won't be able to help.",
