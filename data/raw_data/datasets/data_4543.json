    "content": "As of last night, I followed the advice of removing the update which created a temporary fix. Woke up to my apps pulling disappearing acts all over again. Was told that the app had been properly fixed and ready to update, but when I attempt to update it says is \"pending\" and has been saying so for the past 15 minutes. Tried to use Gmail to contact support, but it quit on me. Again.",
