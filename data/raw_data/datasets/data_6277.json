    "content": "My new Pixel 4 seems to have two modes:\n1) I've turned off all lock features (because I'm home, and it's lockdown), and the screen just won't turn off. I squeeze the power button and it goes dark, but when I set it on the desk it just turns on again. I've turned on the feature that should make the screen sleep after a few seconds. How do I get the screen to turn off so my battery doesn't die?\n\n2) Smart Lock is on, when connected to my car's bluetooth. I'm driving and squeeze the power to sleep. The next time I need to check directions, I've apparently locked it and need to enter my PIN, despite still being on bluetooth. How do I turn the screen off but not lock it?\n\nWhy do both of these things happen??? I just want my phone to be always unlocked in the smart lock places, but have the screen sleep to save battery.",
