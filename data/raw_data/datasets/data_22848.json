    "title": "Bluetooth connects but more often than not doesn't send media audio.",
    "content": "I have searched through the forums and not found a thread or solution exactly to my issues with my Pixel 2 XL (though I'm sure it's out there somewhere). My Bluetooth will connect perfectly fine with devices, no problem there. The problem is that media-type audio (most of the time) will not come through, and yes I obviously have the device (my Bluetooth earphones in this case) set to media in the settings. The audio will cut out from the phone as if it's sending it to my devices, but NO SOUND will come through. There is even some white noise on my earbuds like normal so I know the device is working and ready to receive audio. The weird thing, is that when I make calls I get audio perfectly fine!! Example, I can make calls back and forth through my headset with NO ISSUES, but I'll jump to youtube to watch a video and I get NO SOUND.\n\nPLEASE HELP!\n\nI have tried:\n-Turning phone and device on and off again\n-Unpairing and re-pairing device\n-Clearing Bluetooth cache and storage data\n-Updating to the most recent OS update\n-Using different Bluetooth devices\n-Resetting phone to factory default settings\n\nNOTHING IS WORKING! HELP - SO ANNOYING! I love everything else about this phone!!\n\nThanks,\nRyan",
