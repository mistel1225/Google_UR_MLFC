    "content": "Pretty self-explanatory, my old phone with EMUI used to allow you to toggle the flash/torch while recording a video, which was super useful in an abrupt low-light situation.\n\nIs this feature available with the built-in Camera app (I've tried) or if not, will I have to use a third-party app or can this be added?",
