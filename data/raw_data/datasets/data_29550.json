    "content": "I bought a pixel 3a two months ago from google  fi.  It started having problems a week ago.  I contacted  support and after talking to five different people for more than four hours they siad their superiors would get back to me by email.  4 days later no one has responded.  I contacted them again and today got the same response.  They admit the phone is well under warrany but say they can't authorize replacing it because it is in the testing phase.  Now the phone won't turn on or charge.  They still tell me their superiors must deal with it and that I have no opition but  to wait.  It seems to me that I have two options.  First, contact Mastercard and let them reimburse me and charge google fi.  Second, take google to small claims court for their failure to honor their warranty and sue them for the value of the phone and for the time I have spent dealing with it.  I so far have been unable to find any other way to contact people who might actually do something to help.",
