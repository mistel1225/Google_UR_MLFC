    "content": "I have restarted the phone in safe mode and no sound works. I have done a factory reset and the sound worked for several hours before stopping again. I am running on android 11 and everything is up to date. Headphones do work, but people can not hear me when I call them, so assume the microphone is not working as well. I also have no vibrations and the phone is not in do not disturb mode. If you have any suggestions, thank you in advance!",
