    "content": "The adapter in question works properly on a different Samsung device, and multiple online sources say the apple adapter is supposed to work well with pixel 5. \n\nWhen I connect the audio from what ever I am playing doesn't go through, and the connected speakers/headphones only receive a \"clicking\" noise. \n\nOther forums on line about a similar issue but for older devices, the posted solutions don't work, and no one mentioned the clicking noise.\n\nThe some of the solutions I have found is to boot in safe mode, and to clean the ports.\n\nBooting in safe mode didn't work, and I bought the phone new less than a month ago, so there wouldn't be that much pocket lint or other debris in the usb port.",
