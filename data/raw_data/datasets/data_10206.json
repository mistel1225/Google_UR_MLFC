    "content": "After about 30 minutes of use, all the audio apps on my phone start cutting out. This happens with Google Play Books, Pocket Casts, and Spotify. It happens whether I am using bluetooth, wired headphone, or just the phone's speakers. I've deleted apps and reinstalled them with no luck. Please advise.",
