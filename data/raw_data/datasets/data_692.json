    "content": "Using google phone app for visual voicemail on ATT. When I receive a voicemail, it puts a \"+\" in front of the number but it does not put the \"1\" since I am in the US. When I click on \"voice call\" or \"text\" it tries to connect / send to an international number.  I have not been able to resolve via any settings, or via ATT support.  I was on Verizon for years and used this feature with no issues.  Any help would be appreciated.",
