    "content": "I have never had an issue with taking a video, saving it to my phone, and then sharing it and accessing it at any time. Today, my husband tried to forward a video I had shared with him from Tuesday of this week, but the link that was created no longer worked. I tried to resend the video, but it was no longer in my album. Please let me know how to recover this video.",
