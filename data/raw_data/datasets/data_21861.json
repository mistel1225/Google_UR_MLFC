    "content": "Hellovely community! I hope you're spending a fantastic day! I'll be as clear as poss with all info! Received today in Berlin, where I'm quarantining around, a Google Pixel 3 refurnished certified esim function. Tried to activate it with my French carrier SFR, supporting esim with Pixel 3, so I received their QR code, but as others in the community and on the internet, I could not select \"Carrier\" in \"Network and settings\" so I tried to use the SIM card of my friend (I do not have), but did not change anything, and finally turned on the Developer mode which allowed me to see Carrier and add one, but I had the \"typical\" error \"Setup not complete\" while trying to scan the QR code, I found that sometimes it is better to update the Android system, so I did to Android 10, but now I can't even tap/access \"Mobile networks\", so I'm even more backward than at the beginning, I tried to reset Network settings, and turned the phone on and off, but still cannot access Mobile networks if I do not have a physical SIM in it, and now no way at all of adding a carrier to activate the esim. (It is a possibility that I was having the error \"setup not complete\" because maybe activation of esim from carrier was taking longer than it should but still now I cannot even do those steps again). I had found similar threads but none with my exact situation, and after digging Internet and talked to carrier technical service for hours and hours, I come here to find heplful kind people, because I need this number to make a better world this week. Thanks and be on fire. Vince.",
