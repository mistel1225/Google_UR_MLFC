    "content": "Hi all,\n\nI have tried every tip that I can find on the internet as well as this forum and not resolved this issue:\n\nWhen I receive a whatsapp message (whether group or individual) my phone vibrates, I want this to be switched OFF. I would like to see the icon on the screen telling me there's new messages, but not have it constantly vibrate.\n\nI've upgraded to Android 11 recently, re-started the phone, uninstalled Whatsapp and reinstalled, cleared the cache, updated settings within the app and on my Notifications settings. I don't want to switch Vibrate off completely as I don't use a ringtone, I rely on vibrate for incoming calls.\n\nWhat seems to be happening is when I change Notification settings from Alert > Silent, they seem to automatically change back to Alert as soon as a new message comes in.\n\nI've noticed this issue only with Whatsapp, all other apps behave accordingly. I read that phone settings override apps so please heeeeelp!\n\nThank you in advance for any tips, I will try them all!",
