    "content": "My phone isn't recognizing my wifi or allowing me to use my mobile data. It's completely stopped and made it impossible to do anything on it. Calling and texting has been buggy since the march 11th update. It's also been deleting items off my home screen. I've tried restarting the phone but it isn't working. I'm about ready to get rid of this phone. It's been ongoing for week now.",
