    "content": "My Pixel 3 freezes about 6-10 times a day. If I force restart, it freezes on the 'G' start up screen where I have to force restart again. Its disrupting my daily phone life. I can't even use Google maps to travel from my phone, it literally has frozen before and I've gotten lost in the middle of urgent travel. Aside from the normal battery draining issues, that seems to be my biggest concern. Any idea on how I can resolve this?",
