    "content": "I am running out a severe issue from the phone. I cannot open many native applications like gmail, making search from searchbox, other non native application. The application open and suddenly disappear. I tried to clear data and cache for gmail. It works few seconds after the action. But right now the problem is still here. I wonder if there is a recent android OS update. Before that I also restarted my phone many times. Could you do something for this issue?",
