    "title": "Pixel 3 XL on sprint won't illuminate basic voicemail icon after turning it on in settings",
    "content": "Sprint tries to force visual voice bloatware and says only the Pixel 2 will illuminate the icon.  All I want is the 20 year old service that tells me I have a voicemail, don't want the Sprint visual voicemail app with advertisements, nor any other app.  Sprint offered to text me when I got a voicemail, which I also didn't want.  Tech support says its a Google problem and Google chat said its a Sprint problem.  Why do I feel like I'm in Kansas again?",
