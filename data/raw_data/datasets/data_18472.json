    "content": "I'm going to record videos using an external mic with my pixel 2. \nI can see that it for quite some time has been very difficult. \n\nI get the option to choose the external microphone, so I guess there should be some kind of connectivity between phone/app and external microphone. But when watching the video afterwards there's no sound at all. I have tried to unplug the external mic before watching, I have tried to restart app and watch, I have tried to send video to my pc and watch - no sound at all. \n\nIs it some kind of gear that I need that I don't have (adapter of some kind, specific microphone), even though I get the option to choose the external mic? Or do I need to use a third party app to get it to work? Or is it some kind of setting I have missed besides simply choosing to use the external mic? Or does it simply not work (STILL)??\n\nThanks for any answers.",
