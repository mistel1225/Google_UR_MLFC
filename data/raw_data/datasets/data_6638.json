    "content": "Having problems with some (most) bluetooth connections on Pixel5 (And11)--it worked with a bluetooth aux adapter for my radio; it \"sees\" my TV (downstairs from where I'm sitting) a a couple other random devices I can't identify, but doesn't find my Beats headphones or JBL speaker sitting right next to it. (Both are fully charged, and I've connected them to Ipod, so they work.)  I've turned bt on/off, wireless on/off, but Available devices just spins.",
