    "content": "Hi,\n\nMy Pixel just rebooted itself and it just reboots constantly as it starts up.\nI gets to the home screen and as I try to get into Setting it would freeze and reboot. It doesn't matter what I do, going into settings, just waiting for full reboot, as it boots, it would just reboot.\n\nAnyone else have the same situation? Any advice would be appreciated.\n\nThanks\ns",
