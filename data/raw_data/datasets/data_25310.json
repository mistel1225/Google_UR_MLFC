    "content": "My wife broke the screen of her phone and she sent it to Google for repairs. They said it would take 3-5 business days to return it, it's been a month and so far it looks like they have lost it because they say they don't know where the phone is but can't give us any more information at the moment. What can we do to escalate the issue? who can we contact?\nThanks for any help",
