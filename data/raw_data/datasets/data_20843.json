    "content": "Recently purchased a Pixel 4xl last month along with a pixel stand. Over the past two days I've noticed the pixel will charge to 100% while on the stand and then stops charging and starts discharging while still on the stand. I do not have a case on it. The pixel will show it's charging wirelessly until it reaches 100% and then shows \"not charging\" and then appears to discharge as if not on the stand at all. Pixel stand features such as the photo show continue to work which drains the battery even faster. I'm not sure if it has anything to do with the update released recently or if that's just a coincidence, because it did start around the same time i updated the Pixel to June's update. I'm waking up now to a phone at 60% battery. Does anyone have any ideas or is anyone experiencing this as well? I love my pixel 4xl even with a few issues I've noticed so far, but this one affects functionally more so than any other issue I've experienced and is frustrating when my phone isn't fully charged in the morning.
