    "content": "Two months ago, after a camera update, the selfie cam also crashed the phone software. Had to do a factory reset back then too. It solved the issue. Snapchat was causing part of the problem so I had to uninstall and reinstall that too after the factory reset. The app would crash any time it was opened.\n\nI figured the problem was solved until last night when I tried to record a video. The moment I clicked on the video tab, the camera app just closed. Now it just closes any time I open the app. It doesn't crash, it just closes. I've factory rest the phone already but it keeps having the same issue.",
