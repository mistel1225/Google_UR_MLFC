    "title": "Pixel XL keeps locking up on calls and sending texts. Safe mode only works 50% of the time.",
    "content": "My Pixel XL keeps hard locking when I send texts or phone calls. Also my speaker will just stop mid call or not work when I receive calls.\n\nI've restared phone over and over, factory reset it and boot in safe mode. It only works for maybe an hour and I have to do it again. It's been doing this on and off for the past two weeks.",
