    "content": "Ever since I moved to Android 10, I now have the issue of random texts being sent 45 min to 1 hour later. Some of my photos or memes dont go through until later and its its super annoying. And the thing is, its random. I can send 3 texts and 2 will go through but one will not. Or I send a picture and it will not go through. I have contacted my carrier about this and they say my service is not throttled or they dont see any issues on their end. Is anyone else having this issue???",
