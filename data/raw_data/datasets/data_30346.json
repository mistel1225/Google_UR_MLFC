I was out in the middle of nowhere, recording a short video, & my pixel shut off two or three times randomly for no reason!  I have had this computer phone for about a year so it has worked pretty well other than when it turned TALK BACK on by itself, which was kind of odd, & had me thinking I may have been hacked!",
