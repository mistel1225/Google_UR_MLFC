    "content": "When I click the \"one tap mobile\" link for conference calls (the one that includes the meeting ID and passcode so you don't need to flip between screens and enter them manually), my phone dials the number and disregards the rest. This started about a month (~05/2021) ago. Before dialing, it asks if I want to join with the passcode, I choose yes, but it forgets it. WTF?\n\nHave tried clearing cache and data on phone, calendar, and contacts apps. Also uninstalled and reinstalled phone app updates.",
