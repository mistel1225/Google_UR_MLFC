    "content": "My phone was working fine until about 40% battery power and then suddenly drained to 1% in about 10mins and then died. I then plugged it in while dead to charge and came back ten minutes later to turn it back on and it was charged to 86%. I have a fast charging port and it should take about a minute per each 1% charge so this is incredibly out of the ordinary. In total it should take around an hour and a half to get to 100% charge from 0.",
