    "content": "My phone started crashing after the latest update, and it's been hard to start it up. The battery is stuck at 50% and it won't go up or down, whether connected to the charger or not. If I remove the charger, the phone crashes. I have tried in vain to find direct contact details, but I'm stuck in a loop that keeps taking me back to the main Tips and Support page. I bought my phone on Australia, but I'm stuck in Thailand due to the Covid restrictions, and there are no service centres here.",
