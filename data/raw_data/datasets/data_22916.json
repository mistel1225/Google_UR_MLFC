    "content": "I have to send my phone in to fix a faulty bottom speaker. I would like to backup all my recordings from the Recorder app, and restore them to the phone when I get it back. Surely Google would have thought about such a common scenario? \n\nIf I simply save the recordings to Google Drive and leave them there, I can't use the Recorder app's search feature that lets you jump to the exact point a word was said, amongst others.\n\nThe recordings are not backed up by the phone's Backup to Google Drive feature. \n\nSurely Google isn't that short-sighted? Is there a way to backup and restore recordings? The Recorder app was a headline feature during the launch, surely Google would have figured out how to provide such a basic function? It can even help them sell more Drive storage.",
