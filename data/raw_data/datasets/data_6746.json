    "content": "Pixel 4a crashes when the phone call closes and has to be hard reset. Now when you first hard reset the battery displayed is 0% and after a restart of the phone, it jumps back to whatever it was before. This does not happen on all calls but only one out of say around 5 calls it does. What may be the matter? How come it crashes only when the call closes or it goes into ,, The client did not respond voice \"",
