    "content": "I updated to Android 10 last night, and today, my bluetooth audio in my car will not display any info regarding the music that is playing (album, song, photo, etc).  It just displays the song's length.  I've tried clearing the cache for Bluetooth and Bluetooth Midi on my Pixel 2, and I've also unpaired and re-paired the phone.  Playing music thru Amazon Music app, which I also tried updating.  2019 Lexus.",
