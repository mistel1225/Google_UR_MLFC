    "content": "I want to stop the app icons from automatically moving onto and off of my home screen.  I move things to where I want them but often, within the next day or so, what's there changes.   Some completely disappear from the home screen, and some duplicate themselves on the home screen, with one on the bottom row of 5 apps, and one above.",
