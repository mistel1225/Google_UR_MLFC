    "content": "I typically take videos on my phone, but since I upgraded to the Pixel 4 XL it's very easy to hear audio clipping in videos. Im assuming the microphone is too sensitive and is not auto adjusting this. Is there a way to manually adjust? My videos are trash now that the audio sounds bad.",
