    "content": "My USB-C port is not working. It charges the phone, but if I plug the earphones music still sounds in the speakers....if I try to connect it to the car for using Android Auto, is not doing anything and I´m not even able to change the USB connection preferences (because it´s like if it was not connected...). I´ve tried to go into developer mode and use the unbugging mode, but it´s not working.... It´s the second Pixel 3 I got with the same problem. When Google replaced my pixel the first time, music was working for a couple of days...and then not anymore. They told me in the Help line that it may be some app was interfering with the phone....but they don´t know to tell me which one could be. I tried to do all same things with my wife´s Huawei P20 Lite and works just fine and easy. Somebody could give me a solution?",
