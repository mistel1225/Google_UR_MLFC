    "content": "My screen has a vertical unresponsive strip. The phone has been for about 1 month with me, got it shipped to a friend during black Friday and picked it up for Christmas. I don't think this waiting period inside the box could affect but I mention it in case it can be relevant. Now, the problem is that there is a whole area in the display that is not responsive at all. I never dropped the phone and I've taken a lot of care to keep it in perfect condition.\n\nIn order to track the area I enabled the \"pointer location\" option in the \"input\" section of the developer options (I didn't have developer options enabled before this). I also tried to restart the phone in safe mode and I tried to keep it off for some minutes to see if it changes something. As a last thing I also performed a factory reset. Unfortunately none of those attempts fixed anything. The links below show a couple of videos of the pointer location tracking and how this unresponsive area is clearly defined.\n\nSomething that I didn't try is removing the protective glass from the phone. Regarding this, I don't think it's affecting the display as the whole strip is 100% non responsive. I guess if it was a problem with the glass then part of it would react at least every now and then.\n\nThanks in advance for your help.\n\nbefore factory reset: https://photos.app.goo.gl/L5nGdTGiAmLawhii8\nafter factory reset: https://photos.app.goo.gl/P9jqoBvr8r6eg4Ls6\n\n(sorry about the quality of the videos but they were recorded with an old phone with some audio problems)",
