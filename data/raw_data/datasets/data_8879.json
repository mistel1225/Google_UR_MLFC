    "content": "My camera used to default to the zoom slider view. Now there is a 1X, 2X button and the only way to invoke a slider is to touch the 1X 2x button. Then the slider appears, but the behavior is very erratic. At first the zoom is very slow, then it over zooms causing me to reduce the zoom. I guess this feature was added after an update but it is not working very well. I was fine with the original camera slider. Whatever they have done to the camera zoom behavior is not working well for me",
