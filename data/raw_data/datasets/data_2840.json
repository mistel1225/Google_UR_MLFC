    "content": "I recently purchased the device after losing access to my iPhone. The issue began on a Google Admin account that I am unable to access to. I'm unsure of the exact point in which the incident began, but it has been an ongoing and daily sequence of  occurrences for several months at this point. I need to speak with someone who is able to give me a solution. I have been through the normal processes that you all recommend as well as followed the instructions giving to me by apple countless times with no resolve. I need help. I am only certain of one thing regarding this matter. Whoever is responsible for what is happening to me is not someone who the normal procedures that are in place. This is an issue that could potentially end the trust people bestow upon Google to provide safety and peace of mind. This person has been testing,  collecting, and perfecting techniques and using your own analysis tools, source code, and reports which are freely made available.",
