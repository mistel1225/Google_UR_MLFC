    "content": "My Google Pixel 3 screen flashes like a strobe / green color out of nowhere. I didn't break or damage it. I was watching Youtube when suddenly the screen went bright green and started flashing. I restarted the phone, didn't help. I switched off the phone for 24 hours and turned it on again. It was ok for several hours and the screen went crazy flashing green again. That is quite frustrating since I've been using the phone for several months only and franky it is far from being the cheapest phone in the market. I had many smartphones, including iPhone and this is the first time I'm dealing with an issue like this. Moreover,  my eyes were affected because of looking at the flashing green light in an attempt to fix the problem and they hurt. I begin to suspect that my health might be affected by this phone and regret buying it. I need an immediate help in resolving the problem. Attached is a photo of my phone. Thank you for support. ",
