    "content": "Noticed that when the sensor of Pixel 4 is blocked (Even with a clear/transparent film) the 'tap screen to wake up' function does not work. It seems that the sensor must not be obstructed for the 'tap to wake up' function. Is this normal? If it is, that will be a design flaw man..",
