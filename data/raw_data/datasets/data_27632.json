    "content": "My phone seems to have a \"hidden\" player in it, which is incompatible with my Alpine CDE-HD149BT stereo, it displays \"bluetooth player\" but doesn't do anything.  And it won't let me select a default music app.  I've reset bluetooth cache, reset all connections, toggled media on and off in the bluetooth menu of my phone, all to no avail.  I know it's something simple that I'm missing, I just can't figure out what it is.  I just got the phone yesterday.   Help!!",
