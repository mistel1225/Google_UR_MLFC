    "content": "I have a pixel 4a (only about 3 months old) suddenly certain apps aren't opening up. They start to open and then close. This happens for the gmail app, outlook app, google search bar, espn app, etc. Tried restarting phone, turning off and on, taking sim card out. I even uninstalled one of the apps and reinstalled and the first time reinstalled it opened and then back to closing while opening. Is there anything else I can do or am I going to have to do a factory reset?",
