    "content": "I have had this phone for almost two months and have loved it. Now it won't function. At first, it was just my home button not responding so I could not go back or leave an app or access the app tray. Then it started to do things on its own. I would try to type something and it would randomly select letters and then glitch out. I don't know what is happening or why, but if someone has an idea please let me know.\n\n I have turned it off, removed screen protector and case, and tried to charge it fully. I tested it in safe mode and it still won't function, cleared space on the phone and nothing changes.",
