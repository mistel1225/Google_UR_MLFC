    "content": "At first whenever I tried to access a website that required a password, it wouldn't load unless on incognito mode. Now, For about two weeks, I have been getting an error message of \"bluetooth keeps stopping\" every about twenty seconds of phone usage and then i get kicked off the internet and it says there are no available networks, i have to restart the phone to connect to the internet. I deleted every excess app on my phone, cleared the cache, and history on the Bluetooth and Chrome apps.  I have restarted the phone, reset all settings besides resetting to factory settings, and cleared almost all of my storage. It went away for about 4 days and now it is back. I also get an error message that says I have no sim card inserted.",
