    "content": "I restarted the phone multiple time using the side buttons, then I let the phone die and recharged it, finally I decided to factory reset my phone using the side buttons. Still the touchscreen will not work. The fingerprint scanner works on the back, but without the touchscreen I can't do much. My phone had the most current update as of yesterday, has anyone heard of this happening before because I can't find any information on this issue.",
