    "content": "I really hate this new swipe up system for looking at recent apps. Is there a way to revert to a 3 button system? \nFirst, it's annoying to have to do a double swipe to get to my app tray. Second, I've regularly closed a window I didn't want to because of having to do that second swipe. \nI know they said this makes it easier for people for physical usage, but I'm one of the lucky people that's left handed and the button was always perfect for me. If you're going to make something easy for right handed people, why not also make the back button easier for left handed people?",
