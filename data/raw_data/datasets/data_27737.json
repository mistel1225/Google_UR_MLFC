    "content": "Updated pixel on android 10. 3 weeks worked fine, then there were sharp problems with sound - it stopped playing, and when I tried to play music, answer the phone, the phone rebooted.  After several reboots, the sound began to work, but now the phone does not see the headphones or does not switch the sound playback in them, but play through the speakers.",
