    "content": "The Google pixel USB c earbuds that came with my pixel 3 phone is having problems where my music keeps stopping (ie the earbuds keep disconnecting from the phone). Sometimes going to settings and updating my phone helps but sometimes it doesn't. What is wrong with the earbuds?? Also I can't seem to find any official google support hotline/email to ask for help on this so I'm posting it here.",
