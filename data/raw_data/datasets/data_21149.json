    "content": "Hi,\nMy problem is Pixel freezing and being completely unresponsive\n\nHow it started\nIt started after it fell on the floor I think, at the beginning locking/unlocking the phone worked.\n\nProblem description\nAt moments it's completely unresponsive, after restarting it I can't even type the PIN.\nDouble pressing power button and opening a camera helps at times. Or sometimes it still unfreezes after I lock/unlock it.\nThere are moments when it works perfectly for a minute or more. Full functionality. And then it freezes again. Sometimes rebooting it doesn't help, sometimes it does.\n\nI did all the steps from 'Help'\nI did a hard reset - it started freezing again when I was connecting to WiFi before I restored any backed up data ( I did not restore apps)\nThe power and sound buttons work fine\nSystem is up to date\n\nAny ideas how this can be fixed?\nThanks,\nWiktor",
