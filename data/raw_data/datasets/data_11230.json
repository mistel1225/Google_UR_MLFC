    "content": "How do you officially replace the battery? Not being able to remove Pixel batteries is one of the things that unarguably sucks about them. Google makes it near impossible to do it yourself without cracking the screen and then makes it very difficult if impossible to find where to go to have it done. Very frustrating and not to mention bad for the planet to encourage that kind of waste. We need a list of retailers easy to find on the Google site ( and future models should have a \"key\" or normal battery removal)",
