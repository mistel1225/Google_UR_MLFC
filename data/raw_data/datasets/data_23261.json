    "content": "It seems that after upgrading our Pixel 2XL to Android 9 (PI) that the main camera has problems. The App does not always open, or camera is out of focus or video works a few seconds then goes out of focus. Have cleaned lenses, cleared caches, opened in safe Mode, factory reset. Nothing makes much difference.\n\nOccasionally the camera opens in-focus, but blurs within 5 seconds. The selfie camera seems OK, but we do not use.\n\nNow, two holidays with broken camera. The only reason that we purchased the Pixel was for the camera!\n\nIs this a known problem after Android 9 upgrade? Is there a fix? Can we go back to Android 8?",
