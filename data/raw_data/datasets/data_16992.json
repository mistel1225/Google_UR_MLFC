    "content": "Hello, \nI have bought bike rollers and they function with bluetooth. I could not manage to connect it to the phone, it pairs but does not connect. I have tried to restart the phone, to install and re-install the application, to forget the device and then pair it again, everything without success. I need to connect it to the app because I need to calibrate the rollers otherwise I cannot use it in the correct way (with the right resistance). I thought was a problem of the rollers, but then I managed to connected with the computer and then with a friend phone. I did not want to reset the phone yet. Does anyone have some piece of advice here? Thanks!",
