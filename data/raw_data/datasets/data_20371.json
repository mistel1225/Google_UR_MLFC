    "content": "I think its high-time that Google makes Pixel Android updates for 4 years now. iPhone 6s was launched in 2015 and it's scheduled to get iOS 14 (that makes 5 major updates). There might not be a huge difference from iOS 13 to 14, but it's still a major update. Google should really consider upping its game. 4 Years of Android updates would be great and would really push other companies to think. Besides, OnePlus already delivers 3 years of updates, on par with Pixel devices. Google should stay ahead of the curve. \nFeedback sent through the phone. Requesting everyone else to do the same and make sure this reaches the Google team.\n\nCheers,\nPRK",
