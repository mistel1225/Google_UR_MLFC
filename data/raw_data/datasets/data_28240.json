    "content": "Today when I was using my Pixel 2 , it's screen got frozen and shut down automatically. At that time available battery capacity was at 30%. Then I tried to start the phone but it didn't work. As per the google support guides I have plug the phone to charger and hold down power and volume down buttons for more than 30 secs. But no response from the phone. I have connected the phone to my desktop and it didn't get recognized from my desktop as well. From the start of last this week I have observed unexpected shutdowns (3 occasions)  like this but in those times I was able to restart the phone after holding the power button (5 -10 secs). The only change which I have done to the phone recently is that upgrading to the android 10. Could you please advise what may have caused this issue. Thanks a lot in advance.",
