    "title": "My pixel 3 will not connect to Bluetooth. I have tried all of the troubleshooting information I can find. When I click on pair a new device, it just spins like it is loading and nothing shows up. After reading lots of reviews online, I am worried that it will not work. I am seriously considering returning this phone tomorrow, and I just bought it today.",
    "content": "I have restarted the phone, turned off and on my Bluetooth devices, shutdown the phone, multiple times. Nothing is working. I am super frustrated because when I bought this phone today, I specifically asked about how well it pairs with Bluetooth devices. After reading tons of reviews, it seems like Bluetooth connectivity is a constant issue with this phone. Unless it magically starts working, I will be returning this phone tomorrow. It's not like me to be negative, but this phone is way too high of a price point to be having this issue.",
