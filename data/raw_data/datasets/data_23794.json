    "title": "Please enable Miracast to all pixel phones.",
    "content": "The old Nexus 4 and 5 phones maybe even 6p has native Miracast built in and activated. Please make all google phones have this feature enable. Chromecast has its own advantage but forcing the use of it by limiting existing features on a phone is a disservice to your customers. The Google pixel line of phones is supposed to be the best of what Google has to offer but it appears to not be the case because of decisions to eliminate older and useful features older Google phones use to have.\n\nI am hoping that if enough people comment about this issue perhaps Google will make a concerted effort to change their ways.\n\nThank you.",
