    "content": "I recently upgraded from Pixel XL where everything worked as desired.  During the setup process, all accounts and rules came over to the new phone just fine.  However, Do Not Disturb events don't seem to know anything about the Exchange calendar.  I also tried removing my exchange account and re-inserting it.  Nothing different except the calendar colors changed.",
