    "title": "Android dismiss notification badge from Apps as soon they are opened!",
    "content": "I upgraded my phone from Galaxy to Pixel only to found out that Android platform DOES NOT support count on App Badges! and even worse is that once you open one notification the badge goes away! \n\nAs a professional, I always get multiple SMS, Emails etc. that I need to respond too. I need to know if I have received anything new. Sometime I have an app open and received a new message and I will not really get to see the notification because I am in the app (with different screen than main where new item has arrived). \nIf you really think this is the way some people want it - then make an option to have this as an option. Most professional will not be able to handle change like this.\n\nCurrently my only option is to goto an older Android phone (s7 or s8?) or  iPhone because that's the only way to keep up with all the messages.\n\nPlease please please fix this.",
