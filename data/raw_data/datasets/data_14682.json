    "content": "Hey I have a problem. Everytime I turn on the phone there is a bright flash of the lockscreen right before it turns on. This is really weird and annoying especially when I'm looking at the phone in the darkness.\n\nIt also happens in safe mode. Anyone know how to fix it? I think the last update caused it.",
