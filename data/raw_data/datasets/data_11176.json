    "title": "Pixel 5 battery draining excessively ?5G responsible",
    "content": "My Pixel 5 is about 2 weeks old. It's battery drains excessively during the day with moderate use, such that it's dying/needing charging by 5pm. It's worse than my previous phone which is 2 years old, so I was pretty disappointed I got a Pixel 5 instead of the new iPhone which was actually offered cheaper but I've been loyal to Android. I expected much better as reviews said the battery was very good.\n\nThe battery analysis tells me apps are behaving normally and nothing is draining my battery excessively. I saw a story suggesting 5G could be the issue.\n\nI turned off 5G and suddenly my battery is lasting much longer.. I could be wrong but it's also getting a lot less hot.",
