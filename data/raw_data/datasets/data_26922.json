    "title": "Portrait Mode - Preview bounces to previous photo taken",
    "content": "This may be difficult to explain but I seem to be having issues where reviewing the portrait photo taken causes a \"bounce back\" to the previous photo. Example, I'll take one portrait photo, review it and it appears fine. The next one I take, I'll click on the review icon and while it shows \"Processing\"....once it appears to complete, it bounces back to the previous photo I took (whether it be a portrait photo or not). I tested it a few times and it seems to happen intermittently. I just want to see if others are experiencing this. \n\nI suggest testing should be done by taking one portrait photo then review it. Then immediately take another one (or two) and see if the image you review is the previous one. The latest photo you just took will be saved, but you'll have to move an image ahead to see it.\n\nThanks for any confirmations on the same issue! Pixel 3 with July patch has been applied.",
