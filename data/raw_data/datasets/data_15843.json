    "content": "After an indeterminate period of time, usually between 15 and 30 minutes, Bluetooth playback will not respond to the pause or skip buttons on my headphones or car stereo. When I pull out my phone, the playback appears locked a 0:00:00, even though audio is still playing. This started happening when I upgraded to Android 11 on the Pixel 3A.",
