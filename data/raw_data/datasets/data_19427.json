    "title": "Very peculiar problem with my phone",
    "content": "I am using my phone and all of the sudden the screen turns multi color like its old school static on a TV. I some how restart my phone, and the problem disappears. Now the next day and randomly the static comes back and I cant operate my phone at all. I somehow figure out the only way to operate the phone is if i bend my phone pulling from both the speaker and microphone, while simultaneously maneuvering my other finger on the screen, its a very tasking even for the simplest of task such as a phone call or text. Randomly, the phone will go back to normal like nothing is wrong, maybe for like 5 min, then goes back to static screen, unless i try bending my phone.",
