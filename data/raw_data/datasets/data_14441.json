    "content": "My girlfriend recently bought a Skagen Falster 3 to pair with her Pixel 4XL. Upon setting it up, we realized her messages were not syncing. She was able to receive notifications from new texts, as well as send messages out. However, the conversations in the messages app on her watch would never update. As a work around, I tried to uninstall updates for Messages on her phone through the Google Play store. This seems to have fixed the sync issue. However, she can now not update the app again... Is there any fix for this?",
