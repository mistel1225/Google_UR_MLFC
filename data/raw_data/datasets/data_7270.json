    "content": "Hello! Whenever I'm browsing on Chrome and go to click a link for like target or poshmark where I also have an app the pop up appears to ask if I want to open in chrome or the app. I chose to have that ask everytime as sometimes the apps are slow and chrome is easier to work with. Now whenever that pops up I can only select the app. If I select chrome it keeps popping up until I select the app.",
