    "content": "On my Pixel 5, I can't hear phone calls unless I'm on bluetooth mic or speakerphone, but not from ear speaker . The problem will sometime go away for a little bit if I clear phone app cache or do a factory reset, so it does not look like a hardware issue. Has anyone seen this issue before?",
