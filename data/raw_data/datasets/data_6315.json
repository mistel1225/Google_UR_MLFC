    "content": "I'm hoping someone else has run into this and has a fix. Lately only about 2/3 of the photos I take then appear in my Photos app. They're not hiding in a weird folder in they're, they're just not there or in my Google photos online. They are somewhere on the device because if I open up a text or email and attach pictures everything I take is there. But somehow it's not in photos. I've cleared all photos from my device and sent them into cloud only and also cleared the cache for photos and neither helped. Thanks!",
