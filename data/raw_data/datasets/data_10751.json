    "content": "Absolutely disgusted. Purchased a phone on 20th November through Google store. Received it on 28th. Within 3 days the phone went faulty which required an advanced replacement to be done. \nThe new one has now also gone faulty. \nReported it to google support yesterday, who couldn't perform another advanced replacement immediately due to a technical error. I got the email this morning to do so and I'm now being told the replacement is a refurbished device, not new. \n\n17 days ago I ordered the phone, this will be the this phone too. I want and am entitled to a like for like replacement under UK law. Google support this morning told me this was the way to raise a complaint.\nPlease replace this with a new device before I just refund the whole thing and walk away from google entirely.",
