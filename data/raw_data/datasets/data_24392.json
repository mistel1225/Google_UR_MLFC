    "content": "The call screening button does not show up when I get a phone call and it has never shown up since I have had the phone. The only buttons that show up are 'Answer' and 'Decline'. I have tried every suggestion that the internet has had to offer at this point. All my apps and software are up to date. I have AT&T and I live in the US, I'm not sure if that makes a difference. Does anyone know how to fix this issue?",
