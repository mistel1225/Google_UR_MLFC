    "content": "I was caught in a heavy downpour of rain, my phone was in my pocket (waterproof jacket). When I got home and took the phone out, if felt damp/humid. The screen won't respond to touch. \nI've taken the screen protector off & removed the case. It has been in a sealed tuppawear container with rice for over 24 hours - still the screen won't respond to touch. It turns on but won't click on the apps I want & instead immediately goes onto my messages but won't select the Back Arrow function to go back to another screen\nAny ideas how I can fix this please?",
