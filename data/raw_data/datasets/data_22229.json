    "content": "My daughter's Pixel 3 won't update. Each time she checks for updates, she gets this message : \"can't check for update\".\n\nThe phone is definitely connected to the internet at the time, and the message comes up very quickly.\n\nIt's currently at Android 10, September update.\n\nHas anyone else had this issue ? Any suggestions ?\n\nThanks, John",
