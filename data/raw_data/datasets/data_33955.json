    "content": "  I just bought pixel 2xl as I was very impressed with Gcam on other phone.great camera performance made to buy this phone.but after using it's portrait mode in some situation,my joy have come to an end..I used Gcam on OnePlus 6 and just loved to use portrait on that phone..I use color pop option a lot while editing my pic.ever since i have started using pixel,I am feeling that using portrait in OnePlus 6 with Gcam was way better and more practical as many time in pixel main object and person can not be differentiated from background...if I want to take portrait pic of entire person from head to toe,blur effect is not seen at all.picture is taken as normal...this situation was not seen in Gcam in OnePlus 6 or even OnePlus 6 stock camera app...can anyone help me understand that is this normal with pixel...?",
