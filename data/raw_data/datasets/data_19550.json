    "content": "My Pixel 3 XL is in a Boot Loop. The previous night, I have observed that my Pixel rebooted itself while I was using it. I thought it could be a small glitch and ignored it as it was working fine after the reboot. The following day, I have observed that the phone is again rebooting by itself, and the time intervals between each reboot were shortening(4hrs, 2hrs, 30 min, 1 min and now continuous). By the end of the day, it is in a state where the home screen doesn't even appear and the boot loop continues just displaying the Google Logo. \n\nI have tried the following and none of them worked\n1. Draining battery over night and charging it the next day and tried to switch it on\n2. Safe Mode (As soon as I click the volume button, the loop starts again. OR after couple of secs of inactivity)\n3. Recovery Mode (As soon as I click the volume button, the loop starts again. OR after couple of secs of inactivity)\n\nMy phone is not in warranty anymore. I have seen few others reporting the same issue and none of them have received any RCA on why this happened. What are my options?",
