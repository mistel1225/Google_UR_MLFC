    "content": "Ever since I started wireless charging my phone the play store apps won't auto update even though I have the setting turn on saying that it can. \n\nI will open my app after a while and see that I have 20+ apps that needs to be updated even though I charge my phone every night and often throughout the day. Do the apps only update when the charger is actually plugged in or just whenever the phone is charging?",
