    "content": "I'm planning to pre order pixel 4xl because i like pixel phone and i'm using pixel 2 now. But i don't want to type in passwords to access my apps every single time. It's surprising that even google pay doesn't support facial recognition. How soon can we expect all apps at least banking apps to support this feature. with out this there is no point of buying this phone at all. Pixel team should have worked with at least major banking apps to work on this before even announcing this phone like apple did.",
