    "content": "As the title summarises, the screen has developed a weird streaky look from when it fell off my desk. Is that normal? Aren't these phones tested for such things before launch?\n\nI bought the phone directly from Google. My warranty runs out in May. Can I send the phone to Google to replace the screen under warranty? If not, can I pay them to replace the screen?",
