    "title": "Not recognized in fastboot on Mac",
    "content": "I bought a used Pixel 1 (non-Verizon). I have OEM unlocked it, and restarted into bootloader through adb. At that point, my MacBook can't recognize the device any more. It's not there when I use \"system_profiler SPUSBDataType\" and fastboot doesn't see any devices. I've tried new cables (I bought a belkin one), and I tried connecting to a Raspberry Pi (I don't have any PCs). I have the same issue no matter what. I've been trying random advice for the last week, but no luck. Can someone please help?",
