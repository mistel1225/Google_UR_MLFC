    "content": "When I first used Snapchat today I noticed the HDR processing feature is no longer working or enabled. I tried logging out and logging back in, uninstalling and reinstalling the app, and restarting the phone to no avail. Now every single picture I take on Snapchat looks grainy, unlike yesterday and every day prior when they looked amazing on Snapchat. Is this some hidden feature of a Snapchat update or a hardware/software problem?",
