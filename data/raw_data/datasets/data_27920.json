    "content": "I've cleared the cache memory for all the apps and reinstalled all the apps. Has made absolutely no difference. \nAlso, the headphone jack doesn't seem to detect when I plug in my headphones. This problem gets temporarily resolved upon restarting the phone but then they abruptly stop working and then the phone freezes and restarts again\n\nDidn't face either of these issues before I updated to android 10",
