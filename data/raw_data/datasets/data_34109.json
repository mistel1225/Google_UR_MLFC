    "content": "Quite often pressing the homepage Recent button doesn't do anything, I able to see the recent apps for a less then a second and then it is gone, just disappears. The only way to make this button work again is to restart the phone.\nThat is actually happening since I have upgraded my phone to android 9.\nIs that a known issue with android on pixel 2 ?",
