    "content": "In android 11 , the main issue with the conversation section is it is showing all the messages as conversations in notification.\nBecause if this all spam and promotion messages are all categorised under conversations and creates a mess.\n\nThe OS should be smart enough by only showing messages from my contacts in conversations.\n\nGoogle please fix this issue or else there is no use in introducing this feature.",
