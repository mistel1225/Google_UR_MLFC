    "title": "I sent my phone that can't turn on anymore. They returned the phone without fixing it at all.",
    "content": "I bought a Google Pixel 3a about 2 months ago and 1 month later, it didn't turn on anymore. It was charged at around 80 percent during that time (it was charging and I was using it) when it just shut down randomly and did not turn on when I tried turning it on again. It did not drop into any water or have low battery. I sent it to Google to try to get it fixed, only to have it return today (1 month later) and nothing has changed to the phone. It still does not work. It won't turn on despite charging it, which we already saw was not the problem. It is really frustrating. Why is this happening and what can I do to finally get it fixed? I don't want to have to go through this again and have to wait even more.",
