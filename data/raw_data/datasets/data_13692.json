    "content": "I tried to restart my phone and the power button worked again. However, it just got jammed for 10 minutes again despite me restarting and it suddenly worked again. I suspect the problem is not hardware as the button works normally after the 'jammed' period. I have experienced 3 episodes of jamming in the last day. Any ideas on what is the reasons, my fellow users? Thanks a lot.",
