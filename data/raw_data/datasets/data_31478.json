    "content": "Hi, I got my Pixel 3 in November from the Google store, and now the USB-C wired headphones that came with my Google Pixel 3 are automatically muting my audio, and then the volume buttons and main button no longer works.  My wife has the exact same model, and I've tried her headphones with my phone with no problem, so I know it's a problem with the headphones themselves.  \n\nI've tried re-setting up the headphones in the phone settings, but I'm pretty sure there's something wrong with the buttons themselves.  \n\nThanks for any help you can give.",
