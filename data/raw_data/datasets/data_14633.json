    "title": "Pixel 4 all apps crashing",
    "content": "Is anyone else having an issue with their Pixel 4/4XL where no apps will open until a restart is forced? Not even basic functions such as opening settings or taking a screenshot work. It's happened since I got the phone in July, and after numerous attempts to rectify (including factory resets) I received a replacement device under RMA. It happens about every 5 days and the only way to sort it is to restart the phone. Any info would be appreciated. TIA",
