    "content": "My headphones which previously used to work fine have stopped working all of a sudden. The phone no longer recognizes any pair of headphones as audio device. I tried at least 2 different pairs which used to work previously. Restarting the device didn't work. But, using the device in Safe mode apparently fixed the issue but started the phone in normal mode and the issue reappeared. How to fix this?",
