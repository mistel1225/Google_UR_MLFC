    "content": "I'm listening to Spotify through the phone speakers, and I can't keep the volume at a normal level. I've used both the side buttons and on-screen volume control, with both every time I lower the volume - it shoots right back up to max volume. Even if I mute sounds altogether, 2 seconds later it shoots right back up to maximum volume.",
