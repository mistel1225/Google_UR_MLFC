    "content": "How do I enable live captioning for Zoom webinars (or any webinar for that matter)? I'm using Google Pixel 4a. The thing is that live captioning works for 1-on-1 Zoom calls and such. It works for Whatsapp video and normal phone calls. It works for Youtube videos and podcasts. But it doesn't seem to be coming for Zoom Webinars. Any solutions to this?",
