    "content": "Recently my Pixel 4 has been opening straight into chrome with spam pages such as us.mobilland.online along with several others. I have cleared the cache and deleted memory in chrome but that only works for about an hour then they come back. Any thoughts on how to get rid of this virus? I have tried virizon security and other anti virus apps but all say they can't find anything wrong.",
