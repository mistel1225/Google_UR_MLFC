    "content": "Yesterday morning all was well, I could make and receive video calls through my google phone app.  Then i got crazy, I wanted to be able to get video calls from my daughter on a larger screen.  Searched and saw I could download google Duo to my tablet (completely different device) I install to the tablet, entered my phone number and I thought all was well.  Nope, i never got the video call last night to either my phone or my tablet.  So this morning i deleted Duo from my tablet.  Well that did not work, i have switched some settings on my phone in duo, and at one point i could make video calls but not receive.  Then I got very crazy and spent an hour and a half on google chat support.  Now i can no longer make or receive video calls through google phone and I am left with support telling me to factory reset my phone.  I have no idea why this is so difficult.  phone is a google pixel 2xl.  Please any help is appreciated.",
