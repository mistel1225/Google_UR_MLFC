    "content": "I just received a refurbished Pixel 3 from Google as a replacement for my original device whose battery had become swollen.\nUpon booting up the device I noticed that the top and bottom halves of the screen have different colour temperatures, this is most apparent when looking at a solid darker colour (which is quite common in many apps when the dark theme is active). The top half of the screen is much redder than the bottom half of the screen, which results in the bottom half appearing brighter than the top half in most dark mode apps.\n\nIs there any way to recalibrate the screen to address this issue?",
