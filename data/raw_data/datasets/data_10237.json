    "content": " I have a pixel 3a XL and upgraded it to android os 11, and my phone started having connection problems. So I decided to trade in my phone to pixel 4a 5g. When I was setting up my pixel 4a 5g, I realized that I still have the same connection problems with my wifi connection. So are the connection problems now related with my internet provider (Cox wifi)?  This is just nuts.",
