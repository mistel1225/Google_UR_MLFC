    "content": "After the most recent Andoird 9 security patch  (5th April) I no longer recieve any singal or mobile data, Wifi and Bluetooth still work. I have tried resetting network settings. I have done a soft and a hard reset. I have even tried the Andorid Q beta. Still no signal.\n\nWhen I try and make a call the phone says to switch aeroplane mode off to make a call, despite it already being off",
