    "content": "I have recently purchased Pixel 4. However, its Motion Sense does not function in Azerbaijan. Based on my research it is possible to have 60Ghz frequency in personal use in Azerbaijan. Is it possible that Google would apply for permission to enable use of Pixel 4’s Motion Sense functions in Azerbaijan?",
