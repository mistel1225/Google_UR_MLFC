    "content": "I bought a new pixel 3. I started the phone, did the initial setup and then tried opening YouTube app. I clicked on the app, it opens and closes immediately. I tried opening it again and then the same happens and I get a pop up stating \"YouTube keeps stopping\"\n\nI've tried all the suggestions I already found in pixel support. Tried updating, tried force stop, tried cleaning the cache. Nothing was helping.\n\nIts little annoying to see this behavior on a brand new phone.\n\nAny kind of help to fix this issue would be really appreciated. I'm also attaching a screenshot of the popup.\n\nThanks in advance.",
