    "title": "Android 10 Security July 5, 2020 broke Wi-Fi calling. Error \"Turn off airplane mode ...\" ANY FIXES?",
    "content": "Project Fi cellular reception is almost non-existent here, hence the need for Wi-Fi calling and no need to have cellular turned on draining the battery. Wi-Fi calling, while cellular was turned off via airplane mode, worked before the last update (July 5, 2020). I could call and receive calls via Wi-Fi even while in airplane mode.\n\nI checked many many settings. I read a bunch of help tips which didn't help. \n\nDoes anybody have a solution?",
