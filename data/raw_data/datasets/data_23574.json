    "content": "1. I bought a phone and motion sense was working. e.g. skip song, Pikachu waves back and so on.\n2. I went to Jordan where motion sense is not available, no big deal. I was informed that this sensor is not available in this country so it's ok.\n3. I went back to my country after a holidays, turned on motion sense on again.

Tried restarting and updating the phone with no luck...",
