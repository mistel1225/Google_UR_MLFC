    "content": "Hi guys,\nSo I'm a Belgian citizen currently living in Spain. The problem I have is my Google account has been created when I was in Spain and so all my services like movies etc are entirely in Spanish.\n\nI would like to get to my home country store so I can buy original version movies with matching subtitles.\n\nI've read somewhere that I can \"change\" my country but when I go and check this option, I have no option to change anything it just stay grey.\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated",
