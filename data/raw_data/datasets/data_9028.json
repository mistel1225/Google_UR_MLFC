    "content": "Have had a Pixel 4A 5G a month now and having a recurring issue where the phone thinks it is offline if you move from Wifi to 4/5G (ie whenever I leave the wifi network at my house and go outside)\n\nCurrently the only way to fix the problem is to restart my phone after turning the wifi off. Considering it's a brand new smartphone which boasts 5G connectivity blahblahblah this seems a fairly massive (and ridiculous) bug.\n\nAnyone else having this issue of do I potentially have a defective handset? Have already tried a factory reset and been sent an new sim from my service provider to no avail.",
