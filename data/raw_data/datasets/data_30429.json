    "title": "I have a complaint about camera in my Pixel XL which I have been using for 1.5 years with great care",
    "content": "Pixel XL is not listed in the list so I chose Pixel instead.\n\nI'm having problem for a few months now actually. Sometimes it disappears but it is always there when I open my camera and goes away after a while but not always.\n\nThick parallel vertical lines (four to five) appear in camera and remain there after taking a photo. Although, the effect is hardly visible in broad daylight but one can notice indoors, and if I take a photo of bright light then it's pretty clear as in the photo I've attached below.\n\n\n\nIt's really annoying as I've been using my Pixel XL with great care and I thought Google will solve this through an update but it's still there.",
