    "content": "First I am a new Pixel user.  I have auto sync on however if I read an email on my laptop I get a notification on my phone which i cannot remove (without opening email) even though it is read on my laptop.  If syncing works on auto surely the notification shouldn't show on the phone if it's been read on my laptop?",
