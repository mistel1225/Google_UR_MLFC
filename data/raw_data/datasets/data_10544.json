    "content": "Should Verizon carrier customers set their expectations to receive updates on their unlocked Pixel 5 devices a week or two later than everyone else that has an unlocked Pixel 5?\n\nThis is two updates now in a row that Verizon carrier customers have to wait to receive the same update everyone else already has.\n\nI would like to set expectations and understand if this is the normal process going forward for anyone using a Pixel 5 with Verizon service.\n\nIMHO, it sucks.\n\nThanks",
