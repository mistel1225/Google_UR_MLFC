    "content": "Okay. So this summer I had the motherboard issue where my phone would crash whenever I would try and use the microphone (phone app, third party app, whatever). I brought it in and google fixed everything for free. Hooray. It's been working smoothly since. Until today? Today I started having very similar issues. My phone is basically unusable outside of safe mode-- I get a \"system UI/processes system\" not responding notification. When I boot into safe mode, things... Kind of work? But I am unable to make or receive calls still, and when I try my phone stops working again. There was a brief moment where I was able to make a call (less than 5 minutes) and it worked. But then shortly after it wouldn't, even after another boot. The only thing I haven't done is a factory reset, which... I'd kind of like to avoid? I don't want to lose all of my texts and have to redownload contacts/photos/etc. I already had to do all of that just a few months ago. Any help would be appreciated.",
