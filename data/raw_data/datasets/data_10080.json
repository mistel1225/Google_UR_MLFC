    "content": "My Pixel 4 has suddenly switched to a black background. It also killed off my custom wallpaper, which I had selected before. Nothing make it switching back. I can enable dark mode and also back to light mode. To be clear: this changes the mode of all the apps, but the background and the main mode of Android itself stays in dark mode. Also, it is not possible to add a wallpaper. What is wrong?",
