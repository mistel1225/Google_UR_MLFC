    "title": "Pixel 3a screen suddenly turns off, won't turn back on again. Touch still working.",
    "content": "The device screen turned off during use. I figured that maybe the phone just locked because I pressed something. Then I pressed the power button twice to turn screen on again, after this the phone screen kept on for a few seconds and turned off again.\n\nThen I rebooted the phone to see if it was a software issue. The Google splash screen appears for a few seconds and then the screen turns off again. I am unable to turn on the screen again after this point.\n\nI tried squeezing the phone to start the voice assistant and the phone vibrated. So the phone itself is on. Then I tried changing the volume and press the button for switching between \"sound\", \"silent\" and \"vibration\" option by guessing where is located on the screen. The phone reacted with sounds and vibrating so this means the touch function on the screen is working, but I still can't see anything on the screen.\n\nAny idea how can I get the screen to turn on again?",
