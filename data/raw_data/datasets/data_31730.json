    "content": "Starting about two weeks ago, whenever my phone was in my back pocket my headphones would cut out. I tested the headphones on another device and they were fine, and I tested other devices with my phone and could replicate the results. \n\nWeirdly, it only happens when I'm walking. But if I'm walking and the phone is in my back pocket, no matter what the range, the connected Bluetooth device cuts in and out. \n\nThings to note:\nI've tested with multiple speakers and headphones\nI've restarted the phone\nI've cleared the paired device settings, re-paired\nI've turned everything on and off again \nNo, my ass is not 10 metres wide\nIf the phone is, say, on my desk, this isn't a problem--the range is still fine\nIf the phone is in my chest pocket it's not a problem\nIf the phone is in my back pocket and I'm standing still, it's not a problem--it only happens when I'm walking",
