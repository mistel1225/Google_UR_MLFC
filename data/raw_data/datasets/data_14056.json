    "content": "If I go to the setting and click on \"Password Manager Google play services\" I get a pop-up asking me which account to use (I have 2 on my phone) and everything looks ok with a \"J\" in a circle for the first letter of my name, just like every other time this appears on my phone or in chrome or Google site on my laptop.\n\nBut if I select the option to change my password \"Password, Google Account > Security\" The is a \"m\" in the circle for the first letter of my email address\"\n\nNot exactly a big issue but just a little annoying but it could mean there is something on my phone where I have not entered my name.\n\nI did set up my new phone manually and not with the usb cable transfer.",
