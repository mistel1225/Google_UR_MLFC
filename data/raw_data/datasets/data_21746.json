    "content": "Since Android 10 update, my daily alarm is not sounding off at all, which is causing aggravating consequences on my daily schedule! at first, I thought I mistakenly left the phone too far away, or forgot to set the sound level loud enough.\n\nToday I realised there is a message showing up very briefly at the bottom of the screen when I open the clock app.\n\nThis needs to be addressed ASAP. How many people have  been late to work because of this?ï¿¼",
