    "content": "So today I got a call and I noticed it said \"Emergency Call\" on the screen along with my location. I got instantly worried that something might have happened to someone I know and I was on their emergency contact list. So I answered the phone and it was a Indian scam caller! The phone call isn't even on my latest phone calls. \n\nHow is this even possible?? Has anyone else experienced this?",
