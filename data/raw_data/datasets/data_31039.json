    "content": "I bought a Samsung Smart watch and after installing the Samsung Wearable App on my Pixel 2 and going through the setup I seem to have 2 problems.  First, the notification don't get sent to the watch and second, the Samsung app on the phone does not have access to the music on my phone (which is required to transfer music to the watch), it can access photos but no music.  I have reset both the phone and the watch multiple times to start fresh and it still doesn't work.  My wife has the exact same phone as me, and when connecting the watch to her phone, it worked perfectly the first time.  Phone is on version 9.",
