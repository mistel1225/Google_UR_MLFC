    "title": "Recently I've started seeing an ad screen after logging in. How can I get rid of it?",
    "content": "Recently (around end of may 2021) I've started seeing this annoying behavior that after logging in on my Android phone, an ad screen shows up. This is way too intrusive to me making me want to get rid of it or take it the step further to abandon the Google system once and for all. I don't want to see an ad screen every time I log on.\nI tried deleting various apps that per internet recommendations were launching them (Facebook, Nextdoor) but now it's Google apps behind it. Will a system reset help or am I stuck with this behavior in the Google ecosystem?\nMy phone always runs the latest system update, and Norton 360 have not detected any virus.",
