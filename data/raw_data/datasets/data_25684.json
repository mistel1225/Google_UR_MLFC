    "content": "My Pixel 2 xl is giving me charging issues since 2 days.The phone tends to reboot after plugging into the charger(the original one). Plugging in the charger and restarting it manually doesn't help either. The phone shows me the charging battery icon (without any animation) and reboots again and the thing goes on till my phone battery completely drains. I have tried all troubleshooting options. The charger in itslef is fine as it charges the other phones. When plugged into a generic usb type-c charger the phone tends to reboot and charge but at a very slow rate (10-60% in 3 hours). Factory resetting the phone or draining the battery all the way and then trying to charge hasn't helped either. What should i do now?",
