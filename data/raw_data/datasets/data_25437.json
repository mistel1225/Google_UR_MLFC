    "content": "I've attempted to update from Pie to Android 10 on my P3 5 times now. Each time it restarts after the install and goes through about 40 (sometimes longer) minutes of Google logo cycles. After that I just get this screen once the device starts back up. Is anybody else having this problem, if so, were you able to successfully update and how?",
