    "content": "The 3.5 mm headphone jack is malfunctioning. My phone thinks it's plugged with a wired headphone even when it's not. So basically I have no media or sound call without using a 3.5mm headphone. The USB headphones jack also isn't working due to the same issue. I tried rebooting/restarting, updating apps etc. I'm pretty sure it's a hardware issue with the 3.5mm jack. Is there any way to fix it without taking it to a service center. I'm currently based in Kenya and I doubt there's a google service center here.",
