    "content": "I have a new Pixel 5. One of my problems has been the failure of Google Assistant's \"Read It\" feature, for reading web pages. Every time I tried to use it the device reported no web page available to read. I checked all kinds of settings, including using screen context, but never solved the problem. I desperation, I wiped all data from the phone and performed a new setup. Voila!  The webpage reading feature worked with the fresh install. Success was short-lived, however. This morning I noticed an outstanding update fo Pixel Stand. When Iet it update, the feature became disfunctional again. I immediately uninstalled Pixel Stand and now I'm back in business. Is this a known issue with Google Stand and the \"Read It\" feature?",
