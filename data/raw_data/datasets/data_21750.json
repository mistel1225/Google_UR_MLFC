    "content": "hi, in my Pixel 2 XL the power button is not working properly.  there is still a problem with screen locking.  once it works, once it doesn't.  100% it is not the fault of the button, because a long press displays the menu, and a double press starts the camera normally. It is rather a fault of the software.  does anyone have a solution to the problem?",
