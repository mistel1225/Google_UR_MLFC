    "content": "How do I 1) get rid of the date/time thingy on top of my main screen on the Pixel 3XL (total waste of real estate) and 2) move the Google search bar to the top, instead of the bottom of the screen. I just got three Pixel 3XL's, and if I can't fix this at least two are going back to Fi. (Our Nexus 6'es were just fine, I don't know why we should put up with reduced customizability!)",
