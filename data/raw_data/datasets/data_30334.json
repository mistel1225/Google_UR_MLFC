    "content": "Yesterday out of no where my was off and then I turned it back on. After about 3-5 minutes it went off again. I found steps to go into safe mode and it still shut off so I did a factory reset and it still shut off. I haven't even had this phone for a month. I reached out to support and they were really nice and responsive. They are sending me a replacement. REFURBISHED! I'm very heated about receiving a refurb for a phone I just got. So I am hoping someone has found a fix for this or has any idea of the real cause. It could be hardware but I had just received the june update so I am hopeful it was the update that cause the issue. I though about Opting in for android q to completely wipe the current OS. Any thoughts on this or would this void my current refurbished exchange.",
