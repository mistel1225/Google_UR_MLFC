    "content": "I just want to share my horrible google support experience\nI had a problem on my Pixel 3 XL about Microphone quality\nThe microphone had horrible quality during calls but was nice during videos..\nBecause the main function of a phone is to calls , i obviously open a RMA request to change this phone\nI sent it to google in Poland , they received the phone at Friday11/29/2019.\nAfter that they ask me to wait 14 days.\n( 14 days later )\nno news about google , nothing , i decided to contact the support\nhow can i describe my surprise when they told me that my phone was not even checked , nothing , and that i have to wait some days again ( Obviously the google agent told me that he will do everythings to accelerate my rma )\n\n( 7 days later )\n\nA lot of new contact with them , they always say the same, \"don't worry , just wait 2-3 days more , all will be fine !\"\n\"your phone is actually in verification \" ( this is an important part to remember for the next step )\n\nI just continue to wait , obviously , my work depend of my phone , i just stop to work since the 11/29/2019 and wait about google to send me my new phone , i dont have money to buy a new one..\nSo , i wait some days again...\n\n( some days later ( honestly i dont count anymore ) )\n\nAgain a new contact to google ! and this time they told me new things ! it was in the end of december (25 - 31 dec)\nGoogle told me that they have actually a problem with my RMA , they can see the phone in their system , they confirm they have received it but \"they can't found my phone on their warehouse and nothing have happened on my phone since all theese days , no verifications nothing , because we dont found it \"\nIm just curious if it's a troll or something like that ?\nSo they can't send me a new phone obviously... i am the one who have paid this fuck*ing pixel 3 xl a lot of money but i am the one who have to wait because THEY do mistake and waste the phone\n\n(01/01/2019 ) new contact with google support\nSo they transmited my problem to a \"specialist service\" , Waw\nIn my head i was like , this specialist service was like Chuck norris and gonna found my phone and do something\nBut , i was really far of the reality...\n\nNow im waiting since the 01/01 , 8 days later , still contact the support all 2-3 days and , always same \" Don't worry i will accelerate the things ! in 2-3 days you will probably have a refund or a new phone sent\"\n\nso im still waiting , can't work because of them , and tired to hear the same fake things everytime\n\nIt's not my problem if google warehouse in poland waste phone , or drink so much vodka to check a phone in the delay\nand it's not my problem if google sell phone's with microphone and other defaut and fails\n\nso , still waiting\n\nIm sorry but when you pay a phone 700â‚¬ or more , we can't accept that.\n\nI can't describe how much i have deception about google , Pixel's seem's to be nice but honestly i paid it but never profit of the phone because this microphone problem and The google support is the worst thing.\nHonestly , dont buy Google phone , if i have the choice to come back in the past , i'll never buy a google product again.\n\nSorry , for my bad english , it's not my native language. Have good day.",
