    "content": "Google has released a 5G phone, however due to software issues it does not connect to many carriers in many places (eg. Hong Kong)\n\nGoogle has not addressed this software fix in the past few monthly updates. So hoping for an ETA on when Google will look into resolving this simple issue (if at all).\n\nPreviously a Google representative mentioned that it is not in scope to fix as the Google Pixel 5 is not sold in Hong Kong - and this is an absolute cop-out of an answer. If the Google Pixel wasnt able to function under HK wireless spectrum, then what's the excuse for supporting 3g and LTE. What about those who travel. Hong Kong's 5G wireless spectrum is a globally acceptable standard and proof exists that you can activate the Pixel 5 5G for Hong Kong by rooting the phone and tweaking the settings. \n\nI find the above alternative (rooting the phone) far more dangerous than simply activating 5G. There is absolutely no need to coordinate with OEMs or wireless providers to turn on the hardware. You don't do this for LTE, why would you need to do it for 5G.",
