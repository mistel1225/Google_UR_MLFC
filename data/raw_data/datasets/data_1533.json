    "content": "Suddenly yesterday, my battery drained quickly and I haven't been able to properly turn it on since.\n\nWhen not connected to a charger or if charged via the supplied usb c charger nothing happens. Once plug into my laptop via regular USB I do get a charging logo. However, it cycles between the charge logo and the google logo constantly. \n\nI have tried holding the power button and trying to get into rescue/recovery modes with no result. If I hold power and volume down at the right time I can get it into the screen to select these modes but once I select them, it immediately goes back into the same cycle.\n\nAs soon as I unplug the phone from charging I get a low battery light and the cycle stops, but I cannot boot the phone in any mode still. \n\nThanks.\nAndre",
