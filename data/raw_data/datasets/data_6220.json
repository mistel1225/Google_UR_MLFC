    "content": "Since I got it in November I've had problems with the device restarting sporadically and apps crashing until I restart the phone. All kinds of apps are crashing (Youtube, Pixel launcher, Chrome etc) not just 3rd party apps.\nYesterday I tried a factory reset to see if that should solve the problem but after only a few hours the problems started again with Youtube and Google News crashing.\nI've done an \"adb logcat\" where I see logs like:\nlibc    : Fatal signal 6 (SIGABRT), code -1 (SI_QUEUE) in tid 30053 (initCrit3-1), pid 30029 (android.youtube)\nlibc    : Fatal signal 6 (SIGABRT), code -1 (SI_QUEUE) in tid 30380 (DISK #1), pid 30330 (.apps.magazines)\nlibc    : Fatal signal 6 (SIGABRT), code -1 (SI_QUEUE) in tid 30585 (.android.gms.ui), pid 30585 (.android.gms.ui)\netc\nAny suggestions on what do do next?",
