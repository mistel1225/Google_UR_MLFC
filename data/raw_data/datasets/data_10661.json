    "content": "I already tried adding the comcast email, it is listed in the right column of the screen snip and says Windows Live under the address. That choice, Windows live,  was accepted but did not retrieve my email. I do not know what to choose now from the choices. I was able to link the other comcast email a couple of months ago, but have not been able to recreate that. Thanks.",
