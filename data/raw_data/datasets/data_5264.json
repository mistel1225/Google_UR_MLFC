    "title": "Google is muting sounds recent problem",
    "content": "So every time I hook my Google Pixel 3 AXL up to my car via the headphone jack afterwards Google is always muting some sounds and my text message notifications do not work. Once I reboot my phone they come back.  This happens every time I have used the phone in my car with the auxiliary connection through the headphone jack. A definite duplicatable problem. So every time I get out of my car I have to reboot my phone in order for my text notifications to make noise. This just literally started happening this week not sure if there were updates or what the heck is going on. Anybody have a clue?",
