    "content": "I have my Pixel 5 setup to recognize my headset as a trusted device and keep my phone unlocked when it's on, but here's the thing... i'm driving... my phone is in my pocket... I need to make a call for whatever reason so I put on my headset and try to call and it tells me it can't until I unlock my phone (unless I am doing a redial... that seems to work), which means I have to physically pull my phone out of my pocket and unlock it, while driving, to make a \"hands-free\" call. Why does connecting it to the headset not go ahead and unlock it, if it is a trusted device... or at least unlock it to make a phone call? Is there any workaround for this other than making the phone pretty much unlocked all of the time, which obviously creates other issues?",
