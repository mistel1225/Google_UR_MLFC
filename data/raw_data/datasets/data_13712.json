    "content": "After about two days, my new 4a started losing battery rapidly (about 1-2% per minute). After a restart or a 0% shutdown, the phone shows the real value again, only for it to drop.\n\nFor example, I start my phone on 100%, and it quickly drains to 0%. It restarts. It is on 92% and quickly drains to 0%. It restarts. It is on 84%. \n\nAnd so on....\n\nA factory reset seemed to help for a das, but it's quickly become worse again. \n\nI am on my wit's end because this problem seems unheard of, but from what I gather, it seems like the phone isn't displaying the real battery capacity. Could this be a hardware issue? \n\nThe phone is factory, never dropped or anything.",
