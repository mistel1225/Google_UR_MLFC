I've tried everything I can find online, including clearing the cache and storage in the \"Media Storage\" system app, but the problem persists.  I've also tried removing all my audio files and re-loading them onto the device, but the problem persists.  Also, there isn't a \".nomedia\" file in the music directory.",
