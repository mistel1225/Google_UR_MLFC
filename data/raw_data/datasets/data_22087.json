    "content": "My Pixel 3a's charger recently started to charge for 2seconds - stop, 2seconds - stop, repeat. After a day of this, I tried to turn the phone on to find it was stuck in fastboot mode. Start, Recovery Mode, Power Off, all resulted in a blink back to the fastboot screen. \nAfter reading some other posts on here and around the internet it seems like this issue only happens to rooted, modded, or jailbroken phones. I've never even attempted any such thing. This problem has persisted for about 3 days now",
