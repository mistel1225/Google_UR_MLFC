    "content": "Previously on my Pixel 4, I could restore my Gsuite account like a personal Google account. However, when I switched to pixel 5, it automatically created a work profile and I had to reinstall most of the apps in work profile in order for me to access my previously synced data from my pixel 4.\nHence can I just disable the work profile so that my Gsuite account operates like a personal account?",
