    "content": "I recently updated my phone to android 10 and am now unable to unlock the phone. I do not have the issue of the phone getting stuck on the google boot screen. My phone will start and the unlock screen comes up and after I put in my password the screen will go black, and then send me right back to the boot screen. Any suggestions on how to fix, or other people having the same problem?",
