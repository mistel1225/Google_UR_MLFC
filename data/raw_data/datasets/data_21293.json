    "content": "Since I have owned my Pixel 2 XL I have used it as my clock.  I plug it in before going to bed and when I want to see what time it is I can just look at the screen and see the time.  For the past three nights in a row the screen has been blank when I wake up.  When I unlock the phone the top status bar is completely missing.  I can reboot the phone to get it back but that does not result in a permanent fix.\n\nThoughts?",
