    "content": "Traded my original Pixel for a Pixel 3a, taking advantage of T-Mobile's 2-year long kickback of $400. The phone's locked to T-Mobile. I'm guessing that all updates and patches will pass through T-Mobile before I get them. Correct? Anybody have experience with T-Mobile's turnaround time for updates and care to comment?\n \nI've noticed that the phone's still at the March security update.",
