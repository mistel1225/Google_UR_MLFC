    "title": "Want my Pixel 3a XL screen fixed, how can I get in touch with google customer service?",
    "content": "I broke the screen on my phone and can't use the inbuilt customer service from the Pixel. IMEI-code in the \"find an authorized repair partner\" on google, it says I have to contact support. When I click on the link I just get to a menu, with no contact info. And when I finally found the same option to get a call or text from google online, I get the error \"contact us on business hours\". Which is weird because I'm trying in \"business hours\". Please help",
