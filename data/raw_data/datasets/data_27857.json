    "content": "Hi,\n\nRecently my battery performance has dropped significantly. After some looking into into the matter it seems the Google Play Services is draining it by quite a bit. I've been at work all day and have only used my phone on my breaks, usually by this time I still have 45-60% left but as I type it's dropped to 20%. \nWhat can I do about this?",
