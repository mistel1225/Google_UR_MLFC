    "content": "My wife and I both bought a Pixel 3 at the same time. Both phones failed in an identical manner within two weeks of each other. The phone simply stopped accepting charge, and I saw a message in the battery settings showing it was connected, but could not charge at this time. Both phones eventually shut down due to drained battery and will not charge or turn on. Both phones were working great right up until they stopped charging and had consistent battery life. Would appreciate some support as we can't go out and buy two new phones right now.",
