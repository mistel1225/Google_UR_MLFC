    "content": "With much anticipation, I've been waiting for Google to allow direct streaming to my hearing aids, I just upgraded my pixel 2 to the pixel 4 XL to allow direct streaming to my Resound Quattro hearing aids. (Finally approved by Resound)\n\nDue to my moderate/severe hearing loss work gave me an iPhone (no camera) so I have some experience with direct streaming.  One issue and one suggestion for the Pixel 4XL. The first and very annoying issue, is that under settings/sound you can select to have the sound  stream directly to your hearing aids or directly to your device. The problem is that the phone seems to decide when to send the sound to your hearing aid or to the device. For instance I was trying to view a video with some friends and no matter how many times I went into settings to send the sound to the device within a few seconds it would go back to my hearing aids. This happens quite often. Very noticeable and as I said very very annoying! \n\nThe one feature I like with iPhone is that when an incoming call comes it it'll ring directly to my hearing aids. it doesn't appear that the Pixel 4 has that feature...unless I'm not sure where to find it. It would be nice feature to have if isn't already there..\n\nI'm rooting for Google to continue to improve the streaming capability and would like to talk directly with someone that has a strong understand of hearing aids and the streaming environment.",
