    "title": "Poor battery life and blurred selfie camera pics on brand new P5",
    "content": "I have switched to dark mode, I have switched from 5G to LTE, I only have necessary GPS running, battery optimizer is activated, no Bluetooth/wifi scanning, etc. My battery only seems to last half a day and I wouldn't consider myself a heavy cell phone user. I send the occasional Snapchat message throughout the day, some web browsing, some photography, etc. I'm not streaming movies and music all day or anything like that! \n\nI was really looking forward to having a phone that I wouldn't have to carry a charger around for it! So unfortunate. I thought these were supposed to have decent batteries? Is it possibly faulty?\n\nI have a feeling I was spoiled with the P3 dual selfie camera. The detail on this P5 is really lacking.",
