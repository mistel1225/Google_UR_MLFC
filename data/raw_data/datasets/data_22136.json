    "content": "Phone screen is messed up, despite phone being 6 months old. Was never dropped or mishandled.\nHad a blinking green screen for a while, and now the right side of the screen simply doesn't work. At other times a pink line appears on the screen, or a green screen appears. Screen can take up to 20 seconds to boot up, with pixels lighting up at random prior to the screen actually booting up. Overall, screen is simply capoot for no apparent reason, the phone is mint.\n\nI have already tried the factory reset multiple times, I have removed screen protector and case from the phone, and have tried multiple other troubleshooting methods found on the web and none have worked. It is my understanding from multiple forum posts that this is a common issue with this model. Anybody have answers, cause I haven't found any?\n\nThank you",
