    "content": "For all I know all Android phones released with Oreo or higher do support the LDAC Codec.\nNow I found the \"Pixel phone hardware tech specs\" support page.\nIt states all phones after the original Pixel (wich was released with Nougat) do support it. Except for the Pixel 3a/3a XL wich was released with Pie.\n\nSo is that just an error or is there a reason? I already tried contacting the chat support but they couldn't answer that question.",
