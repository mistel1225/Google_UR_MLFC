    "content": "Hi, I'm hoping somebody can help. \n\nI changed my passcode on my Google Pixel 2, Then I was unable to log in with said passcode the next time I turned it on.\n\nI've tried a variety of miss-types and old passwords in case I did something stupid, but I can't get it to work.\n\nI've tried to wipe it using the bootloader recovery mode and it receives an error message: \"no command\" any playing around with this seems to take me back to the bootloader etc. \n\nI've tried plugging in and using Dr.Fone, however that doesn't seem to connect (tried alternative PC's and cables too).\n\nI've also tried the Google Find my device, but it can't find it. (Connected to Wifi, Tried different SIMs etc.)\n\nIs there anything I can do? I basically just need to get some things from it and then I can throw the phone away.\n\nthanks!",
