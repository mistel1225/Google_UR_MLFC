    "title": "I put the earphones on my pixel 3 xl and they are not working. Google sent me earphones, not USB-C",
    "content": "My earphones that came with my pixel 3 xl were broken. I took them back to the store I bought the phone but after 3 months they sent me earphones with 3.5 headphone jack and not USB-C, saying that they don't have any more earphones of USB-C in stock. I bought this phone approximately 1000â‚¬ and I think it's unacceptable that the company can't replace broken accessories",
