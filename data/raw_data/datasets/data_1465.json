    "content": "Hello. My Pixel 3 XL is no longer able to detect any nearby networks when Wi-Fi is turned on. Usually, attempting to turn Wi-Fi on causes the Settings app to hang or crash. I can't think of any apps or downloads that might have caused this, and the problem persisted both in Safe Mode and through a factory reset.\n\nI have heard that Android 11 has caused similar Wi-Fi issues in Pixels, so I'm guessing this is either a firmware or hardware problem. I am careful not to drop or damage the phone, so I don't think it is likely to be a hardware problem. Is there anything else I should try before I send the phone in for repair?",
