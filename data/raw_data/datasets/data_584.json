    "title": "Pixel 4a 5g NFC Not Working Due to Back Separating",
    "content": "NFC stopped working on my Pixel 4a 5G. I initially thought the sensor had gone bad, but after reading a bunch of other posts online, it sounds like this is a known issue for the Pixel 4a 5G and the Pixel 4 XL. The back separates just a little bit causing NFC to fail, but if you squeeze the phone together you can sometimes get it to work again. \n\nNow that I knew exactly the issue I was looking for, I'm seeing this problem all over the internet. It's obviously a known issue. According to this Reddit thread, Ubreakifix (Google's partner for repairs) tells their employees not to mention that it's a known issue.\n\nIs Google really going to try to ignore this?",
