    "title": "Pixel 3a phone crashed with a warranty, 6 weeks ago. File a claim denied, no record by Ins. of IME",
    "content": "Done all, claim denied by Ins. say: \"no record of IME\". Phone was a replacement, told Google replaced original under their warranty. Receive daily email messages by 'The Support Team: \"Rest assured that I'm working on this and I'll keep you posted on the status going further\". \nI no longer receive in the message: \"within 24-48 hours\". This is my only phone! Would purchase another at this point, but the prices exceed my budget. Have asked \"what is the problem\", no response to this question. So, Assurant says it's Google Store error, why not just send me a phone?",
