    "content": "Hi,\nI have issue with my brand new Pixel 5. Double tap to wake stops working after a while, until I wake up the phone via power button, then it works for a bit, and then after device goes idle, its stops again.\n\nI'm coming from Pixel 2, which never had this issue\n\nAlso, always on display has almost the same issue, and It just went off on me just as I'm typing the on my laptop :/. Its sounds exactly as this https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/91572236\n\nI don't have any batter saver on, no screen protector, etc, I'm a developer so I should be technically sound with this stuff.\n\nHere is a video https://imgur.com/a/7we74PG",
