    "content": "The 30% default brightness is not bright enough for me. I work from home with a dim room with several bright monitors and everytime the screen brightness goes to 30% I have to manually raise it to 45% or so to really see it well. I've turned adaptive brightness off and been confronted with an almost black screen outside. I just want to be able to use adaptive brightness and have a brighter default.",
