    "title": "Small white bar when using gesture navigation prevents use of bottom edge of the screen.",
    "content": "I'm trying to use gesture navigation on my pixel 3a and ever since the android 11 update I am unable to use buttons on the very edge of the bottom of my screen.  Wherever the white bar is.  So sometimes when typing I cannot hit the space bar (unless I hit the very very top) or in a game I cannot hit a button. I cannot figure out when the typing one happens as it is only when the padding on the bottom is not there.  And of course I realize I can change my navigation style but I'd really prefer not to.",
