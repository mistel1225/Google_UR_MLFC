    "content": "Hello all those who reading this appeal. I have purchased Google pixel 2 for personal using.\nDuring the first power-on, Android 8 was installed on it and I successfully updated to 11. On Android 11 smartphone worked fine but after I reconnected the screen of course by disconnecting it from the body of the smartphone(that is, simply reconnecting the same screen), smartphone began to work much worse and I felt it immediately.\nWhat i mean:\n1) The scroll in some applications began to freeze.\n2) Several system animations started to work incorrectly(when squeezing the edges animations of the assistant panel freezes)\n3) While pulling the bottom edge, the animation of running applications hangs.\n4) Google applications to the left of the main screen began to slow down during scrolling.\n5) Brightness does not work correctly.\nIn order to solve these problems I wanted to reinstall the system but could not do it because bootloader is locked.\nThe Android 11 version is the latest from October 5th.\nI hope that Google will see my problem and help me, since I don't live in America and I cannot contact the official service center as it is not here.\nBest regards to everyone reading.",
