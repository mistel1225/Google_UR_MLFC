    "content": "My pixel 2 is not responding. I used it like half an hour ago and it was running perfectly. I left my phone and went to do some work. And when I returned to check the phone I noticed it's turned off. I tried to turn it back on. After pressing the power button for like 30sec it didn't turned on. I clearly remember it had 65% charge left. Still I charged it for 1hour. But there was no sign of life even after plugin the phone with charger. Still it's cold dead.. any solution for fix this issue?",
