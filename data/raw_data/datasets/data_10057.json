    "content": "I've checked all the settings and they're all set to display all content. I've gone into each individual app and change the settings to always display all content.\n\nI'm still not getting any notifications on the lock screen or in the notification bar from apps such as Reddit, Facebook, and Textra. I've also uninstalled and reinstalled several apps and cleared the cache with no success. \n\nI'm using the lock screen and notification bar that came with the Pixel 5 so I'm not using any 3rd party apps for those functionalities. I'm out of ideas as to how to get notifications to display. \n\nThe only thing I haven't tried yet is a factory reset but I'm hoping to avoid doing that.",
