    "title": "Weather Widget(At a glance), YouTube Maximizer and Volume Button Issue with Pixel 4a?",
    "content": "I have 3 issues with my Pixel 4a and now they are very annoying to me.\n\n1. Weather Icon keeps disappearing in 'At a glance widget. It only comes back when you make a duplicate widget of it.\n2. When you maximize YouTube and the device goes on landscape mode touch buttons don't work at all. The only work through with this is switching to the app launcher and getting back to YouTube.\n3. Volume Button on the side stops working sometimes, feels like a software issue more than a hardware one cause it works smoothly when it does.",
