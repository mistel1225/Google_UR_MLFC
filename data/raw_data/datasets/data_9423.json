    "content": "Hello everyone, I wanted to shed some light on my experience so far with Google help. I clearly squeezed my phone to pull up the assistant while I was outside taking photographs of Christmas lights, and the phone screen cracked. This is not to me an accidental damage situation. This is a design flaw that is not being addressed. They want to charge me for a new screen, and Google fi cannot get me a SIM card for 20 plus days. So I'm now stuck with using a cracked glass phone that's wrapped in a plastic bag. If anyone can shed some light on what they did to get real support from Google pixel help addressing a design flaw, please let me know I'm having a horrible time with Google fi support and Google pixel support. And this straight up was a freak thing that happened.\nAnd no I am not the incredible hulk :-) I actually have my sensitivity level set for what I call geriatric setting :-)",
