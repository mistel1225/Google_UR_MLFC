    "content": "My new Pixel 3a doesn't show the Chromecast icon in chrome browser videos but my Samsung so does show the icon and works fine.\nMy Chromecast is linked and works in other apps but when I try to cast a video from inside the chrome browser there is not an icon to cast. Is there a setting I haven't turned on or something? I've only had the Pixel for a few weeks but I can find a solution anywhere specific to the Pixel. I love the phone but this is just an odd issue considering it's all Google.",
