    "title": "4a and Do Not Disturb",
    "content": "While my 4a works flawlessly, wife's 4a continually reverts to Do Not Disturb, failing to allow calls or texts through. If its not doing that, it also turns off Wi-Fi. We are long-time Pixel users, etc. so this is a bit surprising. Have even put our phones side by side and duplicated my settings on her phone, to no avail. Getting to be a bit much. Have tried the suggestions seen here, still no joy. The only variable is/was that I was able to get 42+ months out of my original XL 128 while she had to, having dropped hers a couple of times, get a 'refurbished' XL from Asurion. When that died, we knew the 4a was imminent so we picked up an interim phone for her, a Samsung J3 or some such. This probably doesn't make sense, especially since we've twiddled the 4a but it 'feels' like some setting or other from the J3 made it over when merging data and is at cross-purposes with the 4a and Android 11. Doesn't make sense, I know, but that's the only difference.",
