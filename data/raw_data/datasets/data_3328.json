    "title": "Battery drain even worse after latest update",
    "content": "Bought this phone less than 2 years ago, so far I'm satisfied until this. My battery drained very quickly even without use, I usually charge my phone to 85% before going to bed and it decreases to around 50% in the morning. It got worse when I actually use the phone, had to charge after 1-2 hours of use (WhatsApp, browsing). The drain happens around 3-4 weeks ago and I'm running out of ideas to try.\n\nFrom the usage; screen takes the most 20% in 4 hours, but I have turned adaptive brightness and lower it to about 20%. Next is phone idle and Google Play service.\n\nI tried deleting some recent apps, thought that was the problem, but does not change a thing. Update system also does not work. I've sent feedback about this device from my phone hoping to get some suggestion on how to fix it. I've read suggestion to downgrade OS, but I would like that to be my last option.\n\nDid the latest update, battery drained even worse. After restart, System UI isn't responding, had a glitch. Went from 75% to 28% then proceed to decrease faster than a ticking clock.\n\n \nAny ideas are welcome.. Thank you in advance",
