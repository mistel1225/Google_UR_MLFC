    "content": "Hi! \n\nMy Pixel 2's display/screen has been working erratically and finally the screen stopped displaying in a way that I can read, but I can tell through testing that the phone is basically still operational (can call it and it rings, can soft restart and it reboots just fine, I can hold the volume up or down button and dimly see the volume slider on the display).  So, I believe that the display is probably not damaged.  I can see flashes of screen content that appear sharp, but very dim, so I suspect the connection of the screen to the phone has gotten loosened.\n\nUnfortunately, the display stopped working while the phone power was still on.  I'd like to turn it off, ideally without attempting a factory reset, so that I can have the display connection checked.\n\nI have successfully restarted the phone many times without needing to use the display, but I have been unable to find any resource online which describes how I might power down the phone (without it rebooting) that does not require interacting with my phone display to select \"power off\".  I'd rather not let the battery run down to zero if possible, so any ideas/techniques, and I think it's a bad idea to try to have someone work on a phone that is turned on.\n\nAnyone know how to turn of a Pixel 2 without needing to interact with the display?\nThanks in advance for your helpful suggestions!\n-MC",
