    "content": "The Assistant doesn't react to my voice commands when audio is being played. So far I tried with both, YouTube and Spotify, and while I can start them via the Assistant, once the video/song is playing it doesn't react anymore. What's weird is that it doesn't even work when the media is playing but the sound is muted, which eliminates the possibility of any accoustic interference. I have also tried using it while playing WhatsApp voice messages and it did work in that case, which leaves me even more confused as to what the issue is.",
