    "content": "Last morning my pixel started freezing, both while using it and in standby, and the only thing I could do is restarting by holding the power button for a longer time. After restart it works for a minute or two and then it freezes again.\n\nThe weird thing is that between 10 am and this morning it worked fine and then it started again. While writing this I had a freeze for about 2 minutes and then it worked again without restarting, so I don't know what to think.\n\nI even did a factory reset (it froze while setting it up, before connecting to WiFi and typing in my Google account), ran it without sim card and in safe mode, in airplane mode and neither worked, the phone was still freezing.\n\nIs there anything else I could try?",
