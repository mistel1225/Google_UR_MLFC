    "content": "I'm struggling to understand why, when my Pixel 4XL is docked on the Pixel Stand, I have to unlock my phone for it to do anything such as turn bedroom lights on. I get why it would be off in your pocket in case it hears someone else but I've also got voice match on. Has Google really gone backwards here? Considering the stand itself is double the price of the Nest Mini you'd think it could have the same features.\n\nI really hope I'm missing something here but I don't believe I am, any suggestions?",
