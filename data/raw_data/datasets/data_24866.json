    "content": "I wear reading glasses during the day, and so only have them on for part if the day. Does anyone know how will the facial recognition work?\n\nAs I see it you will have to do one of the following. \n\n1. Program two separate faces, one with glasses and one without. Is this possible\n\n2. You have to take off (or put on ) your glasses to unlock the phone. \n\nAny thoughts?",
