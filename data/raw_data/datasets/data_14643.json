    "content": "I was planning to buy pixel 4 a did research for service center and their related issues. What i found is like everything is negative response with their service partner b2x . Also, there are not ready to take repair request these days. I was totally dissapointed about that. How come leading tech giant doesn't have a proper repair center in India? Can anyone one suggest me is it worth to pay 30 thousands rupees for a no repair support device?",
