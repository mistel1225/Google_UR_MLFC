    "content": "My home screen used to show date, time, and weather. Now all it shows is the date in small font. I can't resize it or change it. Clicking it asks to open my calendar or email only. Holding it brings up preferences which gives no options for interface. It's terrible compared to the old widget.\n\nI've uninstalled google updates, cleared cache and data. All the old tricks. No good.",
