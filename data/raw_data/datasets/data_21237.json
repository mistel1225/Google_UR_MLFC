    "content": "I recently got a Pixel 3a XL that, while fantastic, especially for the price, has been having some weird technical issues. The phone had been working fine but suddenly today I couldn't hear anyone who called me unless I put the phone on speaker mode. Phone works otherwise but I can't hear anyone with the regular speaker on the top of the phone.\n\nAny suggestions on what to do? This is my second Pixel 3a XL device, the first having to be returned because it somehow melted the USB-C cable I was using and would refuse to charge after it was removed by a technician.",
