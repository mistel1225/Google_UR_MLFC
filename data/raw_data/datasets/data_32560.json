    "content": "I was in the process of grabbing some videos and photos from my wife's Pixel when I noticed that a bunch of the files could not be copied due to a Cyclical Redundancy Errors.  With Windows, I'd just run a chkdsk /f and fix them, but I am finding no App based or software solutions for this problem after extensive searching online.  I've tried mapping the Pixel's internal storage as a network drive, but that doesn't seem to help.  Thanks in advance for your time and help.",
