    "content": "This morning I was using my phone, with the auto rotate feature off as I always have it, but when I open my apps the screen auto rotated. I checked the settings, and auto rotate was off, so I tried turning it on and it still happened (this I expected) when I triied turning it off again, the button greyed out again but my screen still rotated when I tired my phone. I've also tried resetting my phone with no luck. Are there any other ways to turn the auto rotate off?",
