    "content": "Me and my wife have the exact same phone. Tmobile pixel 4 xl variants. \nHer phone gives the option of post picture blur options while mine does not. Before i get the typical the pictures i am trying to use must not qualify, let me stop you to say they absolutely do. The same pic on my wifes phone gives her the option where mine says \"pop\" where hers says \"blur\" on the exact same pic. My phone is fully updated and runs the same exact software version as my wifes phone and google photos versions is also the exact same. I have gotten the most recent feature drop with the bed time stuff tab in the clock so i dont see why i would not have gotten the blur one. How can I force this or get it to update? This is driving me nuts",
