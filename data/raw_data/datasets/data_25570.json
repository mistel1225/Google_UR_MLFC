    "content": "I was facing charging issue in my Google pixel device. As suggested by one of the google-support team members to update that to Android 10.0, I did that.\nAgain, I was facing the same issue and it got switched off and stop charging. After informing again, someone came and picked my device for Diagnosis. \n\nAnd then Google service engineer from B2X(official service partner) in India said the issue is with motherboard. As my pixel is out of warranty for the replacement so got estimate to repair is around Rs.22,000/- (~$310). My phone did not completed 2 years till and I am facing this motherboard issue.\nThis is so sick from Google side for not having quality checks on the defective motherboards.\nThere was a program of free replacement of motherboard in USA under ubreakifix center. \nBut no such program in India.\n\nThis is the last time I have bought Google products. \n\nAnd when I discussed with senior Manager, he was not ready to listen and I told him, if I plan to purchase next pixel device in future then the same thing can also happen after completing 1 year of warranty then he was saying it is up to you but we will charge if any issue occurs after one year.\n\nHelp me out",
