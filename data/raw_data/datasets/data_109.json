    "content": "My carrier supports wifi calls and has no issues. Never had a problem on the Pixel 2. Now on the Pixel 5, wifi calls take forever to connect if they ever do.. and when they connect either I or the other person cannot hear the other. I have the latest update. I've tried resetting WI Fi, clearing phone cache, and toggling airplane mode. Google really dropped the ball with the Pixel 5. The single most important thing a phone should be able to do is make and receive calls. Apparently many others have the same problem, and there is no fix in sight. Any suggestions?",
