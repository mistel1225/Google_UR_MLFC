    "title": "Pixel 3 Power Button Ultra Sensitive - Triggers Without Being Pressed",
    "content": "My Pixel 3 was stuck in a reboot loop. I ended up having to factory reset it. It's back up and running again but now the power button is ultra-sensitive. It's responding without being touched (ie power/restart menu popping up, screen locking and unlocking, etc.)\nI've seen few, old threads on this topic so I know I am not alone. But my phone is NOT on warranty anymore as I've had it for over a year (18 months). Other than paying for a repair and to mailing it in to Google and waiting 10 business days, what are my options?? Is this something I can fix at home??\nAny help appreciated!",
