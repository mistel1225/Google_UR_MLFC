    "content": "The camera on the rear of the device goes unstable past 1.8x zoom.  The is to say it won't focus and it bounces around as if on a gimbal.  This affects both the still camera and video.  It does not seem to affect the screen side camera.   We've tried rebooting, uninstalling the camera software, rebooting in safe mode and clearing the cache.    I've only had the phone for 3 days and one would think after all the hoopla about the quality and capability of the camera something like this would have been extensively tested.  After having my original Pixel XL for several years I'm very disappointed with this offering.  I'm returning this phone for a replacement under warranty but I will be updating my experience with it in about a week after receiving the replacement.\n\nHas anyone else had a similar issue??",
