    "title": "Reset pattern WITHOUT wiping all data? Older versions have options, why don't newer ones?",
    "content": "I use my fingerprint to access my phones, but I forgot my pattern (which is required on restarts). There HAS to be another way to access my phone (or reset password) that doesn't require me erasing my data. I'd do anything else besides erase everything. What's the point of accessing my phone again, if all the memories I created with it are gone? I feel stuck in a nightmare and I need help! I've been a loyal Google advocate for SO long, from most Nexus' to almost the entire pixel lineup (including my new pixel book). If anyone can help, it's you guys. THANK YOU IN ADVANCE!!",
