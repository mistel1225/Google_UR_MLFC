    "content": "Phone was on my chest for a few minutes. When I picked it up to check my email it was stuck with the G logo and a continuously cycling progress bar. I let it run for over 4 hours plugged in and there is still no indication that it's making any progress. I've just tried power cycling it (which I realize now may have been a bad idea) and every time I try booting it the same issue arises. The Pixel boot animation plays then I get stuck at the G logo with that progress bar. I would really appreciate any solution that doesn't include a factory reset.",
