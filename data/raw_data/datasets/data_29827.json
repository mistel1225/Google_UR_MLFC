    "content": "I cannot transfer all data to my new Pixel 3. I need to go through all apps and start again:\n• setup banking account apps\n• login to each app like Spotify, Blinkist etc. Any app that has an account is reset\n• email app requires reset of all accounts\n\nCan I just copy everything and use my phone like the old one without doing ANY other action?",
