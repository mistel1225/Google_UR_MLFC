    "content": "Apparently my 2017 BMW with iDrive supports; iPhone, Samsung, LG, and the original Pixel but not the Pixel 3.  I can connect via bluetooth to  make calls but that is it.  I can not listen to texts or emails.  I can confirm that the iphone works perfectly as well as my old Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge. \n\nWhat is is about the Pixel that is incompatible, and can i do something to fix this problem??",
