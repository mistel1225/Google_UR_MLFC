    "title": "Pixel 4 XL WiFi Disconnects after Android 11 Upgrade",
    "content": "After upgrading my P4 XL to Android 11, I've started noticing WiFi disconnects on the regular. So, I did a factory reset - usually do this after a major upgrade of Android - and, it's still happening. None of my other devices disconnect as frequently as my P4 XL, so it's not the router.\n\nThis did not happen on Android 10 at all, so, it's definitely a bug in Android 11 and possibly the new P4 XL firmware. Anyone else experiencing a similar issue?",
