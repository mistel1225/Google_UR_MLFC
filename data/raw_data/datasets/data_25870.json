    "title": "Why did you bother to bring Gesture Navigation to OG Pixels?",
    "content": "The new Gesture Navigation feature on Android 10; my question to Google is why on earth did you bother to bring it to the OG pixels? It is so choppy that it's a pain to use. It drops frames so much that it makes the OG Pixels feel like to be running a entry level SoC; it's utter nonsensical. I mean I know that it was purposeful; if it worked as smooth as it does on a Pixel 4 or Pixel 3 no one will be upgrading, but still, I thought you guys had least ethical side of conducting business. First you kill off the OG pixels after providing three years of updates, while the hardware itself is more than enough to run even the new two iterations of android, whatever they maybe, even the security patches will be stopped. Which is a big shame and shows how needy google is for consumers to be forced to upgrade to their new phones. And I mean their new phone is a Pixel 4, which is hilarious.\n\nSo this is a complaint and a request as well, to the good self if you have anything of that left. I know there is one last update left for the OG Pixels which is forthcoming in December. In which I will sincerely request you to optimise the Gesture Navigation performance on the OG Pixels, because as it stands it's practically unusable because of the all the aforesaid frame drops.\n\n\nRegards,\nSaurav",
