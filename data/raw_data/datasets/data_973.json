    "content": "I stupidly clinked on a link in a text supposedly from ParcelForce about a missed delivery. I realised it was a scam when I was asked for my bank details, but not before I had sent my name, address and DOB. Should I be worried scammers have access to my phone - or will be able to do Identity Fraud?",
