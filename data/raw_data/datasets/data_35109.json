    "content": "My google pixel 3 XL stopped working after being exposed to rain. I brought it to the google repair Centre and they say it’s out of warranty. The cost to fix it is more than a thousand dollars.\n\nThe phone was exposed to heavy rain but nothing out of the ordinary. I believe living in a tropical climate with high humidity could have contributed to the problem or the phone could have itself been defective on purchase. I’ve only been using this phone for less than 3 months hence I cannot imagine it having gone through much wear and tear, if any.\n\nI wish to escalate this matter to Google. This phone is clearly not even water resistant as it can’t even stand up to bad weather. I live in Singapore and there is monsoon but frankly the weather is nothing dramatic, just high humidity. It is misrepresentation to market the Google Pixel as water resistant up to 3minutes.\n\nBefore this I’ve been an Apple user for years and have NEVER had problems with exposure to rain. This is my first time using a Google phone and I bought the highest end model available, paid a high price for it, hence you can imagine my disappointment. \n\nI hope Google can look into this urgently. I’ve already lost use of the phone for more than a week and counting.",
