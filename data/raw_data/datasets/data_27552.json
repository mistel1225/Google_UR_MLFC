    "content": "I bought a Pixel 3 in July at full price ($799) but didn't use right away because my Pixel 2 was still working. I activated it on 14 September and upgraded to Android 10 when prompted 6 days into use. Within 24 hours, the whole device failed and wouldn't boot, even after a full day's charge with the original charger, plus everything else described in the Help section.\nGoogle promised to replace it if I sent the failed product back. I sent the failed product back immediately on 21 September, and it was received. \n10 days later, I got an email saying to contact them *for reimbursement* so I could re-buy. They had sent a phone, but it was not delivered.\nAfter AN HOUR on chat with someone who kept stalling me and saying my return period was over, I called and requested reimbursement (no phone - broken or new replacement). The rep, who at least listened instead of giving me stalling sentences every 3 minutes, said he couldn't do it himself but would send the notes so I could be reimbursed.\nChecking my account (since I did not receive any additional communication in 24 hours), it looks like - instead of doing the reimbursement they suggested - Google has sent me a *refurbished* Pixel 3.\n\nSO.... be careful you don't end up in this kind of scam. A *new* Pixel 3 is on sale for $499. Even though I only got 6 days use out of one for which I paid $799, Google is trying to scam me by sending a used one.\n\nIf I were making a decision again, I'd probably look elsewhere, if this is the quality and customer service Google proposes.",
