    "content": "Wireless charging Stand worked great for first month, but suddenly stopped charging. Will only connect for a second or two and then do nothing, so waking up to low battery. Using original cable in working wall outlet. Phone still charges fine via USB-C. Tried taking case off, vertical/horizontal/centered positioning, forgetting stand and trying to set up again, rebooting phone, verified Pixel is fully updated. No fix. Any ideas?",
