    "content": "Visual voicemail turned on, confirmed to match husband's Pixel 3a setting & his visual voicemail works. \nI've tried clearing storage & cache for phone app & carrier settings (as recommended on Google forum), tried turning VV setting off & back on, updated & restarted phone, & NOTHING works. There's a line at the top of the voicemail box thing that says \"transcribing\" but it never loads or transcribes. I'm at a loss & so frustrated.",
