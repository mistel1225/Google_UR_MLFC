    "title": "Issues after latest update on pixel 4a 5g",
    "content": "After installing the latest update today 3/2, I have no data connectivity. Off the bat I couldn't make or receive calls or texts, they came back eventually but not completely, after I got home from work and got on wifi I received a few texts, but was able to text the Mrs on the mobile network. As of right now anything that uses data when on the mobile network tells me I have no connection. I've tried several power cycles but really don't know much else to do... The phone is a Pixel 4a 5g and had no issues previous to this update.",
