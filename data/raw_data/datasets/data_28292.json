    "content": "Bought a pixel 3 XL. Order is now a few days late, no estimated delivery date and support representatives refuse to cancel the order and provide misleading information:\n\nEmail\n\"Your order is currently on hold until we have the inventory ready to fulfil the entire order.\"\n\nLive chat\n\"Your order is no longer cancelable. If you do not want to receive your package you can ask the delivery driver that you want to refuse delivery and return to sender when the time of delivery.\"\n\"Yes, it has be sent but it didn't delivered till now, that is the reason we've escalated this to our specialist team.\"\n\nTotal shambles.",
