    "content": "How do I change which google account all my apps are signed into? Ex: google maps, google play, etc are all signed into an account that used to be my primary but I no longer use. Is it possible to switch all of those to my current primary account without losing contacts, info, etc? \n\nI've been using this old primary acct for a while so most of my info is linked to it. Since it's no longer the email account I use it's sort of a pain. I'm willing to put in some effort to switch it over just want to make sure I'm doing it correctly.",
