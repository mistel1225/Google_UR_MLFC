    "title": "Screen violently flashing when unlocked?",
    "content": "I was listening to music while walking my dog on my Pixel 3 and everything was working perfectly. When I return and attempt to pause the music my device began violently and rapidly flashing an extremely bright greenish white color. After restarting a number of times I realized I am able to see the entire screen before unlocking the device. However, as soon as I unlock the phone everything begins flashing. \n\nAny thoughts on what to do? I cannot call Pixel support since -- well -- my pixel is broken. I do not have Twitter and I cannot find another contact method. Any help would be appreciated because Google doesn't seem to support things they make after the point of sale.\n\nHonestly, I am feeling lucky I don't have epilepsy because it is that bright and disorienting.",
