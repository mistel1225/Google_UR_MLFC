    "content": "When I attempt to edit a video from my Pixel 3 XL it crashes whatever software that I am using.  I have tried Premier Elements 11, Premier Elements 2019, Pinnacle Studio 19.  All with the same results.  All three packages work with videos created on other devices.    I tried both 4k and 1080p",
