    "content": "Hello. Dark Theme is turned off. My home screen was originally the \"Gradient\" background (default, I think). I changed the background for the home screen and lock screen to a Solid light grey.\n\nHowever, when I swipe to bring up the num-pad to unlock my phone, the background goes black, and numbers are white. This is fine when I'm indoors, but when outside in bright light it's very difficult to see the numbers to punch them in.\n\nHow can I change the \"unlocking\" portion of the \"lock screen\" to be a white background with black numbers? Or any kind of customization to this at all.",
