    "content": "In the form of a Pixar pitch, because, why can't this be fun?\n\nOnce upon a time, there were two Pixel 2XL's\nEvery day, they were able to perform file transfers with PCs running Windows, and their owners were happy and content\nOne day, one of the Pixel 2XL's upgrade to Android 9 \"Pie\"\nBecause of that, it could no longer make a USB connection to the PC, even though the other Pixel 2XL, which was still on Android 8.1, was happily connecting without issue\nBecause of that, it's owner could not listen to the CDs he has recently bought and ripped, making him sad\nUntil finally, out of frustration, he posted here to try and get some help with it so he could safely unite the two Pixel 2XLs in the world of Pie",
