    "content": "I just bought a Pixel 3XL from a third-party store as google doesnt sell Pixel officially in where I live. However, I realized something that looks different than all the unboxing videos I saw online. \n\nPhoto 1: Here is a photo of the box i got. the detail is much lesser than all those i saw online. Btw i hid the bar code and stuffs cause i heard you are not supposed to show that to people (which i am not sure). Also, could someone tell me if the \"G\" stick just looks old or odd...\n\n\nPhoto 2: below is the standard sticker I see online which has much more detail. I have checked unboxing videos or articles made by people from the US and Taiwan.\n\n\nPhoto 3: another thing i found out is that my earphone package is missing the no.2 photo instruction. There is supposed to be a photo under \"2. Fit | Positionner\".\n\nI guess the phone itself looks fine and i can turn google assistant on with the earphone but just still want to make sure i am having the real Pixel. I am not too scared to log in to my account and start using the phone.\n\nI was thinking to check the with google using online chat; however, i don't find online chat anywhere on my phone or the internet. I can't dial to the US so please let me know if you know a way for me to contact Google Pixel help center without calling. Thank you very much!!!",
