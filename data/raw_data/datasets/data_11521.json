    "title": "Facebook chat bubbles will not switch people",
    "content": "For the past several days my Facebook messenger bubbles will not change to a new person. The first chat to start after I've closed the app opens fine. Once a second person messages me, their bubble pops up but shows the first chat (I can reply in the first chat as normal even if the bubble is the second person's profile pic). The bubble that originally showed the first chat then shows whatever is ony screen below the chat bubble (other apps/chrome/etc).\n\nI've checked for updates, cleared the cache, restarted my phone, and uninstalled/reinstalled the app and this is still happening. Please help?",
