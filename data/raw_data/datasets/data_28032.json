    "content": "I updated my Pixel 2XL to Android 10 noticed some minor glitches such as errors with notifications and gestures. Later the next day while using Google docs phone froze. Restarted phone, then tried to enter passcode on lock screen. I could not input the numbers. The screen would not respond to touch. Restarted phone several times but phone would not let me go type passcode to use phone. Performed factory reset according to a Google representatives advice. Problem persisted. To summarize, I can't use my phone because the screen stuck at \"Hi, There Screen\" and screen is unresponsive. I tried rebooting many times and I get stuck at the \"Hi, There Screen\".  Did I screw the Motherboard or the Screen. My Phone is now a toast worthless. I never a google phone is my life. It is a piece of garbage.",
