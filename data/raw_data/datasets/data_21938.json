    "content": "When I got my Pixel 2 during setup it asked if I wanted to enable the fingerprint scanner to be used for pulling down the notifications window by swiping down on it but after a few days when I had my phone completely setup how I wanted it the notifications window no longer pulls down when swiping on the fingerprint scanner when the settings for it are still on. How do I fix this?",
