    "title": "Pixel 2 won't switch automatically between wireless networks, have to do it manually",
    "content": "I have two networks in my house -- the main router and an extension. The extension has a strong signal in my home office, and the main has a strong signal in my bedroom. No matter how long I wait or what settings I try, it doesn't switch automatically to the stronger network when I have moved from one area to the other. \n\nBoth are remembered networks, and both get pretty weak when I'm at the other end of the house, so my phone will be slow and have trouble loading stuff... And I'll look and realize it's still connected to the one bar network from the other end of the house instead of the remembered 4 bar network right next to me. \n\nIs there a way to get my phone to seek the strongest network automatically? I've tried waiting awhile but it never switches on its own, even when the weak network it's connected to is too weak to load anything at all. I also think it drains my battery trying to load stuff with the weaker farther network before I realize and switch manually. Which I shouldn't have to do....",
