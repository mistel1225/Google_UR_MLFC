    "content": "I have a personal Gmail account and my work email uses Exchange. They're both synced to my Google App calendar. However I can only change the color of the Gmail account. \n\n\n\nSo in the app it looks like this. Then I go to settings. \n\n\nThen I click on the d11 calendar to change the color away from the premade color it gave me. \n\n\n\nAnd no option for color change. So I'm confused if there is a certain setting somewhere that will allow me to change the color eventually or am I S.O.L. and should just use a different Calendar app?",
