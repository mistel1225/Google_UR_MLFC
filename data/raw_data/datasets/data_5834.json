    "content": "I'm used to work from home with mobile hotspot, never had any problems (device: Sony Xperia XZ1 compact). Last week I switched to a Google Pixel 3a and the mobile hotspot is really unstable. Using e.g. Citrix on a connected computer is impossible. The downloadspeed seems okay but the upload speed sometimes drops near zero. Switching back to my old phone (same SIM) and it works without any problems.\n\nWhat could cause this? Is simply the phone botched?",
