    "content": "My Pixexl 3a XL used to unlock with voice and make voice calls while I was driving around with it in Bluetooth on my car. A recent update cause trouble and a Google help desk person had me revert back to the earlier version. Now I can't make calls from the lock screen and awaken the phone with my voice. It wants me to enter in my pin which is a pain and unsafe when I'm driving.",
