    "title": "Pixel earbuds cause notifications using the default flutterby sound won't stop w/o restarting phone",
    "content": "When using the pixel earbuds, the default notification sounds (found with CNN & NBC news apps) called \"flutterby\" start and can't be stopped by discarding the notification, turning the notification within the app on or off, unplugging the earbuds, or hitting the do not disturb button.  The flutterby sound continues in perpetuity. The only way I have found to stop those notifications is to do a reboot of the phone by restarting the phone.  This flutterby sound seems to conflict with the earbuds in some software fashion, for when the notification of flutterby is triggered without the earbuds, the sounds stop spontaneously after two rounds.  What's up???",
