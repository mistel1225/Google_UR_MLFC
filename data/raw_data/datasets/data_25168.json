    "content": "I recently moved from HTC 11 & Android 9 to Pixel 2 XL & Android 10. In Android 9 I found (still have the phone and still find) contacts by searching from details within Notes (the Notes section of a contact's details). Now (with Pixel 2 XL and Android 10) it's not possible anymore and that's a big issue for me... When I reach a contact and look for details, they are there, but won't just show up in results... I tried installing third party apps, the problem still the same. Must be something with Android 10.",
