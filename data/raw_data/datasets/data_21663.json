    "content": "After I did the update on my phone, my batter displays 2% all the time whether it's being charged or not. I've been on my phone a lot since I've been stuck at home so the battery lasts me a long time but I can't tell when my phone is about to die so I can charge it. I restarted my phone, emptied up storage, and rebooted into safe mode to see if it would display normally in case there was something affecting it. Still the same.",
