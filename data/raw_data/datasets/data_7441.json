    "content": "What is everyone using since Google Play Music is dead? Youtube Music is alright but a bit buggy. I'm currently on a trial for Amazon Music Unlimited which works great... but I don't care about the cost. IMO I feel like Google Play Music being killed off was a HUGE mistake as it was a great platform for getting and playing your music. Thanks in advance!",
