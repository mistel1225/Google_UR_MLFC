    "content": "Only some apps are refusing to load when I click them. For example: My Tamagotchi Forever, Cumo, and just the regular Google search engine. \n\nWhat is interesting is, I uninstalled then reinstalled the Tamagotchi app, to which, it suddenly started working again. However, then it stopped working soon after. \n\nAnother thing is when I open Google, it doesn't crash until I try to type into the search bar. (This doesn't happen with the Google Chrome application; it only happens when I swipe up to Google something.)\n\nI have restarted my phone, both by pressing \"Restart\" and by powering it off, then turning it back on again. I cleared up a bunch of space as well, including deleting apps, photos, files, etc. I don't want to Factory Reset my phone, but if that is the only solution, I will try it.",
