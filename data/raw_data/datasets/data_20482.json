    "content": "Hi \nMy Pixel3XL is having screen issue, very blurry screen but able to see and click on it and contacted google support, I am receiving a replacement phone in a couple days.  The current phone is working but able to read words clearly and has a deep blue shade of color on it.  How do I copy all my contents from my current google phone 3XL to the replacement pixel 3XL?  \nIt seems I am unable to find any related info, mostly I missed it in my google search.  I really dont want to loss any data etc...\nAny help will be greatly appreciated.\nTed",
