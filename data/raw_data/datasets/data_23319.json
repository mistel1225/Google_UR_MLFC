    "content": "The bottom speaker on my mom's pixel 3a stopped working. She can't hear calls on speaker and the phone no longer rings. She's updated her software, made sure the phone is set to ring, set in call volume to the loudest setting. She's also restarted a couple of times and made sure airport and do not disturb modes were both turned off.",
