    "title": "Pixel 3a. Cannot see actual photo on W10 w/ PTP, only generic thumbnail.",
    "content": "I cannot see 99% of my actual phone photos on W10 using either PTP or Android File Transfer via USB, they appear only as generic thumbnails. If I click on the thumbnail, the photo viewer WILL open it, so I tried switching the default viewer just in case that was the problem, but no luck. I tried a different cable, and a different USB port.\n\nI believe this was working before my recent update to Android 11, although I see this same issue raised about earlier versions.",
