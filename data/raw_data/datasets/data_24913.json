    "content": "I've just got a new Pixel 3, and the maximum volume for ringtones, notifications and alarms is very low even at maximum volume. I would say it is about as loud as my previous phone set at below half, same goes for my wife's iPhone. Is this known/by design? I can't hear it ring in my pocket in an office or shop environment.",
