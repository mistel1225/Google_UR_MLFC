    "title": "experience with liquid screen protectors for 3a?",
    "content": "I purchased a Pela brand liquid screen protector for my new pixel 3aXL after having my previous pixel 3aXL for a year. My previous pixel 3aXL was dropped within the first month and had a crack that didn't hinder its function, but a few weeks ago there was a fatal drop and crack that was the demise of the phone. I'm noticing that the liquid screen protector box label warns against using on phones without Water Resistant screens, and the research I've done tells me that the dragontrail glass on the 3a pixel lines is not 'officially' water resistant. Articles I read suggest that although its not water resistant officially, using a damp washcloth to clean it or exposure to light rain should be fine. The process of installing the liquid screen protector is using a damp cloth to wipe on the substance and then let it dry for 2 minutes. I'd really hate to damage my new phone, but it seems like this should be fine...any opinions?",
