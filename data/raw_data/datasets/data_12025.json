    "content": "I have a quite common issue where my pixel phone loses sync connection with the Google contacts and I need to do some kind of restore of the contacts on my google account frequently. It's a Google pixel phone and it's a Google contact account do you have an answer to this issue or not?\nThe same issue occured on my previous Samsung S10.\nI have tried in installing, clearing cache and related advices. \nPlease do not refere me to a previous thread with those standard suggestions.\n\nGoogle team must be aware of why this happens.\n\n\nIn short\n\n1/ all names on my recent calls and all my contacts suddenly disappears\n\n2 / I go to my google account and find that I have no contavys at all any more\n\n3/ I do a restore from contacts to yesterday's status, and now all my contacts show - and my pixel starts to sync again\n\n\nTo me, this seem to be an account issue at the Google cloud environment , rather than s device / OS problem\n But I am not sure.\n\nI the year 2020 google, in control over hardware,OS and cloud must be able to resolve a simple contact sync issue like this?",
