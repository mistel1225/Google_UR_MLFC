    "content": "Usually on the weekdays, I have the MS Teams app's Chat notifications on Silent. I want this to switch automatically to Default on the weekends.\n\nI didnt want to use DND because I still want to hear my phone ringing. I only wanted to silence the chat notifications while I'm on Teams on my computer. The app notifies me on both desktop and mobile which is annoying but I really need to get the notifications on the weekend as I need to monitor the chat.",
