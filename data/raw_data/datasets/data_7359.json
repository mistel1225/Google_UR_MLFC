    "content": "Hello everybody! Just bought a Pixel 4a. There is a problem with the color rendition of the screen - the white goes into yellow tones. This is especially noticeable in direct comparison with other devices, but even with separate use of the device, it can be seen that the white temperature is very different from \"adequate\".\nI have pictures of this phone compared to the Nexus 7 and Mi A2 Lite and them among themselves. It may not be entirely clear from the photos, but white on the Nexus 7 and Mi A2 Lite is perceived as white by eye (Mi A2 Lite is a little colder, but visually does not go into blue), and on the Pixel 4a, white is perceived as yellow.\n Is this a marriage or should it be?\n Are there ways to change the color temperature? I did not find such an item in the settings.",
