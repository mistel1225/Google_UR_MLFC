    "content": "I just lost my phone in the ocean. There is a note on the phone that is really important to me. Is it anyway I can get it back!l? Beacause I cant find it in google keep. It has to be a way to find it! Itâ€™s a document that describes all the coordinates each day when I sailed from Gran Canaria to Caribbean. Thank you in advance!!",
