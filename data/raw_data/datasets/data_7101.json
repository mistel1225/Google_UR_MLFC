    "content": "Pixel 3 battery was fine before the June 2020 security update. Since the update, my battery drains rapidly even when idle. I will have a full charge before bed and wake up to a dead phone. I have checked for apps running in the background and have turned them off but it doesn't fix the problem. \n\nCharging is also very slow, yet it says charging rapidly at the bottom. The phone now gets very hot while charging.",
