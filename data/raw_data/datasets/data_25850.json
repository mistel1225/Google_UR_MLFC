    "content": "https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/4457705 says:\n\n“If you bought your device from the Google Store, updates will typically reach your device within 2 weeks. If you bought your device elsewhere, updates can take longer.”\n\nIs this just about devices aquired from certain carriers? Or is there actually a difference in how updates are deployed to Pixel devices aquired from suppliers such as, say, Amazon, and devices aquired from the Google Store?",
