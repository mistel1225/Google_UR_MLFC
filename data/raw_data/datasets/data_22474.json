    "title": "After Android 10 update, pop up notifications not working",
    "content": "Since updating to Android 10 on my Pixel 3 XL, pop up notifications work intermitently.\nThe biggest issue is when I receive a phone call while using the phone, pop up notification does not show up, forcing me to pull down the notification shade to see who is calling and to be able to answer, reject or screen the call.  This is very aggravating.\n\nI've already performed a factory reset, but the issue still persists.\n\nAnyone else experience issues with pop up notifications after Android 10 update?",
