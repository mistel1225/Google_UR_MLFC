    "title": "IPhones don't get my group texts",
    "content": "There are at least five iPhones that don't receive my group messages, we found out because someone would like or respond to my message and the iPhone user would have to comment that they hadn't seen it. Those same iPhone users, if I send them an individual message with a picture attached they don't get it. I have been able to send them straight text messages. They are willing to make adjustments on their end if I can figure out what they need to do, but so far I haven't found an answer to this question, the only answered question I found that similar is backwards of this situation: people with a pixel who aren't receiving messages from iphones. Any help would be appreciated, it's so frustrating!",
