    "content": "I have two issues happening to my Pixel 3XL:\n\n1. The speaker makes a rattling noise randomly, and will make the whole screen flutter. It mostly happens when the camera is on, but happens randomly everytime. This has made videos have a crackle/grain to them and I have to restart my phone for it to go away. \n\n2. When charging, the charging icon comes on and then goes off randomly. I've tried different cables and outlets, but at times, cannot get it to stay charging. This also happens randomly, not every time when trying to charge.\n\nAny help would be appreciated!",
