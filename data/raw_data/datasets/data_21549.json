    "content": "In my Pixel 4 XL, I am seeing a sliding effect/ shaking on black and other dark colors during scrolling (in both horizontal and vertical directions). Not sure, if it is caused by 90Hz display or all OLED Screens will have a similar effect.\n\nThis is happening in every app and even in system apps and notification drawer. It's mostly happening wherever black color is displaying.",
