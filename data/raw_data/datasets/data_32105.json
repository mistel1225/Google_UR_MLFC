    "content": "Hi,\nYesterday my phone was sitting on the table for most of day. When I got to start using it, I saw a black spot at bottom of the screen, just in the middle.\n\nI thought this might be software issue as thereare known software issues related to black areas. So I restarted the phone. During the restart, I saw what looked like mini sparks from the spot and then more and more area around the spot started blacking out in a pattern of irregular circle.\n\nIs this a known issue of pixel 3?\nShould I be covered by the warranty?",
