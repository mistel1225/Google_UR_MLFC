    "content": "after I updated with my pixel mobile phone system on 2nd Feb. 2019, my pixel mobile phone requires a pattern to unlock after device restarts. however, the device keeps saying I put the wrong pattern after I have tried many time the right pattern which I never can be wrong about it as the pattern is only made by two lines. \nanyone know any solution about it without lose my phone data as several important files are still not back up.\nmaybe any unlock patterns, likes original google company may set up that I could try",
