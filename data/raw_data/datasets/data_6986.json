    "title": "Phone won't turn off and volume up button is stuck.",
    "content": "Randomly the power button stopped working for the use of turning off the screen or holding to restart. The button itself works because the double tap power brings up the designated app. Also the volume randomly starts increasing with no correlation to the volume buttons. Once I was able to hard restart, I get prompted with the android \"no command\" screen. I was able to get the commands to pull up once before it restarted back to the home screen but all the issues still persist.",
