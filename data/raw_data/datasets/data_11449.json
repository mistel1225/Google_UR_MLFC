    "title": "Pixel 2 XL started to turn off when charging and will not fast charge anymore",
    "content": "This just started happening about 1 month ago. Now, when I plug in the USB C plug to any rapid chargers, it doesn't charge at all. I test with 3 different OEM Google chargers and cables. When I slow charge via USB C port, it works but then the phone turns off. So each time I charge, I have to turn it back on. I've also factory reset the phone and cleaned the USB port with air duster and using 91% alcohol solution with toothpick. Nothing has worked so far.\n\nThe phone has been very reliable and worked fine for 3 years now, but since a month, this just started happening. I suspect it ties back to the OTA update on the phone.\n\nI've found many posts on here about this issue. I'm convinced this is an update from Google that caused this issue, not hardware.",
