    "content": "following the security update on Monday 8/5/19 I have been unable to make a call or send text messages to anyone.  I'm on Visible wireless and they have been unable to troubleshoot this issue.  I also contacted Google support and they too were unable to help. Google suggested that if the phone is under warrenty that I should return it but that would take up to 10 days.",
