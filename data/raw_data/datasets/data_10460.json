    "content": "My WiFi drops where my old phone Samsung Galaxy S7 with the same SIM was fine. Sometimes shows WiFi and says \"please connect to internet\" even though it shows as connected. Sometimes it lets me make calls then makes my voice tinny and robotic as it loses all signal. These are all places that my old phone had phenomenal signal. Can this be fixed? It's making me hate the phone",
