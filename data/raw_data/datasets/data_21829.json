    "content": "I got a good challenge for anyone who is up to it.\nMy phone was submerged in salt water for about 2-3 mins. Screen was cracked pretty bad. Automatically turned off. I put it with some rice for about 24 hours after that, decided that would be effective, so i took it apart. I cleaned off all of the contacts and surfaces with Isopropyl alcohol 91% let it dry for 30 more min. plugged it in and it was charging.(did jump from 50 to 59 then normalized) I turned it on and the screen worked fine, but when I unlocked it, it froze then turned off. Now it shows nothing from charging to any lights. plugged it into my computer and no connection. I'm looking to see what is wrong with it. I'm thinking about trying to replace the battery to see if that fixes it.",
