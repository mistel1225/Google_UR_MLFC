    "content": "My screen turned black and does not change. I tried to reach to google support many times, but I am being ignored every time. The phone was in use only a few months. Can anyone help me solve the issue? I still have the warranty, but with Google unwillingness to help, it will be off warranty soon. There are no official dealers here, not even any representative. There is no Live Chat on the page, no email.",
