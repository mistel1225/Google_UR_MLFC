    "content": "Hello all,\n\nBought a used pixel 3 XL phone that was unresponsive and on a boot loop and I was able to fix it.  Since the previous owner was not able to do anything with the phone, his account is still linked with the phone and now I am unable to setup the phone without his credentials.  What options do I have so that I am able to add my account to the device so that I can use it.  Still unable to get in touch with the owner to make him to remove it from his account.  Since I have the receipt for the sale is there a way to use that proof of sale and have the device transferred?\n\nRegards",
