    "content": "Hello,\n\nI have a king of an unusual question (perhaps). The display on my pixel does not show anything anymore. But the phone is still working and even touch screen too. The problem is that I have very important apps there. I really need to get access to them. That is why I want to connect my phone to PC and broadcast its screen to it. But I have USB debugging function off. My question is there any way to turn USB debugging on without touching the screen (using the phone buttons probably or my PC). Or maybe you can say where can I find interface screenshots for each step so I can try to turn it on blindly (for some reasons there are not a lot of them on the internet). Thank you for your help.",
