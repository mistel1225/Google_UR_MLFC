    "content": "I changed from my old Vodafone SIM to the eSIM option and the phone is no longer connecting to 5G networks in the same places that the old SIM worked fine. Vodafone say there are no changes to the provisioning.\n\nThere is now no physical SIM in the phone, so it’s not the “can’t connect to 5G with two SIMs active” restriction.",
