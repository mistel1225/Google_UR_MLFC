    "content": "Hello everyone, I've noticed that after setting up a new style personalisation (I just changed the color of the quick toggles from blue to black, cause I don't like the blue tone chosen by google when dark theme is active) the Gboard stops following the device's theme color. It either remains light or dark, regardless of theme (light or dark) active on the device. I don't have any personalisation on the Gboard, so that can't be problem.However, if I disable the style personalisation I've created and go back to one of Google's defaults, the problem disappears and the keyboard goes back to functioning properly. Is there someone who noticed the same thing? Could this be a big? I really have no idea!\n\nThank you!",
