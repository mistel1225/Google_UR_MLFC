    "title": "How do I stop the multiple spontaneous reboots after upgrading to Android 10?",
    "content": "I installed the Android 10 update late yesterday evening and all appeared to go well.  However, today the phone keeps spontaneously restarting and the battery is losing charge quickly (possibly due to all of the restarts?).  The phone has restarted in the middle of a telephone call, in the middle of composing a text, but most of the time, it has happened while just sitting on my desk or in my pocket.  In the last 3 hours, it has literally restarted 10 times. \n\nNote: Other than the telephone call and text message restarts, no other apps are running.  Also, I updated all apps last night and checked for more this morning.\n\nOther than doing a factory reset, how can this be fixed? Or is it a bad update?",
