    "content": "Took Pixel 3a to UBreakifix. Was having connection issues. They replaced the battery. But the battery was running down much quicker than before I brought it in. Took it back to Ubreak. They said the charge was maintaining fine, but they had me dump a couple of programs, tyrn iff background, do the save the battery thing. Now, another week later...we are back to the same thing...phone won’t charge. Further, the Ubreak people made me pay out of pocket for the new battery, saying my account said I was not under warranty...but found the iriginal bix from my June 2020 purchase. It IS still under warranty! Tried to call # for Google support. They’re not taking calls. Looked up how to file a claim, and it just keeps trying to get me to fix the phone and read articles...rather than give me steps to file a warranty claim...when I click button on “How to file a claim,” it  just loops back around to the same page! \nSOOOOO FRUSTRATED!!!!",
