    "title": "Google Australia replaced my \"just black\" Pixel 3 Xl with a \"not pink\" Pixel 3XL, how proceed?",
    "content": "My Pixel 3Xl in \"just black\" had problems with overheating. I requested a RMA and send the phone to the address which Google provided to me. After 1 week I received a replacement device in the color \"not pink\". After several E-mails Google is not willing to replace the device with the original color because they argumented that the replacement stock is out of \"just black\" devices. Any Idea how to proceed? I'am very disapointed from the Warranty handling of a premium phone!",
