    "title": "Pixel USB-C earbuds not working properly",
    "content": "All of a sudden my earbuds stopped working while I was listening to music. When they were plugged in the phones speakers stoped playing just as they should so the phone seemed to recognize that the earbuds where connected. While trying to figure out what was wrong i noticed that i would hear audio in the earbuds if i held the middle button(the black one) on the remote pressed but as soon as i let go the audio goes away and the volume up and down doesn't work either. It might be worth noting that this happens no matter what app i use for audio and when the audio goes silent the phone keeps playing what ever i was listening to but i can't hear anything so it's not pausing the music or anything like that. It's like the mute functionality has been reversed somehow but i can't figure out why. Any suggestions on how to solve this?",
