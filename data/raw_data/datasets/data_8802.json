    "content": "Hey guys,\n\nI have a Pixel 4A which I bought about 2 months ago. It suddenly shut down and started showing the following message: \"Your device is corrupt. It can't be trusted and may not work properly. Press power button to continue\". And when you do that, it only shows you the Google logo and nothing else happens. I have tried rebooting so many times, but it only shows me the same message over and over, and nothing I can do (and no idea why this happened).\n\nI am currently travelling in Colombia from Canada and I am stuck without being able to access my smartphone, so this is quite urgent.\n\nCan someone please help?!\n\nThank you,\nGiacomo",
