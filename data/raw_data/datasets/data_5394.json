    "content": "I have a Pixel 5 and cannot make 'tap to check' work. Initially it did not work, then for a very brief period it did, and a day later nothing! I've read elsewhere about batter saver having an impact, but I do NOT have battery saver enabled. I was using 'dark theme' so tried turning that off but still nothing. There has been no change in Apps since the time it did briefly work. Any suggestions?!?!",
