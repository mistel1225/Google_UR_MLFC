    "content": "So recently whenever I take a screenshot it will say image saved at the bottom (like normal) then I will get a message saying storage full. My phone storage is only at 56%. My photos are only taking up 18gb. Whenever I take a picture it doesn't save to my phone, it'll show up in the bottom right corner like normal but isn't saved to my gallery. Then on external apps that access my gallery (fb, insta, snap, etc.) It shows up that there are no images in my gallery at all. I have already tried restarting my phone, clearing my cache, and clearing storage for my gallery app. What should I do?",
