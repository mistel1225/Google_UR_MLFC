    "content": "For several months now, my phone has been rebooting randomly despite showing a charged battery. In an effort to resolve this I decided to do a factory reset. I backed up everything and went into settings and found factory reset and did it. Then the phone came up to a dead android and \"Error\". How do I get my phone working again?\n\nEdit: it actually got stuck on \"Erasing\" first. After some time I held down the power button until it rebooted and it came up to the dead android.",
