    "content": "I have 2 voicemails showing from my Drs office. I cannot access them. I click on them and it says loading Voicemail (when I push the play button to listen to it). After a brief delay the screen then shows cannot load Voicemail. If I call the *86 number, I can hear the VM, and I can check from an outside phone, just not from my own phone. I have contacted support with verizon and i have not gotten anywhere with that.",
