    "title": "Second hand locked Pixel XL reboot issue",
    "content": "I bought the phone last year without any other accessories. It has no box either. After the last December update, I had a couple of occasions when the phone just froze and restarted but still was working. However, a month ago it did that again but didn't go beyond the Google logo animation. I tried factory reset, no use. Tried sideloading the same December OTA, the reboot loop was still there. Debugging is not enabled meaning I can't unlock the bootloader. Any chance Google can help me in any way even though it's a second hand with no papers like warranty or anything? Plus, I'm in HK where Google doesn't sell Pixel phones.",
