    "content": "I want to understand the ramifications of continuing to use a Pixel 1 phone after security updates are no longer being supplied by Google.  If the phone is no longer secure, does that mean that it can no longer be used at all?  Or, does it mean that it can still be used, as long as you refrain from entering any data into it that an attacker could take advantage of?",
