    "content": "I can't seem to share other's IG stories/feeds on my IG story. I have tried clearing my IG cache, made sure my IG settings allow for sharing of stories and also made sure the feeds that I wanted to share were posted by public users. Also deleted and reinstalled the app. The option is just missing. Anyone has this issue?",
