    "content": "My wifes pixel 2 suddenly shows a dead screen (screen pixels colored differently like on an old TV if you know hat i mean). https://photos.app.goo.gl/TcAZixyPk1yJn1ZY7\nThe phone wasn't dropped. The Screen is not broken!\nBut she said it got very slow before that happend.\n\nI can connect it to the laptop, Pixel 2 shows up at in Explorer, but of course i can't choose Data Transfer on the screen, so i can't backup all her important files/photos. (she didn't have \"Back up & Save\" activated)\n\nRight now i'm completely out of ideas. \nAny Ideas what may help here? :/",
