    "content": "Has anyone else had issues trying to organise a replacement through a third party retailer?\n\nI purchased my pixel 3 just over 3 months ago and the speaker phone isn't working (people cant hear me when i talk on speakerphone but off speakerphone is fine). I tried all the trouble shooting methods and did a factory reset but still an issue. I took it to my local store to organise a replacement however they would only send it for repair despite the site saying i was eligible for a replacement.\n\nUnfortunately now they've said its going to be a 4 week wait, kind of frustrating to not have my new phone for potentially a month?",
