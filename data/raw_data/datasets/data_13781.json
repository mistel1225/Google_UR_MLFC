    "content": "Garbage. I don't get texts for months. Or voicemails. I can't tell you how many doctor appointments I missed because of this phone. HEY GOOGLE!!! \nIf it's CANCER, probably could have been found earlier since your device is incapable of receiving phone calls. Everyone gets forwarded to a full voicemail box even though I keep it empty. My friends literally don't talk to me anymore because I \"don't respond\". Your phone is a joke and I am tired of it. I have a serious lump in my neck and you can't even fix your bugs so I miss the \"over-the-phone\" doctor appointments. Fuck 2020, Fuck Google Pixel.",
