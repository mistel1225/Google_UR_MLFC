    "title": "How do I contact someone in the Google repair depot directly?",
    "content": " The camera on my pixel Pixel 3 died and I sent the phone into Google after requesting official Google packing materials, which are guaranteed against damage in transit. When the phone arrived at the repair depot in Texas, the estimate was $85 more than I expected due to damage to the screen and frame. The screen and frame were fine when I sent the phone in, so, possibly, the phone sustained damage in transit. Now I’m getting the runaround from support, they are claiming that the phone was not shipped in Google’s packaging.  I could ask for the phone back without having any repairs done, but I don’t want to get a smashed phone back. I can’t get any answers about what the problems with the screen and frame are, and I haven’t yet had any success getting this escalated. Who can I contact to see exactly what’s going on here? This is infuriating.",
