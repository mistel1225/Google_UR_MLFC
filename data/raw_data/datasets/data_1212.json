    "content": "My Pixel 3a hit the ground hard and the screen began turning purple.  It is now completely black.  It works just fine (I can tell by the sounds and the few things I managed to do before it was completely black), but I can't see anything on the screen.\n\nHow can I transfer the data to my new Pixel4?  Everything I've tried requires me to grant permission on the Pixel 3a, and I can't do that blind.",
