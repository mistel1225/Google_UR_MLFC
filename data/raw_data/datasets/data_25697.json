    "content": "My Bluetooth headphones still have a 30% battery left, but now every 60 seconds my phone's lady voice tells me \"battery low\". This notification even cuts into media I am listening to/watching. Once every minute, that's not an exaggeration, I put a stop watch on it. Obviously this is wildly annoying. I cannot find anything on how to disable this constant warning.  Help?",
