    "content": "Since the March 2020 security update, my Pixel 3a is really slow to unlock.\nWhen I restart the device, the problem  disappears, but comes back progressively.\n\nI saw a similar post, apparently the guy tackled the problem by updating the Carriere Services, but I'm up date and my problem is still here.\n\nIf you have had the same problem or/and know the solution, please share it.",
