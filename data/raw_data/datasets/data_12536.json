    "content": "I can't smoothly scroll through my apps like before, smoothly drag my activity shade down, fluidly punch in numbers on my lock screen, etc. I deleted my cache, and have 60% free storage, I entered Safe Mode to find a faulty app (there wasn't one), I restarted my phone several times, and  I waited and installed this month's security update.  I still have lag.",
