    "content": "What I want: Notifications (primarily email, whatsapp and SMS) to pop up onto my lock screen and then STAY THERE. Right now I get the notification, it shows for 5 seconds, then disappears. I can press the power button to bring it up, but this isn't useful for my purposes. The dots are there indicating some notification has happened, but I want my notification to stay on the screen and not go away. The dots aren't very useful to me. I have tried turning on all notifications, etc. I'm not sure if this is something I can accomplish, but it is 100% the biggest reason I regret having switched from iOS. \n\nThank you in advance for your help!",
