    "content": "There used to be a way to block calls that were not in your contacts. Did this got taken away? I just upgraded from the Pixel 2 to the Pixel 3 and now this page (https://imgur.com/a/Aa3EDrC) no longer exists.\n\nNo need to respond to this saying use a Do Not Disturb rule. I'm aware of that but it's a poor replacement since it means the DND has to be always on and can no longer be used for other purposes.",
