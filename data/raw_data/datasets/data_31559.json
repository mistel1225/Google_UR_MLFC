    "content": "Hi,\n\nVery odd problem. Scratched the cover of my SIM card tray so ordered one from Amazon. It arrived and looked identical but wasn't flush with the body of the phone.\n\nI assumed they had sent me the wrong one.\n\nOrdered an official Google one from eBay and the same problem again. It is slightly longer so isn't flush with the phone.\n\nAnyone have this problem? I have read in some reviews about this.\n\nOriginal SIM in the photo attached is on the right.\n\nThanka",
