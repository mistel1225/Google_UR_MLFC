    "title": "My Pixel XL battery recently became absolute trash and shuts down at random battery percentages",
    "content": "I've tried factory resets and removing apps, and the change is still drastic compared to what it used to be. The phone tends to shut down during intense processes like filming or taking photos, then when I boot it back up the battery has gone from 60-70% to 1-5%. I've only had this phone just over two years and never experienced such a  terrible drop in performance and lifespan, making me question whether I can trust this brands future products. Not angry just really disappointed :(",
