    "content": "The phone is not properly launching Android auto to display on my car's system. The app itself works fine, but the pixel is not connecting via USB c. (It's not the cable. I've bought 3 new ones. It's also not the car, as I've had it checked by the dealer. My friends iPhone works fine.) This wasn't a problem until the recent update, and as I drive a lot, fixing this is of high importance for me.",
