    "content": "Connection to my phone network is bad.  This is not including internet services, which on the whole are good.\n\nHow can I improve this?\n\nPlease note the following:\n\n - I've had a couple of previous phones with the same sim card/carrier before which worked flawlessly\n - I live in the second biggest city in france, right in the center, signal should be very strong\n - restarting the phone temporarily solves the problem, but it may stop working an hour or so later\n - I've experienced this problem for months\n - the signal bar is about half, but I can't make calls, it just times out\n - I don't receive calls\n - I receive SMS from my carrier telling me that I've missed a call, but the phone app doesn't register this (no missed call)\n\nIf you would be so kind in your responses as to not say \"contact your operator\" that would be great.  This is clearly a device issue because:\n\n - it's solved by system reset\n - there is not signal issue for devices of the same network in the same area\n - I have not had this problem with previous devices on the same network in the same location\n\nThankyou for your time",
