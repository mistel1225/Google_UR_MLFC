    "title": "Pixel 3XL Camera Taking Blurry Photos",
    "content": "I have the Pixel 3XL mobile phone, and everything was fine with it until a few months earlier. All of a sudden, my rear camera started to take blurry photos (for the distance above of 5-8cm).\nI have contacted to Made By Google team, and was requested to clear the cache, update the camera app, install a new app and even a factory reset. I have followed all the steps, and the issue remained. \nI have requested from team to direct me to a repair shop, but they told me that I can't get a coverage as I am currently a resident in UAE. This is a super annoying situation, as I have paid more than 800 EUR for a phone and can't take photos, and even can't get it fixed. Below was the latest message I got from the support team, and then they have stopped responding my messages. I just don't know what to do with a super expensive and malfunctioning device in hand. Super annoyed and sad. And a very bad customer experience for Google.\n\n\nThanks for the info. It looks like you're currently in a location where we have limited support options. Please note that we offer warranty support only in countries where we sell devices. You can get in touch with our team directly when you're back in a country where we sell Pixel phones or ask a friend (in a country where we sell devices) to do so on your behalf by clicking on “Contact Us” on the top right corner of this link: https://goo.gle/2Eqys1z Appreciate your understanding.",
