    "content": "I just recently went on vacation from Ohio to Florida. While on vacation in Florida my pixel 3a fell into the pool and stopped working completely. Went to the Verizon store in Florida and got a new pixel 5. I currently can not receive text messages from people with Iphones. I can send texts to people that have an iphone but when they go to text me it shows up for them that I am on imessages. I have never owned an iphone or been on imessages. My boss has an iphone and I have been able to receive text messages from him but no one else that has an Iphone. I have reset my phones network settings and tried using different messaging apps. Does anyone have a solution?",
