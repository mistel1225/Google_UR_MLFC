    "content": "Hey!\n\nAfter I unpacked the (brand new) phone, I set it up and immediately found an issue with the rear camera. It makes some clicking noise when trying to focus. When it occurs the whole picture shakes or jumps around. It's very annoying. It feels like something is loose inside of the phone as well.\n\nI confirmed same is happening in safe mode. A video showing the defect can be found here: https://photos.app.goo.gl/EPynX3g3dHBoBmT86.\n\nI guess I'll need to send it for repair, anyone in same boat?",
