    "content": "I would like to report a defect in the camera app.\n\nBackground and description\nWhen I point the camera towards a hall way with a vanilla background and lit by tube lights, the camera app starts to show moving ribbons in the screen. Like in the television if old times. \n\nWhen I click on the camera, the image contains the ribbons. \n\nMitigation steps and result \n1. Restart the app. No impact \n2. Restart the phone. No impact \n3. Move the target to a non vanilla background. The  camera behaves correctly. When pointed back at the vanilla background it resumes the ribbons \n\nThere are pictures and videos showing the defect here. \n\nhttps://photos.app.goo.gl/6UJteRfbYwftyVGv5\n\nHoping they are helpful and thankful for any suggestions and updates. \n\nKind regards\nSesh ",
