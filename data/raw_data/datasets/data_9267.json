    "content": "I got a brand new Pixel 4a today and I have been liking it so far. I was taking screen shots by holding down the lock button and clicking on the screen shot button. I restarted my phone because of a glitch and now the option to screenshot is missing. I cannot find any information on the settings on how to bring it back. \nI would screen shot the problem but I cannot screen shot anymore.",
