    "content": "Hello guys!\n\nSad day today. Out of no where my power button stopped working. However I click it doesnt do anything. Doesn't react at all but when I managed to power it off then I can turn it on but as soon as its \"on\" then I can't do anything at all. Feels like the power button doesnt have a \"assigend key\" so it doesn't do anything. I do hear and feel the click when clicking on the power button but it doesnt react at all. What should I do?\n\nNew update: After 5 hours, I managed to click the power button 10 times in a row and then it died again. I have restarted my phone through adb tools and the problem still remains.",
