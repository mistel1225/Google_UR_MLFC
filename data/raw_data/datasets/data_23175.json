    "content": "I traveled from the US mainland to Puerto Rico (still in the US), however while the region remains the United States, there's no time zone for Puerto Rico, so the timezone doesn't update and the clock remained in local time. There is a separate region for Puerto Rico that I had to manually move it to to get the right local time to my phone",
