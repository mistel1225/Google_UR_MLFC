    "content": "Has anyone dealt with issues with a faulty touchscreen?  Whenever I go outside (it was just below 40 degrees), my touchscreen was not responding in the cold weather and after I go back inside, I have to do a soft reset to get it working again.\n\nHowever, three weeks ago, it completely froze.  WHen I contacted Google support, they told me to take it into a store to get it fixed for free because it was under warranty.  They told me that it was a screen issue and I had to pay $190 to get a new screen and get it replaced. However, the issue has persisted - sometimes, I’ll get my touchscreen back after a soft reset or a factory reset (which is very annoying). I simply can’t have a phone touchscreen that won’t work for me half of the year (I’m in Chicago) if I’m outside!!\n\nIs anyone else dealing with these issues with their touchscreen?",
