    "content": "Hi,\nI have a Samsung Active 2 watch and have just purchased the Google Pixel Buds 2. I had the Samsung Galaxy Buds 2 which I used in conjunction with my watch but wanted the Google headphones to link up with my Pixel 4 seamlessly.\nWhen I returned the Samsung headphones I used a old pair of Apple Airpods and the watch didn't pick up the taping to skip songs, does anyone know if the Google Pixel Buds 2 work and pick up the controls?\nThanks\nRobert",
