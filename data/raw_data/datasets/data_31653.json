    "content": "Hey I'm travelling in Inidia, borrowed a SIM from a friend and phones working ok. But google assistant is throwing me some curves. It doesn't properly recognize my voice commands. Verified my language is set as english. It's almost like it is trying to analyze my speech for the country I'm in. Tried going thru Training Assistant. That finished ok. For example i asked, \" what is the weather in Danbury Connecticut\", and Assistant voice recognition was, \"what's the weather in America America\"",
