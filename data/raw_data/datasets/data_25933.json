    "title": "Display on Pixel 3XL turns off while touch, fingerprint sensor, and power and volume buttons work",
    "content": "For about 6 months (intermittently) the display will randomly shut off wile the rest of the buttons, the speakers, and fingerprint sensors keep working - I've been able to touch the screen from memory to pause music and make a call. It usually takes a few force restarts for it to work again(the display will turn off while powering up most of the time on the first couple of tries). I've tried factory reseting the phone and it didn't help.",
