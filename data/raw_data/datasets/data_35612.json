    "content": "Shattered back glass of my Google pixel but it hasn't broken the camera, where and how can I replace? Very disappointed as I've had it less than a month and do not think it was very durable in comparison to the pixel 2 (it was broken by my 8 month old hitting it, and he isn't very forceful obviously) and is now unusable as it's already cut my hand.",
