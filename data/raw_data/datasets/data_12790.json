    "content": "For months \"Blutooth has stoppped\" would pop up on my screen and it would keep popping up and stacking on the ones that had already popped up if I didn't close them right away (every 5-10 seconds a new one would pop up) I've tried resetting my phone and wifi, blutooth, and data, many times with nothing changing except now \"blutooth has stopped\" will just disappear right away and I occasionally get \"system UI has stopped\". I would just like to listen to music on my earbuds that connect via blutooth, but I can't get blutooth to stay on for more than 5 minutes, if it works at all.",
