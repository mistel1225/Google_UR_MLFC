    "content": "My Pixel 3 sometimes starts vibrating like it's in a shock. And if I am inside the camera app due to the vibration the view is so blur. This vibration never stops until I lock or restart my phone. Also when I am not using any app it does the same thing. I couldn't find any solution. It behaves like a time bomb which is about to explode due to these vibrations. Is there any solution to it? Or should I just throw my pixel?",
