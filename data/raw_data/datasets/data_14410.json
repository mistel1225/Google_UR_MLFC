    "content": "My pixel 4xl will not wirelessly charge.  This seems to be an extremely common issue and it's actually the second pixel 4xl I have owned with wireless charging issues. Yesterday support was basically refusing to replace the device and now I can't even contact support because it says \"something went wrong please try again\".  Even if they were to replace it I have no confidence at all that a new device will be any better. what are my options at this point?\n\nMy device is covered under warranty but they won't replace it and I still owe money on the device.  I feel I definitely should not have to continue to pay monthly for a defective device that google refuses to replace.\n\nThank you",
