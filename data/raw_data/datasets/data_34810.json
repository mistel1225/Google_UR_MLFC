    "title": "Two official pixel chargers stopped working on the same day, coincidence? unlikely.",
    "content": "I had a really strange problem yesterday evening. I went to charge my Pixel 2XL and it wouldn't charge. Luckily I have a back up official charger I take to work (I had previously owned 2 pixel 2s), but this also did not work. I then tried other plug sockets, and still no luck. I cleaned the USB charging port, put the phone on safety mode, restarted the phone, none of which made a difference.\nI was about to give up, when last resort I used an old cheap USB to USB C cable to charge the phone, and it worked perfectly. I've used this cable before and it normally slow charges, but now it fast charges, which is odd.\n\nWhat's going on? I can't believe that both of my USB C chargers broke at the same time, something must be wrong with the phone, right?\n\nI am fully up to date, on android 9.",
