    "content": "Yesterday I upgraded my Pixel 3a XL to Android 11 and the screen recording feature is missing from the pull down screen. I swiped down twice and clicked the edit icon, but no screen recording icon is available. Rebooting had no effect, nor did safe mode.\n\nShortly after taking version 11, I changed some of the app permissions for the phone... could that prevent the screen recording icon from appearing?",
