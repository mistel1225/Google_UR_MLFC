Looks like I am not the only one.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/em061y/pixel_4_xl_back_glass_coming_off/\n\nClosest option in the help center is frame damage, and there is no button \"Other Issue\", neither I found a way to contact the store in some sort of a chat to explain the matter. For the first 5-6 months of using the device I carrie dit around in a case so I don't know for how long it was happening. ",
