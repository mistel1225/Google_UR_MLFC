    "content": "My Pixel 3 suddenly started MUTING itself during calls about two weeks ago. No rhyme or reason. Sporadic. Makes phone almost useless. It's also dropping calls regularly for no discernible reason (ie, I live in NYC with FiOS super high speed and I'm sitting near router). The muting itself issue is crazy! I have seen this issue posted on an earlier forum, with thread & Replies disabled. But it's NOT been fixed !!",
