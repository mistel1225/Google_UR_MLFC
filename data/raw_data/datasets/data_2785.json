    "content": "Hi,\n\nI took a photo of my family during a family event. To my surprise, the pixel 4A (RCAM) turns the saree color that my wife was wearing from Green (original) to Blue!!!.\n\nDid anyone face a similar problem? \n\nI tried Google Support and they took for repair but the issue is still there. I am still contacting them in parallel for resolution.\n\nI writing here to see if anyone faced a similar problem.\n\nThank You\nVijayakumar Kuppa",
