    "content": "The screen seems not to respond to touches, you have to be very deliberate and sometimes fairly firm and slow in order for the touch to be picked up.\nThe phone was never dropped(significantly), no screen cracks, never submerged in water.\nI tried turning off, uninstalling apps, Safe mode, factory reset(twice) nothing helps\nit makes using the device unbearable especially to type any thing.",
