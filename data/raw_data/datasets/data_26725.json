    "title": "July 2019 security patch 'couldn't update - installation problem', then withdrawn for Pixel 2 ?",
    "content": "When the July 2019 OTA security patch was originally offered on my Pixel 2 here in the UK last week, I accepted it and it seemed to download (58MB) but it continually failed at the installation stage with the error \"couldn't update - installation problem\". This occurred repeatedly, even after booting into safe mode and after multiple factory resets.\n\nI left it a few days and tried again this morning, only to find that my 'system is up to date', with the 5 June 2019 patch. There is now no evidence of the July security patch previously downloaded and no error messages.\n\nIt's almost as if this latest security patch has been in some way cancelled or withdrawn for my device - is this possible ?",
