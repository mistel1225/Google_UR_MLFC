    "content": "When I add my card through my Chase Bank app, it says \"Couldn't add card to Google Pay\". I've talked to Chase and they say it's a problem with Google Pay. When I add my card manually, it says \"Double check card details. Something's not right\" but the information is 100% correct and the card is completely valid. Even when I scan the card itself, it still tells me to double check it. The card works with every other app, website or store. It just doesn't work with Google Pay.",
