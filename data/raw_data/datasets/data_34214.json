    "content": "After an issue with the usb c port the phone was sent away for a fix under warranty at which point everything was going smoothly. Since then I have been told the phone was shipped out on the first week of January and then another confirmation of this the week after yet nothing has been received. Google are insisting I have patience but after 2 months I'm pretty much at my wits end, after escalating to the contact centre manager all she said was to have patience again!\nIt seems the issue is now between the courier and Google however everyone I speak to tells me they are unable to get in touch and have no means of contact with the courier so this leaves me at a dead end. Very frustrated and looking for any information on how we can advance this.",
