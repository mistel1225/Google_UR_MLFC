    "content": "Hello together,\nIs there a way to individually choose which Page is your Homescreen? I need 5 \"Homescreen\" pages (with Widgets etc.) and want to have the \"Startscreen\" right in the middle. Any important apps, only 2 swipes away from the startscreen. With the current design the \"Startscreen\" is alwas on the far far left. So i need to swipe right, swipe right, swipe right, swipe right to get to last page..... Really annoying. Is there any solution?",
