    "content": "Hello!\nI just got the new Google Pixel 3a XL a week ago. But it appeared that photos from the front camera are blurry! Even the objects in the back are focused better. I wouldn't even complain about it if it wasn't the camera-phone Pixel. The phone got the latest updates on board, clear front lens, good environment and light.\nI have contacted the Google support, they are proposing free repair but the thing is - I live in Russia, so I'll have to send it to the US, what will take forever with our post-office and upcoming holidays (I'll do it in January then anyway).\nTo make sure, could anyone please send any examples of selfie from exact this model (Or if there any fix for it?)? I'm just afraid that the repair service would say everything's fine.\nAccidentally I found what caused the problem, but it isn't exact. When I cover 75% of the camera with something, the picture becomes clearer.\nHere's some examples:\n A selfie without portrait mode\n\n A selfie in portrait mode\n\nA selfie with covering the lens",
