    "content": "When I use a headphone with ausb-c adapter the microphone quality is really bad. While calling and recording speech messages in whatsapp the input of the microphone is quiet and band passed( less high and low frequencies) \n\nI used 2 adapters from a noname company and one from Samsung.\nI also used 2 different headphones\n\nDo I have to use the Google headphone jack?\n\nBest regards \nChristoph",
