    "content": "New Pixel 4a. Themes will not function - doesn't open. Also, I was unable to locate any sound files for notification, ringtones, etc. There is one sound for each action but I am unable to locate the files. I can't find a Themes app to download to try and replace the one that crashes and won't open. I did download the Google sounds file, but am unable to assign it to any function as Themes will not open. Any suggestions? Is this a defective phone that has to go back to Amazon? I'm not very computer/phone savvy so please if possible - simple explanation or directions to fix. Many thanks in advance.",
