    "title": "Telephone icon had changed to a red stop sign-like icon. Why?",
    "content": "Tried multiple places to find out why, then discovered why on my own by accident.\nIt must be a new feature related to detecting spam phone calls. A couple of calls on my recents list had the same icon. I deleted them but the main telephone icon was still the red stop sign. By pure luck I long pressed the stop sign icon and a message window came up asking me to identify a specific phone number as \"spam or not\". Once I answered the prompt, the red stop sign icon was replaced by the normal phone icon. If I hadn't discvoered this I'm sure I would have been annoyed for a long time!",
