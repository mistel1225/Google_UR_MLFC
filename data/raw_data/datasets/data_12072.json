    "title": "BT Audio Stuttering with Headphones (Pixel 5)",
    "content": "I have been using a Pixel 5 for the past 10 days and noticed significant Bluetooth connectivity problems with Sony headphones (WH-1000XM3 + WH-1000XM4). Pairing the phone with the headphones works just fine but when playing any type of music (be it via Spotify, Youtube, etc.) I encounter sound stuttering and connection interruptions. The headphones work flawlessly with any other devices I have tested them with (Macbook, iPhone, Win 10 Device). I also tested the headphones with Bose headphones and I could not replicate the issue I had with the Sony headphones. \n\nHas anybody encountered the same issues? I am close to returning the Pixel device. \n\nKind regards,\n\nJan",
