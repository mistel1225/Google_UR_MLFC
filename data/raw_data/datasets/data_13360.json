    "content": "Since the update my phone is practically unusuable. Almost every app crashes or some don't even open or function at all now. My keyboard won't appear at times, same goes for the volume bar. The wi fi drops out now, the device is also way slower and glitchy. If I restart my device it takes ages to turn back on now. I have paid apps that don't even function now. I've tried every thing support has told me like soft reset, start up in safe mode, factory reset, clearing cache the lot. Nothing works!!",
