    "content": "I have a Pixel 5 with 5G and the whole purpose of the purchase was to be able to use as a hotspot for when I'm working, however even though I have the '5.0GHz band preferred' option set on my Pixel, my devices only ever connect to the 2.4GHz band and the tx rate is making 5G completing redundant.... And yes all my devices are 5GHz devices and do connect to my 5GHz router at home. There seems to be barely any information on this using Google so just thought I'd ask here before contacting Pixel tech support.\n\nFYI I'm in UK and I'm mostly trying to connect with a MacBook however I do sometimes use a gaming PC and still only ever see a 2.4GHz connection.",
