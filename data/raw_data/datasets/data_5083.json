    "content": "Pinch to Zoom doesn't work at all. \nKeypad sensitivity is quite off, which means the touch screen is not tracking my movement well.\nWas using a screen protector, so I took that off to see if it's the problem, but the issues still persist. Only using my 4A for less than 6 months.",
