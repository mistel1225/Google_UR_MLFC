    "content": "My google pixel 4a will simply not recognize headphones jack or bluetooth speaker/headphones during video calls. All video calls are on speaker phone, which is absolutely infuriating. There is no way to video call in a public space, making it challenging to have privacy and to hear the call at all. How do I get my phone to play sound through headphones during video calls?",
