    "title": "No message body in Outlook and blank screen in some other apps",
    "content": "I have a Google Pixel 3A with all current updates applied. I am also running the Outlook application, and that’s where I first noticed issues. Email is now displayed without a body. There are a few gray bands below the addresses and subject line, but the screen is white. Sometimes, a Solitaire game displays a blank white screen once you select the game you want to play. If I do a Google search from the Google input at the bottom of the screen the search never seems to complete. The progress bar stops just short of the end at the top of the screen, and the “Discover”, “Snapshot” and other icons are displayed at the bottom. I uninstalled Outlook, deleted the account and reinstalled. Now, when I get to the point of creating the new account, I land on a white screen with only navigation icons at the top and bottom of the screen.\n\nThis all started only yesterday, and I find nothing online about anyone else having these issues. Any help would be greatly appreciated since I depend on outlook for pretty much everything.",
