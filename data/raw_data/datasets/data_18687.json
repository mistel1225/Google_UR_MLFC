    "content": "My google pixel turns off when the battery is 20-30 percent. A few times when I've put it on charge at night, I've discovered in the morning it's not charged at all and it takes a long time to just turn on. The battery life has decreased significantly and when I connect it to the charger, it doesn't charge rapidly like it did before.",
