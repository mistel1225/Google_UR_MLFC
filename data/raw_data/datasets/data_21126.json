    "content": "I use Pixel 2xl. For last couple of days I am facing slowness in Instagram loading of posts and stories and also in the WhatsApp status videos and pics while using WI-FI which has fast speed of 40Mbps. I find it quite unusual.\nBecause the same loads well using Mobile Data Internet which is got speed of just 1Mbps.\nAlso another point is, videos of YouTube and Facebook runs perfectly fast and fine on Wi-Fi.\nI have reinstalled the Instagram and WhatsApp app and checked but of no use.\nI am unable to diagnose what is going wrong .. are pixel phones overall facing this issue or is it subjected only to individual mobile sets like mine?\nKindly help.",
