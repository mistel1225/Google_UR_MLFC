    "content": "Pixel 2 XL. Within last couple of months my phone would randomly switch to vibrate mode. Contacted Google, wanted me to start in safe mode...blah, blah, blah. I finally figured it out...but STILL NEED help. \n\nWhen I connect to certain Wi-Fi networks, my device was set to vibrate on certain ones. Not sure why this happens, must have been an error in one of the updates. I essentially, have 2 different networks at home, one a 5G connection, the other not...which was bumping it into vibrate. \n\nThe only issue now, is that in the Settings Services Rules, I can't figure out how to check all of my saved networks. I do have it set to automatically suggest new rules, got through like 4 networks then it stopped suggesting. HOW CAN I ADD A RULE??? The pic attached shows the screen, but \"add rule\" isn't lit up or available to be clicked.",
