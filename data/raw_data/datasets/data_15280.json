    "content": "Every time I set my phone on a table it goes into privacy mode and plays through the earpiece. I HATE THIS and cannot figure out how to disable it. A message on the screen appears \"in privacy mode, move the phone away from your ear to turn it off\" and the phone will be nowhere near my ear and then privacy mode just stays on.. awful, please help",
