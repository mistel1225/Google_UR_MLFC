    "content": "Beginning a few weeks ago I found my still nearly new pixel 3 wasn't charging overnight. It seemed erratic, and I tried different standard cords.\n\nI finally figured out that no matter the charging cord there only seems to be one way round the cord will charge in the phone.  \n\nThis issue seems to have developed as I'm sure it did not and should not matter the orientation of the cord.\n\nThe phone has been treated tenderly and has never had to have the dust or water protection tested.  I've had it kept in a Google pixel case since the day I bought it.  The pixel 3 XL that I got for my mum, and the pixel 2 my dad got are both fine, and it's their cords I've tried my phone with as well, all from google. I also tried my Nexus 5X cord same issue.\n\nI waited for at least one android update and have tried restarting it as well and neither addressed the issue.  This seems to be a physical connection issue and not a software issue.\n\nThis is the only issue I've had with this otherwise great phone but having to pay this much close attention to make sure it charges is not only inconvenient it's definitely not working as it's supposed to, USB c cords should not require a specific orientation.\n\nI will do some research online to see if this issue has popped up for others, I don't see how it can be unique to me as i I have not tried a reset yet as that is a last resort I will do if this is a documented fix for this known issue, otherwise that level of inconvenience just to try it does not seem reasonable.\n\nThank you for you assistance.",
