    "content": "My Amazon app, Bank of America app, and a Battery Widget app I downloaded all crash when I try to open them. They start to load for a split second but then goes back to the home screen. Clearing the cache and uninstalling and rebooting the phone doesn't help. Deleting the app data let's the app run like normal and let me sign in at first, but then when I close the app and open it again it crashes. It's like there is something that is causing a bug in the apps whenever there is data saved and instead of loading it it crashes. They only work without any data stored after deleting the data.",
