    "content": "Hi, \n\nI have been using my pixel 2 XL since it came out. I'm very happy with it. Great phone. \n\nBut since now couple of weeks / months i'm having a serious issue with the notifications. Once you don't touch your phone for couple of minutes you don't receive them anymore. \n\nIt's really frustrating as I have missed several important calls and also some notifications from instagram/gmail etc. \n\nAfter some search online, i saw that i'm not the only one and a lot of people are facing the same issue. \n\nIs Google going to fix this problem please ? Because it's really annoying. \n\nThank you,",
