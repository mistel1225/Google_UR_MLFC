    "content": "Battery shows 50% charge all the time. Wireless charger shows battery symbol with ?. Peeing down battery has helped bring the phone to normal battery power indication but will not hold, phone reverts back to 50% at some point unknown to me. I then try to fix the issue via power on and off several times. Some days the phone battery just goes into quick battery bleed for some reason and the phone becomes unresponsive with black screen.  All Pixel 4xl phones need to be recalled and customers need full compensation. I've had my phone for 8 months. Not at all happy since I paid a high price for what I thought was a quality product. Lemon don't buy this phone.",
