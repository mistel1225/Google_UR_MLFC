    "content": "My Pixel 2 crashed and started back up with a black screen. When I press the power button, the lock symbol, time, and battery percentage keep flashing off and on in a loop. I can't unlock the phone or get into it. I've tried recharging the phone and force rebooting several times , but the same issue persists. Any fix for this or way to unlock it? I am trying to not do a factory reset because there are photos on there that have not been synced yet.",
