    "title": "Pixel 3a won't reboot after latest update",
    "content": "The security update was automatically downloaded a few hours ago and it gave me the option to reboot now or wait till 1:00 AM. The battery was at 100%. I choose reboot now and left it alone for over an hour. It never rebooted.\n\nI tried booting it and I get nothing. No vibration, screen is black. I hold down the power button for over 30 seconds and I still get nothing. I tried booting in safe mode by holding the down volume and the power button and I get nothing. I tried all these steps again with it plugged in to the charger and nothing. I let it sit on the charger for a couple of hours and try all these steps again and nothing.\n\nDid anyone else have this problem with the latest security update?",
