    "content": "Phone won't respond to touch. At first I just had to restart the phone. Now it gets stuck crazy long periods of time. As of posting this it's been an hour. I've done 3rd party check, contacted customer service, factory reset, etc. I can't figure it out. I even took the case off incase it was over heating.",
