    "content": "My Google Pixel first gen device turning off automatically without any notification. The issue showed up after the Android 10 upgrade. My device is usable only when connected to power. This is a weird issue.\nI have contacted Pixel support and they helped me picking up my device for service. They promised me the repair and return within 15 days, but they say that the device is still in transit even after 10 days. I am really disappointed with pixel service and probably it's time to switchðŸ˜“",
