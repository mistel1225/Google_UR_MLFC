    "content": "Trying to set up my new P4a5G, coming from a Xiaomi Mi 9T Pro.\n\nDevice setup, Data Transfer via cable outright fails 19 out of 20 times (Xiaomi phone shows \"connected to \"new device\", yet remains stuck in \"preparing\", while Pixel phone displays that maybe extra permissions need to be enabled on the old phone). 1 out of 20 times I can see the Xiaomi files on the Pixel, yet nothing about Call history, SMS, app settings?\n\nIf I tell the Pixel that my old phone is unavailable and I'd like to restore from a Google Drive device backup, it comes up empty and tells me there's no backup at all in my Google Account, while opening the Drive App on the Pixel clearly shows it there, listed together with the WhatsApp backup as \"other backup\".\n\nWhat now?",
