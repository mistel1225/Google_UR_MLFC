    "content": "I recently noticed that here is no sound coming from the bottom left speaker on my Pixel 4a.  I see/hear 3 speakers, 1 coming from the top of the phone, and two placed on the bottom.  Both the top and bottom right have sound emitting from them.  Although the bottom left seems to be dead.  Does it serve a different function?",
