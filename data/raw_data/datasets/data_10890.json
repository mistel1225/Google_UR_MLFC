    "title": "When playing games the notification bar turns great and prevents me from pressing some things",
    "content": "It doesn't happen 100% of the time but it does often. I don't know what triggers it, it seems random to me. The notification bar turns grey and I can't see my rources or click stuff that it covers. It's not necessarily game breaking but pretty annoying. Couldn't find anything about it so here I am asking you for guidance. ",
