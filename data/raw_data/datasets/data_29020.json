    "title": "Pixel Stand Issue - Draining battery as opposed to charging",
    "content": "The pixel stand has been such a hit or miss product for me.\n\nFirst, it would work perfectly.\nThen shortly after, it would completely wake my device up so that the home screen is showing super bright constantly.\nThen, it would not longer quick charge.\n\nNow, its not even charging...in fact, its actually draining my phone battery.\n\nI turned off (and have had off) all of the settings on the pixel stand + phone options (i.e. photo scrolling, ambient display, etc.)\n\nMy phone got really hot, and then starting to dip in battery life rather quick.\n\nI know all products have issues...but this is doing the opposite of what it was supposed to, and it was expensive.",
