    "content": "I am a new softball coach. We have purchased a set of practice plans that includes detailed drills, but so far have had issues staying on schedule. Therefore I am trying to display the screenshots of the drills on a schedule. Each drill is only 1 page/screenshot but takes a minute or two to re-read the details.\n\nI tried using the assistant feature inside of alarms to display an image but could not get that to work.\n\nI downloaded a custom alarm app that displays pictures along with the alarm, however when I snooze or dismiss the alarm the picture goes away(annoying at best to try to read details with the alarm sound playing).\n\nI have another coach's phone number so was going to send the screenshots on a schedule via text however stock messages doesn't allow scheduling and I'm not sure ill be alerted when messages are sent (would have to rely on his phone).\n\nTried assistant to schedule those messages but it will only send text and no images.\n\nSo for now I have alarms set for the times with the names of the drills, and ill have to dig through screenshots manually. Am I missing something? Anybody have any good ideas? Thanks for your time in advance!",
