    "content": "I've had my pixel 3 for about a year and a half. I got it in December 2018. It has been the perfect phone until about a month ago when it started overheating. For the first couple weeks, it was overheating when it was docked in my car. It was plugged in, navigating, playing music and it was sunny... so I just assumed that the combination of factors, it seemed reasonable to overheat. That being said, I have been running it in this fashion for the entire time that I've owned it and I take frequent road trips in which it is responsible for all of these tasks. None-the-less, I brushed it off. \nBut now, it is just sitting on my coffee table and I'm listening to music on it via bluetooth connection... and it's totally overheated. It isn't charging. It isn't in the sun. The house is air conditioned (I'm sitting under a blanket). All the other apps are closed except SoundCloud...\nThis means now I'm concerned... it seems to be getting worse. Has anyone else experienced this? Is it fixable? Is the battery worn out? \nThanks,",
