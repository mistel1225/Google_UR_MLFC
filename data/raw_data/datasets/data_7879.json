    "content": "Have current update.\nThe box that appears at the bottom of the screen to say \"Contact Saved\" or \"Sharing to Messages\" or \"Drag from top to exit full screen\" does not go away for an extended period of time and displays over screen well after task has completed.\nThis is so bothersome as these notices obscure part of the screen in the next task.\nI've searched for weeks for a fix or similar problem but don't know what to call these \"notices\". Searches regarding notifications are always irrelevant.",
