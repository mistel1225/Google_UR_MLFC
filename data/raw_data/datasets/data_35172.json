    "title": "bootloader error - I think?",
    "content": "Every time I opened my phone, the volume bar would appear and disappear over and over again, then the volume started going up and down without me touching it. So, I thought it would be best to restart. When I restarted an error came up. There's an Android lying on its back with a panel open and an arrow pointing to the on button that is looping 'recovery mode' 'download mode' 'restart bootloader' 'start' 'power off' and 'barcodes' over and over again with bootloader, baseband, product revision, serial number, ufs, dram, boot-slot, console, secure boot, device state and then in bright yellow highlighted text: ERROR: Operation Denied. I tried to get through to GOogle directly, but they close their phone lines and chat services at 8pm. I now have no access to my phone and I've been reading that it's a proper error and I will lose all of my important pictures and things - I don't know if everything is automatically backed up to the cloud and I'm sad and panicking. Any help would be massively appreciated.",
