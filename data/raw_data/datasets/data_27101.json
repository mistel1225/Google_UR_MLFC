    "content": "I recently received a manufacturer replacement Pixel 2 after my first one had to charge issues. After about a week of using the new phone, I began to wake up to my phone in a crashed state. The screen was completely black and I had to factory reset my phone in order for it to work properly. \n\nThe charger I use is also completely new and is not an aftermarket charger. I purchased it from the Google Store.\n\nCould the charger be causing these issues? Or is this a software/hardware problem that's out of my control?",
