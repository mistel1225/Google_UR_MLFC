    "content": "    My issue: With increasing frequency I will lose my data connection while I'm using lyft/uber drivers apps(it might happen if I don't use them but that's honestly the only time I'm not at home on wifi so I wouldn't notice) which of course makes these apps not work making it very difficult and annoying to do my job. it's been happening about a week and tonight it started happening very often up to every 30 minutes. When it first started happening it would show the little x on my signal strength indicating I had no signal but now it gives no indications-- apps just stop working until I toggle airplane mode. When I do toggle airplane it fixes the connection instantly but it often takes a while to notice my phone has stopped working which causes many issues in my job. It's obviously not that I'm actually out of cell coverage-- this is a phone issue.\n     Things I've done: restarted phone, made sure data saver is off, allowed apps that use data to have unrestricted data usage, made sure phone is up to date",
