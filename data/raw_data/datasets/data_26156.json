    "content": "I bought a 3a pixel a couple of months ago and since then I've only seen the features decrease:\n- Instead of the ringtone/notifications the volume keys change the multimedia volume even when you don't use any multimedia. \n- The ambient display could be set to appear only when the device was raised, shortly after this feature was replaced by the full display which blinds when the device is raised in the middle of the night.\n- Recorded videos have a very loud hiss that makes them horrible. To be able to remove this whistle is necessary to disable the Now Playing function or the Voice Assistant (both features that I like.)\n- In the latest version of the camera you have removed:\n    - burst photos (one of the best features!)\n    - the possibility to choose video resolution\n    - the astrophotos added with V7.2 and removed immediately (I was very keen on it but I didn't had time to test it)\n\nIs it possible to have a PIXEL with features that increase over time instead of diminishing?\n\nThanks.",
