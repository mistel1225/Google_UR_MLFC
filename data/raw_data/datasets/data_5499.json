    "content": "Using pixel 2 camera for recording anything when battery is less than 50% causes phone to die. When battery 25% or lower just taking pictures will do this. Sometimes it has entirely drained the battery then and other times i can start phone back up but battery is always significantly decreased and i still could not use camera to perform any actions without the same result.",
