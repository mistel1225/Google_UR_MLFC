    "title": "While locked phone is in a pocket of my pants it reacts on touches and accepting calls",
    "content": "I do press power button each time before I put my phone in a pocket. So it should be locked. The screen is turned inside. But while my phone is in a pocket it reacts on touches. Many times it did accept calls, mess with notifications, etc.\nAlso I noticed that during the call, when I put my phone to my ear it reacts on touches as well. I do not have cover or screen protector. This is 3 month old device. I did not notice any other problems. All of my previous phones did not have such problem.",
