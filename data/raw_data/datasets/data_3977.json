    "content": "woke up to a warm, dead pixel (1st gen).  Tried all the rebooting videos that lead to the White screen of death.  Luckily, had a spare pixel, same gen, transferred Sim and started the recovery via Google which frooze during the process and now I have 2 non responsive Pixels.  Could it be the Sim card or what else?  Batteries and screens where replaced last year",
