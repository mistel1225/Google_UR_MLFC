    "title": "Pixel 3XL - \"Can't find valid operating system\"",
    "content": "I've had my Pixel 3XL for about six weeks and when I went to use the phone a few hours ago received this message on a black screen.  Phone is totally locked up, won't turn off, restart, flash, etc.  Completely random - no changes to phone, updates, apps; prior to this glitch I had used the phone for SMS and browsing the internet today.  Finally got through to support, but after a 40 minute call the conclusion was to have the issue escalated and wait for a call back within \"1-2 business days\".  Totally unacceptable.  My $800 phone is now a paperweight due to an obvious system glitch and thus far the only solution offered is a refurbished phone which I will not accept.\n\nThis doesn't appear to be a common issue, but coupled with all the other basic trouble I've seen posted (and encountered myself) regarding the PIxel 3 series, Google is unfortunately pushing me away from Android, the only modern mobile OS I've used.",
