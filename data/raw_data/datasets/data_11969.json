    "content": "I have been using Google pixel from pixel 1, but now feeling embarrassed as Google discontinued pixel 4, I bought it few months ago, they have launched pixel 5 with fingerprint scanner, larger battery. And there is no trade in option for Australia, only for USA. Feels like looted and fool. Pixel 4s battery doesn't last half day, even motion sensors are off, power mode is on. I called them and they said sorry we only trade in pixel 4 in USA. Who else is looking for trade in options?",
