    "content": "I have a Pixel 2 downgraded to Android 10 due to the reboot issue.\nNow there is a December 2020 update available.\nIn https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/87385737 it is stated that the reboot issue is fixed for Pixel 3 and newer. I need to know whether this fix is also included in the Pixel 2 update, because otherwise I will not update the phone.",
