    "content": "Hi,\n\nI bought my Pixel 3a XL in june this year from the Google store, i am located in The Netherlands.\n2 weeks ago, without any known cause, my screen went dark. I tried to do a forced reboot by holding down the power button for > 30sec. Tried to boot it, charge it for a day. Nothing seems to work.\nThe phone looks undamaged, not a scratch or anything.\n\nI tried to start the repair process as described on the support page explaining the repair process:\nhttps://support.google.com/store/answer/9004345?hl=nl\nThe link (http://store.google.com/repaircenter) to the repair center redirects me back to the google store page: https://store.google.com/ I suppose that this is an issue, not being able to go to the repair center.\n\nI also tried to call for support but then I get an automated message saying that due to covid-19, they are unable to take my call.\n\nI hope you guys can point me to the right direction on how to start the repair process here in The Netherlands.",
