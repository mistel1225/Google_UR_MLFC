    "content": "Hi,\n\nWhen I use my usb-c Pixel Buds with my Pixel 4a (Android 11), I can't hold the volume up button to trigger notifications.  If I turn the screen on, this feature works.  If I leave always on display, it'll work until I put it in my pocket (and the screen, of course, turns off).\n\nSo basically, if my phone's in my pocket, I have to click the power button before I can get the \"read notifications\" feature to work.",
