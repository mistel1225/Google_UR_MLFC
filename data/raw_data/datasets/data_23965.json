    "title": "Disable Bluetooth absolutely (including auto connect)",
    "content": "I have used the settings to turn Bluetooth off.. but it turns back on whenever a Bluetooth device is nearby. \n\nI have searched these forums and found lots of info on turning bluetooth ON... But only basic instructions for what I have already tried above for turning it off. \n\nI found lots of questions like \"why would you not want to reconnect automatically to Bluetooth devices\" .. if you must know. I wish to connect to Android Auto in my vehicle. .. and also sometimes to Bluetooth for audio. \n\nI set up Bluetooth first..and now android auto cannot connect (my car switches rapidly between Bluetooth and Android auto when it does).\n\nOn my old phone (a Samsung) I did not have this problem. And I could simply turn off the Bluetooth..and it would stay off.",
