    "title": "Pairing with Daydream controller OK, but update gets stuck on cca 5%. how to fix?",
    "content": "I have a Daydream (the older version) with controller. I was able to pair it with the phone. But tha phone says that the controller needs an update. The update starts as expected, but the gets stuck between 3-7% and the phone says \"no controller found, try again\". I go thru troubleshooting steps as described here: https://support.google.com/daydream/answer/7395955?hl=en , still nothing helped. Anybody got some suggestion on how to get the controller updated? The version of it shows in daydream as 1.0.25, model on controller D9SCA. Thanks for any suggestions.",
