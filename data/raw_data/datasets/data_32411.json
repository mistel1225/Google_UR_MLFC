    "content": "I had an issue with the pixel shutting down at low battery while using network and tried to fix it according to the answer from an expert from this community by factory reset. It didn't help and now its worse. It just shuts down when its not getting charged even though the battery is over 90%. Now I have to keep charging it to use it. Could it be a power IC problem or battery?",
