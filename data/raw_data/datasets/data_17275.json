I tried connecting Boya to my iPad, iPhone and computer and they worked. I tried connecting using my headset with the USB Type C to audio dongle and it works too. So, Boya MM1 has selectively worked for everything except my phone?\n\nHas anyone encounter this issue or was my Google Pixel 2XL too old for Boya MM1? \n\nCan someone help?",
