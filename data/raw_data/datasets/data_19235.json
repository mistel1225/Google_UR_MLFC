    "content": "I have a Pixel 4. It is around 10 months old. Prior to that I have owned a Pixel 2 for two years and know how to operate these phones well.\n\nI was deleting a single photo from my album and suddenly a huge number of my photos and videos were permantley deleted.\n\nThey are not in trash, or in any other albums. \n\nI have contacted the support chat who advise me Google Photos do not have any staff who can be contacted via phone, email or chat and the only way to seek help is to post a message on here. \n\nI would like to repeat that my phone automatically deleted a large number of my photos and videos permanently, and that Google are unable to offer me any support other than to post in a chat forum. \n\nAs someone who has previously highly recommended (and converted) a number of friends from iPhones to Pixels previously I am highly disappointed. \n\nIf this issue cannot be resolved and my photos and videos are irretrievable I will not be buying or recommending a Pixel phone again.",
