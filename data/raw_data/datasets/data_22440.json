    "content": "I have TTY full mode enabled on my Pixel 4XL to try to communicate with a bank that has TTY support. But, for some reason the calls are not going through. I use Google FI as my communications carrier. I don't appear to have RTT mode support on the phone, even though the Android system is version 10.  How do I make my Pixel 4XL work with a business TTY system? \n\nThis is the page I referenced to find out, but it does not answer my question:\nhttps://support.google.com/accessibility/android/answer/9042284",
