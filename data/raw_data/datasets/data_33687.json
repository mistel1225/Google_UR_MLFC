    "content": "Last update installed a bunch more junk on my pixel 2 xl.  The one in particular I can't get rid of (there are several others too) is Digital Wellbeing.  \n\nYet another unwanted, unrequested, and unwelcome piece of software that will no doubt have the normal Google endless updates wasting my time and data. \n\nI buy only Google tablets and phones to have pure Android. Google has forgotten their roots. This shouldn't be like a Samsung device - you should be able to control what's on YOUR device. \n\nSo how to get rid of all this new stuff? \nDigital wellbeing - especially this one! \nDevice health services \nDevice policy\nActions services \n\nThese are all recent additions that have appeared since I installed pie in January. \n\nI'm betting you can't remove them which will mean no more Google products and rooting and custom ROM for the 5+ Google tablets and phones I have. \n\nHoping somebody out there has found a solution instead of forcing me to root.",
