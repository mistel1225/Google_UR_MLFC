    "title": "\"password required after device restarts\" Issue on Google Pixel 2 XL",
    "content": "I suddenly got locked out of the phone today. I was normally using it to take some pictures and next after few minutes when I checked I saw that it is locked with a weird message that read \"password required after device restarts\".\nI have tried using my pin, my google password and any other password that I could recall and nothing has worked. My device location is not active so I cannot use find my device to unlock it.\nI think I updated the device like in last 2-3 days to a newer version.\nI cannot access my phone and everytime I put a new pin/password, it shows me that \"password required after device restarts\" error.\n\nPlease help Google. There has to be a fix of this stupid error of yours other than just wanting us to factory reset the phone.\n\nplease help.",
