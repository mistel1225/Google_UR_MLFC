    "content": "I just got my Pixel 5 and transferred all my settings and data from my Pixel 4XL, and activated the Google Fi. When I opened Message app noticed that chat feature was not enabled. I went to settings for chat features to enable it but it was saying: chat features not available for this device. I contacted google 5 times (due to call dropping, support agent ending the chat window to assist other customers since they couldn't assist me) I followed all the instructions from the last support person from making sure that my default message app was google message app, turn airplane mode and clear data from both Service carrier and Message apps, reboot in safe mode and do the same, re activate google fi and erasing eSim, but nothing helped so far. I guess no Chat for Pixel 5.....",
