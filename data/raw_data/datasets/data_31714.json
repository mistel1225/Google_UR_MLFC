    "content": "Ok, what gives? System crashes, UI stops responding (oh when that starts to happen there is no way to capture the log at that point in time because the phone needs to restart), Google services stop working, freezes and crashes when using an application. Hell, you dont even need to be using thr application, just exiting may do the same. I looked forward to dropping my Samsung for a Pixel. Biggest mistake. At least im only a week in of owning it.",
