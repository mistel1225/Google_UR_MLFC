    "content": "Hello, new pixel 3xl from Google running on Us cellular. Phone works fine except I cannot access voicemail. US-Cellular support said the Phone is not reading its EID number off the sim card they needed. I had my sim card replaced and same issue.\n\nCalling and texting works just fine. However under data settings, it lists \"roaming indicator off\". I have roaming turned on, and have tried enabling and disabling those settings. The tech guy at us cellular said he hadnt seen an issue like this and I should contact Google since it seemed like a software bug.\n\nAlso in settings under \"Sim Status\", it lists Not Roaming and EID unknown. \n Has anyone ran into this before and is there a fix?",
