    "content": "My wifi calling settings have disappeared from all Settings menus when i switched over to Google Fi service 10 days ago. I am using a Pixel 2 XL which is supposedly \"Designed for Fi\" and wifi calling is a big feature. Spent hours with Google support with no resolution so far.  Just to reiterate, the setting to enable/disable wifi calling has disappeared from the Network as well as Calls settings. I am on Android 10. Anyone else facing this issue? Any suggestions would be much appreciated.",
