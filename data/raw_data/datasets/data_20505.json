    "content": "Almost two weeks ago, my phone would not turn on and when you pushed down the power button, you could see an \"empty battery\". I called ATT and they had me troubleshoot. I also tried another charger to make sure that was not the issue. ATT said I needed a new phone so since I have had it since Oct of 2019, she transferred me to Warranty since it is covered under warranty and I got disconnected. Almost two weeks later, after speaking to 5 people from ATT, the final one said I need to contact Google to process a new phone since I have had it less than a year and it is under warranty. Since the pandemic, there is no one there and I cannot find an email address to contact Support to get this done. I have been to all the links that state if it's been a year or less and all it does is send me to the same place to troubleshoot my phone. How can I get a human to process my Warranty claim so I can get a new phone. I am an insulin-dependent diabetic and I HAVE to have my phone. I have an old one with a weak battery that is not dependable and I live alone so this is URGENT. Any suggestions? The phone will not turn on so I can do nothing with it. Thanks for any help!",
