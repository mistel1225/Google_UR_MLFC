    "content": "As the title suggests, my phone's vibration intensity keeps on changing automatically throughout the day universaly i.e. not only in keyboard but also while navigating the phone using the navigation gestures and buttons. Sometimes the strength goes all the way down and sometimes it gets very strong. As of this moment I'm typing it's strong. Can anybody help me fix this?",
