    "content": "So my phone the other day started to turn off when I plugged it in. It does it on fast charge and regular charge. It does it on my Laptop and and just a charger. It does it on factory chargers and OEM chargers. Sometimes, it does not charge at all even once it has shut down. \n\nI have looks for any objects inside the port, and have blown it out with air. That has not made any change. The only way I can charge my phone is to pug it in, let it shut down and then turn it back on.",
