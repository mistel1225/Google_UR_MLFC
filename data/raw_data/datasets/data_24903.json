    "title": "Google chrome opens automatically when I open another google app",
    "content": "When I want to open a google app ( checking the weather on the main screen, google podcasts, etc), \"it redirects me\" or it opens Google chrome automatically. If I try to open the same app again it will just open another new tab. Initially it happened only when I was trying to check the weather from the main screen functionality, but later it happened with Google podcasts and even when I tried to open play store. I've seen a post with the similar issues but there seems to be no solution, even though this issue is already experienced by many other Pixel phone users and even LG phone users for a long period of time ( since 2018). It does not seem to be a very difficult issue to solve so I don't know why google isn't fixing this bug. Is there any one who found a solution to this issue? I tried clearing my cache which was one suggestion but that does not work.",
