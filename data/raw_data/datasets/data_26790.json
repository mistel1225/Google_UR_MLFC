    "content": "Is there any way to separate the volume for notifications and calls? This is very annoying as I need my ringtone to be lots for calls but I prefer my notifications to be quieter. I can't find a quiet enough notification or text tone since I can't seem to turn the volume down for only that without turning down my ring tone.... If this isn't a feature, is there any pending changes coming for this?",
