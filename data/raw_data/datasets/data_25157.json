    "title": "Why are close-up selfies sharper on the Pixel 3 than the Pixel 4?",
    "content": "Selfies taken with the Pixel 4 are not nearly as sharp as those taken with the Pixel 3. \n\nI've been playing around with this for hours now, and the problem seems isolated to just the front-facing camera. I haven't been able to test this outside with the sunlight, but I used all of the lights in my house and I still get the same result.\n\nI'll provide two photos, the first being taken with the Pixel 3, the second with the Pixel 4.\nYou can easily see the detail in the facial hair on the Pixel 3 as you zoom in, but on the Pixel 4, all of the detail is somewhat lost and, for lack of a better word, \"blurry.\" And it's no small difference, it's massive.\n\nThis has been consistent regardless of the use of portrait mode or facial retouching. \n\nHowever, as I pull the camera further away from my face, the pixel 3 does seem to lose its sharpness and the pixel 4 provides a close, if not better, image. Is this a software issue, or is this a hardware issue? How did Google not test these cameras out more, and why aren't there more people talking about this?\n\nEither way, this is super frustrating. Just another reason for me to wonder why I even bothered upgrading.",
