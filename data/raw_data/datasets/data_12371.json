    "content": "Since the Pixel 3a upgraded to Android 11, on phone calls the Android Notifications screen keeps inserting itself/hiding my phone call in progress screen. This happens a lot when I am making my way through a phone tree, needing to access the screen to touch numbers on the keypad etc. but also while I am on hold or just on an ongoing call. At first I didn't even know what to do to get rid of the screen display of notifications hiding my phone call screen but then found I have to swipe up to get rid of it. How can I prevent general Notifications display from interrupting my phone calls? (I just submitted this to Google under Send feedback on my Pixel 3a) \n\nPS a  lot of these are notifications I don't even want but cannot swipe away, for example from my security program, which won't let me remove a notice about VPN not being turned on.",
