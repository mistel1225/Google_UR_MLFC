    "title": "Pixel 4 XL and Desktop Mode question",
    "content": "This is more of a general question about all the pixel phones with Android 10 and Android 10 in general. \nin the developer options there is a way to force desktop mode on external displays. Which I, and many others have turned on. However nothing seems to happen with my pixel 4. But other phones on android 10 (Oneplus 7 etc) get a \"Samsung Dex\" type mode. Which, if it is now being baked into the core of android would be amazing. \n\nIs this a feature that will be fully implemented into the pixel? I understand its a development feature at this time. But the fact that other phones on android 10 can use this is odd. \n\nI read somewhere that the pixel line of phones cant output video over USB C. Will this be changed to enable this? As being a flagship phone, running the latest android. And not having one of the core flagship features seems rather disappointing.\n\nAs the pixel line (and the nexus before it) IS the standard that pure Android should be. That was what they have been designed for. \nAnd having other manufactures implement features of Android that the pixel doesn't is a little disheartening.",
