    "content": "I ended up cancelling my Pixel 4 XL after finding out you stopped unlimited original quality storage for my pics and videos. This is absolutely rediculous Google!! For what we are paying for a flagship phone with ONLY 64GB of internal storage?!?! This was a major selling point for me and many others! I've been a loyal customer since the first Nexus but now it's time to jump ship. Thanks Google, your loyalty to is is no longer!!! ðŸ¤¬ðŸ¤¬",
