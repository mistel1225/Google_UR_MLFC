    "content": "I experience a squeaking sound when I make phone calls and listen to the other person speaking. When they pronounce certain words it´s like this squeaking sound is added. The call volume is moderate and I´m not using the speakerphone. The sound isn´t clear and I have used this phone a few days only. You could think the speakers were worn out and can´t tolerate certain frequences but that can´t be the case with a completely new phone. The other person hear me fine and doesn´t experience any background noise.\n\nI've restarted the phone and all of the latest updates are installed.\n\nAny tips on this?",
