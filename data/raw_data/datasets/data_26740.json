    "title": "Add an option in quick settings to turn 90hz on/off (games run poorly)",
    "content": "So in games like Empires & Puzzles and Mario Kart, if 90hz is on, the games stutter noticeably.  Knowing that 90hz (I don't have it forced on which causes the problem too though) only works currently at brightness levels somewhere above 75/80% I have to drop the brightness below this to make these games run smoothly.  I personally would like a quick option in the top tray like the wifi/bluetooth/nightlight/airplan button options to manually choose quickly if my phone runs at 60 or 90 instead of the deeper settings and developer option to change it.  Would be helpful to manage battery life too to make it this accessible.\n\nAn even better choice would be a way to set an option for each app if it runs at 60 or 90.",
