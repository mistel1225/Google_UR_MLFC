    "title": "Pixel 2XL turning off when any cable plugged in / not charging",
    "content": "Couple of days ago my Pixel 2 XL started turning off after any cable was plugged in (usb->usb-c in my car, usb-c->usb->c from my mac, usb-c->usb-c from power brick), for the first couple of days it was at least still charging when turned off, but at the moment it just keeps turning on and off when it's plugged in and that's causing it to discharge more than charge. \n\nThere is not \"debris\" inside the port and I tried all the suggested software fixes I could find (using safe mode, turning off adaptive battery), none of which worked. I haven't yet tried to factory reset, since I'd lose access to every app I'm using Google Authenticator on. The main problem is that I bought the phone in the Czech Republic, so not from an official distribution (from the biggest Czech electronics eshop though) and it's now out of warranty and there are literally no repair shops with google pixel parts or even knowledge about the phone.\n\nAny suggestions, please? Am I completely fd up?",
