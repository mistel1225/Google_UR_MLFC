    "content": "I've had my pixel 2 for just over 2 years and never really had much trouble with it. But in the past few weeks I've been noticing a lot more app crashes than normal. I've reinstalled the app, made sure the phone is updated, etc. Mainly it's pokemon go but other apps as well. Is this a common issue?",
