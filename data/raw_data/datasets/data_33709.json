    "content": "Camera does not stay still. There is constant shaking and clicking. Makes videos impossible. Can just manage to take a clear picture.\n\nA few things to note:\n1) I have never dropped this phone. \n2) it is two months old\n3) I've tested on different camera apps\n4) the clicking noise in the video link can be heard coming from the camera\n5) I've switched vid to camera like to portrait, etc it does not solve it \n\nQuick 16sec clip of the issue:\nhttps://youtu.be/Nu8bUKyp6NA\n\nAlso this is the clicking noise. It is the lens shaking https://photos.app.goo.gl/QGAxnwt9fJKh3zqD7\n\nMy next issue is that now I live in South Africa. I bought the phone when I was in UK from Google store online. Trying to return or exchange is a right nightmare. Any recommendations??? I'm tempted to destroy the phone, and claim from insurance and just buy a local phone here or something.",
