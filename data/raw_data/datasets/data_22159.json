    "title": "Cannot restore Google 1 Backup of Pixel 3a XL after Factory Reset",
    "content": "I have a Pixel 3a XL with all current updates. I also pay for Google 1 service. I had to send my phone in for repairs, so I did a backup in the Google 1 app, waited for it to complete, then did a factory reset before sending my phone to Google for repairs. The phone is back, I set it back up, selected restore from a backup during the setup process, and it has not been able to restore any of my settings, data, or MMS. Via support I have now done 3 factory resets, I have reset the app data and cache for Google 1, tried the \"restore\" button in the Google 1 app. Nothing is working. I need my text messages back. I'm frustrated. Google drive says that backup contains plenty (3.6GB) of data. (2.2GB of MMS messages). I've let the phone sit overnight, nothing restores.\n\nGmail, photos, contacts and any other typically cloud synced data is fine. Backup info is not.\n\nGoogle's explanation on how Google 1 backup works, because support has said only 25MB of SMS data is backed up\nhttps://www.blog.google/products/google-one/new-phone-backup/",
