    "content": "I have a Pixel 3 XL, and I recently discovered that you can customize the Google Search Widget, changing its shape, color, etc. However, I already have a Google Assistant Search Bar at the bottom of my home screen, so putting the customizable widget on my home screen too would be redundant. Is there a way to remove the non-customizable Google Assistant Search bar from the bottom of my home screen so I can replace it with the customizable widget? Alternatively, is there a way to customize the Google Assistant search bar the same way you can customize the widget? Thanks.",
