    "content": "I just got my brand new 4a in the mail. no matter what I do it will not show anything on the screen. If I try to turn it on connected to my computer, the computer tells me something is connected but then immediately disconnects it. I am currently deployed overseas so ordering a whole new phone is both expensive and a massive waste of time. Any help would be appreciated. Thank you",
