    "content": "I have a balding, shaven head and Portrait Mode seems unable to deal with it. Whenever I take a selfie in PM, the depth effect lops off parts of my hairline. I look weird and thinned out. Itâ€™s fine if I set the depth slider to off. But I want to be able to use depth effect like any non-follicly challenged person. Why is Google discriminating against us baldies?",
