    "content": "For 3 weeks now I have had an issue with the GMail app on my Pixel 5 crashing when opening certain emails or clicking to open links. I have reported it to Google and have gone around in circles with various reset procedures and work arounds. What I have established is that the Android System WebView update (89.0.4389.105) which is meant to be resolving the problem is for me actually causing the problem. If I uninstall updates to WebView the problem goes away but as I prefer to allow automatic updates on my phone it gets this update installed again and the issue returns.\n\nAnyone else having this experience?\n\nThanks.",
