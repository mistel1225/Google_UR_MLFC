    "content": "On my Google pixel 4 xl, after upgrading to Android 11, screen recording does not capture screen.  In playback, It only captured the first frame then shows \"gboard stop responding\"   while the audio is playing. There aren't any permissions for this native app.  I uninstalled and reinstalled Google keyboard many times but no luck..  I researched all of community but no luck. \n\nThank you.",
