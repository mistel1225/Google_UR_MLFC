    "content": "Pixel4XL is shutting down while not in use /screen off. Touching the screen or the power button does nothing. Only long press on the power button turns it on. Started about 2 weeks ago once every few days and gradually got to many times a day. I tried deleting several apps in frequent use, same thing.",
