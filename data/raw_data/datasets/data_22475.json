    "content": "Hi,\n   my google 3a XL mobile lost display all of a sudden. I was seeing blue blurred screen. I tried fixing this issue using steps specified in url: https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/6010316?hl=en. But i was not able to perform all steps specified in it as i was not able to find all required options. Also as part of troubleshooting steps, i have noted some minor cracks on phone screen. So i have stopped my trouble shooting steps and requesting for help. \n\nCan you please advice me on how to get display for my phone.  Display is completely dark now compared to earlier blue screen. pfb mobile screenshot for reference.\n\nThanks in advance,\nAnil",
