    "content": "I am trying to change the audio output on my pixel 3. Before updating to android 11 I did this in sound settings. However, now that is done in the media controls that are supposed to appear in quick settings, but the media controls do not appear for me no matter what app I open. Therefore, I have no way to change the audio output from my headphones to the speakers and vice versa. Does anyone know how to force the media controls to appear in android 11 or how to change the audio output without the media controls?",
