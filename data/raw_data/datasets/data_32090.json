    "content": "I am a volunteer for the RNIB and I have visually impaired person that is trying to make her Pixel 3 XL go totally White on Black, while we can do a use a number of settings, it seem to be impossible to the lock screen and other screen to go white on black. We have tried inverting the color which does most parts, but does not do the lock screen or other system screens. If we try dark mode or dark theme, also tried white themes with the colour inversion, it can do other parts of the system menus, but nothing so far can do all parts.\n\nCan you advise or point me to a document that allow us to get the best option to get the Pixel 3 XL to be readable 100% for any visually impaired person.\n\nThanks",
