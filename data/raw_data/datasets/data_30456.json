    "title": "Was anyone forced to factory reset their phone after downloading the android q beta update?",
    "content": "Two days ago I saw that there was an update for Android q beta and I downloaded it. While it was in the installation phase and going to boot up, I got this message on screen (see attachment). I tried to boot it up 4 times and it wouldn't, eventually I had to perform a factory reset on the phone. Everything was back to square one and whilst I was setting up, it occurred to me that I should opt out of the beta just in case something like this were to happen again. \nI opted out, went back to android p (seems like I was still in the beta for that but oh well) and now my pixel is back to how it were before (of course I had to set up multiple things like it was out of the box and had tons of apps to redownload which was a pain). \n\nI know my screen cracked so please don't bother pointing it out. It the first time in my life it has happened to me. ",
