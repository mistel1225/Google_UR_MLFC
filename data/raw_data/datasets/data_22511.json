    "content": "This started to happen after the March 2020 feature drop.\n\nLet's say I'm playing any kind of multimedia through the loud speakers of my pixel 3xl, call it YouTube, Spotify, video in a website, anything. \nAfter 2-3 minutes the sound switches from the loud speakers to the earpiece as if I were listening to the music through a phone call. Which is not loud at all. \n\nFor the sound to go back to normal I have to pause and play again. \n\nHappens with the phone locked and unlocked. Absolutely annoying. \nI haven't install any apps recently, it began to happen that same day the feature drop dropped.",
