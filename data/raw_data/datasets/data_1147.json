    "content": "I had the original Pixel and never had a lick of trouble with it in regards to Bluetooth connectivity. I decided to upgrade to the 4a 5G and really wish I hadn’t! Despite completing multiple factory resets and all the other troubleshooting steps I have read, I still can’t get it to keep connectivity with my Bluetooth devices. Fails in my car, me headphones, earbuds, everything. I’ve even tried the Google ear buds and same issue. It will connect okay but will never stay connected for long. This is the only phone I’ve had the issue with including earlier Pixel and iPhones.\nThis is a huge deal breaker for me and if it doesn’t get fixed, this will be my last Pixel. As in, I will get rid of it and eat the cost of getting something else. I’ve seen so many similar complaints that one would think Google would’ve escalated a fix by now.\nI’ve got a open ticket so we shall see if anything comes of it.\n\nIt is too bad that one issue will ruin my run with Pixels BUT it is a huge issue for me.",
