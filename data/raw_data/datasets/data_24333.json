    "content": "I hardly bought the Pixel 4XL.\nOrder number GS.1410-3187-0577\nFour rejections were made on the Google Store.\nI live abroad. So really hard, hard to buy.\n\nBut after one month of use, I had a problem.\nThe Pixel 4XL camera does not work.\nMany people in the community have identified the same problem.\nI talked to \"Gold Product Expert\" \"Salim\" in this article.\n\nhttps://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/25493208?hl=en#  \n\nSafe Mode, Airplane Mode, Clear Camera App Cache Data, Factory Reset\nI did everything but the camera app didn't work.\nHe said it was a hardware problem.\n\nSo I write an e-mail.\nMy opinion is firm.\nIf you send me a Pixel 4LX with the same problem that I purchased from Google,\nI will transfer the data and send back the problematic Pixel 4XL.\nIf this is not possible I want a refund.\nI will be very disappointed at Google if you do not send the Pixel 4XL without any problems.\nIf you would like a refund, please let me know the address I need to send.\n\nIf Google doesn't implement my opinion on this issue,\nI will be very disappointed with Google.",
