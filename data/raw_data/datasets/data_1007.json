    "content": "Why does the Google device support dont offer partial support. When I am facing issues only with the screen's display glass, why should I pay for all the other listed issues where in I dont have any issues using the phone as it is.\n\nAn estimation of 28k for an absolutely working fine mobile phone is something which any customer would deny paying.\n\nA proper justification here would help me. As I have got no other option apart from throwing the phone I loved to garbage.",
