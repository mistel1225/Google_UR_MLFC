    "content": "Hi,\n\nMy son got this phone for his christmas and said it has been like this from day one.\n\nHe says when he uses the video zoom it glitches and stops and starts a lot. This never happened with his older pixel 2 phone. He also says the camera looks warped and the picture curves.\n\nHe has cleaned the lens and updated all apps. This was the first thing he tried as this was an important part of the phone he likes to use a lot but says it is not as good as the pixel 2 which can't be right surely?\n\nAny help would be great.\n\nThanks,\nJohn",
