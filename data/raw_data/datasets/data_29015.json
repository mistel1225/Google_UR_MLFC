    "title": "Pixel XL is stuck in a boot loop. Unable to boot up in safe mode or recovery. This worked for me.",
    "content": "This is not a question about what can I do. I tried everything from multiple forums. I don't think anyone has the answer to this problem. But if you're like me and you just took some once-in-a-lifetime photos, then grasping at this straw, like I did, might work for you. \n\nLet the boot loop run until your device dies. Take your USB charger and connect your phone to a laptop. And that's it. My XL booted up regularly and I was able to back up my photos.\n\nNotes:\n-Several days before my phone stopped charging normally. If I was charging while it was off I would get a picture of giant battery with the lightning symbol on it. Never happened before.\n-If my phone was on it would charge very slowly or not at all.\n-An app or update did not cause my boot problems\n-My phone was in and out of the water the day before. Used normally for the next 24 hours.\n-30 min and counting with my phone hooked up to the laptop and it hasn't charged a single percent.\n-I have a very slight burned in image of the internet navigation bar at the top of my phone. I was looking at a web-page when I turned my phone off and this mess started.",
