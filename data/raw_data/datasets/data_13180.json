    "title": "Support ticket stuck with a supervisor who stopped responding to me despite multiple followups.",
    "content": "I'm experiencing a number of issues despite no physical damage to the phone. Sometimes it restarts randomly, and it often disconnects from mobile data and/or wifi connection. The problem has persisted for a month now and I've both gone to the authorised service center and pursued help with the support staff via email. Now my support ticket is live but no one has responded to me in almost a MONTH! This is unacceptable, and I'm really disappointed in the level of service and the product itself. I don't want to switch phones because I bought this only a few months ago, but at this point I'm so fed up!!!",
