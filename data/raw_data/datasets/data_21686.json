    "content": "I have been issuing my Pixel 3XL for more than a year alongside the iPhone 7 and i have noticed that most photos taken by the pixel in any incandescent (soft, yellow) light or with anything that has yellow or red colour are saturated with yellow colour.\nFollowing serval tests Apple doesn't seem to have this problem and generally has more realistic colours. \nTests were done and photos displayed on both phones and Apple has less yellow.\nMy wife uses iPhone xs so I tried this one with the same result.\nIt seems that \"Auto\" filter removes the yellow saturation, so why isn't camera reducing it?",
