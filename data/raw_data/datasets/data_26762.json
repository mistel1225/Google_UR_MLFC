    "title": "4 days out of warranty the bottom speaker on my pixel 3 fails. Common problem and they won’t fix it.",
    "content": "I was told by support they would cover it and now after a week of slow responses(over 3 days to respond to my message telling them my address and phone number to start the warranty process) while my phone is broken then they refuse to start the rma process. I ordered on launch day and paid full price. I’m now typing this on my iPhone 11 Pro. I’ve been an Android user since Honeycomb(2011) and only bought Android devices since then. The Pixel 3 was the end of that.",
