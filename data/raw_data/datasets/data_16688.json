    "content": "I updated to Android 11 on Pixel 3a and since then the media controls have stopped showing on the lock screen. Restarting the phone fixes the issue for a few hours but the controls disappear from lock screen again over time. The issue is not specific to a media player. Checked with Spotify and Google Podcasts.",
