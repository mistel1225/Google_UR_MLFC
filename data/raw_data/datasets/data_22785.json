    "title": "\"white wash\" on top & bottom of screen with dark wallpaper",
    "content": "I started noticing a green-ish gradient on the top and bottom of my homescreen when using a dark/black wallpaper.  It wasn't there initially; then it started showing up on day 4 of using my phone.  It only happens while on homescreen, it doesn't show while I'm using other apps.  I've tried restarting, turning off developer options and doing a factory reset but no luck.  It's annoying and looks ugly...I don't think it's a \"feature\" since it wasn't there two days ago.See picture attached.",
