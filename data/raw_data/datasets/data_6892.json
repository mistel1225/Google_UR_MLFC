    "title": "Pixel 3 battery failure twice in 26 months",
    "content": "My Pixel 3 is 26 months old. After 14 months the battery was bulging. UBREAKIFIX replaced it with an original Google battery. Now, 12 months later, the replacement battery has been bulging and had to be replaced again. Two UBREAKIFIX technicians independently told me that the root cause of the failures could be that I keep the phone most of the time on a Pixel stand. This could cause overcharging and battery failure. I find it hard to believe that the Pixel stand should cause battery failures. Surely, there must be built-in functionality to prevent battery life reduction. Should I no longer use the Pixel stand or are these batteries simply poor quality?",
