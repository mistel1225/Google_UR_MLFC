    "content": "Before sunset the other night, I confirmed an issue regarding color accuracy of clouds and landscape on my Pixel 3a. When focusing on a particularly beautiful array of pink clouds, the camera could not pick up what I was clearly seeing. The clouds and sky had an orange tint, were less defined, and the greenery below was dark and also less defined.\n\nI notice that sometimes the camera looks to fall short of accuracy in full daylight when I shoot, but then the algorithm seems to correct and the output is great.\n\nThis was not the case here, as shown in the first pic below.\n\nHOWEVER, I stumbled upon a short-term fix, which indicated to me that there is an issue that might be resolved. \n\nThat fix was to point the camera at the ground, then raise it quickly and snap a shot before it could focus and washout the picture. It was the photographer's equivalent of taking shots like a quick-drawing, Wild West cowboy in a shootout outside the saloon. Not the best scenario for making a composition, or much else.\n\nThree result was the second photo below, a pretty decent shot considering the quick, sweeping action I had to make to take it, and much truer to what my eyes saw.\n\nCan anyone steer me towards a fix so I don't have to act like a outlaw at the ok corral when I want to take pics at sunset?",
