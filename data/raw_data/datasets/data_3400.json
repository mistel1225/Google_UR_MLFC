    "title": "Pixel 4a 5G:The Bluetooth keeps disconnecting to audio devices especially when wifi is on.",
    "content": "I am having this problem for quite some time now, I thought it will be solved in the recent update, but it did not. My Bluetooth keeps disconnecting and again connecting with audio devices which causes continuous interruption in the music or call voice over Bluetooth devices. I have noticed that it occurs more when the Wi-Fi is turned on. I have tried connecting multiple audio devices and the problem is the same on all.",
