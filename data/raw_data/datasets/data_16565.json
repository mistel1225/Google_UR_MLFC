    "title": "Why is India blatantly ignored for all android and pixel devices?",
    "content": "Why is that since Pixel 4 launch India has always been sidelined. There are just about as much active google fans in India as in any other country. We took the explanation of Project Soli to be the reason. Now again India is rejected for the pixel 5 launch, and android 11/ R is available everywhere except few countries like INDIA. WHY so much of hatred towards India?? I understand Google as a company is not so keen on user interest or market share as much as many other companies, since Google has a lot under its belts. But I don't think ignoring a market is a good way of going about it. I have been using google devices since the nexus days, and i have been stuck with pixel 3XL since long. Was eagerly waiting for 5, but now i am made to understand, thats a NO GO in INDIA. Sad.",
