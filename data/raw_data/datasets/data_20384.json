    "content": "A couple days ago I was going for a swim and I dropped my pixel 3a in the pools shallow end, I very quickly retrieved the phone but there were some ghost touches happening I decided to not touch it and let it dry by my towel. about half an hour later the screen was flashing the display but the phone was still operational, five minutes later the phone turned itself of when rebooted the ambient display works when phone is off, but the time and the notifications have a dark green tint too them. When unlocked with finger print it vibrates like normal ad then just displays a dark green screen.\n\nWhat can I do and is there a fix for this?",
