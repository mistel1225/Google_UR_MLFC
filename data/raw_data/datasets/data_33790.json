    "content": "My lock screen font suddenly changed from white to black and I can't see it now. I've tried changing my wallpaper to a different color scheme, even made it completely black, but the font won't change. I've played around in all of the display settings, but nothing changes it (apart from the \"high contrast text\" but that just gives the black text a white outline, and does it all throughout my phone, which I don't want).",
