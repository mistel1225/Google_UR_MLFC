    "title": "The in line audio controls function by themselves very often when listening to Spotify or YouTube",
    "content": "I listen to Spotify and watch YouTube videos a lot on my way to work and am experiencing a very annoying issue. \n\nI am using Sony headphones with the USB c adapter. The headset has a in line mic with controls. Very often while listening to Spotify the in line audio controls function on their own without me doing anything.\n\nFor instance the Google assistant is activated by itself, the songs get paused or skip to the next song all by themselves. These functions are usually only activated when I press the button on the built in microphone section of the headset. \n\nI can't determine if the issue is with my Sony headphones, the usb c adapter, or in Spotify. I highly doubt that the issue is with Spotify because I sometimes have the same issue while watching YouTube videos although not as often. \n\nSomeone please help me with this issue it's very very very annoying and I get very frustrated with this it. I don't know if I need to replace the adapter or the headphones. \n\nSide note I have used wireless headphones and the issue doesn't seem to happen at all. This issue is used to happen too on my pixel 2xl before I upgraded to my pixel 4xl. However it took a few days or maybe two weekends for the issue to arrow on my pixel 4xl. I don't want to use my Sony wireless headphones all the time as I travel on the subway to and from work and don't want them to possibly get stolen. \n\nThanks for taking the time to read this and any and all of help/suggestions would be appreciated 100%",
