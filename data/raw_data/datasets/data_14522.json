    "content": "Hi, \n\nI have Pixel 2XL running on Android 11 today. I purchased Boya by-mm1 shotgun mic to use with my video recording for external audio source. I am using 3.5mm (trrs) to type c (female) adapter however it doesn't seem to record any audio on the inbuilt camera app. I tried with opencamera app as well but the recording there with external mic is worse than mobile recording because this has a lot of noise. \n\nHas anyone encountered this issue as well? Can you please help me fix this? \n\nRegards,\nAshish",
