    "title": "When I receive an incoming call on my Pixel XL it rings once quietly then a female voice announces the caller and or number. Often I miss several calls because my phone is in my pocket which muffles the voice and ambient background noise makes it impossible. I have been attempting to turn off this call screening for 2 months. I have called Pixel support, Google Fi support, put phone in Safe Mode, (the auto screening stops Yeah! but resumes when phone resumes normal mode), explored various Accessibility apps and functions, Google Assistant, and explored numerous possibilities without success. My final option is probably back up everything and reset to factory specifications. HELP!",
