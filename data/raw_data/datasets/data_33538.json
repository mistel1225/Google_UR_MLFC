    "content": "For the past few weeks, I started getting an ARCore error when I attempt to use Google Maps. I did the latest update for ARCore and Maps and now I get that ARCore not working error every single time. Cleared cache, rebooting. Nothing. Checked on forums, nothing. I haven't done a hard reset yet. It's just a pain. Is this a known issue right now or am I a special snowflake?",
