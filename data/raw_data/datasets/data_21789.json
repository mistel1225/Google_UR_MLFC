    "content": "Since a few days my phone won't charge unless if I connect the (original) cable in 1 specific direction. It also doesn't detect a brand new (original) earphones. So I think the problem is with the phone, and not the accessories.\nOn top op that, the phone freezes on lock screen, even with a full battery. When I try turn it off by pressing on the power button for 30 seconds it switches off, but will only switch on if I connect it to the charger despite having enough charge in the battery. This happens a few times each day, and sometimes even during the night, so I'm terrified of missing my morning alarm. \nI've already done a factory reset, and removed recently installed apps, but neither of these measures fixed any of the problems unfortunately.",
