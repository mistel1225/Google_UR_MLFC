    "content": "So this morning I woke up to my phone turned off and when I powered it on i get the message,  \"Your device is corrupt. It can't be trusted and may not work properly\".     It's a red screen error.  I attached a picture of what I found out about it.\n\nWhen I press the power button again to continue it just goes to black screen and shuts off.  When I boot into bootloader mode and select Recovery Mode it will reboot and show the same error screen again.  So virtually it's a nice paper weight now.\n\nWhat happened overnight?  It was fine last night all I did is plug it in to charge and this happened sometime overnight.   Is there anything that can be done for it? I looked at a Rescue OTA, but it appears the phone needs to boot into recovery mode for that and it won't do that.\n\nAny ideas?  Thanks!",
