    "content": "Hi,\nI have been using the Pixel 5 for just 2 days and today I observed that my battery percentage got stuck while charging at 67% and plugging it again and restarting fixed it. Later on after a full charge, it was stuck at 100%. After multiple restarts it started showing the right value again. This keeps happening at times. Contacted the support and waiting for response. Anyone with similar issue? :\\",
