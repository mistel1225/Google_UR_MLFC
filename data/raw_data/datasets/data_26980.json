    "title": "Pixel 3 xl locking fingerprint sensor (too many tries) while in my pocket, should be disabled.",
    "content": "I have found several other threads but none with a solution. I keep my phone in my jeans front pocket, and Every time I remove it, the fingerprint sensor is locked for too many tries, forcing me to enter my complex password. Every other phone I've ever used with a fingerprint sensor (G3, g5, iPhone X, nexus, s7) disables it when the phone detects it is in a pocket or there is no light, is there a bug preventing the pixel from doing this?\n\nI'm on latest OTA.",
