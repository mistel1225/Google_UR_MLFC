    "content": "My pixel 3a failed on a long timelapse video. I had everything setup on tripod with an outdoor activity, ensured enough battery and video. Multiple times I checked in on the phone and while screen was dimmed, it said \"still recording\".  After a 1.5 hour activity, I stopped the recording. \nTime lapse setting was 10x\n\nFinal video was only 39 seconds (equivalent of 390 seconds or 6.5 minutes).\n\nAnother poster reported a time lapse issue as well, but it has now been locked from further responses.\n\nhttps://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/42743750?hl=en&msgid=42743750",
