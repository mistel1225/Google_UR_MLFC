    "content": "I have a Verizon Pixel 2. Is there any advantage to buying an unlocked 4a, from Google vs. the Verizon version, from Google. I think there is an e-sim issue, but I'm not sure if that would really effect my usage. Does an unlocked phone come with a sim card or do I use the card that's in my Pixel 2? I'm not very happy with Verizon's upgrade policies, so I would rather give Google the sale of a new phone, but I don't want to miss any possible features or benefits, by buying an unlocked unit.",
