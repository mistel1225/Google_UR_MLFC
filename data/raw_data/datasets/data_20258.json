    "content": "Have tried both Apple Airpods and a JBL bluetooth speaker and have had the same problem with both. Music will not play with Live Caption off and music cuts out when the screen times out. The symptoms go away when the phone is started in Safe Mode but that doesn't seem to be a viable fix in the long term. I could really use some help from Google to fix their phone's Bluetooth connection.\nThanks\nRuss Evans",
