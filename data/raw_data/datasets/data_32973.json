It wasn't a problem on my iPhone. \nI use my Pixel3 for work and am seriously considering reverting to apple, purely because of this issue. \nI reported this when I first got the phone but nothing has happened and nobody can help. \nWho doesn't use their phone for work? \nDoes anyone know anything about this matter that Google doesn't please?",
