    "content": "I am experiencing an issue on Android 10 where-in the icons on the home screen are intermittently unresponsive when dark mode is turned on. I have tried rebooting the device multiple times and even performed a factory reset, but the issue still persists.\n\nAs a workaround, I tried disabling dark mode and the issue doesn't seem to occur. I have posted a video link below which shows the issue in detail. Does anyone else face a similar fault?\n\nPixel 3 XL touch screen issue - YouTube",
