    "title": "Audio distortion is back (even at low volumes) on Pixel 3XL",
    "content": "From day 1, there was an issue with audio distortion.  Then, Google apparently issued a fix for it, but since the February 2019 update, the issue is back.  The issue is seen on any media from videos, audio, etc.  If listening to music from Google play music, the issue will show up. But if press pause, then play again, the issue goes away until skip to the next song.\nA restart seems to fix the issue temporarily, but it comes back.\nGiven that this device is $1K, I find it unacceptable for this to be happening.\nGoogle.  Please fix this.",
