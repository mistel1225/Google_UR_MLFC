    "title": "Phone was working fine with BT connection to car 2019 Veloster Turbo Ultimate (Android Auto/Apple Car Play) Bluetooth streaming, hands-free, messaging, all fine. After the March 2019 update, phone calls made or received hands-free connect and work for 10-20 seconds and then revert to the phone. The vehicle reports on the screen either \"conference\" call as if there were multiple parties just before drop (reporting call ended) or just call ended. The conversation can be continued on the phone and then 5-10 sec later the car offers to switch the call to hands free (from the car viewpoint it goes away and comes back). Car has had all BT devices removed and factory reset, and phone has had all BT devices removed and been reset. Pairing and streaming on BT works fine as it always has.
