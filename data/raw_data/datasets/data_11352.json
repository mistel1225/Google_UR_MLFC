    "content": "I don't know why, I've stopped all vibrations in phone settings, but still this pixel 4a vibrates for some apps, lets say when adding items in Amazon cart, or i button suggestions appear in youtube, or playing google play instant games. My Pixel 4a doesn't vibrate for call or notifications as the vibration settings applied, but these specific apps are still using vibration. Can anyone help?",
