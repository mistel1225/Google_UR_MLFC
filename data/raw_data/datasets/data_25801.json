    "content": "After updating to Android 10, the sound stopped working with incoming mobile calls.  the sound when calling via Skype or Viber works well.  I donâ€™t hear when they call me.  How to fix it?  please tell me.  I already tried a complete reset and it did not help.  during the conversation I hear the interlocutor well and he hears me too.  the only problem is that there is no ringtone for an incoming call.  I tried to start the phone in safe mode but the problem did not change.\nwhen the default phone language is English (United States), the sounds work correctly when I call, but when I select a different language as a result the ringtone sound disappears",
