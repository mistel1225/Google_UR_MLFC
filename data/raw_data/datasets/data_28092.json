    "title": "Overheating message but the phone is cold",
    "content": "After using a camera for about 3 minutes recording a video I got a message saying device is too hot and it will affect the video quality. I've talked to Google support, I have factory reset my phone which is only a few days old, I've tried using my phone in safe mode and the error keeps showing up. The problem is the phone doesn't feel any warmer and I even did a temperature test. My phone in idle mode is 36 c and after recording a video for a few minutes the phone reaches 40 c and anytime the temperature goes over 40 c it gives me that error again and again.",
