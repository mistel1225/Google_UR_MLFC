    "content": "Sometimes, when I use the Phone app to make a call, it will show the calling screen but actually won't make a call. Only after I end the call and redial does the phone app actually make a phone call.\n\nI don't know if this is something to do with my Pixel 3, or if it's a common Pixel 3 problem, or if it's an Android related issue. \n\nAny suggestions would be helpful.\nThanks.",
