    "title": "How come my Pixel 2 battery is draining?",
    "content": "I find that after charging my Pixel 2up to 100%, that in only 1.5hrs, it's drained 15% of it's battery, even when I barely used it. I only used a few messaging apps, and nothing seems to be restrictive on the battery life. I haven't tried Safe Mode yet, but, I am willing to try that. I've also figured on getting the battery replaced, but I've seen other posts stating how it doesn't seem to change anything,",
