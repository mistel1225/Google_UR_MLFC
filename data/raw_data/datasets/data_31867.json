    "content": "Pixel 2XL.  All of a sudden folks couldn't hear me at the beginning of the calls, both incoming and outgoing.  But google assistant works fine.  A few weeks later my phone also started to shutdown when I plugged in the charger.  I have to turn it back on everytime I plug in the charger.  Neither issue has improved.  I can hear people on calls 1 out of 10 times.",
