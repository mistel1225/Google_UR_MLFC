    "content": "Everything was working fine since 2 weeks back. Quite sudden the touch screen lost its sensitivity ( I haven't done any changes or updated anything.) \n\nIssue:\nThe tap is not working. I had to press long for detecting a touch. So when long press is needed I cannot do it as it is taking as a single tap.\nAlso scrolling, pinching etc has issue. \n The phone its pretty new and did'nt use much.\n\nPhone Model is Google Pixel 3XL\nTried:\nTurning off developer mode\nRestarting\nBooting in Safe mode\nFactory reset.\n\nBut the issue still persist.  The phone has warranty. \nBut due to the current social lockdown and lack of online services we are unable to do it. (I brought it through Amazon.ae, and I am currently in India)  Kindly help . Appreciate you valuable reply.",
