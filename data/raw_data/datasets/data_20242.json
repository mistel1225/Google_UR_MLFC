    "content": "I have a pixel 2 which has been switched off for the best part of 2 years. I've charged it and factory reset it. As it's been off, it's still on Android 8. I got a 'System update available' message and I have clicked it to download and install Android 10. For the last several hours it's been displaying \"Downloading system update .... 0% of 1.28GB.\nIt's fully charged and connected to wifi.\nWhat do I need to do to get the download and installation?",
