    "title": "Looking for a Call Blocker solution for my Pixel 3",
    "content": "When I got my first Android Smartphone I installed a program called Call Control to block known spammers callers in their database and to block calls I add to my black list.  The app worked pretty good on older phones but on my Pixel 3 not so good.  To block calls on your phone Call Control requires that it be the default dialer.  With the integration of contacts and voicemail withing the default Google dialer I want it to be the default which makes call control pretty much worthless.  Is there a call blocker that doesn't require that it be the default dialer that works well on the Pixel 3?  If there is none that will block the call outright, is there an app that will at least identify known spammers as the call comes in so you can disregard the call and then blacklisted yourself?  I was hoping that Verizon's call blocking app would work but when I go out to the store the app doesn't even show up to download and I've been told it doesn't even work with the Pixel 3 that's why it's not available to download from the store.\n\nIf anyone has any idea's or solutions let me know.  Thanks.",
