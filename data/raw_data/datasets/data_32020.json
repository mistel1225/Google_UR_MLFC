    "content": "I've had a lot of problems with my phone over the last year. First my finger print scanner has completely vanished from my phone which I can live without, second my battery drains rediculoisly amount all the time I will have backing light reduced, power saver on,night light on after 8, deleted apps and I will hardly use it.\nFor example I will charge it before bed (as to not charge over night and damage it) go sleep on 98% power save and when I wake up it is on 50%.\n\nI don't then have enough battery for the day ahead when my phone is needed to actually get in touch with people at work or people looking after my children. \n\nI've factory reset and still nothing. Any help would be great",
