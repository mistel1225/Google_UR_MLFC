    "content": "The personal google account I used has been disabled. I created it when I purchased my Google Pixel 4 and was only logged onto that email on that device. I used the email/account on other devices such as my Mac or Samsung phone (I had to file a warranty claim on my Pixel, that's when issues started happening) so I switched to my Samsung temporarily while I await my phone. I wake up yesterday morning and it is disabled. I spend all day trying to recover and get ahold of someone. I am emailed a response saying \n\n\"Hello Google user,\nThank you for your report. We only restore access to a disabled Google Account if the request is made within a relatively short period of time. Unfortunately, your account can no longer be recovered. However, you can create a new Google Account by visiting this page.\nBest,\nThe Google Accounts Team\n\nThis can't be possible because this all happened in the course of a day, April 26th. I filed my warranty claim for my Pixel, which they send the shipping label to my now disabled account, on the 25th. I have been active on this email and can prove it is me but am receiving no support from an actual human being on the issue. I have no other troubleshooting/recovery options other than putting in a secondary email for potential contact. Please, I am begging, help me recover my account. It has very important data/pictures on it I care about. I went through the recovery steps, I am looking for help from a human being.",
