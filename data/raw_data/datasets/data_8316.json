    "content": "Having difficulties accessing text message content. Can read the preview, but when I try to access the message content proper, nothing displays. Have to restart the phone to read content, but after a short while the text message content disappears again. Some messages are also not being received until the phone is restarted, and some messages fail to send. Incredibly frustrating for a small business owner!",
