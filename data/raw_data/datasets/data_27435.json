    "content": "My Pixel 2, 64 gb, starts acting weird everytime there is a system update available. \n\nThe Wifi and Mobile Network are disabled. I can't turn them back on. The Wifi switch just slides back to off position. \n\nThis is annoying because I can't back up anything. I can't download the update to install it. \n\nIt happened 3 times now. This is the 3rd time. \n\nWhen I restart the phone, then it starts acting very sluggish. The phone responds very slowly. Still the wifi and mobile network remain disabled.\n\nI restarted it in safe mode, reset network settings, did a factory reset,  but the problem remains the same.\n\nSomehow it starts working again after 5-6 hrs. But this time it didn't. ",
