    "content": "I just got the Pixel 3 XL on and after the second day of use I noticed that Google Assistant turns on and off in a glitching manner. I removed my screen protector, increased the sensitivity for squeeze activation and restarted the phone but this seems to appear randomly. Has anyone experienced this issue? If so, I'd appreciate any trouble shooting suggestions.",
