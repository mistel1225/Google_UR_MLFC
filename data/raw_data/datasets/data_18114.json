    "content": "We use a Google Pixel 4XL for our work phone. We are a plumbing service company. Yesterday, a customer called and I got them on our schedule with no issues. Today, they call back with a question from the same number and it pops up as spam, thus, getting blocked and hung up on, which causes it to roll over to our answering service, luckily. Another customer who calls regularly, calls yesterday and it, too, was blocked as spam, even though they call regularly, as in weekly. Why are mobile numbers starting to pop up as spam all of a sudden that were not spam before?",
