    "content": "I had given my phone on 18th of October. It’s a pixel 3. The back glass had scratches and battery was draining heavily. Gave my phone to B2X google’s official service centre and they did not even bother to call the customer and tell them it’s gonna take more time. Rather I received a mail saying I will get by phone by 28th of October but again, they misleaded  plus they do not have their contact so that costumers can call.",
