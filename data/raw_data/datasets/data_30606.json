    "title": "Pixel XL drops from 5 bars to 0 when making call using a Cell booster",
    "content": "I have installed a cell phone signal booster (AT&T) in my pole barn.  My wife's Pixel 3a sees 5 bars and can make calls.  I can see 5 bars and use data, but when I try to make a call, it immediately drops to 0 bars and the call fails.   I  hang up and after about a minute the bars come back and go away when I make a call.",
