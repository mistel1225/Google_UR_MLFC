    "content": "The QR code scanner on my pixel 5 is terribly slow to pick up any code it sees. \nIn a world filled with having to scan QR codes any time you enter a venue for a drink or a meal etc (thanks covid), it is very frustrating for all including the people behind me waiting to do the same thing.\n\nCan anyone help me with this? \n\nI had a pixel 2 prior to having the pixel 5. The pixel 2, I found, was much better..",
