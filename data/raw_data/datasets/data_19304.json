    "content": "I have spent a good amount of time with my IT dept trying to get the Mobileiron email (Mail+) and the Docs@work apps working and no matter what settings or permissions allow I cannot get it to open attachments. \n\nWork requires me to use Mobileiron but when I try to open an email attachment I get nothing. In the email attachment I can click it but it just says downloading and brings me to a plain white screen.  \n\nWhen I go looking for the downloaded attachment I can find it though it is oddly located in the DCIM/Camera folder and when I try to open the file (.pdf/.png) it says that I cannot preview the file and then it gives me a list of two programs to \"open with\" but the programs don't even make sense and I have adobe acrobat app on there which I would assume would work but it will not give me that option. \n\nPlease help. I really, really don't want to switch to an Iphone for work but I need to be able to view attachments on my phone.",
