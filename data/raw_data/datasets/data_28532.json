    "content": "According to this Google blog post from August 12, 2019, the ability to log in to passwords.google.com by using just a fingerprint (without needing to enter a password) is \"available today on Pixel devices\". I have a Pixel 3a running Android 9 with the August 1 2019 security patch, Chrome 76.0.3809.11, and all apps in the Play Store are up-to-date. What do I need to do to get this feature working?",
