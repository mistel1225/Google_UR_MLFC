    "content": "Pixel 3a updated to 11 with the security update has issues that are frustrating me. The top bar on the screen that you pull down randomly goes down with a lot of frequency without me even touching the phone but even more if I am using the phone. A few days ago, it was very difficult for the bar to get pulled down at all. I have restarted and done a full shut down.",
