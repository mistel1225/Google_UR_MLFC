    "content": "Hello All,\n\nI have a problem with proximity sensor.\nI'm using Pixel 2XL.\nWherever I make a call or listen to a voice message from any app, my screen goes to black, even the power button doesn't work.\nThe only thing that help is to press really hard on the screen in the upper speaker.\nIs there anyway to disable the proximity sensor? The always on or double tap to wake don't work also because of this issue.\nI already tried restoring the phone to default and erasing everything twice.",
