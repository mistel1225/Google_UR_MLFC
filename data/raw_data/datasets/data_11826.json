    "content": "I'm on the Google Fi network & switched from a Pixel 2xl to Pixel 5 and I have worse cell data now in a building that I had 4g in before. The Pixel 5 only gets a H+ where my Pixel 2xl had 4g. I've checked the Google Fi coverage map and it's a 5G area. Any help or suggestions? The pictures are the network/data settings. I already figured out that Battery Saver mode disables 5G. I don't know what else to do. ",
