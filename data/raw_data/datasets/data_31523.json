    "content": "Hi there. I'm getting the dreaded speaker buzz when I play music, particularly ambient music with heavy bass parts. I've just got the phone so thinking of returning it for a trusty S10 as I see it's a fairly common fault. Unless there's a simple fix? I've tried installing latest updates, factory reset, safe mode, etc etc. Fairly astonished they haven't recalled units if this is as widespread as it seems! Oh well.",
