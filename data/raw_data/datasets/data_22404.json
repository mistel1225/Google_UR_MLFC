    "content": "Only certain contacts are showing in the messages app.\n\nOn the message list screen, some contacts show up as just a phone number.\nWhen viewing the conversation, only the phone number is listed at the top, however, the image next to their texts has their initials.\nWhen clicking on details, and then their number, it takes me to their fully filled out contact details.\nIt happens in certain group conversations as well. However, their names are shown above each individual message, but not in the message list or at the top of the conversation.\nContacts that are shown and ones that are not are all saved to the same google account\n\nThings I have tried to solve the issue, none of which worked:\nClearing the messages app cache\nUninstalling messages app updates\nForce stopping the messages app\nRe-entering contact details\nRemoving other google accounts from the phone\nForcing stopping the contacts app\nClearing the contacts app cache\nHow can I fix this issue? This is only a month old phone and it has been like this since I set it up.",
