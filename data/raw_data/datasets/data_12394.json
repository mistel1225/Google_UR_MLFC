    "content": "I heard that google disabled 5g in China mainland, including all carriers. \nYou know that pixel phones don't sell in China officially, so in China if you want to use a pixel phone, you have to experice a very complex and difficult period. In other words, in China, a man who use a pixel phone must be a very loyal Google fan. But why Google do this to harm their heart.\nI'm a loyal Google fan. And I feel very sad. Pixel 5 support n78 and my carrier is using n78 5g, but I cannot use 5g in China. Please don't do things like this.\nWhat I love Google most is the famous sentence: don't be evil. I hope Google can insist this.",
