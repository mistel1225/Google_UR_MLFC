    "title": "Pixel 4 GPS Issue - GPS puts me all over the country - The phone travels upwards of 17K miles a day!",
    "content": "Most of my location based apps have me in the incorrect location.  I have to open google maps to force the phone to realize that I'm where I am.  It takes a few seconds for the phone to realize that I'm not in Florida, Arizona, Texas, Pennsylvania (all places that I've spent time in the last few months) - then put me where I am actually at.  Then I have to re-start the other apps to get them to recognize the new location.\n\nI have screenshots of my location history traveling over 17k miles every day from the GPS error.\n\nI've called tech support, and they say I need to take it in to a service center and they will attempt to repair the phone but they are not replacing Pixel 4 phones and repair is the only option that they will be able to offer me.  She would not even discuss going through the settings, checking things, or even admitting that the phone was faulty - just take it in if you think it's broken.\n\nI've tried turning on and off wifi and bluetooth scanning with no luck.\nWifi scanning is currently on and bluetooth scanning is currently off.  Use location is on.\n\nAnyways, recommendations?  I work 70+ hours a week and I don't have the time to sit in a repair shop while someone breaks open my phone to perform surgery and I get it back still broken because they don't offer replacements.",
