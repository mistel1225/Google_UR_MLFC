    "title": "Recording 2-Way Phone Calls",
    "content": "Google have recently blocked the ability to 2-way record phone calls on their devices through 3rd party apps, and Google Voice only allows you to record phone calls one way (I can't remember if its outgoing or incoming, but either way its so impractical it is of no use). I have to be able to record both voice in my phone calls by law for my company, so there must be a way for me to do this, otherwise there is a significant legal clash. What can I do to fix this. I have been struggling to find a solution for this. \n\nThanks for any responses.",
