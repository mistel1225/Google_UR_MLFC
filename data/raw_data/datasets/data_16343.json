    "content": "Hi, I need to purchase a new phone and I'm trying to figure out which Pixel models will work with an external audio source or microphone. \n\nDoes recording an external microphone, or other audio source, work in the native Camera app? \n\nIf anyone has information related to which technical specifications that I should be looking for, it would be greatly appreciated. The only way I can figure out to test this, is just buying a phone and testing it myself, I can't find any information that lists whether or not this would work or how. \n\nIf anyone can help I will Paypal you money for any assistance",
