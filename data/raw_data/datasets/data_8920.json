    "title": "Why does Google support (for my Pixel 4a) stop replying when the only option left is to refund me?",
    "content": "I have purchased a new Pixel 4a phone, and within the first week I had so much problems with it that after being patient trying safe mode, reset factory etc.. for more than a week, google decided to replace it with a refurbished model, which started another cycle of safe mode, reset, ans ended up not much better, so I asked for a refund and support went dead, asking for a screen shot of my Purchase history, because for some reason they do not have access to their own CS system... and went dead again, no more replying to my emails. Why is that? Just make sure enough time pass so you will not accept any refund or return. The problems started as soon as I started to use the phone (not a single scratch on it), please explain.",
