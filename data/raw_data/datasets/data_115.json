    "content": "Hi, just got a new pixel 4a. Noticed that with the Wifi Calling enabled (Wifi over mobile network), incoming calls do not ring on the phone, they ring for the other person calling me and at the end of the ring, it shows up as a missed call notification on the pixel. With Wifi calling option set to mobile network over wifi, this problem goes away, same with wifi calling turned off. I have checked multiple wifi networks and the same thing persists. Any pointers if this is a sim issue or something on the phone?",
