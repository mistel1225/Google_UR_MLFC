    "title": "Pixel Stand intermittent not charging",
    "content": "Bought a brand new Pixel Stand and when placing my Pixel 3XL on the stand it only recognizes and begins charging about 50% of the time. Alignment, case, different wall outlet make no difference. I returned it to Amazon and received another with the exact same issue. However in both cases, plugging in the Pixel Stand to a different cable and power block resolves the issue, and it works fine. So confused.",
