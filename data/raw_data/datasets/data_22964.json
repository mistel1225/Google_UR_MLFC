    "content": "My pixel 2 was working good but yesterday I left battery drop to phone to power off, then tried to charge it but it didn't work, I had some luck charging it turned off but very irregular, could get like 70%. I read from other post that safe mode is good to know what is causing it, I used safe mode but intermediately after plugin the charger,   phone restarts. Anyone having same trouble?. \nI recently updated to Android 10,  \nI also see that when I close recent apps they still appearing again and again even in safe mode. \n\nOf course I tried different chargers, cables, power source etc. I'm almost sure it is a software issue (probably the system)\n\nThanks for your help",
