    "title": "Pixel 4 XL microphone. Typing lags, without saying Google Assistant comes on anyways. I see others?",
    "content": "I have not found a solution for the microphone issue. Noticed a second situation I have not read in the posts here, that is? The times the microphone is slow responding while typing, those times I notice without even saying hey Google!! It will pop up. She pops up when I'm on the phone, she pops up when I'm just sitting reading a book. I was taking a shower and singing when I heard my phone say, \"I'll get that \". I got out of the shower and that screen was full of ads for showers, music. So either the microphone lags in typing. Or it works too good with the assistant. I wanted to get into this conversation to see if I could find some answers. Thank you very much everyone have a great day. I appreciate this community. My name is Louis",
