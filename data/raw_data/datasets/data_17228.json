    "content": "Yesterday I during the afternoon my phone started showing up a notification that reads \"analogue audio accessory detected. The attached device is not compatible with this phone\". I was not using earphones nor trying to charge the device (Pixel 3a) at that moment.\n\nWhen I got back home and tried to charge it with the original charger it just won't work and instead would only work with a different cable in a certain position. I tried the charger with other devices and it did work.\n\nAny ideas on how to solve this issue? Any response will be much appreciated.",
