    "content": "This problem was recently posted again despite the subject being \"locked.\"  I believe the most likely cause for this is \"gunk\" in the USB connector of the Pixel phone (those with USB-C).  The wrong audio cable advice given by some here doesn't make sense when the problem is related to the phone not charging.  Dirt in the connector will prevent the phone from charging.\n\nOthers have several methods for cleaning out the USB-C connector.  I use a bent staple.  I wish there were better ways to clean it.  I keep my Pixel in my pocket and I've had to clean the USB-C port twice.  Both times solving a problem.",
