    "content": "Got a pixel 4 in January 2020, it work wonderfully for a couple weeks and then all of a sudden, I can't answer incoming calls, it rings but the call screen doesn't show up. I put it in safe mood, I factory reset.. none of it work. Took my phone to my phone provider to get fix...loner phone (not a Google phone) can answer calls. Go back to pick up my phone, said they couldn't fix it, so I got a new replacement Google pixel 4 phone...still can't answer incoming calls!?!",
