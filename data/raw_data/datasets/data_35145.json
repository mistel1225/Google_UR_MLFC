    "content": "I really like the feature that allows me to pin a score to my home screen. I follow a few teams (Saints, Maple Leafs) and generally, Google is good about pushing a score notification which gives me the option to pin it to my home screen. \n\nThe last few NHL games however, the option to pin the score has not been available in the banner notification. I tried to go into the Sports app to figure it out, but I can't find an option to pin a score from there either. I looked online to no avail.",
