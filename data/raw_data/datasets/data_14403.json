    "title": "Notifications and calls are going to my watch and not phone. Phone no longer rings or vibrates.",
    "content": "I have a Google pixel 3a and a Garmin Forerunner 935 watch.  Since I got the watch my watch would display my notifications and display that I got a call and so would the phone. As in, if I picked up my phone, the lock screen would show my recent notifications and once unlocked, if you swipe down you see your notifications.  Also, if someone called my phone would ring and display an \"answer phone call\" screen.  \n\nAbout 6 days ago the phone stopped doing any of those things. It's as if my watch is auto dismissing everything?  No notifications show up in notification list.  My phone calls don't make the phone ring.  All that happens is my watch vibrates and says \"you're receiving a call\" and asks if I want to answer it.  The only way to answer a call now is with my watch!\n\nI have confirmed that my notification settings are normal, my phone volume is not off.  Vibrate is not off.",
