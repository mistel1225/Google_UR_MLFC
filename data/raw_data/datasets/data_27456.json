    "title": "Incorrect number of missed call notifications",
    "content": "Whenever I miss \"1\" actual call, my notification tells me I actually missed 5 calls, one time last week it said I had 20 missed calls, but when I checked the actual call logs I only found 1 recent missed call. It seems that the process of \"clearing\" missed calls isnt working as it should and therefore they are continuing to add up. I went back a couple of months to see if anything wasn't \"cleared\" or \"pressed on\" but didnt see anything highlighted. \n\nI have a pixel 3a XL with os version 10\n\nCan anyone help?\n\nThank you!",
