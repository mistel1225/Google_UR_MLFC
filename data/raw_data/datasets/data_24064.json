    "content": "Using a Pixel 4xl.  Since the nav buttons are gone, when in the main screen of messages when swiping to go back to the home screen if you aren't far enough to the edge when you start your swipe it removes a text thread.  If you're fast enough you can undo.  Is there a way to prevent swipe from removing a thread, or better yet a better option to go back to the previous screen other than the swipe from edge, which is good in theory but has some bad unexpected consequences.",
