    "content": "In the last month, voice calls are not possible to just one contact, my wife, on her iPhone or our landline. I apparently get connected, she can hear me, I can't hear her, same if she initiates the call. I've tried restarting the Pixel 3, clearing cache in Phone, no success. I've tried deleting her as a contact on the Pixel and entering again, deleting me as a contact on her iPhone and entering again, no success. In recent times I've initiated successful two-way phone calls with a brother, a travel agent, a bathroom contractor, a pension company, and no problem. I've received calls from some of these and my GP, and no problem. Sending a SMS text to my wife works fine. Help!",
