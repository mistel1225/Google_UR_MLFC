    "content": "Hey guys,\n\nmy Google Pixel 3a XL has always shown me my upcoming calendar events on my always on display and on the lock screen. It's like in this screenshot: https://imgur.com/a/1jFePUM\n\nIn \"At a glance\" there are calendar events enabled and my Pixel shows me my events on my home screen as normal. But when enabled it should show my events on lock screen, AOD and home screen, right?\n\nA strange issue, does someone have the same problem and knows how to fix this?",
