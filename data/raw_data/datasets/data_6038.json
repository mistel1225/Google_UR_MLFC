    "content": "Is there a way to disable volume warning. I dismiss it but after 5-6hrs it drops volume suddenly and have to manually turn up volume and dismiss warning again.  I like to plug speakers in for white noise while I sleep but the sudden drop in volume wakes me up, defeating the purpose of white noise on speaker",
