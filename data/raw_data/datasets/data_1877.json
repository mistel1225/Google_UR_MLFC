    "content": "I have a problem with my phone (Pixel 4a). My screen isn't working, i can only see some pixel on the top right corner light up intermittently, everything e√≤lse is black. I know the phone isn't broken because it receives calls and an alarm rang, but eve touch screen doesn't work.\nI tried every link to contact support but everyone seem a loop hole to bring you back to one another and i now this is supposed to get people to solve issues by themselves but it made it impossible to really get in contact. I even got to this page https://store.google.com/repair where i put my IMEI number but the links to contact support just redirect you to self help pages.",
