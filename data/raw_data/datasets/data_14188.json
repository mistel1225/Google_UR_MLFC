    "content": "So my phone is stuck on 17% battery. Tried different chargers. Tried even factory reset. The phone was registered to android beta testing as well. I removed myself from the beta testing since the problem started, but no update was issued to downgrade the phone back to stable version. I already tried hard reset, what is the next step? When will I get the downgrade update from google? The problem showed up yesterday.",
