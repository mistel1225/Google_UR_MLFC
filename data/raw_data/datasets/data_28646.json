    "content": "GPS is dead offline, whilst on airplane mode. Diagnosed with GPS tools; it is shut down even with location on, when no wifi. (Works fine with wifi.) Verizon says GPS won't work on any phone without data. But my Galaxy S7 could--used it outside US all the time--and there are many offline GPS apps specifically for the Pixel 3. I downloaded offline Google Maps, which I can see, but no location. Android v9. What gives?",
