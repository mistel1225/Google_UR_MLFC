    "title": "Pixel 2 XL fails setup of other devices in multiple apps",
    "content": "I have a problem where the Pixel 2 XL will fail setup for Google and Amazon devices through their apps, with errors like \"Something went wrong.\" etc. Both times I've had to dig up my old Galaxy Note 4 out of a drawer, use the apps on it, and then it would work. The first time it happened was setting up Google WiFi devices, the second Amazon Alexa/Echo devices.\n\nWhat could possibly be causing this? Clearly there's an issue with the Pixel 2 XL itself, as the Note 4 has zero issue and works flawlessly the first time.",
