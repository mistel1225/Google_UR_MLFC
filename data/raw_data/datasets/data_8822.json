    "content": "Hi, my name is Fabio and I got a Pixel 3, however, something happened to my phone and I canÂ´t turning on. before that I was chatting and suddenly it showed me a message like this: \"Your device is corrupt. It can't be trusted.. \" and turned off. I've already tried the fixes that you suggest, like rebooting to safe mode but nothing is working. I really appreciate your help",
