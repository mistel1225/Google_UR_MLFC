    "content": "Google Voice recognition accuracy seems to have been reduced. Even though I have my voice trained to me, it still responds to other male voices. \n\nI've retrained my voice and it still responds to other male voices. \n\nIt used to be that it would only occasionally respond to voices that were roughly similar to mine rarely, but now it's just all the time. \n\nThis started to occur about a month or more ago.",
