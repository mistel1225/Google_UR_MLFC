    "title": "June 2019 update has hurt my Pixel 2XL",
    "content": "After the June update (installed Saturday morning I think), my phone will no longer recognize that it has a fingerprint scanner. To make matters worse, there is a very noticeable and very frustrating stutter in its performance (specifically while typing but other activities demonstrate it as well).\n\nI have attempted the safe mode restart, the factory reset, and trimming things off of the storage. I have also switched from the SwiftKey keyboard that I was using and it hasn't helped anything either.\n\nNothing has worked. Help me please!\n\nIs it possible to select the prior version (pre-June update) and just roll with that until a stable version becomes available?\n\nThank you, \nBruce",
