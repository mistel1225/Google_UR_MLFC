    "content": "My xiaomi phone has LED for charging and will turn off when it's full charged but my pixel 4a has nothing, I don't want to overcharge it because I'm afraid it's gonna ruin the phone? Is this a myth ? Anyway is it possible to have LED or sound notification for when battery is full charged? Thanks",
