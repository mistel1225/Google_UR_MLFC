    "content": "Hello, I have a Google Pixel 3a that accidentally fell in water. I took it to a place to drain all the water that was inside and they told me that the phone will work but it will need a screen replacement because some components from the screen got damaged. I bought this phone in the USA and brought it to Latin America so there are not places around that can change my screen. I just need to know if it is safe  to buy from amazon or ebay and if it is worth it to ship all the components to my country. Should I give up and get another cell phone ? Any opinions? Thanks !",
