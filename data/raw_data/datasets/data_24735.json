    "content": "I updated my Pixel 3XL last night and have noticed that when my phone is charging on the Pixel Stand and it goes to the lock screen, notifications are not pinned under the clock like they used to be. If I am looking at my phone I can see a small preview of a message that has come in but then it fully disappears. I have to tap to get the unlock preview screen. Maybe this is considered a privacy update?!",
