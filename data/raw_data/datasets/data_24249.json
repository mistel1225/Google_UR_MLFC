    "content": "My pixel 3 started having the rebooting problem probably couple months ago then the problem becomes more often. \nIt all started out in an order. \n1. Rebooting/ restarting - show first google logo (possibly followed up by the second one)\n2. May or may not reach to the home page.\n3. Once it reaches the home page, the screen flashes and turns on power/on off option or open up your camera. \n4. Tried turning it off but unable to. On the same time, power button and volume down can't work. It shows up but once you pressed volume up or down, the whole rebooting loop starts again.",
