    "title": "For Pixel 3 XL Google Photos, how do I turn off the suggestion popups from Google Lens?",
    "content": "I am having an issue with popup icons on my Pixel 3 XL when I use Google Photos and I believe it's coming from Google Lens. Whenever I \"favorite\" a photo, I instantly get a \"order photo\" icon that appears in the lower center area of the photo and the icon also has a shopping cart next to it. I can close the popup by X-ing it, but as soon as I go back to this favorited photo, the \"order photo\" popup appears again. I will also get random popup suggestions like \"copy text from image\" or \"rotate photo\", etc. \n\nI don't want ANY popup suggestions for my photos and I cannot figure out how to turn these suggestions off completely and I cannot find any online support articles for this. If I want to take an action on a photo, I can do this independently and should not have to constantly close popup suggestions from Google Lens. Please help.",
