Managed to switch phone on 12 hours later by pressing on phone.battery logo came up with a question mark and stays stuck at to percent. Ran a diagnostic and it says the battery is not connected.i have factory reset the phone and tried differently chargers but 2 minutes after I disconnect my phone from the charger it switches off and doesn't switch back on without a lot of work.
