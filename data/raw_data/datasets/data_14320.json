    "content": "Is there anyway to have the recently used apps only appear when you pull the home button up and not appear on the home screen? Because I like what I already have in the drawer on my home screen and would prefer not having to look around for recently used apps.\n\nEdit: Let me rephrase this lol sorry. I know theres a setting for just the apps list, but it only shows me the same 5 apps and some of them I don't even use that much. So I guess my real question is how to get the apps to change. I apologise for the confusion.",
