    "content": "Hi guys,\n\nThe original charger and cable have stopped charging my phone and I have a constant notification saying Android System charging connected device USB the only way I can charge my phone is by activating the notification and changing the setting to charge this device. I have to do this each and every time I wish to charge my phone use Android Auto in my car, I have attempted reboots, cleaned the charger and port, tried other cables etc, I do not wish to do a factory reset at this time.\n\n I have also requested a callback from  Support five times in the last ten days and have not received a call.",
