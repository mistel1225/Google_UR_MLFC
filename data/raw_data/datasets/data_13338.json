    "content": "Phone frequently goes into black screen but still with power on.  Won't respond but will continue to function in the background.  Music may still be playing or casting to a screen will continue.  Nothing will \"wake up\" the phone.  Eventually need to hold power button for hard reset.  Happens in all situations.",
