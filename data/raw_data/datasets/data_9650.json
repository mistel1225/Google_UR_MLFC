    "content": "I have tested my phone on normal calls and when on speaker. I have tried multiple apps, and have tried with my phone case on and off. However the problem persists: if I call via speaker, I can hear the other person but they cannot hear me. I have muted and unmuted myself, but that doesn't work, so I think it is a manufacturing issue.",
