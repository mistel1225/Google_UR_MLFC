    "content": "I've tried deleting the app, changing the setting, all I have left to do is a complete factory reset but then I'll lose all my pictures. I can't click on the app icon on my phone but any time I add a new page to the home screen the same app icon is there. Sorry if the pictures don't make sense but it's the greetings app icon I can't click on it or change it and I already uninstalled the app.",
