    "content": "This widget like thing pops up whenever I get a notification and I can hold it down to see the messages from different apps or hold and drag down to the trash, but it just comes back up onto my screen whenever I get a new notification. I've been in the settings for the apps in the notification bubble thing and all over my pixel and can't figure out how to turn it off. Or at least control which apps give me the bubble notifications.",
