    "content": "My two-day old Pixel 3a XL randomly got shut down twice yesterday and on both occasions I did not even realise it had happened until I took it to check something and then I had to hard-set it to bring it to life! So frustrating experience to be honest. \n\nIs it just a software glitch or has it got anything to do with the hardware? I've seen so many compliments on online forums regarding the same for both Pixel 3a and 3a XL!",
