    "content": "Voice typing is very laggy on my Pixel 5. Sometimes it stops altogether, and only types the first word and then ignores everything else I say.\nIt is a similar issue to this thread: https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/18009311?hl=en but none of those solutions help.\nLive Caption is turned off\nI have never installed Swift Key\nThe problem persists whether I'm on wifi or not\n\nPreviously I used voice typing on my Pixel XL2 all the time and it worked great. Thanks for any help.",
