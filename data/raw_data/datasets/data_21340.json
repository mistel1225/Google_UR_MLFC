    "content": "Hello There,\n\nI'm really sad and disappointed to say that my Pixel 3 is having a connectivity issue for a couple of days now. The battery ran out and it turned off a couple of days ago. Then I charged it and switched it on, after that no connectivity at all. Nothing wrong with the sim card (I checked using another phone) and it shows no service. And no wifi connectivity either. It doesn't even search for wifi connections. When I try to make a call it says radio off and it is in the airplane mode. But I tried several times to switch the airplane mode on and off, still nothing. I even tried the factory reset, still doesn't work.\n\nThe same thing happened a couple of months ago after a software update. However, it recovered automatically by itself somehow when I checked after several hours. So this time also I tried leaving it idle for some time but it has been more than 3 days now. Still, nothing works. \n\nI really liked this phone and it ran smoothly. It is disappointing to see this issue. I tried to find any help online but couldn't. I appreciate your support on this.\n\nThanks,\nTJ",
