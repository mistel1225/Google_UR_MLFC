    "content": "If I use the voice command: \"take a screenshot\" when in landscape orientation, the saved image is stretched horizontally and flipped upside down. This does not occur in portrait orientation, or if I use the buttons to take the screenshot. The first attached image was taken using the voice command, and the second with the hardware buttons.",
