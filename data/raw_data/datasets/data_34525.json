    "content": "In the last couple of days, my Pixel 3 doesn't recognize the headphones. When I plug it, I get a notification saying 'charging connected device via USB'.\nHappens for both the google headphones that came with the device and older headphones connected through the adapter.\nChraging works fine, so it's not a buggy slot.\nI tried safe mode and resetting the device, but it didn't help.\nI've also tried switching to USB debugging mode.",
