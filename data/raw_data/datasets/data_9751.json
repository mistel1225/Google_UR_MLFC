    "content": "I previously had a Pixel 2 XL and was having an issue where all of a sudden the phone would say it was August 2000 and all of my connectivity would be gone. We replaced the sim card and it was still happening so per Verizon's guidance I replaced the phone with a new Pixel 4 XL. Unfortunately, the issue just started happening again with the new phone. Has anyone experienced this or know how to solve the issue?",
