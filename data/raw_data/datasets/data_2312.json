    "content": "After performing a hard reset as recommended by Google chat the phone opened with a Google calendar time and date at the top of the home screen. Previously I have removed this to make space for a widget that I much prefer. Chat has not been able to tell me how to remove this and I have not been able to figure out how I had removed it previously. If anybody knows how to do this I would be interested in getting directions to do so.",
