    "content": "My Pixel Phone (1) just stopped working a few days ago. It won't respond to anything I try, including activating Recovery Mode or Bootloader Restart. \n\nThe only response I get once in a while is the device trying to load the OS but that the the process dies and it's dead again.\n\nUntil that point the phone was fine and nothing that I can think about happened that might explain it.\n\nThx for your help!\nori.",
