    "content": "My wife has a Pixel 2 XL and I have a Pixel 3 XL. After the recent July update BOTH of us have noticed severe camera grain. We both use our phones everyday to take photos for our business and when we both complained to eachother we knew something was up.\n\nI've tried clearing cache/data on the camera app and tried different apps but the issue remains on BOTH phones.  Why all of a sudden would this occur?  The camera is the main reason we even have a mobile so we need to figure out why this is happening.",
