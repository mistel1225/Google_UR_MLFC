    "title": "Audio switching for ALL output gone?",
    "content": "With the new Android 11 update it seems the audio switching has become more complicated. It looks nice when dealing with media apps but it seems that now it's more complicated to switch ALL audio to a different device. I often have my phone connected to multiple Bluetooth devices and sometimes want to play audio over my speakers. I used to be able to toggle the volume and then tap to switch output to any source available even when not listening to a music app. For example Dolphin browser audio or audio from a game app etc. Now it seems only to give such an option for music apps. This is a regression in my opinion.",
