    "content": "So many issues since upgrading. Bringing up all open apps, Facebook Messenger doesn't work at all, screens don't respond. Text window doesn't bring up keyboard, etc. (you can assume I have done all basic troubleshooting that would normally fix things...former cell phone tech). Can we downgrade back to Android 10 until some of these bugs are worked out? So far I can only find about downgrading if you are using a Beta version, which I am not.",
