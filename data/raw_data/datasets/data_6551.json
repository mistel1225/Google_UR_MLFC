    "content": "My alarm on my phone is not going off as it should, I've seen other comments where others having similar problems have reported that clearing the storage and cache will fix this issue. I have tried this and yet it still doesn't work, not sure when this started exactly, but it is frustrating when your alarm doesn't wake you up in the morning.  Anyone (Google Support) know how to fix this problem?",
