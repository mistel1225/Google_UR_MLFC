    "content": "My phone out of nowhere, starting a few months ago, would keep shutting off my wifi and not being able to turn back on until I restart my phone a few times. I do not mean that I cannot connect to a certain network, I mean that I cannot turn on the option to use wifi. While this usually goes away, for the past 2 days no matter how many times I restart it won't turn on.",
