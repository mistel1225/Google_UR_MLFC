    "content": "Since the Android 11 update came for my Pixel 2, it hasn't been working at all. The internet is too slow to do any images in my email or Facebook, and my app games won't load at all. The internet pages just time out. The phone battery also decharges really fast and charges slowly, it also makes the phone hot. Basically, the only thing unaffected is the phone part. Seriously thinking of just getting a new phone because of this. Really unhappy as I liked it, and had no problems before this. I tried all the troubleshooting suggestions online.",
