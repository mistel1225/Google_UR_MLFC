    "content": "My phone is acting weird. I turn it on and it seems fine but after less than a minute it goes to the lock screen by itself (I am not touching anything at this point) and the lock screen is flashing.\n\nIt flashes the time and I can see the bar at the top as well as the back button but the lock screen itself is black, I cannot see the picture I have set as the background.\nI am unable to do anything at this point besides either power it off or restart it. Both of which I have done several times yet the problem still persists.\n\nThis wasn't a issue until just now, the phone was working perfectly fine all morning and evening yesterday until I looked over and saw it flashing. I did drop my phone from a normal table height over 24 hours ago but it has a good quality case and like I said, there were no issues until just now.\n\nAny suggestions? I am at a complete loss for what to do here.",
