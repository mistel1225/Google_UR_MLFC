    "content": "Hello,\n\nI have a google pixel 4a phone with two profiles, a personal profile and a work profile.\nI have a work google camera app and a work google photo app, as well as the standard (personal) google camera and google photo app.\n\nThe shortcut gesture of double tapping the power button to open the camera is brilliant, but it looses all its greatness under my work profile.\n\nWhen I double tap on the power button while using the phone under the work profile, it opens the standard personal google camera and saves pictures in the standard google photo app.\nI would like the gesture of double tapping power to open the work google camera app and store pictures in the work google photo app.\n\nThank you\n\nAntoine",
