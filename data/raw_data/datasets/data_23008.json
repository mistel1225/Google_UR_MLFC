    "content": "I used to be able to click on options when squeezing for Google Assistant. This minimal UI sucks! I don't always want to talk to it especially at work. Sharing screenshots was something I did often where I would squeeze my phone, click on 'Share Screenshot' and be able to share it ANYWHERE. Now I have to say 'share screenshot' out loud and it only shares to my contacts on messages and NOWHERE ELSE.\n\nThis was a terrible way to \"improve\" Google Assistant, and I hate the update! How can I get back the clickable options before and be able to share the screenshot to all apps like before?",
