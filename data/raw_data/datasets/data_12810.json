    "content": "I lost my pixel 3 with 614 contacts on it. When I import my contacts to my new pixel 5 only 65 contacts import. When I look at my import settings my phone gives me the option to select my old 3. Under that selection it shows my saved (614) contacts but when I go to restore them it only restores the 65. Why?",
