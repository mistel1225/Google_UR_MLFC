    "content": "Hi! Can you help me please:\nThe next 1-2 years I will live in another country(Italy), I have Pixel 3 with preferred care. If it will be mechanical breakdown or accidental damage, will I be able to send broken phone from another country(Spain) for repair in the US? Repaired/replaced phone can get my sister (lives in USA) and then send me to Italy.\nCould I send it off from the Italy? Would it have to be returned to USA?",
