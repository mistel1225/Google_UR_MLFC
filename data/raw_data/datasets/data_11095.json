    "content": "My phone's USB-C plug stopped working correctly. The phone doesn't recognize the adapter (USB-AUX) anymore. I can't plug wired headphones anymore and the battery life has also drastically decreased from one day to the next. I'm still in the warranty period but I can't find where to submit the claim. I've bought the device from Google store Germany (although I have currently moved to Belgium).\n\nIt's such BS that Google doesn't provide decent warranty support, covid or not, this is unacceptable!",
