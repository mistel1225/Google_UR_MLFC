    "content": "When my phone is locked and I have more than one notification, anything after the first just gets shrunk down to a small icon with no way for me to get a preview unless I swipe down from the top of unlock my phone so for example if I'm playing Spotify and I get a twitter message it just gets shrunk to a small envelope with no way for me to quickly see what the message says like I used to. I've included a screenshot to show what I mean",
