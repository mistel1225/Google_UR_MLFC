    "content": "I originally was trying to change from a simple 4 digit code to a proper password for my pixel 3 but I apparently misspelled the new password. I could still unlock my phone at that time with fingerprint but I couldn't fix the password. Then I tried using find my device to change my password but now thats ended up completely locking me out.\n\nDo I need to just reset my device or can I still access it? I don't think I had a recent backup so I guess I'd lose my data.",
