    "title": "\"silent\" mystery homescreen bar appears ranomly on home screen",
    "content": "there doesn't seem to be any useful function to this bar which is got an x on the far right. I noticed it after Android 11 update. I just get rid of it and it doesn't seem to affect operations when we're the other being on or off. Hpwevver I have noticed I've been missing calls sporadically one my phone has been right beside me expecting the call with the volume turned up to full on all counts and I don't know if this is the reason or another form going silent issue that's been reported in the community since Android 10 on various phones right from the updated phones from Pixel 2 Pixel 4 5. I've also noticed my volume levels even though they're turned right up and the speaker is on and I'm practically shouting people are having problem hearing me. if I don't turn on the speaker they can't hear me. I would be grateful for any experiences or find out what this stupid non-functional appearing silent bar appears on my home screen and whether it's affecting the operation of the phone audio.\nthanks in advance!",
