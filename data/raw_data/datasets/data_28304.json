    "content": "Last night my pixel 2 screen changed to a blue hue, all white colour now has a blue tint and it makes its impossible to read anything without turning the brightness down a lot, then it's too dark! The screen has also went black a few times but not tribes off, is I can still feel vibrati when typing. \n\nI have tried restarting, booting in safe mode, power cycle, I have been through developers tools, altered all screen settings/colours/brightness etc and nothing has improved. \n\nPlease help as this has been a great phone but I won't be getting another if it can't last 2 years!!!",
