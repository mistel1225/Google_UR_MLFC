    "content": "greetings, \n\n i have an issue that need to be addressed soon, i bought a cellphone (google pixel3) in middle east , the cellphone seems perfect and i was so fascinated with the picture quality and how amazing the camera is, however to my disappointment, one day i was drinking tea and placed my google phone on the table which no more than 50cm in high, it fell down and when i picked my phone, i was saddened and disappointed to see a crack in the display screen,  days later i took my flight to Philippines, and had plans to get it repair in google Philippine office, i made my research on where the office is located and i asked questions in google map if they conduct repair to google products, unfortunately no reply , i traveled twice to manila to try to get my phone fixed at google office, first time it was Sunday and office closed, the second time i went there,  to my disappointment they refused to entertain me in their upper office located in bonifacio manila. and the lobby man advice me to cross the street in the other side at picadilly star building since its an extension to google office, so i did and went to the upper 24th floor i guess, where the google office located, a humble security man entertained me and asked me the reason why i went there, so i told him about my broken phone and he asked me to wait in the lobby so he process my request, only adding to my disappointment that he came back with a cellphone in his hand and gave it to me to speak to a person , so basically no google representative was willing to see me in person since i mention the issue with my phone, the woman i spoke with on the phone was nice and she asked me to send an e-mail addressing this issue, the e-mail address was provided by her, i need an answer please, cause i've spend too much money and time traveling to manila just to get this phone fixed",
