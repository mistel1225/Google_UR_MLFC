    "content": "When i click a video in the google search result it just takes me to a blank google homepage. it doesnt matter if the video is from youtube/vimeo or any others. \n\ni have cleared cache and storage or every google/youtube app, restarted phone in safe mode with none of that working. The only thing that works is when i remove my google account from the phone. google chat has told me it is an account problem not a phone issue. \n\nWhat in my google account would be cause this? i would like a new pixel phone but if this problem persists i would be hesitant.",
