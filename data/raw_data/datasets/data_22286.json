    "content": "Pixel won't connect to a wifi SSID that is not broadcasting. This was working before the OS upgrade.\nI can connect to all other SSIDs on the same access point. If I make it broadcast the SSID, the phone is able to connect. As soon as I switch off the broadcast SSID option, I get network out of range on the phone.",
