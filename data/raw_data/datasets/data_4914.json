    "content": "I'm now on my 2nd Pixel 4a 5G, and the audio quality on calls is often so bad\nthat I have to call back. A friend also on her 2nd Pixel 4a 5G has the same problem.\nThere are no apparent hardware problemsâ€”local music and sounds play fine.\nI've followed the Nexus-Pixel from the original Nexus One,\nbut problems with the Pixel 4a 5G may finally drive me away.\nI think it no coincidence that the trade press is reporting a decline in Pixel loyalty.",
