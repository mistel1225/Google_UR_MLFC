    "content": "When I remove and add the account the phone it solves the issues for less than a few hours before the google account is unable to sync again. I am not even able to \"sync now\" with gmail. I'm not having this issue with my surface duo or other android devices. Any thoughts as to why this is happening? I had assumed google apps on a google phone should run without issue.",
