    "content": "After restart my Pixel 3a behaves strangely.\nThe Quick Settings bar only displays one row of quick settings and when swiping down a second time, nothing happens (no extended quick settings menu appears.\nAlso I can no longer make the the apps quick access menu appear by swiping upwards from the bottom.\nAlso when I perform screen actions (eg typing) I hear a sound and feel a vibration (I turned this off).\nAlso I can't browse between open apps anymore.\nIt's like there has been some reset of the phone in some way.\nPlease let me know if this is an update issue and what I need to do. Thanks.",
