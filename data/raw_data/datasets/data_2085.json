    "content": "My phone was lightly splashed by some water from my bathroom tap which triggered the ‘liquid or debris’ message. I left it to dry as suggested, there was no visible liquid. However my battery was already very low and the phone battery died while the USB port was still disabled. It will charge up  enough to power on, but then I think it disables the usb again so the phone loses battery and switches off again before i can manually override the liquid/usb message. The notification doesn’t have time to appear. Can anyone suggest anything, or work out where in settings I can try and quickly get to to enable the usb charging function before it powers off?",
