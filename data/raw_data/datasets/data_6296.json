    "content": "For the last month or two Gmail has not opened or downloaded any attachments that I've received, including PDF. The only way to view it is to save to Google drive and then go open it from that app. Touching the attachment leads to the download percentage pop up but it just sits on 0%. I've contacted the support on my phone and they won't help. I've tried clearing both the cache and all the storage on Gmail with no success. I've also downloaded a different PDF reader and tried that with no success.",
