    "content": "Ahh, Google!  What's the deal here?  No CBRS support?, no 5G?, no 802.11ax?, no SD slot?  I've so badly wanted to switch to Google Fi and a Pixel, but why would I?  You boast a fancy camera and assistant.  Personally, those features don't mean much to me.  I don't use assistant now on my Galaxy S8 (which I've been waiting to upgrade to non-Samsung) and any phone-based camera will do the job these days.  I want performance, a snappy processor, quick access, decent screen res, and a solid battery.  I guess I'll just have to deal with an S10 jailbreak to get next-gen features (without that stupid physical Bixby button).",
