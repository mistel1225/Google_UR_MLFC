    "content": "Hi all,\nPixel 5, Androind 11, Outlook and G Calendars.  Had to reset whole phone due to sensors going down.  On reinstall no calendar alerts on \"At a Glance\" or Ambient dsiplay - they were there before.  I have been through preferences and ambient display settings. Ask Google Help who asked me to ask you.\nSo any bright ideas?\nMany thanks in advance\nMarcus",
