    "content": "Hi pixel users ,\nI have seen multiple  pixel users complaining about loose charging port . I also have this issue with pixel 2.\n\nBut this design issue has persisted till date with every upgrade. Google team should work on this and come up with a better design. It's a design issue totally.\n\nWhat are your thoughts ?\n\n- Pixel user/fan",
