    "content": "What happened to the QA for this device, honestly!?\n\nIssue 1: Device charges rapidly up until about 90% then takes 20 mins to charge the final 10%. Supplied charger used and also Pixel 3a charger. Same result. Issue still present in Safe Mode and after factory reset. Didn't migrate any data from Pixel 3a after factory reset so as close to a clean install as you can do on a Pixel.\n\nIssue 2: Phone won't maintain a 5G connection. All correctly configured on network side. Phone will connect to 5G (five bar signal), but will drop back on to LTE within about 5 or 10 seconds. Can force it back onto 5G or a further 5 or 10 seconds (most of the time) with an on/off of Airplane Mode, but phone will then drop back to LTE again. In the Networks > Mobile Networks settings it defaults to 5G preferred but, if you open the setting, only LTE, 3G and 2G are available for selection??? Setting it to 5G only (via *#*#INFO#*#*) displays similar behaviour, except connection drops out entirely without dropping back to LTE, naturally.\n\nIssue 3: Neither VoLTE or VoWiFi are available to turn on via *#*#INFO#*#*. Both are supported for the phone on my network (Vodafone Ireland)\n\nI'd have this straight back for replacement but, considering I've managed to get one WITHOUT a screen gap, I'm hesitant (though the battery issue concerns me, it could be software, but...). This launch has been an appalling mess, really. Google are losing their grip when it comes to hardware in a big way.\n\nAnyone have any experience of the above or Google folk suggest whether fixes are incoming for any of the above?",
