    "content": "original USB C to 3.5 audio jack adapter that I got from buying Pixel 2 no longer works, now I have a pixel 5, I tried buying multiple other non-google adapters to use for my pixel 5  but they produce audio that is distorted and has white noise. it also makes headphones go to sleep if there is more than 1 second of no sound signal, leading to a choppy audio experience. I have a pixel 5 and it does not include a new adapter, which is kind of disappointing, especially that retailers in my country do not sell original google adapters. I would like to have my old google adapter replaced, I feel like I should be able to use headphones on a phone that I newly bought.",
