    "title": "Pixel 3 microphone picks up a lot of static",
    "content": "The microphone seems to pick up a very large amount of static in multiple apps, including Phone, Messenger audio calls, Duo audio calls, camera, etc. When I make a call using speaker phone or make a video call on Duo or Messenger, there is no problem whatsoever. The camera app always appears to have the microphone issue whenever making any video recording. Using the Google Assistant or any voice recording app like Google Keep also cannot pick up my voice. \n\nI've done the following, in this order:\nReboot\nSafe mode\nFactory reset\nReboot\nSafe mode\n\nNone of the above has resolved the issue for me. Also worth mentioning that this probably cropped up around the second week of owning the device.",
