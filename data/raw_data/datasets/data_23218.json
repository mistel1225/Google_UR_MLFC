    "content": "Is there an option or method to use 'Free up Space' but only from a certain period of time (i.e. only remove photos older than 6 months)? I often go out of range for work and need to access some photos (often recent ones) to show clients. It would be handy if there was even an option to fully free up space then bulk select on the phone to 'save to device'.",
