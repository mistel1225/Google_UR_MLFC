    "content": "I keep having unwanted \"ghost\" alarm. I don't have any alarm that actually goes off but there's always an alarm icon on the right corner of my screen, I have checked in the alarm app and there is no alarm set. And I can't turn on bed time mode, every time I try to turn it on there always a notification says that \"Do not disturbs stays on until your alarm starts at (1 minute after now)\". Example: If now is 4:47pm, I can only turn on bedtime mode for a few seconds before 4:48 and the notification says \"Do not disturb stays on until your alarm starts at 4:48\". Pls help :(",
