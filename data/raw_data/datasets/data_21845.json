    "content": "Whenever I screenshot a picture in my Google pixel 4, I can't edit it straight away. Instead I have to go to photos to edit it there. I have seen videos on the internet explaining the option of editing screenshot once taken by scrolling the top and it comes as notification. Anyone can help with changing that, I also can't find any option in the settings.",
