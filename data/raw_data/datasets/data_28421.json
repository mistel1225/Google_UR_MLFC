    "content": "My friend is sending me valid links on messenger of YT videos. when i click on the link, it just takes me to the YT app but doesn't play the linked video. I had him send me a few more to test it and got the same result. I'm new to android so this might be me not checking a box somewhere?? Thanks for any help.",
