    "content": "one morning I was out and checked to see if my wife had called or texted me about anything she might need me to pick up, when I looked at the phone I had 0 signal, I was in a store and thought maybe it was because I was in a building. Outside I also had no signal and the whole drive home nothing. I went to T-Mobile and they could not figure it out no matter what they tried so they have ordered a replacement. I normally buy fairly cheap phones but decided to get this mainly because of the camera and figured it would be a lot better than my old phone (I was really liking it). I was very surprised that it only  lasted a month and I haven't read anything about anyone else having this problem. I just hope the replacement does'nt have any problems .",
