    "content": "Only happens when I have headphones plugged into the usb-c. A very high pitched sound plays at the same time I listen to music, watch tv or videos. Had this issue with two different headphones (but same brand AIAIAI). Haven't had issues with the usb-c adapter for my aux cord in my car.",
