    "content": "Hi,\nIn the clock app on the bedtime I setup my wake-up routine with repeat, sunrise alarm with slowly brighten screen before alarm with sound and vibrate and Google assistant  routine. I changed the news action to change what news is played and save, and hit allow. In the morning on my locked screen the  sound/alarm works fine at the right time, but the google assistant doesn't work at all. Seems buggy ? I deleted it and tried to set it up a couple of times but nothing. Anyone else having this problem?",
