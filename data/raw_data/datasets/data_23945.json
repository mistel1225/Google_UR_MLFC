    "title": "Fingerprint option disappeared after February Security Update",
    "content": "Fingerprint option has disappeared after the february security update - this is on a 128gb Pixel 2 XL. It was working without any issues before the update but now all options to use the fingerprint / pixel imprint are missing - the phone is behaving as if it does not have a fingerprint scanner attached at all. This happened immediately after the update! Have tried soft booting and factory reset but it does not change anything. Everything else appears to be working as expected.",
