    "title": "Pixel 3 keeps rebooting constantly!",
    "content": "I've had this phone for less than a year.  This rebooting stuff happened maybe a month ago then went away.  I didn't think much of it, and just figured it was some rain affecting the performance.  \n\nWell today, it's back at it.  Just funny how even if you're able to \"catch\" the phone before restarting, hold the power button, then you power off that it still RESTARTS back up.  People were saying this was such a good phone?  Obviously I'm a little vexed, what a waste and a joke.",
