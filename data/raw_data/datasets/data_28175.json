    "title": "Google iPhone — pixel trade in program complaint - 3rd Party following malpractices to rip us off",
    "content": "It is quite disappointing that the 3rd party company Google hired for validating the trade in  the phone does below par job. They just returned our iPhone saying it wasn’t working while it was working fine. We sent the proof of videos as well and they agreed, but still...yes, we did open google support case and corresponded over phone and emails. We expected $250 credit by now. \n\nIn fact, we were using the iPhone until we switched to pixel 3a and now regret not taking Sprint store trade in offer for the same amount face2face.  \n\nWe wonder whether google has instructed its vendor to rip people or not provide the complete value. Hope not. \n\nNow looking at filing a complaint with BBB given all the data points we have. Hopefully, that could push google to curtail the malpractices.",
