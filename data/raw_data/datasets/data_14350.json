    "title": "Why are you letting iPhone dominate a segment",
    "content": "Is it only me or fo other Android users also think that organisations like Google and Qualcomm have allowed Apple to dominate the premier segment for way too long. Every year, Google comes up with half-hearted attempts at trying to penetrate the premier mobile segment and every year iPhone comes out with features 95% of which we already and were capable of mastering but failed due to incomprehensible reasons. \nI'm not sure if the management of the Pixel division ever tried to answer the questions \"Why Pixel and not iPhone? Why Wear OS and not Apple Watch?\" I think it's time that Google/Alphabet team start respecting and make attempts to help us Android believers save face in front of the iPhone phonies!",
