    "content": "When taking a photo it appears in the small circular preview window but when I click it it opens an older photo and the photo does not appear in any folders. If I screenshot, the image does not appear in the screenshot folder and these have now all vanished. If I am sent a photo via WhatsApp the images do not appear in the WhatsApp image folder and again all old images have disappeared. I have cleared cache for both camera and Google photos. The photos also do not appear on the Google photos drive. Any thoughts and help is appreciated.",
