    "content": "My Pixel still can't communicate with my Mac to transfer files. It has been well documented in these forums as well as others. It seems like this would be a major issue - being able to transfer files from your phone to your computer. But it doesn't seem like anything is being done to fix it. It has been an issue for as long as I can remember, at least a year or more. What do we have to do to get Google to fix this?",
