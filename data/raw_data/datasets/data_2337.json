    "title": "I have a Pixel 4a 5G whose touchscreen is now very buggy. I cannot use my home swipe gesture at all",
    "content": "Since updating to Android 11, my touch screen has become incredibly buggy. Typing messages is now painfully slow and difficult, my swipe up gesture to go to the home screen or to switch between apps does not work at all and the entire screen will be unresponsive to any touches at random intervals throughout the day. This is so frustrating, the phone is only 6 months old and is so frustrating to use. I have already done a factory reboot which did not solve the issue. \n\nI've had pixels for many years (since they were called nexus') and it always seems that a software bug renders them useless after a period of time.",
