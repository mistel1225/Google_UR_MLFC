    "content": "Hi all, I have been experiencing issue where no sound is recording on videos captured on camera on my pixel 4. This has only started happening in the last couple of days (whilst trying to take holiday videos-so annoying). It is also very random. Appeared to be working this morning but has now stopped again for no apparent reason. \nI have checked all other sound including all calls and all is working fine.\nAll permissions are enabled for camera and microphone.\nI have 'cleaned out gunk' from top microphone which fixed it briefly but the problem has returned. \nPhone is updated to latest software (March 5th 2020)\n\nI would like to avoid a factory reset if possible. But this is ruining my holiday.  Saw there was a thread with no resolution re the pixel 2 experiencing this issue but not for pixel 4. Any ideas? Please help! :(",
