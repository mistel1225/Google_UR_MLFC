    "content": "I've been facing this issue for the past 3 days. If I long press volume up/down , it just doesn't work. But if I single pressed it , it works. And if there's any media playing on the phone , like a video or music , then the long press works. If I restarted the phone , the volume button completely works as usual , but the issue starts happening after sometime. It's been only 2 weeks since I bought the phone",
