    "content": "My Daydream controller pairs with my 3XL when the Daydream app asks me to push the button, but after the \"allow access to contacts & history\" pops up the app loses the controller, asking me to try again, however when I look in Bluetooth settings the Daydream Controller is listed as paired.  Why can't the app see the paired controller?",
