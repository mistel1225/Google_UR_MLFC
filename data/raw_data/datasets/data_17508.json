    "content": "My phone is facing  the charging issue since i have bought.I'am not satisfied with the product dont know whats the problem either hardware or software .I have to send my device for diagnostic center every then and now.My current ticket number is GL0103751.I want that my device should be replaced as i'am facing this issue again and again.I never though that google hardware would give me such kinda problem.I bought the device with a trust and build quality of google.The stock android  is best at its part but the hardware isn't worthy at all as iam getting  the issue again and again.I want you to replace my device  as it is under warranty period.Its my humble request to team google that please do the needful.Never expected that the device would give me such problems.I wish i would be a happy customer this time.i have already mailed   twice to team b2x and Google support but nobody is replying ,they are not responsive at all what kind feedback is this,very pathetic  service from Google.\nThanks",
