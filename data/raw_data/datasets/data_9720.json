    "content": "Does reporting SMS spam with the Messages app do any good with non-Fi wireless providers? I have a Pixel 3 but use T-Mobile. I get 10 - 20 spam SMS messages a day, and when the Messages app offers to report and block them as spam, I usually do so. Does this do any good if T-Mobile is my service provider? I used to have Fi, and SMS spam protection was pretty good, but T-Mobile's is useless. They have a short code I can forward spam to, but it involves several steps of swiping and tapping and doesn't seem to do any good anyway.\n\nIIRC Android used to let you block SMS from sources not in your contacts, as well as calls, which is what I really want. This option doesn't seem to exist anymore. The closest I can get is to leave Do Not Disturb on all the time, but the configuration to block non-contacts in SMS is confusing and sometimes my phone doesn't ring at all in DND mode, even is the text is from a contact.",
