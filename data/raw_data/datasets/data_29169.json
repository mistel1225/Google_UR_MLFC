    "content": "Hi, i'd like to share my ideas for new features. The active edge is an awesome function with a lot of potential, it would be great to have mappable app shortcuts when screen is off (sleep).\nSomething like short squeeze for normal assistant, long squeeze for camera, 2 short squeezes for flashlight etc.\nAlso, the AOD could have an option to show only while charging.\nBattery saver would be better if it had some customization, like haptic feedback on or off.\nThanks if anyone takes a look at this and forwards it further!",
