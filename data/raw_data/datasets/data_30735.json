    "content": "On the Pixel 3XL, after a take a picture or two, the camera screen goes black.   I have tried clearing the cache and closing all applications and just opening the camera app but it is still black.  If I restart, the camera will work for another 1 or 2 pictures and then does the same thing.  It seems like it has been like this since I received the phone.  \n\nI figured it was a software issue but after a few months and its still happening, I'm guessing a hardware issue.\n\nAnyone have similar issues?  Any fixes?\n\nThanks.",
