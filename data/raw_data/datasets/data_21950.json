    "content": "Hello Experts,\n  My Pixel 3 is dead for the last 3 days. I tried all the possible fix mentioned across multiple threads. \n  Google support said that since this is out of warranty, it needs to take to the service center.\n  However, after multiple tries, I was able to start the phone in SAFE MODE. When I check the battery, it says 1% Plugged In, can't charge right now (see picture)\n  The phone is connected to the original charger. I am able to activate Wifi etc. Even at 1%, it is ON for the last 60min but the battery is stuck at 1%.\n  Are there any other suggestions I can try. The service center near my house is closed.\n  Any help will be appreciated.\n  Regards,\nShubham",
