    "content": "After updated the May2020 security patch, the microphone on my Pixel 4 XL isn't working anymore. I have to use speaker to talk. Google recorder app doesn't record anything, keyboard dictation doesn't work either \n\nHowever, when I record a video from camera app, sound was able to record, so it's clearly not a hardware issue.\n\nPlease fix this asap. This is a basic feature of a phone.\n\nThanks",
