    "content": "I just got my new Pixel 3a and I liked that it showed how long the battery will last (at current usage I think?) when I pulled down the status bar. Yesterday I saw that there was just the \"normal\" percentage instead of the estimated time it will die. At sometime today it switched back to estimate.\n\nI did searched on the settings and the internet but could not find anything about it.\n\nSo my question is how can I enable this feature full time or if I cant what does it depend on?\n\nBR\nTim Fahrner",
