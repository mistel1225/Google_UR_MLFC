    "content": "I use DND mode and I allow notification exceptions for my contacts list.  This would allow any notifications (phone or sms)  whether in vibrate or ring mode.  This no longer seems to work when my phone is in vibrate mode and seems to occur after the Android 11 update.   Sound notifications still work but not vibrate.",
