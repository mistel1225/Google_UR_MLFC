    "content": "My Pixel 3 is stuck in a constant boot loop. It will load, stay on screen and then reboot. It won't stay on long enough to do a backup, hard reset or anything. I've tried booting it up in safe mode but then it reboots on its own again. I've also tried just powering the phone off for a while to give it a bit of a break. Well, sure enough the phone boots up on its own even the I've hit POWER OFF. \n\nNeedless to say, I'm very frustrated as all the options I've read are useless given the constant rebooting, no matter what mode I'm in. \n\nThoughts anyone?! My phone has basically been rendered useless at this point.",
