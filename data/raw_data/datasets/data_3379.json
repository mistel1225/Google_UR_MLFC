    "content": "I am trying to get my mobile data to work. It is showing that it is on, but I don't have any internet connection if I open any webpage/app. I already cleared my cache for my connections, and even reset to factory settings. I also restarted my phone, and have been in the process of installing updates. But I still cannot get my mobile data to work, even though I can receive and send SMS and calls. Is this an issue with my carrier or with the phone?",
