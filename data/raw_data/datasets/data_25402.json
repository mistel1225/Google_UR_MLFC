    "content": "I have had my Pixel 4 XL for around two weeks now. When streaming video whether it be on Instagram, Twitter, YouTube, Netflix, etc my device's stream will become pixelated and break up. It will self correct itself but then it will continue the cycle of breaking up again and again.\n\nAt first I believed this to be an issue with my wireless network at my home, but the issue appears when streaming on cellular. Then I thought it may be the 90Hz screen, it still occurs when Smooth Display is turned off. I have tried clearing caches and reinstalling apps. Shutting down and restarting the phone hasn't appeared to help either. The only thing I haven't tried, that I can think of, is to factory reset the phone. I do have fairly poor cellular at my hose but my previous iPhone 7 never had this issue so I do not believe its the cellular connection. My broadband at home is 300 Mbps so I have never had issues streaming before.\n\nI have tried to contact the Pixel support page but they keep telling me is an application problem, but it appears across many applications. Any suggestions for help or fixes would be greatly appreciated. I will also have two screenshots of my problem attached.",
