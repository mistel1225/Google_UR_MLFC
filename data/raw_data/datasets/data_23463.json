    "content": "My connection to both my JVC head unit and a Targus Bluetooth speaker drop after a few minutes. In addition, neither device will auto-connect when powered up. I've used these devices with my 1st Gen Pixel and other Android phones over the years.\n\nI believe it's a firmware or software bug on the 3a. Any ideas?",
