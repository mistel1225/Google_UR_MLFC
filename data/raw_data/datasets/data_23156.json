    "title": "Pixel 3a - poor sound quality (aux & bluetooth)",
    "content": "Through both the headphone jack and bluetooth connection, sound loudness is dulled and quality is poor (dulled treble and bass). If I restart the phone and listen to music right away, the sound quality is excellent, better in my opinion that my previous iPhone. However, after using Google Assistant the loudness degrades and sound seems muted to the point where I can't even stand listening to music on it.\n\nI've tried Apple Music, Google Play Music, YouTube Music, and Spotify, and with headphone jack and bluetooth connections.\n\nAnyone else with the same issue?",
