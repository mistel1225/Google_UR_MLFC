    "content": "Battery only holding charge for 4-5 hours with moderate use - texting, email, listen to podcasts.  I don't have any social medial.  Mostly at home so on wifi. Worked with Verizon support, tried multiple things incl. factory reset.  Contacted google support, recommended replace battery.  I am just wondering if it is worth the cost of battery replacement.  I try to keep my phones for at least 3 years.  Thanks.",
