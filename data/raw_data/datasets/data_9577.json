    "title": "Do Not Disturb Not Working on Pixel 5",
    "content": "I have new Pixel 5, having switched from a Samsung Galaxy S9 Plus, and am having issues with Do Not Disturb. Maybe I just don't understand how it's supposed to work, but DND doesn't start or end automatically. I've set up different schedules for weekdays and weekends, because I get up earlier on weekdays. I can get Bedtime mode to work, but it doesn't let me set different schedules for different days.\n\nWhat am I missing here? If it won't work out of the box, is there a 3rd party app that would?",
