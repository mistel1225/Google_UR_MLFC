    "content": "I just purchased an unlocked Pixel 3a.  I have Consumer Cellular as a provider.  Consumer Cellular indicated that they will allow WiFi calling on their end and tried to work with me to enable it on the phone.  We were unable to do so because the option doesn't come up (under \"Calls\" then \"Settings\" then \"Calls\") as it should.  I need this feature as there is no cellular signal in one of the remote places I frequently stay - but there is WiFi service.  Consumer Cellular has done everything on their end they can think of.",
