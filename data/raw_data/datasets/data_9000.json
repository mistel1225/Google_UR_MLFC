    "content": "Vibration sensitivity doesn't work when attempting to use keyboard. I have always liked and loved this feature and for some odd reason stopped working..  Cleared cache and cleared storage , nothing . Reset apps , nothing . The only setting it works at is default which is garbage to me since that isn't a strong enough MS ability to even feel the vibration mode .. Last update prior to this one worked just fine.. Help as this is stressing me out",
