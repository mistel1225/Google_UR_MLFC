    "title": "My grandmother died on 28th March. Is her phone just an expensive brick now?",
    "content": "My grandmother died on 28th Mar.\n\nAs part of sorting out her estate, I'm also trying to sort out her smartphone (a newly brand new Pixel 4 XL) as one of my relatives wants it.\n\nI do not have my grandmother's pin number. I have access to her Gmail account - I have also inherited her laptop, which has her Windows password on a scrap of paper stuck to the screen - but don't know the password or pin.\n\nWhat can I do with this phone? Factory reset hasn't helped, it's still asking for the pin, and the only person who knows it can't tell me.",
