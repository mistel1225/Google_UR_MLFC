    "content": "It's stuck on backing up 11 items for 3 days now, and it never backs them up (only photos, no videos). \nIn turn, I can't backup further photos to clear up more storage space...\n\nI already cleared cache and now cleared app data. \n\nSo now, instead of getting the \"getting ready to backup\" message, I get a loop of Getting your photos message.\n\nI tried everything, reboot, delete some items, uncheck all picture folders to be backed up, delete apps... My cellphone is 70% full, not that much that it wouldn't be able to backup.",
