    "title": "Are all Pixel 2 XLs defective?",
    "content": "This has been a horrible experience. \n\nFirstly I bought a completely new Pixel 2 XL. \n\nLittle did I know, Google has been selling defective products through retailers and I am now only able to obtain a Refurbished replacement. If I wanted a refurbished product, I could have bought one for hundreds of dollars cheaper than what I initially bought.\n\nI did as requested, sent my originally completely defective phone. And received a replacement. I immediately noticed that your promise of it being completely inspected and passing Quality tests was not upheld. \n\nI contacted Google again. Requesting they replace the replacement phone. As It has failed Quality inspection and was sent to me regardless. \n\nAgain you requested that I send you my phone first. Meaning I had to use my old phone which barely works. Jeopardizing my job as I need my phone for work. \n\nSo I complied and sent you the second defective phone. Days later I received a third phone. \n\nYet again, the phone did not pass Quality inspection and was sent to me. \n\nI've had enough.",
