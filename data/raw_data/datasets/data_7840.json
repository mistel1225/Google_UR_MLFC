    "content": "Today the touchscreen of my Pixel 2xl suddenly became not responding. I didn't do any damage to phone, screen visualy such as whole device seems normal, nothing wrong.  I use a silicone case, I removed it such as a protective film from my screen, reboot it in a safe mode but that didn't help. I using a latest 11 android with december safety patch, i want to flash my phone or somehow restore the firmware through usb, what i can do?",
