    "content": "I bought a Pixel 4XL last month and the screen is flickering and jumping. It's still under warranty and I brought it to Ubreakifix, where I was told the phone would have to be replaced by Google. Since I bought the phone at a retailer (now closed because of the virus), apparently I can only do a standard exchange - I have to send the phone to Google and wait 5-10 days for a replacement, though there could be delays in shipping. There's no flexibility in the \"process\" - I offered to pay for a new phone and get refunded once I sent in my current one, but they won't budge.\n\nThis is totally unacceptable - I keep trying to escalate the issue, but was told I hit the customer support ceiling. I would bring it back to the store and get a different phone, but like I said the store is closed. Has anyone else run into similar problems but gotten a better result? Any help is much appreciated.",
