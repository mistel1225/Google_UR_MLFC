    "content": "recently (last 4 days) my pixel 2 is having severe battery drain issues. It lasts about 14 hours with the current issue. Currently Pixel Launcher is using 25% of my battery, followed by 7% gmail, 7% messages, and then the remaining apps. Pixel Launcher has been the largest percentage since I started noticing my battery being almost dead when I get home from work. I have reset the cache and memory and have battery optimization enabled. This is all active use, as in background is 0 mins. I have restarted my phone and forced stop, however it has not solved my issue.\nI did recently install the fitbit app on my phone. Could this be the issue? How do I resolve?",
