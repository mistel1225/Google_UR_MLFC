    "content": "As has happened to me, has happened to many, many others. An updated is sent to your perfectly functioning phone, and immediately your phone stops working properly and no resolution is offered. You are now forced to replace your perfectly good phone, as it has just been sabotaged.\n\nCould you imagine bringing a 3 year old car to the dealership for a tune-up, then being told, your car no longer works, you have to buy a new one! Would the car companies get away with it, the way the phone companies do? Class action suits are needed to stop this madness.",
