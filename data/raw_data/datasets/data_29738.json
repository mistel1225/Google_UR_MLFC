    "content": "YA Pixel 3 overheating problem - I use my Pixel 3 with Cricket, and just got back from a road trip. I did not have any coverage anywhere in AZ N of I40 (and in some spots on I40 W of Flagstaff). During the time I was out of range, the phone repeatedly shut down due to overheating. So I think part of the issue is that the RF section of the phone generates excessive heat on some bands when there is no coverage. The phone was continuously on charge during this time.\n\nThe phone also issues an overheating \"features disabled\" warning but doesn't shut down when using Google Maps directions, even on the Interstates when it has partial to full bars. I hope I haven't fried the battery. \n\nJust an observation. I'm switching back to Fi, we'll see what happens next time I'm on the road.\n\nw",
