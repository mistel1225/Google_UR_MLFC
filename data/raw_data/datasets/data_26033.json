    "title": "After the newest update, why is my phone (Google Pixel 2) getting exceedingly slow?",
    "content": "So I was on a trip last weekend and reset my phone, only for it to get hard stuck on the boot up screen (with the loading bar and Google logo.)\nI give it time and keep it plugged in and after around 15ish minutes my phone boots up. O then learned it had actually forced the new update during this time which was odd but oh well.\nI immediately noticed **EVERYTHING** on my phone got 200x slower. Chrome constantly crashes if you aren't extremely slow in scrolling. Social media apps cannot access gallery and crash when you open the upload photos option. \nIs there something I can do to fix my phone after this? Every time my phone shuts off it takes 5-15 minutes to boot back up now and is basically useless at this point.",
