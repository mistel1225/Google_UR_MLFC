    "content": "My phone had about 5 percent left on battery. I left it on the bed next to me and let it charge overnight . I woke up late ( alarm didn't go off) and found that the phone had completely shutdown.    I figured out how to turn it back on after pressing the power button for about 30 seconds.  It turned on showing it has a full battery with 100% . I am now late for work and very upset..   How can I be sure this will never happen again....  How did this even happen in the first place?",
