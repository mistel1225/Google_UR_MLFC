    "content": "Hello.\n\nRecently, I tried to extract audio from an app in the Android/data/ directory but the default file manager app doesn't show anything there anymore! I tried installing a third party file manager but it returned with an \"access denied\" error.\n\nI heard about this \"Scoped Storage\" thing, but I just want to know how I can access the internal files for apps that are usually in Android/data/.\n\nSome help or a nudge in the right direction would be nice.",
