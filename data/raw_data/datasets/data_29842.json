    "content": "I just moved to Australia and bought a Boost SIM card. After I got a new number and plan I stopped getting verification messsages from any applications. This has proven to be difficult as I need to log into my bank (ANZ) but cannot because it is trying to verify my phone number first. \n\nI did switch over to the Australia play store. \n\nI have asked the boost community but have gotten zero responses.",
