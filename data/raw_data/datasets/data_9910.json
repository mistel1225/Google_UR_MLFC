    "content": "Just got my brand new (from amazon) Pixel 4a in today. Everything has been working great, but the camera is incredibly slow and blurry. When recording video or showing what the camera sees, it runs at maybe 2-3 frames per second, and the color/focus is off, front facing camera works fine. Have tried system updates, 3rd party camera apps, phone restarts, and nothing has worked so far. I believe it is a hardware problem, and the only fix is to return it and get a new one, but figured I would check and see if anyone knew of a solution.",
