    "title": "HELP! Update possible culprit for losing nearly all sound",
    "content": "An update to my Google Pixel (probably) caused it to lose sound, but not all sound. So far, I've discovered that Speakerphone still works while in calls, and for whatever reason, Spotify will still produce sound, but ONLY when it's paired to my alarm--it goes silent again once I turn off the alarm. This happened to me back in August, but the sound eventually returned (not sure how). The correlation to the update was too obvious this time around, and I don't want to have to use my headphones just to answer calls and use my phone with sound on a daily basis. I've tried putting it into safe mode to identify an app that could be to blame, but no dice. I've done a factory reset--nothing. I don't know what to do.",
