    "content": "After 5 months of purchasing the pixel 3a, the bottom speaker has suddenly stopped working. It makes a wierd buzzing/crackle sounds and then stops working completely. I can't hear the ringtone for incoming calls, alarms, and speaker phone function also does not work. I have tried suggested troublshoots such as factory reset, but they have not worked at all. I have taken great care of the phone, and it has not suffered any accidental damage.",
