    "content": "Every now and then when scrolling through the thumbnails of my photos in Google photos, I sometimes come across one that looks corrupted. It doesn't show a full image in the thumbnail because part of the image is all green or purple lines running across half of the image. Then when I select that image it's corrupted and no good. I wonder has anybody else experienced the same problem.",
