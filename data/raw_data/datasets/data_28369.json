    "content": "After Android 10 update, my pixel 2 is having strange issues. One that's huge is it's locking up with this \"fuzzy, pixelated\" Google mish mash of colora and I have to hold power button and when it reboots? Still getting the same thing. Freezing constantly trying to open Chrome, Google Launcher bar on the bottom of the phone? The \"G\" is fading in and out in a blinking fashion and my clock under apps? Says clock w/ no icon. ",
