    "content": "Brand New Factory Sealed Pixel 3 Warranty Incorrect When Purchased from Amazon.com (shipped and sold by Amazon not a 3rd party seller).  I purchased 10/31/2019, contacted support to verify warranty and they say it expires 9/15/2020.  Here is Google Support's response:\n\nClay\n5:02 PM\nAs per our records the device warranty expires on Sep 15, 2020. If you have any question about the warranty please contact your point of purchase.\n\nClay\n5:06 PM\nThe warranty of the retailer and Google will differ from retailer to retailer. However, the warranty of the device from our end is covered until Sep 15, 2020.\n\nContacted Amazon Support just to see what they said:\n\nMary | Customer Service\nThat is right and we have a 30 days return policy.\nGoogle Support says it has a year warranty if they can honor the warranty,please contact the manufacturer if they can replace the item.\nIf in case there is a problem you encounter on the phone.\nOr you can buy the protection plan.\nHere is the link:\nhttps://www.amazon.com/s?k=protection+plan+for+electronics&crid=1BXOQLWXHO9Q3&sprefix=protection+pla%2Caps%2C491&ref=nb_sb_ss_i_3_14\n\nSo Amazon doesn't seem to care if the manufacturer (Google in this case) doesn't honor their warranty.  They just say buy a warranty for it.  So it doesn't seem like Google or Amazon Support knows what is going on.  Not pleased with Google's Support as it seems to be non existent if you don't purchase it from the Google Store directly.",
