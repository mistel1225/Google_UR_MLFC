    "content": "My google pixel was freezing and I followed steps that said to restart it. So I restarted it. But to my dismay it now will not turn on. I tried holding down the power until the reboot symbol but that symbol never comes. I held it down for at least a full minute and the steps said it should only take about 30 seconds. No red light turns on. How do I fix this?",
