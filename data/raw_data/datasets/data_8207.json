    "content": "When I use my phone, and receive a notification from some apps, the notification is \"collapsed\". It doesn't show the title bar, or icon like normal. This is an issue, because for instance Snapchat uses the icon to indicate if it's a photo/video/text, and that is not possible to see since the icon is not showing.",
