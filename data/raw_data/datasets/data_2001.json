    "content": "Just yesterday I received my brand new Pixel 4a, ordered directly from Google, Unlocked (no plan). OEM Unlock is greyed out and unchangeable on it, which is odd. I'd expect that if I'd ordered a Verizon one, but I'd expect full use of it if it's supposedly unlocked. Is this a bug, feature, or should I just return the phone?",
