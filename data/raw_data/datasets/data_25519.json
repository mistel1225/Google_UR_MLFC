    "content": "A dozen of factory resets, clean flashing my device the manual way, keeping my amount of active & installed apps at the lowest minimum level without turning my smartphone into a feature phone but nothing is improving or fixing my crazy high amount of battery drain during idle, that is always skyrocket high at levels between 2%/hour as lowest and up to 5-6,5%/hour as highest, which is insane compared to my semi-old Google Pixel 2 that always drained ~0,20-0,18%/hour during idle.\n\nIs my Google Pixel 3 faulty or is this a normal behaviour of a flagship device on the battery life frontline when it comes to idle battery drain?",
