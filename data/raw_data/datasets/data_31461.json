    "content": "Hey Google developers since every pixel device is either AMOLED or P-Oled they can produce deeper blacks and the dark theme in pixel launcher and phone and messaging app are not true black they're some what like Matt black and it doesn't save as much battery as true  black saves and since generally screen is still lit in background & bit less lighted up than white theme/background. So please make it more blacker background in the next update that is Android Q. \nHoping this Change would come up\nM. Eswar",
