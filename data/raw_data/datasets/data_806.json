    "content": "Anyone know how I can escalate so that I get my RMAd phone back from google repaired? They can't find the phone that I sent them and I can't actually get a hold of the department that can help me. I've already chatted / called 5+ times and the answer is always the same, which is that the appropriate team is looking into it, it's already escalated, and it's just a matter of waiting for a response from this team.\n\nBackground: Sent Pixel 4A 5G in for repair with shipping label Google provided along with the paper to include in the box, but the Google Store Repair tracked continues to say, \"Waiting to receive device.\" Their website apparently is tracking a different shipping number than the one they provided in the e-mail instruction to ship the phone to them. So, if I type in the tracking number in the shipping label they provided, the phone says received by them, but if I track the shipping label their online system is tracking, it says waiting on me to ship to them. Both shipping labels were for the same destination.\n\nThe question I'm trying to answer is when will I get a working phone back from Google? Anyone have any suggestions on how to get this moving along so that I get a phone back?",
