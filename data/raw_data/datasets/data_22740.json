    "content": "My Pixel 3a suddenly stopped responding to touches. The device is well taken care of. It has not fallen in anyway. It was working perfectly fine and I had put in my pocket and I walked around. Took it back and viola stopped responding to touches. All hardkey works. I have tried Shutting it down (by holding power button), rebooting. I have some data that I really need so I havent try restoring to factory settings. The phone has ADB enabled but since I restarted its stuck on the lockscreen. I do not currently have a USB-C OTG cable to try a mouse. Please help. I am from United Arab Emirates where Google is not offering support.\n\nEDIT1: I manged to get OTG cable. Using that with a mouse I somehow backed up the data. I did a factory reset. Now its stuck at \"Hi There\" (Set up screen). Touch still does not work. I initially thought it could be a software issue but now I am not even sure, coz after reset no different. Please suggest what else I can try. P.S. The phone is still in warranty.",
