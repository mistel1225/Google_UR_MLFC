    "content": "restarting phone didnt work. updating phone didnt work. When making a call, the screen shuts off. It turns on again when the call goes through. I tried testing the proximity sensor with an app. It isnt consistently registering could it be a bad sensor? Sometimes I call and the screen wont turn back on until well into the call and then I can put it on speaker.",
