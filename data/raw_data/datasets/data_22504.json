    "title": "Pixel 2 XL thinks it gets connected to a charger every few seconds",
    "content": "My phone randomly notifies(vibrates\\beeps) as if it was connected to a charger when it's actually not.\nI could even see that for a split-second the battery icon changes to being charged. (It immediately goes back to indicate that it's not connected)\n\nIt happens about 2-3 times a minute, and besides being annoying, i've also noticed that my battery drains much faster now, and I think that it might be because of that.\n\nI have no problems with charging my phone, it works fine and that's the only time when I don't get that constant random notifications.\n\nI've tried booting in safe mode, and the problem persists so it's not a 3rd party app.\nI think that it started when I update to Android 10 but i'm not 100% sure.\nHow can I try and solve this problem?",
