    "content": "I recently received a replacement device for my old, damaged Pixel 3a with a new Pixel 3a and want to transfer the old phone's data/settings. The hardwired data transfer isn't an option since the old phone won't turn on. When going through the initial phone setup process, it will not even offer my old phone's data backup as an option (none exist in the setup screen), even though the backup exists on Google Drive (I have checked and verified that online). Any ideas on how to get this backed up data onto my new phone?",
