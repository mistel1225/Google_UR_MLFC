    "content": "Does anyone know of a work around to make YouTube Picture-in-Picture work with Android 10\n\nCurrently, going home causes PiP to be \"under the screen\" and we need to tap an invisible touch area on the bottom right corner of the screen in order for PiP to appear visibly.\n\nThis has been an issue since Android 10 on Pixel 3a. I had 2 button navigation and the same issue. I tried a bunch aunchers, the only PiP works with is the Pixel Launcher. All other Launcher appear over PiP and block the view of the video... Seems like an OS bug",
