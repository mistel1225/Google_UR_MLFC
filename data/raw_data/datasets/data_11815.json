    "content": "There's something annoying happening with my pixel 3a's clock when the power button is clicked after some time of the screen being black - the clock will show the time that's been the last time the phone got locked, and then after a second or two it will skip to the actual time. \n\nLet's say I've locked my phone at 3:05. Some time later, I click the power button to see what time it is. For a second or two, it will show 3:05 before it refreshes to show the actual time. Not cool.\n\nThis has been happening ever since it got updated to android 11. I was thinking this was a weird little bug, but now I'm thinking -  maybe it's a feature? And it's very annoying!\nIs it really a feature? Is it a bug? How can it be fixed? I do not want to get confused every time I check the time!",
