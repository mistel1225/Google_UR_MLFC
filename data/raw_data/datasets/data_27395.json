    "content": "I have noticed two black spots on the screen and these haven't gone after a reboot or even in safe mode. I contacted Google and I was told to visit the service center - CDTI here in Singapore. They identified it as manufacturing defect but my only option is to send the phone for repairs and collect it next week. Which by the way is free according to CDTI as the phone is in warranty or else I would have to pay for this manufacturing defect. I was also told that there's no guarantee that this will not reoccure. I'm also told that I need to reset my device and throw away the expensive skin - dbrand (30$) and expensive screen protector - Whitestone some (70$) away. My question is why am I not eligible for a replacement for a manufacturing defect?",
