    "content": "Hello Everybody, I updated my Pixel 4a to Android 11 and now the phone app no longer opens up when I receive a phone call.  i have to use the notification section to answer.  It does ring but the app is not opening up as it would normally do to answer the call.  Since the most important thing about a phone is making and receiving calls, this is a big bug.  Luckily I have a work around for now.  Anybody else having this issue?  Any fixes?  Worked fine in Android 10.",
