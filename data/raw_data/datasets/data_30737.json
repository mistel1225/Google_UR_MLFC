    "content": "hi,\n\nWhen listening to streaming audio (via blue tooth) and then receiving a call over IP (eg Messenger, Skype or WhatsApp), the call behaves inconsistently. It will normally interrupt the streaming audio and then often crash out, routing the call and the streaming audio back to the phone often on speaker. I have to manually stop the streaming audio, and then reconnect the call over IP. Happens most when listening over blue tooth.\n\nMost annoying when driving...     Thanks, Stephen",
