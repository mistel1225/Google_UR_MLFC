    "content": "I bought a Pixel 4a in December 2020. Zero problems until about a week ago, I started to get notifications about \"USB disabled, liquid or debris detected.\"\n\nI could not see any liquid or debris, so I powered off, and on. The message reappeared, but soon disappeared. Only  to reappear every few days. Which worries me. \n\nAnd this time, when the liquid/debris message eventually vanished, it was replaced with with a new message, \"Charging connected device via USB\". But my phone is not connected to a charger, there is nothing plugged into the USB-C port\n\nI have no idea what is going on, and decided to ask the community for advice, before I go to Google support. Any help much appreciated.",
