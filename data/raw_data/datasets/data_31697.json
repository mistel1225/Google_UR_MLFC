    "content": "What I'm trying to do is ask my Google home to play the news, but instead of going to my Chromecast I would like it to be able to project on my phone or Samsung tablet. I have multiple Google homes and have the Google home app on all of my devices.\n\nBasically, I tell Google home to play the news on basement TV and it starts playing news from YouTube. That's great, but I would also like it to be able to play on my phone as an option.",
