    "content": "I keep my mobile data off on my phone. I previously could download my YouTube Music playlists and listen to them when connected to my Android Auto in my car. Now if I'm playing music when I connect to my car that single playlist may work, but if I push the back arrow it doesn't give me the YouTube Music menu, just a screen that says no files or something and then I'm stuck. Please restore this functionality",
