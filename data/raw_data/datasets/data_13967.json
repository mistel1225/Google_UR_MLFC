    "content": "Ever since the update to the new version of Android, I have been having issues connecting to my network sometimes. It seems like it has mostly started when my battery got too low. It has resolved eventually when charged and after lots of resets, but now it won't reconnect at all. I have tried resetting it, using airplane mode, resetting all the settings under settings > system > advanced > reset options > reset wifi, mobile and BT. Is there anything else I can do to fix it? I went on a walk to try to get better receptivity, but it doesn't even look like it recognizes the network exists at all.",
