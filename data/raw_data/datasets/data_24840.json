    "content": "I gave my phone to a friend and now the phone is having a problem with the phone which warranty covers.  How do I transfer my name to her name so that she can deal directly with google to repair this phone? google needs to be sure that I gave her the phone but they cannot unless I provide a proof of purchase order number from 3 years ago... unlikely that I have it.",
