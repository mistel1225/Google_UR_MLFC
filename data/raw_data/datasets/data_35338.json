    "title": "Brand new pixel 2xl with a dead microphone, support doesn't care to even check the phone!!",
    "content": "I bought a new Pixel 2xl and within 2 weeks the microphone stopped working. The person on other end can hear me only when I turn on loudspeaker. I have opened a service request GL0048311 with Google India support and they mentioned their courier guy will pick up the phone. \nEven after waiting 8 days, nobody called to pick the phone. I have mailed Google support everyday and they assure my phone will be picked up on that day itself. But after waiting 8 days, I lost my hope and they are not even bothered to reply to the email thread too.\nIs Google India a fraud company? Are they properly performing the QC!!I I have never faced a hardware issue with a new phone (that too within the 2nd week itself). I am repeatedly asking them to escalate my issue and the support is not even bothering to reply. \nAt this point what are my options? I am completely lost and frustrated on choosing a Google phone.",
