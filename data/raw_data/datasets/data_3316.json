    "content": "I have recently changed from a Samsung Galaxy Phone to Google Pixel 5.  The move has seen all of my photos move to Google photos and now Google is telling me my storage is full and I have to purchase more.  I already pay for Microsoft OneDrive, so I want to change my back up location to OneDrive, but can't seem to figure out how to do that.",
