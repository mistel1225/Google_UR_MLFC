Assistant is set in Italian and English.\n\nQuestion 1: how many places language has to be set?\n\nRegarding point 3 this is how settings look: it's in Italian but it says \"Assistant languages\" on top and you see both italian and english.\n\nQuestion 2: why under english it says \"The new google assistant is not supported in these languages on your device\"\n\nIf I remove english\n\nwhen saying \"ok google\" instead of the usual assistant tab at the bottom the following full page appears\n\nIt says: \"Assistant needs further downloads. An error occurred: make sure to be online and retry\". If I hit the \"download\" button, it returns a \"no connection\" error.\n\nPlease help.\nThanks",
