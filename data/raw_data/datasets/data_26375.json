    "content": "Hi folks,\n\nMy Pixel 2 device will randomly turn off, either in use or while locked, battery level be damned. It won't turn on again if I don't hold down the power button for a good 8 seconds or so. Also, the battery level displayed will erratically plummet to 1%, before  shooting up again. Factory reset didn't help. I was wondering if this is a battery issue or something else, I don't wanna go through the effort of changing the battery if it won't help.\n\nThanks a bunch.",
