    "content": "My device ist corrupted... I am stuck in the bootloader. I tried factory reset, did Not work. I cannot load a new firmware (OTA?) as my device cannot be found on my computer (usb Debugging not enabled).\n\nWhen I try to start up, first I get the corrupted msg, then, when clicking start, the screen turns white with Google Logo and nothing happens. In recovery, a factory reset did not work, and there are no other options as there is no as card slot. Bought the phone in Germany, living in Austria -> lockdown, no way to return it.",
