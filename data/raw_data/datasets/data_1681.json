    "content": "Only 1 touch point is available rather than multiple touch. I suppose that is a hardware problem. \n\nSolution: \nStep1: Setting > System > Developer Mode > Input > 1. switch on touch response, 2. cursor location \n\nStep2: You should see a white spot & cross when you touch the screen, and the locus of motion. \n\nStep3: Now, go to lock screen & notice the top left corner.\n\nStep4: Turn your phone to horizontal position\n\nStep5: Push your screen really hard until the top left corner shows 2/2 or more",
