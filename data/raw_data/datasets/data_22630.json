    "content": "Recently, I have purchased a new Pixel 4 XL from Amazon. The phone worked perfectly until after the first 10 hours of usage. My phone randomly failed to detect my SIM card and it would disconnect from mobile network and WiFi together. After a few hours of troubleshooting with the Google technical support team, they suggested me to get a replacement from Amazon, which was what I did right after contacting Google. Does anyone here face the same issue? I am afraid that the problem will occur again on my new phone.\n\nTLDR:\nMy Pixel 4 XL would randomly disconnect from mobile network and WiFi. I am getting a replacement from Amazon but I'm afraid it's a problem of the design of the phone.",
