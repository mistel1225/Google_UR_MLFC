    "content": "Hi there,\n\nI've found an issue with my Pixel 4XL which I can't find described elsewhere.\n\nReleasing the power button is seemingly turning off the phone.\n\nI can start the phone by pressing and holding the power button. It boots up OK. At any point if I release the power button, the phone turns straight off to black screen. I can get all the way to the normal home screen, but the phone dies straight to black screen.\n\nI have tried the soft reset (power + up volume) and it still happens. If I let go of power at any point, the screen turns to black.\n\nAny idea how I can fix this?\n\nThanks,\n\nNick",
