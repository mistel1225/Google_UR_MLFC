    "title": "After 11hours and 30 minutes, the Google Pixel XL battery drained to 44%. Is it an issue of battery?",
    "content": "I disconnected the Google Pixel XL at 4:30 am. After 11 hours and 30 minutes, the time passed to 16:00, the battery was 44% with only wifi or cellular function turned on, not games and/or movies being played. Does my phone have a problem with the battery? Because with my previous SONY EXPERIA XA1 android smartphone, the battery capacity is about 3000 mAh and smaller than this Pixel but it (XA1) did not drain too fast as much as this pixel did.",
