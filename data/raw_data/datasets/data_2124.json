    "content": "I plugged my phone into the charger and it made a different charging sound at connect. Since then my screen is blank when this is sleeping and won't come on when I pick it up. I have to actually push the button on the side to get the screen to come on. It acts like it's dormant and won't come back on. Until it's triggered by me. It just started doing it.",
