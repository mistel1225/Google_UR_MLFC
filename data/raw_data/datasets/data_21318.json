    "content": "I have taken all of the recommended steps on Google. I have even taken it to the Google warranty recommended shop uBreakiFix. They did a complete diagnostic of the phone. My camera then began to worked for only 2 days. And now it will not open or work. I have not reinstalled any apps, I was told that it might be the apps but it's not the case at this point. I am taking it back in this afternoon , but if it is a update problem I do not want to waste more gas.",
