    "content": "I'm appalled. Straight up. I searched this page and the only \"solution\" I'm seeing to this redundant ANNOYING waste of screen real estate is.... to download a bloated redundant ANNOYING 3rd party launcher? That's a \"choice\" you people are suggesting? That's not the solution we are requesting for our $800+ dollar phones we invest and pay for. Android used to be the frontrunners for customization. What happened? The only *simple* solution to the *thousands upon thousands of people* on here and other Android forums who are also requesting the option to simply drag it off the screen like every other widget. Omg... How simple.\n\nIt's redundant. I can squeeze my phone. I can speak to it. I can use chrome that I *already have running the majority of the time*. Why in hell would I waste a single second typing into this thing? \n\nI do not want to download some BLOATware just to remove this BLOAT. Fix it, guys. Enough is enough.",
