    "content": "Trying to get my top ear speaker working after having the screen replaced. It won't work during calls or as a speaker for music.  Tried restarting, turning on/off, different positions. Still no luck. Have to use in speaker phone currently or buds. Is this common? Was there an oversight? Did something break? It worked before even with broken screen.",
