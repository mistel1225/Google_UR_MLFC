    "content": "Any way to make a 'rule' to turn on/off things like NFC, Wireless, Mobile Data, etc. by location?\n\nI would like to be able to set my phone up so that when I leave the house, things like NFC and Mobile Data are turned on, but when at home, both of those are turned off (but Wireless is on and connected).  (so I can save the battery!)\n\nIt's especially frustrating to have to turn on/off NFC if I want to use Google Pay.  I don't like to leave it on because it sucks up the battery (same goes for WiFi and Mobile data - don't need mobile data at home and don't need WiFi while I am driving).",
