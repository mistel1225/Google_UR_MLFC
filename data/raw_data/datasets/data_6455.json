    "title": "Volume issues with my Pixel 4XL",
    "content": "The volume of the call of my pixel 4XL although it is in the minimum of the configuration, it is always too high.  Also, when I try to increase the volume during the call (or lower it), it is always at the same level, it does not seem to respond to the command.  Obviously I've already tried modifying the call sound settings, but nothing happens.   I made a factory reset, it was fine for a couple days then it start doing it again. It seems that the top speaker is always at maximum.  The same thing happens to me with audio messages.",
