    "title": "Android 10 broke USB charging and file transfer",
    "content": "About a week after updating to Android 10, my pixel 2 xl suddenly stopped charging with fast charging, but then after a few days it fixed itself. It is now charging but Android auto and file transfer aren't working. I don't get the charging via USB notification, and I have USB debugging enabled and have set the default USB configuration to file transfer/Android auto. I'm not sure why it's not working, and I'm very sure it's not a hardware issue with the USB port.",
