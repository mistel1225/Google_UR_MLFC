    "content": "I have seen a tweet of a user stating that his pixel 4a does not work in the UAE after he had purchased it from India. He mentions that it is because of a \"country lock\". I have been trying to reach flipkart India for a long time and no one gives a damn to even reply.\n\nI just want to know whether the Pixel 4a being sold in India is fully \"unlocked\" as I will be using it abroad.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/omermuktha/status/1333789885535195138",
