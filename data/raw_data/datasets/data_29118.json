    "content": "I am having issues with my Pixel XL. If I press the power button for 30sec I only hear a small vibration and nothing else. The screen is dead and the phone wonâ€™t charge. Turned off suddenly with the battery around 50%.\n\nDo you think is the battery? Also, my phone just got out of warranty 6months ago but I don't think is fair that I need to pay to fix a problem that it wasn't caused by me.\nThanks\nMario",
