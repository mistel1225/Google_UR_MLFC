    "content": "Phone is turning off and restarting randomly. This issue has been occuring since over a month. At the beginning is happend rarely and I thought an app crashed or something. Now I've tried the safe/secure mode, resetting the phone etc. but the problem still happens - more often than ever. I now believe that the battery is failing. Is there any chance to have this repaired under warrenty, even if warrenty has officially ended at the beginning of November? The issue started before that date but I wasn't sure what was causing it at that time and tried to figure out what is wrong... Does anyone have experience with the official google guidelines in this case?\n\nThanks and best regards,\nTim",
