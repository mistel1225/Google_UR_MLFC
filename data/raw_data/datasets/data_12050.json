    "title": "Pixel 3 XL Android 11 - Lock screen media controls are gone. Anyone know a fix?",
    "content": "After updating to Android 11 I am unable to play media from the lock screen... the controls show for a couple of seconds but then disappear, or vanish the moment I try to interact.\nI do not have \"Hide player when the media session has ended\" enabled - I tried enabled and not, no difference.\nNow I am not using a premium service/app and I do not want to, I am not going to pay for YouTube Premium just to listen to music on my own phone; the way it worked prior to updating the OS was via a browser (Brave is my case worked well) with \"desktop mode\" enabled, play the vid/aud, lock the screen the access the media controls... that no longer works.\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated.",
