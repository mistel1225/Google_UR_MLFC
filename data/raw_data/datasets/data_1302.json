    "content": "Recently, my Google pixel 5 has been displaying incoming calls in full screen while it is unlocked & I am using it. It has become a nuisance as it interrupts what I am doing on my phone ; I am not able to leave the screen unless I click on a seperate notification on the top left hand side of the screen or wait until the person hangs up. \nTrying to fix the problem, I entered my phone app settings to see if I could fix the issue there. However in doing this, I realized I am not able to change any settings as they are all greyed out. ",
