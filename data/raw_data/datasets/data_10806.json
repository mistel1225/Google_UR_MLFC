    "content": "I recently got a Pixel 5 and switched from Verizon to Google Fi. I cannot receive texts from at least one of my contacts and I suspect I cannot from at least two others. I have gone through all of the troubleshooting steps in the Messages help center and worked with Fi support but it's still not working. Any thoughts?",
