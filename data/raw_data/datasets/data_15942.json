    "content": "Still no notification sound from Google assistant. I have tried so many things at this point I'm ready to give up. Google assistant still works fine, it just does not make the sound when I say \"OK Google or Hey Google.\" Oddly enough, the sound works when I am connected via Bluetooth or Android Auto in my vehicle. I just hate the fact that I need to look at my phone when using Google Assistant to know they are listening.",
