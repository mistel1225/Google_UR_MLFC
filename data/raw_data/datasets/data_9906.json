    "content": "So this morning I got a popup that new software was available. I check it, download it, install it, and ofcourse, the phone needs an automatic reboot. So it restarts, I unlock the simcard and then unlock Android.\n\nSo there's the problem: since then, my phone is stuck on 'phone is being started' (in dutch: 'telefoon wordt gestart...'). It's been hours. By swiping the top down, I am still able to enter the settings panel. I've tried changing the password for entering android, which didn't help. I've tried deleting the newest installed apps and then a reboot. But no.\n\nI rebooted. I rebooted in safe mode. I don't want to hard reset, because of loosing some valuable files.\n\nIs there someone who could provide me with more information about this issue? Is it common? Is there a possibilities to first get the photo's/data off my phone, and then hard reset?\n\nI hope to hear if anyone could help me.",
