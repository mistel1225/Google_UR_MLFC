    "content": "So having an issue with Whats app not playing recorded audio messages whilst the phone is locked. \n\nI contacted the support line here and they tell me its a third party issue with Whatsapp. I contact Whatsapp and they tell me its feature in the Pixel 4a that is causing the issue. Then I contact Google again, and they abruptly end the conversation after telling them the issue. \n\nSo essentially there is no support for this phone according to the company that manufactures them. Also, good luck finding a place to submit a formal complaint against Google, there simply isnt one. ",
