    "content": "I switched from a iPhone to a Pixel 3XL. I have got several complaints that when people call they only hear one ring, then silence. This came from multiple people with different providers. I tested it by calling myself in my husband's iPhone and got the same result. I have spoke to customer support who had me try a few things:\nRestart on safe mode\nClear the cache \nClear the network data\nFactory reset \nI even cleared almost all my storage\nToday a different customer support member helped me realize, when he called from the Google computer the ring back would work fine. When I called from my husband's iPhone it only rang once, and when I called from my home land line (Comcast) it worked fine. \n\nIs this an issue with only certain providers? Or maybe when iPhone users call a Google phone? Has anyone else had this problem?",
