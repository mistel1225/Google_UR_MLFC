    "content": "I've noticed that the ad volume follows the master volume setting on my phone rather than the in-app volume setting.\n\nThis is a problem because I would then have to lower the master volume on my phone when I use or play on such apps if I don't want to disturb others (on public transport or at night). If I forget to raise the volume when I am done, I will tend to miss calls and other notifications.\n\nI think in-app ads should follow the sound settings of the app itself.",
