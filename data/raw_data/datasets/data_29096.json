    "content": "I accidentally added another Google account to my Pixel 2 and could not change the syncing settings quick enough. The contacts from that Google account was imported into my phone. I've removed the Google account but I still see that account's contact in my Phone app, but I don't see it in my Contacts app. However, if I search for a particular name in my Contacts app, I can see that account's contact. For example, searching for \"Mary\" would show all the Marys in my contact as well as that account's contact. How do I completely remove all contacts that's not from my Google account?",
