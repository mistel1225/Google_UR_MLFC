    "content": "I tried everything except reset (because it is a new phone and i got it in factory state): another sim card, calling with or without wifi, with or without 4g etc. Nothing helps. I read some forum posts about similar issues on the internet. Is it a known issue and will it be fixed with an update? Or is it faulty hardware?",
