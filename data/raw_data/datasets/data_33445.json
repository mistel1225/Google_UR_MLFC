    "content": "I bought my previous pixel 3 phone 2 months ago, and I was charging it mostly using my macBooks charger. And surprisingly 2 weeks ago it stopped charging from any source except power banks.\nAfter giving broken phone to repair service, they gave me a new phone. And now I am wondering, was my previous phone was broken because I have used Macbooks charger or was it just coincidence.\nI just don't want to break a new one.\nThank you in advance!",
