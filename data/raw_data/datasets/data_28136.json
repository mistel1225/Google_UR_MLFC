    "title": "Frustrating Issue with Pixel 2XL Camera",
    "content": "Hi, a few weeks back the camera on my Pixel 2XL stopped working, the app closes instantly and on the off-chance that it does open, I cannot get focus. I did the following:\n\n- Cleared storage/cache and uninstalled the camera updates\n- Installed Android 10\n- Updated to Camera 7.0 Beta\n- Booted into safe mode.\n\nNone of these actions solved the issue.\n\nI then resetted my phone (2 days ago) and that seemed to have solved the problem. However, starting a few minutes ago and while I was taking photos, I again lost focus in the lens and the app crashed.\n\nWhat could be the issue? Surely it isn't hardware as the camera worked for ~40 hours after resetting.",
