    "content": "Having had my Pixel 3 for a year now, I still find it very frustrating trying to find a decent external microphone that actually works fully.\n\nI need an external mic for shooting on the go outside so it can be a boom mic or a lapel mic but 75% of these appear to fail miserably when connecting to the Pixel 3, usually via the USB-C / Jack adapter supplied with the phone.\n\nHas anybody out there got a proven (rather than theoretical) solution and are actually successfully using an external mic with the Pixel 3 without problems ?",
