    "content": "I recently purchased my pixel 5. I notice there is a smudge with the camera that cannot be cleaned off. There are no visible marks of the surface of the camera unit. I believe the issue is with the housing or the camera sensor. \n\nMy phone is 3 days old.\nWhy is the only option to replace my unit with a refurbished unit.\nWhy am I paying full price for a refurbish unit.\nWhy can't the replacement device be sent out in advance just because I did not buy it through google?
