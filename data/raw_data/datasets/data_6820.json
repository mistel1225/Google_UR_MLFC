    "title": "Constant Notifications when location services are running",
    "content": "Hi,\nI got a Pixel 5 for Christmas and recently it's been almost unusable because the phone is constantly vibrating (every couple seconds). It happens when the location services turn on I think, the location icon in the top right disappears and then reappears with the notification. I've looked through the settings and I can't figure out how to turn the notification off. I've turned off the haptics for now so it's not constantly going off in my pocket and killing my battery",
