    "content": "Greetings, my Google pixel began to reboot when working in any application. I already did a reset to the factory settings and this helped until the update that I installed came out and it started to reboot again. I went into safe mode and there were no reboots. 40GB + space is taken - from 128. I tried to figure out which application makes it reboot, but I have no idea what this application should be like when connected to the Internet or Wi-Fi, when charging, when downloading updates for standard applications, and even in settings where however, I am not safe from another reboot",
