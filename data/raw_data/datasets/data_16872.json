    "content": "For no reason my pixel 3a suddenly started to resetting itself. I’ve had this phone for about a year and this is the first time that something like this happens. First the phone starts to vibrate, then opens the camera and pops up the power menu, about a few seconds later the phone resets, but that’s not the end, because the phone enters into some kind of resetting loop, it takes about 5 minutes for the phone to stop resetting itself.\n\nI hope you can help, I think pixel is a great phone, but I don’t know why this started to happened",
