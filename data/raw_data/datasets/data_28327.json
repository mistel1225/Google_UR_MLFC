    "title": "Cellular calls not connecting on Google Fi after making a WiFi call, or after some time idle",
    "content": "I'm roaming in Canada on Bell for a few weeks (Rogers says forbidden) and after activating Fi I can make calls until I make a WiFi call, then outgoing calls sit for 30 seconds then say \"ended\" To reset I have to switch to my physical SIM and back to the eSIM (Airplane Mode or reboot does not fix). I also tried disabling wifi calling and reset the SIM, but found some hours later calls not working again.\n\nCalls were working fine on Beta 6.",
