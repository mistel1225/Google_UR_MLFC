    "content": " I have a blank notification for one game that won't go away. It's not even a real notification that says anything. I try to swipe it in either direction but the notification bar only gives me the settings icon. The only way I can get rid of it is forcing close the app or turning off notifications completely. How can I fix this to where I can dismiss the notification? The pictures show what the notification looks like and what it does when I try to swipe and dismiss.",
