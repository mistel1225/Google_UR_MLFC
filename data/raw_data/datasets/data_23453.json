    "content": "I am using a brand new Pixel 4. After I use the Google Assistant, my audio (Spotify or Audio Books) doesn't resume unless I swipe away the Assistant or the phone times-out to the lock screen. This is not the case with my Pixel 3 where music resumes automatically shortly after I ask a question. I am trying to figure out if this is the result of a setting, or an inherent Pixel 4 behavior. Can someone please verify whether they see the same behavior? To reproduce, simply play a song with Spotify and ask the Assistant a question. Doe your music resume automatically?\n\nNot restarting the music seems to defeat the hands-free capability of the Assistant.",
