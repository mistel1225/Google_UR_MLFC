    "content": "My phone was working fine until yesterday late night, when it started to hang for a bit and then restart, it happened for like 3 consecutive times. I turned off the wifi and slept. When i woke up in the morning the phone was completely turned off. I couldn't turn it on. Later it turned on itself and again the same problem occurred. The phone freezes for a bit and then restarts again. It is happening in a repetitive process. Please help me fix this issue. \nThank you",
