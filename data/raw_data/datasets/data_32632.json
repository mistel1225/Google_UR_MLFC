    "content": "I have tried lowering down brightness, restricting apps, and even made some space on my phone. When it hits around those percentages, it just abruptly shuts off (no shutting down description). When i power it back up, it says it has 1%. If i plug it in RIGHT AWAY and turn it back on, it just lost like 5%. It seems in the few seconds it will be off it drains the last part of the battery. Please help! I don't want 1/3 of my phones battery life unusable.",
