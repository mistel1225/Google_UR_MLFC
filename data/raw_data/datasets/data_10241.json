    "content": "I was able to use it fine for a few days.  But suddenly the home app says the chromecast is not available.  \n\nIt works from an iPhone using the same google account. \nIt works from my laptops Chrome browser again with the same google account.  \n\nI have tried:\nFactory reset on both chromecast and pixel \nRebooting the router\nEnsuring both are on the same wifi band (I used the phone to setup the chromecast: it's the same network)\n\nWhy can the iPhone see it just fine but my pixel can't?  I would figure google devices should integrate better with each other.",
