    "content": "Has anyone been successful using the Pixel 4a with a Fitbit tracker?    Fitbit support says it is not on the compatability list and does not know when it might be so they can offer no help.  I read in other forums that others have somehow got it to work to some extent.  I would be interested in knowing if anyone on this forum has attempted this.  Thanks!  Mike",
