    "content": "Within just the last week, screenshots of any photo I've taken are dramatically underexposed. BUT...for screenshots of any non-photo displays (say, of a browser page, for example), no darkening occurs. I take a *lot* of pictures but don't typically adjust any settings related to lighting, exposure, etc, so I don't think it's anything I might actively be toggling on/off. (I typically use the screenshot method of holding the power & down-volume buttons simultaneously, but I did try the alternative of holding just the power button & then selecting \"screenshot\" from the menu and got the same result.
