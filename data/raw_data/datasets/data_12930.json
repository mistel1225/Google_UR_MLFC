    "content": "Get warranty support as expired after trying to reach support in April but it wasn't responding. I have screenshot of two short calls to Google in April, 2020/found warranty replacement wasn't allowed as finally reached support after expired in May, 2020! Just require battery replacement. I am hoping some fairness principles are used for people like me who dropped through the cracks on hardware problems by them being addressed during the pandemic by somebody!",
