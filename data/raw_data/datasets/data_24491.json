    "title": "\"Hey Google\" response volume too low over bluetooth",
    "content": "Lately, connected over my bluetooth earphones, when asking the assistant with \"Hey Google\" the response volume is too low that I can barely hear it when the media volume is 100%.\nWhen pressing the button on the bluetooth earphones, or the on screen Assistant Mic, the volume adheres to the media volume and I am able to hear the assistant's responses.\nRestarting and tweaking the settings do not help.\nI do not find any separate volume level for \"Hey Google\" responses.\n\nThis was working properly till 2 weeks ago. Is there a way to fix this?",
