    "title": "Multiple issues after android 11 update. No option to choose Pixel4XL in the support page.",
    "content": "This is the 2nd time the issue is being reported.\nAfter android 11 update and patch update, following are the issues on Google Pixel4XL (There is no option to choose 4XL on the support page)\n\n1. Getting continuous error message as \"clean the top of your screen including the black bar\". Unable to unlock the screen with face ID. This is not a hardware issue, as we tried to clean the top of the screen multiple times with no luck. This only works when we power off and power on the phone. (Restarting the device will not solve this problem most of the times)\n\n2. Google maps app freezes. This usually happens after typing a destination and finding best route. Have to restart/power off/on the device again. \n\n3. When we receive a call, the screen goes completely black and touch screen and hardware buttons won't work at all. Cannot increase/decrease volume, cannot disconnect/mute/turn on speaker/nothing is possible till the other caller disconnects the call. \n\nRealy annoying as thes issue is occurring multiple times.",
