    "content": "I'm using the Android 12 beta. . Periodically the Gmail app renders an email message transparently, so that I can see my Gmail inbox underneath the message I'm trying to read. So it appears as text on top of text. I can't make it go away or stop unless I reboot my phone. Any tips?",
