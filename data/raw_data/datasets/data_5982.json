    "content": "I have downloaded music onto my Pixel 2XL for the first time. I have placed them into the Music folder. However, I can't figure out how to play them. Play Music on my phone is \"no longer available\", and I am being forced to change to Youtube Music, which I did. However, as far as I can tell, there is NO WAY to listen to my own music on the phone. \"Explore\" wants me to select the type of music I want to listen to. But it doesn't allow me to select what is actually on my phone. Supposedly Play Music used to, but Google has turned it off. Are they so stupid they never included a simple media player to the phone?",
