    "content": "For the last week and a half or so, my phone has had unacceptably slow internet. Even simple HTML sites won't load. Animated GIFs are 100% unable to load. \n\nWhen and where does this happen? Always and everywhere. When I'm on Wifi at home, at work, at the coffee shop, or at a friends house. When I'm on my data plan with low signal, full signal, 3G, LTE, doesn't matter. Internet is consistently unacceptable.",
