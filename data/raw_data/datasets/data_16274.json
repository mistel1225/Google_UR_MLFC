    "content": "I have a suggestion on security specially after mobile is lost.\nWhich will help u and all customer.\n U can put the lock setting for turn off the phone i . e . If somebody lost his/her phone then first thing thief would do is to switch off the phone and remove sim card.\nIf we put some update such that phone will not be switch off without authorization (screen password ) thief will not able to switch off the phone.\nSo as long as there is power present in phone it will not get off and get would get easier to locate phone .\nIn additional to this is any way to so that sim tray will not be open without authentication?",
