    "content": "After the July security update, my Pixel 2 started having charging problems. I plug in my charger and cable and the phone recognizes it (icon changes and the battery screen shows that it is charging) but the phone doesn't charge. I shut down and restart with the same charger and cable and charging then happens normally.\n\nIs anyone else experiencing this? I'm assuming it's a bug but does anyone have a workaround?\n\nUPDATE - This turned out to be a problem with the USB-C port on my Pixel 2.",
