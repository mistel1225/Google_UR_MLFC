    "content": "I updated to Android 11 a day ago and restarted my phone. Now when i want to work an app i first can't just type to search for it. And if i do get to tap to open it, it immediately closes. The same behavior is true of Google apps and other apps. Gmail, for example, opens but the next tap anywhere closes it out. Was something wrong with the update?",
