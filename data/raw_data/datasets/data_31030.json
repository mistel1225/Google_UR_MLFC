    "content": "Hi, I am experiencing issues with my Google Pixel 3xl packaged USB-C headphones. Whenever I am watching/listening to content, the volume will randomly increase/decrease on its own accord. I have tried turning off Google Assistant and I have also booted in Safe Mode (problem still occurs in Safe Mode) - I have also tried turning airplane mode on, WiFi off, mobile data off etc. and the problem still occurs. PLEASE HELP!",
