Last week I got the April update and now I believe the phone is starting the flashing issue that people are starting to have it didn't do it before the update but it's doing it after the update what can I do about these issues.I absolutely hate this phone because of the speaker problem other than that it's okay but I'm ready to go back to my Samsung Galaxy if these issues can't be resolved ASAP",
