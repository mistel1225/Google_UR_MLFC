    "title": "Pixel 3XL Constant Factory Reset Corrupt",
    "content": " I get the message \"Can't load Android system. Your data may be corrupt. If you continue to get this message, you may need to perform a factory data reset and erase all user data stored on this device\", with 2 options:\n1.    Try Again\n2.    Factory data reset.\nThis has happen to me twice in the last couple of months. Not sure if the first time was shortly after an update or not, but my phone updated a couple of days ago and had been running okay. Both times it has happen in the middle of the night. The first time I just happen to wake up and noticed it was dead and stayed up to reset everything. This morning I woke up way late due to my phone has always been my alarm clock for over 10 years now, only to find it did it again and had to do a factory reset. Had to wait 7-10 minutes to go through the initial setup to even text my boss letting him know that I'm going to be late. Very frustrating and now I'm not sure if I can trust it anymore. I've used Google products for a long time, but lately I'm just not sure of the reliability of the products now. I have constant problems with my Chromecast Ultra too. Now I'll lose about an hour of my time installing apps, setting them up, reconnecting to Bluetooth devices (listening to actual radio on my way in to work was frustrating :-P), setting up additional email clients, and etc... Not to mention losing all downloaded data that hadn't been backup yet.",
