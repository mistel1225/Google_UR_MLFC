    "title": "Why is my Pixel 3 emitting a low static buzz when on phone calls?",
    "content": "During all phone calls, both outgoing and incoming there is always a low static buzz that is emitting from the top speaker. It's something that does not go away and at times gets louder and softer at random times. Does anyone have any experience with this or a solution?\n\nThis is my third Pixel 3, last one was RMA'd because of terrible phone call quality (echo-y sounds, constant cutting out, etc....but never experienced this static buzz)",
