    "content": "I seem to be having some connectivity issues that are very specific since I installed Android 11. I have been getting issues with re-pairing my Pixel Buds 2, even went through the whole process with customer support. I'm getting a replacement pair now but I have a feeling that won't solve the issue at hand.\n\nAnother issue that I feel relates to this is with Nearby Sharing. On Android 11 BETA it worked without a problem when sending or receiving various things. Android 11 makes that impossible to do now. I'm not able to see a device to share to when I'm using Nearby Sharing, and vice versa.\n\nWith these two issues, I have a feeling that there are connectivity issues happening with Android 11 that have come around after the beta program was finished. I've already factory reset my phone for a different reason, so I'm not certain that that will solve these issues.",
