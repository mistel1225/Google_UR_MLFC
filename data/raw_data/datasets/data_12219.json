    "title": "Pixel 5 Adaptive Brightness doesn't do anything.",
    "content": "When I first got the phone the adaptive brightness worked well, until I needed it a bit brighter and manually raised the brightness - since doing that the adaptive brightness has not worked at all.  I can turn off adaptive brightness, set my brightness to 0, and then turn on adaptive brightness and nothing happens it just stays with 0 brightness.  It's not the biggest deal in the world but it does bother me and it's a feature I would like to work.  Also just FYI, I have the latest Android update.  Any suggestions outside of \"factory reset and pray\"?",
