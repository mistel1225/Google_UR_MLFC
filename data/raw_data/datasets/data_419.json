    "title": "Pixel 5 Randomly Disconnects Data and Says \"No Sim Card\"",
    "content": "I've had my Pixel 5 on T-Mobile for about 7 months and about a week ago it started randomly disconnecting from data and saying \"SIM Card Not Detected\" where my Data icon usually is. \n \nI've tried:\n- Restarting my phone\n- Removing and re-inserting the SIM card\n- Shutting down the phone for a few hours and turning it back on\n- Resetting \"Wi-Fi, Mobile & Bluetooth Settings.\"\n\n^^^ Resetting is the only thing that has worked. It will reconnect me to Data on T-Mobile, but it eventually disconnects again. It will stay connected for anywhere between 2-12 hours. It is annoying to reconnect to my work and home Wi-Fi several times a day as well as my Bluetooth devices.\n\nHas anyone found a long term solution to this. Would a new SIM card do the trick?\n\nThank you!",
