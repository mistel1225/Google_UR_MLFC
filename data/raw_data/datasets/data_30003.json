    "content": "When phone idle I don't receive notifications (like WhatsApp, Gmail new email, etc.). Once I pick up the phone and open it, all notifications will appear at once. Some of them can be hour delayed. \nAlso if I use web browser on m desktop to access for example messages on my phone, at some point it will say it lost connection to the phone. Once I open my phone (meaning unlock it with fingertip) it will reconnect. \n\nTried to disable all battery performance features, phone is updated with latest patch, even tried factory reset.",
