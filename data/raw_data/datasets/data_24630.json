    "content": "A few days ago when I plugged my phone in I got a warning message to unplug the charging cord to my phone because it wasn't compatible (This is the cord that came in the box). The phone wouldn't accept charge. When I tried to turn the phone off, it kept restarting itself automatically. the only way it stayed off is when I pushed the power button and volume down to reach the fastboot screen. After 24 hours, it started accepting charge again but sporadically and it dies quickly. Now, it's a week later and my phone is yet again not accepting charge. In fact, over night it went from 50% TO 7% and then died this morning when I was trying to get it to stay off. It never used to lose charge this quickly before and it won't accept charge from the charging cord. I am currently living in Mozambique and don't have access to go into a pixel store, or buy a new charging cord for another 3 months. \nI can't seem to find any sort of online chat room to speak to an expert 1:1 about this.",
