    "content": "my older android phone had a \"gallery\" in which all pictures and video's were stored, directly on the device.  I so far, absolutely  HATE Google photo's, and I don't want my photo's stored on the web. Is there any other option to store my pics on my phone? or a way to install \"gallery\"? (it wasn't an app, but part of the phones system)",
