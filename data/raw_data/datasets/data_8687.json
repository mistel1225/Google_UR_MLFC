    "content": "The power button on my Pixel 3 is intermittently ultra sensitive causing the power menu or camera to be pulled up or go into a boot loop. Removing the device from the otterbox defender case that I've had it in since I purchased the phone, does nothing to address the issue. I pay for insurance on the phone but when I tried to file a claim to have it repaired they tried to send me a replacement phone and charge me a $200 deductible which I can't afford. Especially when I still owe $300 on the phone. Is there a way I can fix ? I dont know why I even pay for insurance now .",
