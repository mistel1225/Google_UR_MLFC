    "content": " I just got my new pixel phone in the mail yesterday. I am very happy with it except in the developer options my OEM unlock is greyed out and I'm unable to click it on. I haven't had a chance to try any adb commands to cause this issue. I really don't want to have to go thru the troubles of trying to return it, but not being able to unlock my bootloader now was one of the main reasons i choose this phone rather a different one. Please help me out in this possible? Asap.",
