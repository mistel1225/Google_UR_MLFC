    "content": "When I tap the screen, my dark background become slightly brighter, the brightness flashes at the long-press timeout as well, and on release.  Is this a hardware problem?  It's annoying, but it also could be the sign an electrical connection isn't right, and I wonder if I should get an exchange.  I only got the device last week.\n\n\nIf it's just a software problem, I wouldn't know what that could be, it's really faint, and doesn't seem like it could be useful for anything...\n\nThanks for your help,",
