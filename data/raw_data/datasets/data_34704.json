    "content": "Having issues sending or receiving calls. Errors come up about system ui, or phone app. If it happens to connect both parties get dead air. Sometimes I have to hard reset to just get the phone to respond again. Wifi apps and messaging have no issues. Already did a factory reset, issue persists. Thinking it is the phone, but on the off chance it is the sim card it would save a lot of headache.",
