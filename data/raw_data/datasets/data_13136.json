    "content": "My Pixel 4 had debris. After clearing it out, I plugged in the charger for the night. The next day was hectic and didn't notice that it didn't charge til I had 9% power. Saw the notice that the USB was turned off due to \"water or debris.\" Cleared it and re-checked for debris. The notice has not returned, but the phone still won't charge. I can't find where/how to turn on the USB. How can I activate the USB so it will charge? Tried both restart and cold start. No go.",
