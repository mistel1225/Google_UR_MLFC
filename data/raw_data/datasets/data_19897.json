    "title": "Pixel 3 phone keeps restarting after a few minutes",
    "content": "My pixel 3 is stuck in a restart cycle. It restarts. After I unlock it, it restarts within a few seconds. Same case when I booted it up in safe mode. \n\nI tried tapping on the power button and volume button but it didn't help. I was able to turn off active gestures but it didn't help.\n\nWhen the phone is on, it almost feels like a phantom gesture/ touch is happening as it shows the emergency call/ power restart/ turn off button automatically without my touching any thing before it restarts again.\n\nAny help will be appreciated.\n\nThanks",
