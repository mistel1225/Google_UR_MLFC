    "content": "Recently upgraded my son's phone from a Motorola to a Pixel 3a. His Google account is linked under mine as a child account. So when signing into the device it does its normal thing of requiring my approval, installing family link etc. \n\nSince moving to the new phone, the family link app and Google maps does not show his phones location. On my phone is shows as offline despite location being enabled (high accuracy) in the family link app. On his phone he has mobile data connected and wifi at times. I even tried wiping the device via factory reset and after setting up again, the issue continued. I can confirm that Google maps on his phone will show the phones location accurately.",
