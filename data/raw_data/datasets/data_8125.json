    "content": "I have one contact whose calls never ring. They don't even show up on the home screen a missed call. If I open the phone app and go to the Recents tab, the contact will appear with a á´“ (circle with line through it) where the icon for incoming/outgoing/missed call usually is. That seemed to indicate to me that I had accidently blocked the number, but when I go to Blocked Numbers in Settings, there are no numbers listed (which is itself weird, because I have definitely selected to block numbers when they've been identified as Spam, but that's another issue). \n\nAs far as I can tell, it is just the one person. I only know they called if they leave a voicemail, or if I open the Recents tab for some other reason. Every other number triggers my ringtone and shows up as missed if I don't answer. This is a work related contact, so I'd really like to know when they are calling me.",
