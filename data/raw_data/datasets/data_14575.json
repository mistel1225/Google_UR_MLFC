    "title": "Pixel 4a: data roaming not working",
    "content": "Hi all,\nI am currently away from the UK where I bought my Pixel 4a, and I can connect to the local networks and make phone calls but I can't (with data roaming turned on) connect to the internet. As I am outside of the UK for the foreseeable future I can't access the Contact Us options usually present in the Settings services. I have tried the SIM in my old phone and the data roaming works on it (after contacting my provider) so it's not the network, but the phone. Any help would be greatly appreciated.\nCheers,\nGareth",
