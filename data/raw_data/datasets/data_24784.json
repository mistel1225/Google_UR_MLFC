    "content": "My pixel died one day so I charged it to 100% then booted it up. It shut off after trying to boot up. 1 month later of trying to fix it I held the volume down and power button until the bootloader menu showed, then I selected recovery mode, waited for the no command. I then held the power button then clicked volume up. I factory reseted it from there. I tried to boot it up, then it shut down again. I charged it and reseted it again. Same thing happened again. Please help.",
