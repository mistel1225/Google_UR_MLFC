    "content": "Not sure if anyone can shed some light onto this.\nI tried going into youtube, and it was returning \"oops something went wrong\"\nSo I tried signing out and back in (on chrome) and it was saying that my gmail address was not recognised. I then couldnt sign in on anything.\nI found a link to recover, and I seem to be back on now, but really concerned as to why this would happen.\nI obviously didnt delete my account.\nI opened an online chat to ask this, but the person on the other end stopped responding, now if I go in again, it says that I have an open case.\nI tried the call option, and got an automated call back immediately, but after holding for arounf 6 minutes, the call hung up, so I cant even go down this route now.\nAny ideas please, as this really shocked me.\nThanks",
