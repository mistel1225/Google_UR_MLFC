    "content": "Skip track function of double pressing middle button doesn't work when using 3.5mm to USB C adaptor. I found a similar topic that had been closed as the issue was 'fixed'.\n\nIt isn't. This function does not work in Spotify and I don't want to use the worthless cans that come bundled with the phone.",
