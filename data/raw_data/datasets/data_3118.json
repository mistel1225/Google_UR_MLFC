    "title": "Pixel 5 ear speaker stops working some time after each reboot",
    "content": "After the recent update to RQ2A.210405.005, my ear speaker stopped working when people call me (normal calls or whatsapp) or if I call them on my Pixel 5. This can be fixed be rebooting the phone, but some undetermined time later (same day? next day? I rebooted an hour ago and it's still working for the moment) it stops again. I've tried this reboot fix 4 times now. The call otherwise works fine - speakerphone is fine. I know it's about to happen because I can't hear a dial tone, so I switch to speakerphone. I have not installed any new apps or changed any settings. Anyone else? I don't want to have to go through a factory reset unless I have to :(",
