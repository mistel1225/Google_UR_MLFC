    "title": "Pixel 5 Charging Issue - Disconnects/ Reconnects every few minutes, battery gets very warm",
    "content": "When I connect my phone to charge (typically every other day, when I get it down around 10%), it seems to be connecting and immediately reconnecting every few minutes (I can hear the chime as if it is being plugged into the charger). If I let it keep doing this, the phone gets very warm to the touch.\n\nIf I disconnect it and reconnect it, it appears to begin charging normally - phone cools off, despite still being plugged in and no longer connects and reconnects (i.e. the chime stops occurring every few minutes).\n\nIt doesn't appear to be a bad cable, I've used the cable to charge another phone, wireless earbuds, and a couple other devices with no issue.\n\nCould it be a bug with a combination of adaptive charging and how low the battery is when i first plug it in?",
