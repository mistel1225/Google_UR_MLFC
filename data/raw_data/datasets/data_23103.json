    "content": "My google pixel 3 is stuck and won’t load the homescreen and apps. It’s stuck on my screensaver and says ‘Phone is starting’ with the blue loading bar (which is moving) but it won’t load. I’ve tried rebooting as per forums but it still won’t load. I don’t want to restore factory settings as I don’t want to loose my photos and videos. I can access the settings menu via the sensor at the top of the screen but the issue seems to be the sensor at the bottom of the screen. Can anyone help please???",
