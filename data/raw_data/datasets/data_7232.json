    "content": "Google Pixel 4XL - Battery/Charging issue (Purchased May 5, 2020. I have the order number) \n\nHave gone through FastBoot, Restore, Wipe, but the battery (50% when on and will not charge, turns off randomly, battery exhausted, etc.) issue continues. Now at the point where the 4XL will not turn on or stay on long enough to be used.\nGoogle deleted the order history, luckily I have the emails. I'm a lot peaved about that. \nWhat are my next steps? Obviously, Google will not support it under Preferred Care since they've deleted any record of it. Do I have to go to UFixIT? \nIs there any ethics or accountability that I can rely on at Google?",
