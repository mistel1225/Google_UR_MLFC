    "title": "Pixel 3a screen is dark green when I turn on and nothing else",
    "content": "I took my phone out of my bag and the screen was a dark green. I do not mean there was a green hue over the apps or display, I mean it is entirely solid green and that is all that is on the screen. I have tried to reset/restart it (holding the power button for 30 seconds) and when I do that I can feel it vibrate and then the green cuts out and it goes black (like it would if you turned it off normally). However, when it reboots it just becomes green again. I am pretty sure it is not a broken screen, since it is displaying nothing except the color green. If anyone has any advice or experience wit this that would be really helpful, I have searched online for this problem and I can't find anyone else who has even had it, let alone fixed it. I have not even had this phone for a year also.",
