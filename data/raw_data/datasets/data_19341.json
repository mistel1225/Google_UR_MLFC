    "content": "About a week ago my phone died, wouldn't charge or turn on so I contacted google and they issued a replacement by having me send my broken phone into them. I have tried calling, no luck. I have tried chatting but now can't get through. I have tried emailing, wont let me submit the form (keeps giving me an error message) Now google has my phone and I have no idea whats going on with it or when I will have a replacement in my hands. Any help on how to track my RMA during covid is much appreciated.",
