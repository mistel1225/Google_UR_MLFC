    "content": "Hi!\n\nI recently did a factory restart for another issue. One thing I was looking forward to was the factory restart deleting all my alarms. Well unfortunately it did not as in they were all backed up and my long list of alarms is still there! (Around 80 of them). This is the default Android clock app. Is there a way to mass delete them all without doing each individually? \n\nThanks,\n\nGrace",
