    "content": "My phone shows 50% battery but dies, or shuts off on its own. Try to charge but shows a ? Mark. Now it won't start at all. Starts to boot then goes black. Tried the power button and volume down, but as soon as I take my finger off button it goes black again. Very frustrating, verizon and insurance not much help.  Please save me.
