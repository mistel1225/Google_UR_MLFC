    "title": "Cannot select photo in Photos app and share it to a Facebook Group.",
    "content": "I post a lot of photos to photography groups.  I take a LOT of photos.  I regularly (every day) have the need to find a photo in my Photos camera gallery to post in a FB Group.  I want (and used to be able) to open Photos and browse through the images to find the one I am looking for, then share it to the appropriate group.  But there is no Facebook Group option in the Share list.  There is Facebook (timeline) and Facebook (story) but not Facebook Group option.  \n\nThe only way I can select a photo to share it on a FB group is to start a post in the group and then choose Photo, which opens not the Google Photos app with its various navigation features, but a matrix of small , severely CROPPED images that are often too small or too cropped to tell if the one I am looking at is the one I want.  \n\nThis is extremely irritating, enough so that I think I will have to sell the pixel and go to iPhone.  This USED TO WORK.  Is it a Facebook issue?  I don't know.  It begins with Google Photos lack of a Share icon for selecting FB Groups.  Facebook does not reply to my requests for help so maybe it is their fault.  But whatever, it has been going on for nearly a year now and no one is fixing it and it really irritates me.  Maybe someone at Google needs to contact FB and see if between the two of you, you can solve this thing.",
