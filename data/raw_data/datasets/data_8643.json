    "content": "Whenever I connect to my Pixel Bud 2s, two issues arise. These issues persist even after the Buds are disconnected. The only fix I have found is rebooting the phone. Here are the issues:\n\n1) My phone (Pixel 4a) starts to ignore vibrate mode for notifications. The phone still chimes even when the vibration-only icon is displayed on the phone. The problem persists even after cycling through all notification modes.\n\n2) The phone loses the ability to control volume via long-pressing the volume rocker buttons. If I want to change the volume by more than a single notch up or down, several quick successive button presses are needed.\n\nIs there a fix coming for this?",
