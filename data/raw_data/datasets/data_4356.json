    "content": "Was on phone call and received a picture through text (Textra), soon after call dropped and malfunctions started.  Phone flashes off the screen I am on then immediately back on.  Textra, Waze, & Amazon music start to open then close.  When problem first started I also couldn't use Google search or Google Gmail.  Have powered off and restarted.  Have done safe mode restart. Problems still persist.",
