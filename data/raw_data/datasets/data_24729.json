    "title": "Android 10 - Notifications backlight",
    "content": "Prior to the Android 10 Update, notifications on my phone would be much more mellow. The majority of my phone would remain black/dark, and I would only see the text/email/whatsapp/tweet notifications. \n\nNow when they come in, it lights up my whole phone, and I can see the background. The same applies when I used to double tap the screen to \"wake it up\". I used to just see the time/date and any notification icons that were pending. Now the whole screen lights up, including my background. \n\nAny way to go back to how it used to be? Dark mode isn't what I'm looking for. Apart from using less battery this was just a much more way to leaving my phone upright during meetings etc.",
