    "content": "I received a Pixel 4 XL as a gift.\nThe phone is working fine but just wanted to know if I am covered until Google warranty without receipt since it was a gift?\nIs the warranty attached to the phone IMEI or do I need to provide proof of purchase (which I don't have).\n\nI was told that Pixel warranty is attached to the purchaser's google account and no one else can claim it with the original purchaser's email, name, address..etc. \n\nCan someone clarify that?",
