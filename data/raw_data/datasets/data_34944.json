    "content": "My Google pixel 2 XL goes crazy when I am holding it and I think it is the side controls. I have gone into settings and turned off the side controls but it's still acts like it is trying to work. How do I fix this problem because when I am in a call my phone mutes and when I am doing other things the phone goes nuts and goes to different apps.",
