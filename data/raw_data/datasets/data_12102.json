    "content": "I am on youtube premium, everything was fine until after the recent youtube update. If I pause the video on youtube, the screen is active and does not go to sleep mode. Earlier if I pause the video, the screen used to go to sleep, this was good for the security reasons if the video is ended and I am away from my phone.",
