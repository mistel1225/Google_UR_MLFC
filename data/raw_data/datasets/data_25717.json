    "content": "With Android 9, I was able to give an app's persistent notification low importance. This eliminated the the icon in the notification bar and made the notification a single line. When I upgraded to Android 10, this setting remained the same, so I know that apps can have low importance settings in Android 10. \n\nNow I have a new phone and installed the app, but cannot find the setting to make it's persistent notification  low importance. I can make it silent, but the icon remains in the notification bar and the notification itself is several lines long.\n\nThe persistent Google weather and maps notifications are low importance -- they do not have an icon and they are one line tall. How do I give another app that setting?\n\nThanks for your help,\n\n-- Tim",
