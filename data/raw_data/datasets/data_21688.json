    "content": "Good day! please help solve the problem. About 30 percent of the charge remained on the Google Pixel 3A phone and I did not use it for about 40 minutes. After 40 minutes, the phone stopped responding to the on / off button. I tried to restart it. When I put the battery in charge, the charge indicator does not light. The screen is black. I can’t turn it on, although I didn’t turn it off. What to do?",
