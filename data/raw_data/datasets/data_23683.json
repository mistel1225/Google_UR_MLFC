    "content": "Good evening. Posted are the screenshots I just took a couple minutes ago. My phone is currently 98% storage being used, and most of the storage is being used up by the images. Once I clicked the image icon, the only option available are the screenshots I took. What is wrong? And is it possible I could fix this? I also have images within my photos but the photos are only using 160 mbs. Please help!",
