    "content": "I currently have the Google Pixel 2. The battery has swelled, but I am out of warranty, so I am considering upgrading to the Pixel 3. I am currently in Japan, however, and will not be returning to the US for three weeks. I have a couple questions:\nWould the Japanese Pixel 3 support the frequencies used in the US?\nI currently use Google Fi. Would an unlocked Japanese Pixel 3 be able to use my Google Fi sim?\nAll Japanese phones have the shutter automatically enabled when taking photos. Because I would be using this in the US with an American sim, would the shutter sound be something Iâ€™d be able to disable?\n~",
