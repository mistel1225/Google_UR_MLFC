    "content": "I'm on my 2nd RMA... Original device was purchased directly from Google 3/2/19, it bricked 5/31/19 after being on my Incipio Ghost 15W wireless charger. I put it down to charge, went to sleep and woke up to an unresponsive device. Received a replacement 6/4/19. Did the same as before and on 6/6/19 the issue has repeated. I haven't even sent the 1st device back yet so I now have nearly $2,000 being held on my card and the best I can look forward to is a refurbished device in place of my mint 3 month old phone, an estimated week without a phone at all, and probably having to toss 4x Incipio wireless chargers that I have scattered throughout my home and office because I can't trust that wireless charging works. I've had a Nexus 4, Moto X, Nexus 5, BOTH Nexus 7s, Nexus 5X, Pixel 1 & Pixel 3 and this is my first real warranty issue, but it seems to be an actual issue...\n\nReference: https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/9rbzha/pixel_3xl_bricked/",
