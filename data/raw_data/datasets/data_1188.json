    "title": "Shipment using Google provided label got returned by UPS",
    "content": "I am supposed to send my Pixel 4a to Google for repairs. I have already payed for the service and received a package from Google to ship the device in. However UPS has now returned the shipment with a reason `Invoice missing, required for export`. The package was opened and repacked.\n\nI have no idea how to proceed or who to contact about this. I need my phone, which is broken for a month now. \n\nThe only option I have now is to print the labels again and send it, but that's probably a waste of time since I guess it would get returned again. Please help me ASAP, I am already regretting I did not go someplace else for repairs.\n\nKind regards,\nVladas",
