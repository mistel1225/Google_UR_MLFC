    "content": "I dont know what else I can possibly do; every youtube video ive watched seems as though their phone is open to more options than my phone because the ways they've suggested to fix the problem, ive tried about every single one and then some from other websites and even the LG website itself to no avail so at this point I dont know what all else I possibly can do, IS THERE ANYBODY OUT THERE WHO CAN HELP ME? Otherwise, I'll be forced to drop my current phone in exchange for one that wont cause me so much grief. My LG STYLO 4 had multiscreen so I assumed of course the STYLO 5 would have it, its the STYLO 4's replacement, who wouldnt assume the same? Regardless its essential to myself and my business that I have the option to view more than one screen at once and that im able to work on both screens at the same time and if my upgradeb or downgrade to the LG STYLO 5 wont allow me to do as such, I will find a different phone provider and a phone that will allow me such options!",
