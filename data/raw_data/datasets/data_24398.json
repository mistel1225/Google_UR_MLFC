    "content": "When I have Spotify playing in the background. I'm finding that the top status bar doesn't disappear when I'm using another full screen app. (Any Gaming app I have tried so far). So whenever I press on the top section of the screen the notification bar will drop down over the screen. \n\nI have tried using these gaming apps without Spotify playing in the background and the status bar disappears automatically\n\n Has anyone else has experienced this issue?",
