    "content": "My Google Pixel 2XL's touchscreen stopped working.  I tried rebooting it, no luck, think it's physically just done.  I have already received a replacement device, but I am wondering if there is ANYWAY to access the stuff on my old phone.  I thought I had backups turned on but seemingly not the case?  I want my photos and stuff.",
