    "content": "Phone app is not keeping the call history current.  The most recent calls that it shows are from Sunday (two days ago) and not anything from today and has been crashing.  I tried to clear my cache, restarted the phone multiple times and having the same issues.  Has anyone had this happen to them recently?",
