    "content": "Hi,\n\nFor the past 2-3 months or so, whenever i leave the house or work (anywhere really where i've been on wifi for a prolonged time), my pixel 3 seems to have issues automatically connecting to regular t-mobile mobile data. it still shows as connected but as soon as i try to actually use any app like spotify or instagram or do a search it either just keeps spinning or says \"no network available\". \n\nEverything seems to work just fine as soon as i do a restart (and luckily that doesn't take too long) but it's still pretty damn annoying to have to do that ... every ... time.\n\ncurious if anyone has had the same issues and if there's a solution to it? didn't have this issue when i first got my phone so i would assume it's an issue from a software update maybe?\n\nappreciate the help!",
