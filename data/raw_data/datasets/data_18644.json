    "content": "I have updated, cleared cache/data, and done a factory reset. Nothing works. 2nd 4 XL with this issue, and 3rd Pixel 4XL in 3 months. I have device protection plan from Google Fi. All they will do is send me another refurbished replacement. How do I get a new, not refurb phone or a refund? I'm about done with these phones.",
