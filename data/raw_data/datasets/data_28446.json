    "content": "I have been able to toggle between the eSIM and SIM in AP, lots of clicks but it was reliable and quick.\n\nWith the AQ update, I can no longer switch between the two.  If I physically install the SIM card, it asks if I want to use 2 numbers, loads the second SIM and works with that one.  If I switch back to the eSIM, physical SIM must be removed and reinstalled to get it working again.  Only one can be active at a time (no DSDS), I get that.  I just want to be able to toggle between the two.  \n\nWhat am I doing wrong?",
