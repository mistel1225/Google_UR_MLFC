    "content": "Hi\n\nAfter speaking to Google Live Chat it seems as though Google are not \"aware\" of the Snapchat Mic \"Chipmunk Issue\" that occurs while recording a Snapchat. \nMy other apps that have built in cameras E.G - Facebook, Instagram & more don't have this issue also the Camera doesn't have this \"Chipmunk Mic\" issue.\nSo it all relies on Snapchat's update they did a few days ago. It has been messed up since then.\nGoogle are also not fixing this issue as it isn't they're \"Problem\" it's Snapchat's.\n\nSteps I've taken to fix the problem\n- Uninstall and re install the app over 20+ times (No Result)\n- Reported this to Snapchat (Won't ever get a reply)\n- Reported it as a bug to Snapchat (Won't still ever get a reply)\n- Reported to Google which they can't do anything as it isn't they're problem and they're \"NOT\" aware of it even though the community is flooded with this issue.\n\nWhoever also says Uninstall and reinstall ur wasting ur time.\nThe more community posts the more Google will notice what they're customers are facing as they're currently blind and can't read what people are having the most issue off.\nWhat really is the point of this community if Google really aren't aware of issues that people are reporting constantly yet they don't listen.",
