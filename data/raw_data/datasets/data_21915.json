    "content": "I've tried to find the setting to Override Do Not Disturb in system apps and third party apps and it doesn't seem to exist anymore. I've had music apps such as Spotify go muted as soon as my Do Not Disturb kick in. I could allow media sounds in DND, but I don't want Instagram, Gmail, Snapchat, etc. to have notifications or media sounds during DND. I'd also like my Trading app to have notifications go through DND in the middle of the night if that's possible.\n\nAre there alternatives to Override Do Not Disturb?",
