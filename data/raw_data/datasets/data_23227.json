    "title": "Why do I lose visual voicemail when I update the phone app?",
    "content": "When I update to the newest version of the phone app I lose visual voicemail and my voicemail notifications are received as unreadable text messages. Visual voicemail doesn't even exist in the settings to try and turn it on and off. When I uninstall the phone app update and go back to the original phone app version, everything works fine, visual voicemail is there and works correctly and I receive voicemail notifications like normal. My wife also had a pixel 3a and has the same issues. We've had the phones about a month now. I've been in contact with the support team multiple times and my carrier multiple times. No one can seem to fix the problem. The only progress I've made is that my carrier said this is a known issue with the pixel 3a. I've left feedback twice and no response and also emailed the app help with no response. Very frustrating spending almost $1000 on these 2 new phones and not have them work correctly.",
