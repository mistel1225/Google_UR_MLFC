    "content": "I want to trade in my pixel 3a XL but I need to factory reset first to get the credit. The only problem is that my phone won't turn on due to water damage and I can't factory reset the phone. I don't want to lose my credit, is this ok to send in or do I need to do some type of manual reset.",
