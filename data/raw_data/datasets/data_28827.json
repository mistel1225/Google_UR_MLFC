    "title": "White Icons/widgets leave mark on screen",
    "content": "I have 2 Widgets for e-mails, the camera icon and the Google Assistant Bar, always in the same place at the home screen.\nThe common thing is that the background of those elements is white.\nWhen I load an app that has a white back ground, use the camera with light colors scene, or just see at something light on the screen, I would see the shape of the widgets and the icons.\nIt´s difficult to show without looking at the phone, but I tried to take a picture of it and attached it here, although it´s way more noticeable looking at it directly.\n\n\nI´ve attached another picture to \"show\" where to look:\n\n\n\nWould this enter under a warranty issue?\n\nThanks,",
