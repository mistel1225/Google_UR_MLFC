    "title": "Phone app isn't working as intended for pixel 5",
    "content": "When I make calls with phone app in my new pixel 5, I can't listen to others in turn they cannot also listen back.\n\n\nI checked with other apps like Whatsapp, everything seems fine means mic and speakers\n\nIs it some settings or update, cannot understand, please help\n\nPS: I bought the phone in Germany, came to India for vacation with Indian sim in slot. Cannot use Google voice app due to location preference, I'm thinking this shouldn't interfere with phone app.\n\nMany thanks in advance,\nYathish",
