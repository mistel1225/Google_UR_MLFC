    "content": "I think I might have found an answer but it's old so maybe there is something better than drag and drop?  I had a lot of things like audiobooks on my SD card LG g6.  Those things did not transfer although it looks like the apps were downloaded again.  Short of using the PC and doing drag and drop for all this stuff, is there an easier way with the connection cable or something?  \nThe pictures I will do with photos.google.com.  \n\nTIA!",
