    "content": "I have a Google Pixel 3 and recently the phone has started dying seconds after it reaches 15% battery charge even on Battery Saver mode. My usage has not changed. I haven't downloaded some heavy load apps or games. The battery level just plummets when it reaches 15%. \n\nWhat's going on? This has to be a joke.",
