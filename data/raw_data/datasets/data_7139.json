    "content": "when buying google pixel 2xl I ran into a specific problem.  After a month and a half, my phone stopped turning on.  He does not respond to any action.  When turned on, there are no vibrations and no signs of life, just like when charging.  And maybe there was a problem with the battery.  But after two months I managed to turn it on and return it to working order.  But I ran into such a problem.  The phone starts to freeze after a while on the off screen and only pressing the power button for ten seconds helps to restore it to working capacity.  During normal operation, it cannot stop working.  Perhaps some kind of energy saving script is triggered when the screen is off, but I do not know what exactly.  Even a factory reset didn't help.  the phone has the latest android 11 update. Thanks in advance for solving the problem.  (the text was written via google translator as the owner is from Russia)",
