    "title": "broken phone replaced with a dud; how do I get the replacement replaced?",
    "content": "My screen cracked, so I opened a replacement ticket.  A \"refurbished\" replacement arrived the next day, which was nice.  However, the replacement turns out to be a dud.  The battery lasts 10 hours, less than half my first phone and not long enough to get through a day.  Both the accelerometer and gyroscope are broken (imagine not being able to turn your phone to landscape mode).  The mic doesn't work (always have to use a Bluetooth mic).  In short, this is a poor replacement.\n\nI want a working phone.  I want a repeat of the original phone replacement process: Google ships me an actually working phone, I transfer my data between phones, I mail back the dud.\n\nI've tried talking to Assurant, who runs Google's warranty service.  They want me to mail my dud phone back first, and only then will they have Google mail me a working phone.  Two problems with that: first, I'll be without my phone for a week, second, I won't have both phones at the same time to smoothly transfer my data.\n\nWhen the mainline warranty replacement process fails, as it has for me, what's my recourse?\n\nI suppose I could file another warranty claim, but then I'd have to pay another deductible.\n\nHow do I get the warranty to work for me?  How do I get back to a working phone?",
