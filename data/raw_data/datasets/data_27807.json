    "content": "My little Island got some of the worst of hurricane Dorian. I took photos of precious things that we had to throw away and damage from the storm with my Pixel 2. Last night, my Pixel 2 said my phone storage was full and the phone was freaking out... cutting off and coming back on etc. So, I went into my files and scrolled through them and didn't see anything that looked important and then deleted all of them. I never dreamed that my pictures would be stored in my files folder, because there is a separate picture folder. All the pictures I took since the storm are gone. I was unable to back them up because we only have very limited and bad internet via data. Can someone please help me to get them back? I've lost so much already. I don't want these to be lost too.",
