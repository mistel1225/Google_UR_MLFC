    "content": "Hi! I've got a 12 month old Pixel 2 XL with malfunctioning power button.\n\nThe error started occurring during the last weeks. At first, the phone quick opened the camera when I single pressed the power button. This happened both when indending to lock the phone or wake the screen. Quick launching the camera normally requires a douple press on the power button.\n\nThe error occurs at least hourly / every other time I press the button.\n\nYesterday I reset the phone to factory standards by deleting everything. After doing this, I was unable to reproduce the malfunction for several hours - the phone worked well. After installing all apps and updates, the malfunction started again.\n\nI'm not 100% sure it's not an hardware error, but I suspect it's software, since the reset seemed to fix the problem. Does anybody know a solution or if it's an known error pending an update?",
