    "content": "Hi! I have a question n relation to Google Assistant Routine.\nI recently bought a Pixel3 and Stand from Google, no problems they are great devices.\nBut I have a very puzzling problem. When I set a Google Assistant Routine to run after my phones morning alarm goes off, the news is always yesterdays, meaning it is always one day out of date. Can anyone tell me why please, is there something I need to set?",
