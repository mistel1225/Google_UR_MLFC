    "content": "I recently brought a usb c adapter and new earphones as I found the pixel ear buds uncomfortable and since I have been using them I have noticed something as when I am on any app other than the phone app ( youtube, chrome or even Netflix) the phone app opens to my missed calls screen.\n\nI don't know why it is doing this. I've exited the app several times and it still opens I even forced it to stop cleared the cache and uninstalled it but it still goes on to the phone app randomly. Can someone help me because this is very annoying I even shut my phone down and tried to restart it but nothing has been working so far  I don't know if it's a bug in the latest software? Or if it has always done this.\n\nThis happened on my pixel 3 xl",
