    "content": "I'm trying to print from coupons.com. The coupons transfer to my print page SOMETIMES and I can print, other times between the webpage and the printer page, the print preview becomes blank. When I change printer settings it stays blank and when I print, it prints a blank sheet of paper. I think this is an issue with the printer page settings because sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't, and sometimes the printable page shows up on the print settings but if I change the printer, the page goes blank. I just bought a new printer because I couldn't print from my phone, so I'm trying to not have to return this one again.",
