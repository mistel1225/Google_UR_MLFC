    "content": "When pressing the volume buttons, my Pixel 3 adjusts the cast volume even though I'm not casting to anything (I've never set up chromecast or any kind of casting from this phone).  If I turn the cast volume down or mute it, after a second it automatically puts it back up to 100%.  I don't want the phone to accidentally cast to some device I'm not actively using.  How can I disable casting and/or change it so the volume keys only affect the phone speaker or any connected bluetooth audio devices?",
