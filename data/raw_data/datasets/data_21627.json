    "content": "I got dust under my lens on my Pixel 4XL and I want to contact google support, but now under covid 19, I can't seem to find any way to get hold of them. All I can see is this forum and twitter. Tried to ask them to call me but it just says it is closed and contact them during business hours.\n\nAny idea?",
