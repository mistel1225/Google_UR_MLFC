    "content": "Installed Android 10 the day it came out (I know, I know...wait for the bugs first...) and mostly like it.  Issue I have is with gestures.  \n\nPrior to gestures, tapping the Home button would minimize an open app and return you to the Home screen (whichever Home screen was last open, primary or one of the secondaries).  Tapping it again would take you to your Primary Home screen.  \n\nUsing gestures, swiping up from the bottom of the screen with an app open returns you to whichever Home screen was open, but I haven't found a way to return to my Primary Home screen without having to manually swipe through the pages to get there.  Swiping up from the bottom of the screen without an app open just opens the app drawer, or, if you do it right, gets you to the list of open/recent apps (and that gesture is a whole 'nother issue and topic!)\n\nAm I missing something or does anyone have a workaround?",
