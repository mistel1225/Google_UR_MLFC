    "content": "I have an unlocked Pixel 5 that I bought directly from the Google Store. I put my Verizon SIM card in it and it worked right away. Fast forward to Nov. 2 when the security update came out. I've been manually checking for the update several times a day and it's never available. On my previous Pixel, I always got the update on the first day and I'd like that to continue.",
