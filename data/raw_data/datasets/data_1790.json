    "content": "I've updated to Android 11 beta. I realize it's in beta, so there will be issues. I'm just trying to see if there is anything I can try to get this app to launch. I have tried the following.\n\nUninstall DJI Fly app.\nRestart phone.\nInstall DJI Fly app.\n\nSame results. App opens to splash screen then closes to the background, which if you tap it, it will just do the same thing.",
