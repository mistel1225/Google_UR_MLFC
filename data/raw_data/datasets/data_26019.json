    "content": "For the last few days, I have been having issues with Google Chrome/Google search not working. If I try to click on a link, it just sits there loading forever. If I search something on the Google search bar at the bottom, it will bring up the results, but the same thing happens if I try to click on a link. The same thing happens if I try to either type in a URL or perform a search on the Google Chrome app (just sits there and loads forever). I tried uninstalling the updates (doesn't completely uninstall the app, for obvious reasons), and reinstalling them, but that did nothing. Just wondering if anyone else has had this problem and what the solution is.",
