    "title": "My pixel 5 has trouble playing audio if I switch apps while connected to Bluetooth",
    "content": "So for some reason this only happens when I am connected to the Bluetooth in my car. I do not have the same issue when I'm using a Bluetooth speaker or headphones. The problem is that I will be playing music on Spotify and then I might open YouTube or a Snap or play an audio message from a friend, only when I switch apps, my phone will be playing the sound but the sound doesn't play through my speakers. Sometimes it works no problem, I will press play on something and it will just play with no issues. Other times it will not play any sound except for the last few seconds of a message or snap (and usually only when I am closing it out of frustration). \n\n Sometimes I'll try disconnecting and reconnecting to the Bluetooth in my car and sometimes it works but it usually doesn't. It seems to be particularly problematic with Facebook Messenger audio messages. I do have more luck when I disconnect and reconnect and then play YouTube videos (and no I'm not watching music videos while I drive lol, there are just some songs I can only find on YouTube).\n\nI don't think it's the Bluetooth in my car because I never had this issue with my previous phone (Galaxy Note 9). I could switch apps no problem and the sound from whatever app was active would play over my speakers just fine.",
