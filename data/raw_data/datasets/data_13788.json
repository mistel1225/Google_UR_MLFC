    "content": "I purchased a USB C to 3.5 mm adapter (link below for reference). The adapter includes a DAC chip which I believe is required for the Pixel 5?\n\nThe issue I have is that my microphone doesn't work through the adapter, audio does however work. I'm plugging wired Bose headphones into the adaptor. While the microphone worked on my previous phone, it doesn't work going through this adapter, despite product reviews suggesting it works with previous Pixels models.\n\nAny recommendations on what adapter I need to get the microphone working through a TRS 3.5 mm plug?\n\nhttps://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B081C5GG1R/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1",
