    "content": "Shortly after the Android 11 Update my camera stopped working.  I did everything I can find online to fix it (looked for .nomedia files, reboot into safe mode, ect.).  As a last resort I factory reset my phone, not only did that not help, but it actually made it worse, now the flashlight doesn't work, says camera is in use.  Any suggestions?",
