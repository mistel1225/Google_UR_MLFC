    "content": "I have a 2018 Civic Si and I am trying to connect my Pixel 2 XL via USB. The phone is able to charge, but there is no Android Auto functionality on the Civic Screen. I cannot use google maps, pandora, etc. \nHow can this be fixed ASAP?\nPS. I have tried 4 separate USB cables, 2 of them, OEM and brand new from GOOGLE. Thank you for wasting my money of buying new cables....now please this fix this issue properly.",
