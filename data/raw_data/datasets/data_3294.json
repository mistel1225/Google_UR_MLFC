    "content": "got a notification today to update my pixel 3. clicked to restart the phone and finish the installation.\nThe phone restarts but after a minute I get a message saying \"cannot load android system\" with the option to \"try again\" or factory reset. Try again is not working, always gets back to this screen.\nLong press on \"try again\" restarts the device without completing the update, after booting I get a message \"couldn't install a system update, tap to learn more\". \"learn more\" take to a page with an installation problem, and option to try again which get the same issues.\nHow to fix this?\nWhy Google does not have its own support for its devices? a customer should not be dependant on the community for help.",
