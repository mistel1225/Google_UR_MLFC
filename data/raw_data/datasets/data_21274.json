    "content": "Ever since I got the Pixel 3a a few months ago I am having Bluetooth issues. I had the original pixel and I did not have any of these issues. It does not auto connect to my car like my old phone did, so I have to re connect it every time and even when I reconnect it , it sometimes just connects for media and not for phone calls, making me need to talk via the speaker of the phone. (Completely defeats the purpose). With my Fitbit, I keep finding I have to delete and reconnect it occasionally to keep it connected. I have tried resetting everything. Multiple times deleting and forgetting the connection and resetting it, for all devices, but the issue keeps happening. Also, this phone keeps turning on driving mode and do not disturb after I have deleted that rule multiple times. I have always used nexus and pixel phones because of its clean android features, but this is very frustrating.  Does anyone have other ideas of what I can do?",
