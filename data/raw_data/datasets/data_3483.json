    "content": "After a factory reset, the mapping of physical touch on the screen to the area the Pixel 5 recognizes as being touched appears to be off. For instance, to select an icon with a label I have to aim for the label at the bottom. If I aim for the actual icon, it selects whatever is above the icon. \nI can't find a way to recalibrate the touch function.\nAny help is appreciated.",
