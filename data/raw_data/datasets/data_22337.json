    "content": "I tried asking Google to recognize a song called \"tell me\" by Tuski on my Pixel 4 XL. I only had 20 seconds of the song at first and my 4xl kept listening to the sing, but wouldn't give me the search results. So then I used my OnePlus 7pro to look up the song with the Google Assistant on that phone and it gave me the song right away.  The white background was the OnePlus 7pro and the earth wallpaper is the Pixel 4XL",
