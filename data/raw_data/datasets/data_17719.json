    "content": "I tried searching this, and didn't find much answers. Some suggested that it was due to being in the play store beta. I am not in the beta.\n\nWhen I search the play store on my P4XL, the D+ app doesn't show up. If i visit play.google.com, I can find it, but it shows my Pixel 4XL is not compatible. My Pixel 3XL is compatible.\n\nI am not rooted, and I am not in beta for Play Store or Android.\nIf it helps, my bootloader is unlocked.\n\nCan anyone currently find and install Disney+ on their Pixel 4 XL, so I know whether or not I am alone on this?",
