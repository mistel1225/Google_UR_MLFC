    "content": "On my phone, the horizon indicator on the camera mode does not work properly. The phone is in the upright position. The horizon bar in camera mode is tilted to the right by 4 degrees. The phone has been factory reset. The phone has been launched in safe mode. The problem still hasn't gone away. How can I fix this error? Please tell me how can I calibrate the gyroscope? ",
