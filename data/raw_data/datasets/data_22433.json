    "content": "Just installed the Mar5 update today -- after reboot, the phone's connectivity has been completely bricked, showing \"No SIM installed\" (verified with multiple SIM cards), unable to turn on wifi, and unable to access most connectivity and network settings without the Settings \"app\" either freezing or crashing. Two factory resets have not solved anything.\n\nAny ideas, helpful folks -- or did this update just cost me a thousand bucks?",
