    "content": "My wifes Pixel 3 will not properly connect via USB to our car stereo. It will connect momentarily, but once you select an app to use it promptly shuts down and says it cannot connect. However, I can plug my Pixel 3 into the same stereo using the same cable and it works flawlessly. Seems like it might be a hardware issue, unfortunately she has already had here Pixel 3 replaced twice for hardware issues. Hoping there is a fix.",
