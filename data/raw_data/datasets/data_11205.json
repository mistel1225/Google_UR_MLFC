    "content": "I saw the bubble notification in Android 11. It works also but not for all chat heads in messenger. It doesn't work for whatsapp too!!! When I got a message from messenger as a bubble. I opened that but in that same time I received another message from messenger from different person as bubble I wasn't able to open that. When I clicked on that for open that showed me nothing. It qas showing me previous person's messages. \n\nI don't know that this thing is happening for everyone or not!!! \nI am requesting to fix this ... Really it is so annoying.",
