    "title": "My replacement is worse than the phone before. What can I do? This is my third Pixel 2.",
    "content": "I had issues with my replacement Pixel 2 with Android Auto. The techs at Bestbuy determined the phone was at fault -- other Android phones worked fine with my car stereo, and mine didn't work with other Android Auto stereos. I was sent a replacement for my replacement -- same issues as before but now bluetooth has a range of six inches, all with devices that worked fine with the previous Pixel 2 phones. At this point I would be happy with any old Android phone supported by Google Fi. This phone is the worst I've ever owned.",
