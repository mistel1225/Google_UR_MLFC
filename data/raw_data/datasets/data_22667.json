    "content": "Before the update when taking a photo, you could adjust for the light source to get a clearer picture. There was an icon in the upper right corner and you could select if it was cloudy, sunny, florescent, tungsten, etc. But I went to take a photo today if my cat in the house and it looks so yellow because of the light source and those adjustments are gone!",
