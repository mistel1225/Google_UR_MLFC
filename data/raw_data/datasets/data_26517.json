    "content": "Is Google ever going to increase the display brightness on the Pixels? My 3 XL is completely unusable in sunlight. The display is so washed out it's barely even visible. It appears that the Pixel 4 is going to be the same story. I still pre-ordered the 4 XL but I'm very disappointed.\n\nI don't understand why Google can't make the panel bright, we all know these panels are more than capable of reaching at least 1,000 nits. Apple and Samsung already do this and yet Google is here with a measly 444 nits on the 4 XL.\n\nIf Google is worried about burn in I don't think that's a valid reason to kill the feature, simply inform users that it increases burn in. All Google needs to do is copy Apple and Samsung. The brightness slider lets you adjust from 2 nits to 444 nits and when the phone detects it is in direct sunlight it goes to at least 800+ nits. And if Google is worried about battery life I don't feel that is valid either. I would much rather have my phone use every watt it can muster and be visible outside rather then just be useless. I have chargers everywhere I go so I am not worried about battery at all.",
