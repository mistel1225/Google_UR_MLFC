    "content": "My pixel 3a will not charge when it is powered on, also after plugging phone it it decides to power its self back up stopping the ability to get charged up any further... I have rebooted, safe mode, factory defaulted etc. \n\nTried multiple different chargers I know work with other devices, tried plugging into USB port on computer etc.\n\nThis phone is just a year old and I still owe money on it, what gives?",
