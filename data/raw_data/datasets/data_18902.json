    "content": "I believe there's a problem with the charging port in my phone. It win't allow the cable to enter fully. I've tried both ends of the charging cable and an adaptor but nothing seems to work. I've also tried to check for dirt/blockages, and see if the central plate is bent. I can't see anything off, so I'm stumped. Does anyone have any suggestions?\n Thank-you for taking the time to read:)",
