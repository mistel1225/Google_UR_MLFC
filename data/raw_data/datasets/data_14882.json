    "content": "I have several Play Store game apps that have stopped loading properly since the System 11 upgrade. The security upgrade has not made the situation better. Games load 2/3rds up or more and then just hang indefinitely. These are games you play online - some against live competitors. I have cleaned caches, storage, uninstalled & reinstalled to no avail.
