    "content": "I use the native app on my Pixel 3 to receive notifications from my Google Calendar, but the notifications are screwy. 1) They aren't in chronological order. If today in Monday, I will get a notification of an appointment Tues at 3 pm, below that one of Wed at 9 am, and below that one for Tues at 5 pm and then Tues at 8 am. I want them to be in order. 2) If I have an appt tomorrow, it notifies me with \"Appointment tomorrow at 7\". Then, when it is tomorrow, it still says \"Appt tomorrow\" instead of \"Appt today\". How can I get the message to change?",
