    "content": "Ever since my phone did an update about 3 weeks ago I noticed that my GPS is not working correctly on my Google pixel 4XL. When they open Uber or when they open Google Maps and doesn't detect where I am anymore it only shows where I was before which was like not even close to where I am now I don't know what to do",
