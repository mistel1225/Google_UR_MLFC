    "content": "**Update:** \n\n\nLooks like Google have fixed this. I am on Pixel 3 and now I can see history of selected contact with date and call duration. \n\n----\n\nI followed this: \nhttps://support.google.com/phoneapp/answer/2811854?hl=en  \n\nIt says:  \nYouâ€™ll see details for each call made to that number, like when it happened, how long it was, and whether it was incoming or outgoing  \n\n\nBut I am not able to see all calls. All I see is single day's call. \nWhen I click on call details of contact whom I called today, it shows me all calls I made to him today. \nIf I click on call details of same contact from some earlier day, it shows all calls made to him on that particular day.   \n\n\nI contacted customer care.  We did screen share. We cleared cache and uninstall updates of Phone app.  But still the same.  \n\nAnyone else facing same issue?  \n\nPixel 3,   stock phone app.",
