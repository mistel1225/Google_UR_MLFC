    "content": "I've returned one phone to Google already. I have exactly the same issue with the new handset. My calls cut off and I have to connect to my WiFi calling to use my phone. My phone only works properly when I'm connected to the WiFi. I go out for walks and cant listen to music, or even download music etc... It's so annoying.",
