    "content": "Does my existing phone number transfer to new phone with other data or do I need to do something with that to make it happen. I see how to \"move\" to the new phone, but not that the phone number also goes. I see there's a list of what gets transferred but the phone number is not mentioned. Thanks in advance.",
