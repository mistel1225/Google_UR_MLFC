    "content": "I'm getting a data limit warning but can't find anything on what I should do about it.\nDo I need to delete anything to create space? If so what sort of things should I delete?\n(I just upgraded from pixel 3 to pixel 3XL but that didn't make any difference... I still get the data warning.\n\nIs this okay as is, or do I need to do something about it?\nIf so, what?\n\nThanks,\nMark Dorfman",
