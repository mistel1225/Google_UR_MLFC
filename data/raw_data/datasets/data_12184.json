    "content": "My google pixel 4a screen cracked and needs to be replaced. All uBreakiFix locations close to me (Milburn, Paramus, Kearny, Carlstadt, Paramus) are unable to fix or provide a timeline of when they can fix. Seems they have not been receiving parts to replace screens for 3A and 4A for quite sometime and do not have any information on when they will receive in future. What are my options? I am in the Parsipanny, NJ area.",
