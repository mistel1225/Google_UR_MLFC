    "content": "Ok so I've got a pixel XL \nI had severe battery problems with it \nI just got the battery replaced with an original Google pixel battery \nThe problem is that it shuts off at any time any percentage. You're in luck if it runs for a while\nThen when it reboots it shows the battery to be at 50% which for sure isn't the real battery percentage\nEven if I charge it at that state it won't go above 50 and it's bound to shut off any minute\nOk so right now I decided to clear the cache partition. First I left it on charge for half an hour so to get some juice in it. Then when I tried to press the power and volume up button to to as intended. It just vibrates and shows the battery sign with a lightning bolt \nRefuses to let me boot in that screen or in safe mode  ( I have already performed multiple factory resets) \nAnd even when it does turn on it shows that dreaded 50% battery percentage \nI dearly request anyones help that is my main phone without possibility of buying another. I do have a feel it's down to something in the software but after all any expert that knows what's wrong please advise \nP.s: I've cross checked all chargers and wires and performed mulyie factory rests",
