    "content": "I just got my new pixel 4 XL delivered today. After setting it up I went to check out the camera and it was working fine until I clicked on the portrait mode. As soon as I click it it freezes up and the app crashes. When I open it up again the camera goes black and no image shows. When I restart the device it works fine but as soon as I hit portrait the same thing happens. After it freezes and blacks out I can't even use face id. I don't know if it's just an issue with my device, anyone else had the same issue?",
