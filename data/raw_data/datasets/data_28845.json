    "title": "Yesterday got an automatic OS update. Android 9 on Pixel 1. After the restart, it just died.",
    "content": "Got an OS update request yesterday. Latest update for Android 9. Have to restart the phone. After the restart apps started to hang, have to reboot the phone to be able to access anything again. Even Google Feed was hanging. This morning, about 8 hours after update, the phone just died and can not be booted again. Not even to Android boot loader. Like the battery is dead. Got it to a local phone service, told me the battery is fine, they have no idea what's wrong.",
