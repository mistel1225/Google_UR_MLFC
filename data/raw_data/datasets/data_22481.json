    "content": "Hi,\n\nAs described here (https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/6118421?hl=en) you can pin/unpin screens. This has works as long as i can remember. \nFor whatever reason this does not work anymore. To be more specific: When i swipe up and hold, i see the previous apps, but when i click at the top on the app icon, nothing happens.\n\nIs there an issue with the Pixel launcher?",
