    "content": "Hello, everyone,\nreading the mail with pixel gogole and configured gmail to read different boxes of other managers, I happen not to understand what are the latest emails received: I appear the new emails in the list, but when I go there to click on me proposes them in a messy way, often mixing the senders (groups them by subject I think)\nI've tried to change some configurations but I still can't read the emails simply in chronological order.\nDoes anyone know how to do this?\nThank you",
