    "content": "My battery drains very quickly. Read many comments however couldn't see any solution to the problem.\nI do not buy the solution with battery replacement for a 3 years old phone used for emails and browsing.\nReally disappointed with Google products\n1. Pixel 1 is a Google replacement - refurbished as the previous one had a microphone problem\n2. Nexus 9 software is not working after 3 years.\n\nAny help please?",
