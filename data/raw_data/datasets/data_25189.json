    "content": "I bought Pixel 3 from amazon a received it last week. I'm in love with the phone. However, i just noticed that there's this like stain about 2 cm long (diameter) in the upper right side of the display, near the power button. It is barely noticeable and only seen when the screen displays a dark color (Dark gray for example, like twitters dark mode) and the screen brightness is about 30 to 60%. It is a white stain tho. The screen has no performance issues. I haven't dropped the phone or done anything that could damage the screen.\n\nShould I worry about this? Will it become worse with time? Should I return the phone?\n\nThe phone works flawlessly but this drives me crazy because it makes me think that it will become a real problem later on.\n\nThank you!",
