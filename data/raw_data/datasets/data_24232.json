    "title": "Why would Google Maps Timeline and Google fit suddenly stop tracking location on Pixel 3",
    "content": "Out of the blue on this past Saturday , my pixel 3 just stopped tracking via timeline and Google fit which I use both quite frequently. I\"ve done nothing different with my phone as far as changes, so am curious if there's a known issue. My location is showing correctly in google maps , so what gives? This has happened one time before  and it eventually corrected itself and started working again, but kind of want to keep using Google fit and timeline.",
