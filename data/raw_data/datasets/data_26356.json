    "content": "Hi all\n\nHopefully can find some help here. When I pull the drop down notifications to view them (ie swipe from the top down)there is a white bar that covers up the bottom of the notification (see attached photo). I can't see the quick options (ie reply or mark read) and if I do reply I am unable to see what I am typing. Anybody have a fix for this? Appreciate the help !",
