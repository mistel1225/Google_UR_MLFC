    "content": "Yesterday I had three apps not want to open. They'd open and then close a second or two later. I've not checked every single app on my phone.  Uninstalling the apps and reinstalling seems to have worked for two of them. But the same thing is happening with my Gmail, which is a Google app on a Google phone. \n\nI've done a force stop. I've disabled the app. I've cleared the cache. I've restarted my phone numerous times in between all these attempts to fix it. I even shut it down overnight and it's still misbehaving this morning upon start up.  Still nothing. \n\nI'm not sure what else to try. I'd love to hear any good suggestions. I can't update the phone, updates ended a few months ago. I've seen that some people are having trouble because of an update. I don't think I get updates from Google any longer. I paid nearly $900 for this phone and I'm not ready to buy a new one yet.",
