    "content": "I am facing two problems for my Pixel 3 XL\n(1) Cannot detect the google earbuds - The problem just happened today without any system update. I tried the earbuds in other Pixel phone and it is working well; but when I tried to plug it in my phone, there was completely no reaction from my phone. It did not detect the earbuds. I can still charge the phone therefore the Type C connector should have no problem?\n\n(2) Cannot turn off the phone - When I have the above problem, I tried to fix it by turning off the phone for a while. However, after it is off, it will be on automatically. I can never switch it off.\n\nI already re-set the phone by erasing all data, still nothing is solved.\n\nAny suggestion please?\n\nTony",
