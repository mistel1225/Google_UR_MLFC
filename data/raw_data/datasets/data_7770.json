    "content": "Several times now I am on hold on a call. Looking at phone. Screen goes black. Still can hear the place I called. No amount of doing anything brings the screen back to life. Other then holding volume button and power button to get into being able to reboot. Which when it occurs the phone is back to normal. And I call again with no issues.\nNo screen protector.\njgm",
