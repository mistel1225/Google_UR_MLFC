    "content": "My new pixel 3a initially connected fine with car bt audio system and podcasts, music etc all played through my car speakers. Yesterday, the audio dropped and now any audio plays through the phone even though it is connected to the car system. I have unpaired and re paired both several times and checked all the usual Bluetooth settings on my phone. This is very annoying and I would appreciate any further suggestions!",
