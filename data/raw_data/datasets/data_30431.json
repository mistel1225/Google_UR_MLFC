    "content": "I have both the dongle and UsbC Pixel buds and still cannot listen to anything. They just don't register as plugged in or work at all. Every forum about this has gone UNRESOLVED. That's beyond ridiculous. I'm not factory resetting my phone again. I've cleaned the port. My charger works fine and my dongle and buds work on other devices. No, I will not use Bluetooth headphones. I need them for 8hrs+ and nobody has time to charge their headphones every couple hours.",
