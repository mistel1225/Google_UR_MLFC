    "title": "pixel 3a XL has charging issue.Why doesn't it start charging automatically after plug in the cable?",
    "content": "Since May 2019, I'm using my pixel 3a XL. After few weeks it started showing that \"android system: Charging connected devices via USB\". Previously we can chat with Google help support operators who guided us. Though this option is no longer exit. However, the charging issue again started showing few months back.  Every single time I have do the 3 step process to start the charging. \n1. Though it's a C-type cable, it doesn't work if I change the position. So i marked it and used it like USB cable, meaning if the marked part going downwards  , it won't bother to start charging whatever I do for next steps.\n\n2. Need to click on the silent notification. Which is \"android system: Charging connected devices via USB\"\n3. Select this device, then starts charging.\n\n, Sometimes I go to USB preferences to switch it to \"charge connected devices\", but didn't bother to change.\n\nI noticed so many people are facing this. Still Google never try to resolve this. And stop saying rebooting in safe mode, after the new android update, there's no option of that. It just restarts and still same issue.\n\nN.B. I bought this phone from Singapore, currently stuck in pathetic country Malaysia due to pandemic.",
