    "content": "Hello,\n\nThe issue I'm having:  The minimum media volume setting is still way too loud.  \n\nI'm listening to Pandora over my Bluetooth headphones.  I like to listen to music on a very low volume while at work, so I've adjusted the media volume slider to the lowest setting.  However it's still really loud.  \n\nIs there another way to adjust the volume?  Maybe instead of a slider..  a way to manually input a %?  the slider feels like it's skipping a step between mute and the next available setting.    \n\nThank!",
