    "content": "Closing my app (completely closing by swiping up from current open app list screen) doesn't stop the app from continuing to play podcasts. The only way to get the app to stop is by completely relaunching the app. In addition to it keep playing when it should stop completely, there isn't any easy swipe showing 'now playing' that would allow me to stop it as secondary option.",
