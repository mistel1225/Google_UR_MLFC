    "content": "Pixel 4 (using Google Fi) restarts randomly during long calls (typically business calls). This is typically a very quick reboot, and has happened 5 or 6 times a week, sometimes one after the other (eg. am on the call for a couple of minutes, reboots, call in again, couple of minutes pass, second reboot).\n\nHave factory reset the Pixel 4 and replaced it under warranty for another Pixel 4, but the issue persists. Unfortunately the Google Fi support team keeps telling me to repeat the same troubleshooting steps, followed by another replacement under warranty. Is anyone experiencing similar problems? Any solutions out there?",
