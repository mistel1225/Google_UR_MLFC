    "content": "Rebooting didn't help. I've had no problems with my phone u til the Android 10 update. The battery drains quicker. It's slower to charge. The I fo at the very top of the screen where the time is and where it shows wifi status, battery status etc are double stacked like I see it twice and it's overlapping. If I could add a screenshot I would. I also despise the background being white when I swipe up to see my apps. Even on the lowest brightness it's awfully bright at night. ðŸ™„",
