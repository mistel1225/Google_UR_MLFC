    "content": "I read that a long hold on the power button followed by a long press on the screen shot option would offer a screen record option, but my 4 XL doesn't do it. I also read that I was an option for a while, but google disabled it and it might come out on the next update. Sadly, it's still but there today, so I'm wondering 1. When it might be coming 2. Why they would allow it and then remove the option",
