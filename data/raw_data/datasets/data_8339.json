    "content": "I bought a phone a few days ago. Yesterday, by inserting the headphone plug into the socket, I damaged them. Now the mini-jack plug does not go into the socket, there is no debris in the socket, but I can see a small bent plate inside. Google - shame on you. I want to connect the headphones via the USB-C- mini-jack adapter, but I only have the Apple A2155 adapter and unfortunately it does not work. I read on the internet that this adapter should work. Can someone confirm or deny it?",
