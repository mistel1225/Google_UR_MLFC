    "content": "Google Pixel 1\nThe phone does not boot after the OTA update. It does not boot in OS and recovery mode. Loader locked\nThere is a Chinese man who somehow unlocks the bootloader through Teamwire. Tell me, maybe there is some official solution from Google for Pixel 1, because the phone works, but the OS does not work, and without the OS I can not unlock the bootloader (I can not check the box \"Unlock OEM\" in developer mode). And a secondary question, why can a Chinese person help with a problem (for money), but Google support can't help with this problem?\n\nI'm sorry for my google transate english)",
