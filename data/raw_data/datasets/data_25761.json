    "content": "When I linked my Pixel to my new Pixel 4, The new phone became linked to the wrong account (which is a GSuite account that I am not Admin, only a user).  The Pixel knows all my accounts, but thinks the phone 'belongs' to the wrong one (sends admin emails, etc.)  I want to change my Pixel 4 setting such that the Primary email (service messages, autolink GSuite Admin, etc.) is linked to a different account (which is a paid corporate GSuite account that I am admin).  I still want both accounts on the phone (along with several others, most of which are also GSuite).  How would I do this?",
