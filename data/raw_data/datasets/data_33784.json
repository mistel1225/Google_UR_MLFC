    "title": "Play Games screen recording has extremely long video duration",
    "content": "When using Play Games screen recorder to record a short ~30 second clip from games such as Golf Clash or Bloons Tower Defense 6, the video shows up as anywhere from 6 minutes, to 10 hours or even just recently, over 62 hours long. The actual clip when opening it to view plays fine, but sometimes it's in the middle of the video, or even the end. Because the video length is recorded as such a long duration, it doesn't allow me to upload to some apps (Hangouts, YouTube, etc.) nor does it allow me to open/edit with other apps.\n\nHas anyone else encountered something similar? I'm having no luck finding a resolution to this issue.\n\nI've factory reset my phone, so it may be an issue with a specific app that I have installed.",
