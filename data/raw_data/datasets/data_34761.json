    "content": "My Pixel phone doesn't wanna play any type of media unless it's connected to a bluetooth audio device. I'm pretty shure the problem has to do with the audio because when I play a video with no audio it plays perfectly. I've factory reset it way too many times and it only gets fixed very few times. Please someone help me. I've tried everything.",
