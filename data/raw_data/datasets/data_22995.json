    "content": "At home I used WIFI calling.  Verizon does not have the strongest signal in my home.  Whenever someone calls me there is a 1-2 sec delay before they can hear me.  For example If I answer and say hello, they cannot hear me.  So they start saying hello first.  I sometimes see the message on my screen pop up that it switches over to wifi calling.  Anyone have a fix for this.",
