    "content": "Hello,\nI recently bought a Google Pixel 3.\nI played music on my USB C earphones (got them when I bought the phone) and it was fine until they stopped working with no reason.\nSo, I bought a bluetooth JBL (works fine too) but, recently, I had a ear problem and I can't put my JBL on. So, i bought regular earphones (Sony's) and when I plug them on the USBC/Jack adaptator, they doesn't work.",
