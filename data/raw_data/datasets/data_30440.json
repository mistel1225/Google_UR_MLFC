    "content": "I got my Google Pixel 3XL on December 24 2018. The battery was amazing for the first few months. I could go almost two days without having to charge it.  Now I charge it at night while I am sleeping. When I take it off the charger in the morning when I wake up it automatically goes down 2 percent. By the time I get to work it has went down to almost 90% battery life. I have not used it for the 20 minute car ride to work. I have tried everything and my phone says the battery is fine and everything is running normal. What else can I do.",
