    "content": "I found my rear camera can't focus and the images are very blurry like 144p quality.  And it seems fine within range of 5 to 10 cm.  It seems not relate to the camera app as same situation happens for WhatsApp photos, Instagram etc.  Is this a camera bug from Google and is there any solutions for this?",
