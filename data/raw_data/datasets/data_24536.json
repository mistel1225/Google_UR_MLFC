    "content": "Hi,\nWith my Pixel 4 XL, I am trying to update the system, but it always failed.\nSo I try via the recovery mode, but I am getting the famous android mascot which says \"NO COMMAND\".\nI manage to get out of it and do a factory reset.\n\nI do not update anything, no sim card, no wifi, no downloaded app, but still, I am getting NO COMMAND in the recovery mode.\n\nCheers",
