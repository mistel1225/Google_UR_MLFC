    "content": "I've been having this issue with my Pixel 3 for a while now. The wifi doesn't stop working even after turning it off. The online support had suggested resetting the wifi settings previously which worked at that time but now when I tried resetting the issue is still there which is really odd behavior. \n\nPlease suggest some solution as this is not too acceptable of a bug and doesn't get fixed after several updates.. \n\nThanks.",
