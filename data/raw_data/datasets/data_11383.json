    "title": "Media Stops, Consistent Issue",
    "content": "This is a weird one. Whenever I start playing media on my phone, typically podcasts, the media will just pause after about 4 to 5 minutes. Once I restart it it plays fine and doesn't stop again. This only happens the first time I start an app during a session of listening/watching. For example:\n\n-Start podcast on Doggcatcher, stops at about 4 minutes, plays fine after\n-Switch to pandora, stops at about 4 minutes, plays fine after,\n-Repeat ad nauseum\n\nMy phone is up to date and the apps are up to date. Is this some sort of setting issue? Do I need to do a factory reset to resolve this?",
