    "content": "Pixel 3, 2 months old, freezes whenever it goes to sleep. Only way to wake up the phone other than hard restartis by plugging in charger. When someone calls me it never rings in the phone and goes to voicemail. Called Google help desk and they are not helpful, as they want me to send the device so that they give me a replacement and it will take 10 days. Unfortunately I can't use my backup phones on the carrier, no loaner available from carrier either. Google said they can't do anything other than make me wait 10 days!!! Seriously I have apple phone and they have physical location everywhere and I get a new phone iin minutes!! This all online thing with Google and no plan b for consumers using single pixel device! So if u buy pixel make sure you have another primary phone, because if pixel stops working(by the look of it most of them does have defects) you will be without ur phone for 10 days!!!! Never buying another piece of hardware from this company again. Fix your warranty process or sorry we are better off with apple or Samsung.",
