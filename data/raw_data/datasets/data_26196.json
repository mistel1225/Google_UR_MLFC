    "content": "Hi all,\n\nI have tried taking photos using night sight mode, at night, of scenes where there is a prominent light source. In one instance a street lamp and in another a full moon. I've noticed a blue spot/flare/reflection that seems to move as I move the camera to focus. It seems to be a light being emitted from the camera itself. I'm guessing some sort of focus function. When I zoom in user pinch to zoom via the camera the spot becomes larger. I'm green when it comes to photography matters, so maybe someone can explain the effect as well why the camera is doing that. Is this a bug? I've read reports about the halo effect and the circumstances under which that effect was reproduced seems similar to my issue.",
