I picked it up one day to find it was on the startup screen that simply says 'google'. after about 30 seconds of being stuck on this screen (sometimes it make it partway through the phase with a multicolored G) a white bar or random pixels will appear on screen, then the screen will turn of for about 10 seconds. then, the process repeats. i have tried the bootloader screen, but restart bootloader and recovery mode options were red. is there any way to fix this issue?\n\nedit:now the device is stuck on the boot up screen and will not turn off.",
