    "content": "Switched from an iPhone 6 to a Pixel 4 so I admit there is an \"unlearning\" curve :D\n\nIs there a way to have a banner display on the lock screen to show missed calls?  All I seem to have is the blue dot on the phone icon circle which only shows if I unlock my phone.  Frankly that is not nearly enough for me to notice.  Even on the lock screen there are five tiny icons, one of them being a phone with an arrow bouncing off of it.  Is there a way to have banners similar to iPhone \"Missed Call (x)\" ?",
