    "content": "For the last several days, I've had no sound from any alerts, notifications, call-rings.  Media plays ok though, and so do sounds for navigating the OS (tapping on menus, etc.)  I've tried everything, was on tech support chat for an hour yesterday, tried safe mode, even a factory reset.  Oh, and my wife's identical phone started behaving the same way a few days ago, but for hers the alarm does make sound.  Vibration is all we've got for calls and texts, etc.",
