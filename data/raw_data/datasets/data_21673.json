While video chatting or in photos I can see this.\nPreviously I thought it is a software issue, now even after April 2020 update it is evident.\n\nMy wife also has a Pixel 3XL and I can see this starting in her phone as well. Please suggest.\nI can only see this growing and making the phone completely useless.",
