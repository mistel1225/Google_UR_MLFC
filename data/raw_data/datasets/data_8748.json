    "content": "The Pixel 5 camera will automatically use Night Sight every time I open the camera app in low light, forcing me to press the button to disable it, and it won't remember the off setting for the next time I open the camera.\n\nIt is very inconvenient to have to turn it off every time I open the app to take a picture, and there is already a separate Night Sight mode to choose from in the menu. \n\nHow can I permanently turn auto Night Sight off without having to do it every time I open the app?",
