    "content": "Whenever I try to type any thing in the search bar of Google search, it may be the search bar at the bottom of my screen or at the app of Google it just shutts off the search and returns to the previous page. I tried checking of updates and also cleaned some heavy files in my device, also did try restarting the device a few times but nothing seems to work please resolve this issue.",
