    "content": "Brand new 4a5G, replacing an older iphone, trying to stay connected to my aftermarket car stereo. - I drive the car, turn the car off, go about my business, turn the car on again, the phone is supposed to automatically reconnect to the car stereo, the older iphone does just fine, instead it says there is some kind of error and then makes me manually reconnect to the car stereo, and I do, and then it works just fine, but it's not automatic, and I need it to be.  I'm running low on time to return this phone, so I need to work it out soon.  I'm considering a factory reset of the phone, but don't know how to yet. - help!  If I can get it to work, even better!",
