    "content": "Yesterday bought a Pixel 4a after years with my trusted Nexus 5. Sadly very frustrated with the lack of compatible  USB-C to USB-C cable  chargers and car chargers in the stores. Haven't found one that works other than the USB-C to USB-C cable charger that came with the phone.\n\nI live in British Columbia where Hands Free phone use is the law so having a car charger and phone mount is must. Hence I'm almost at the stage of returning the phone as finding USB-C to USB-C cable chargers and car chargers is a real time waster as well a hit and miss as not all  USB-C to USB-C cables are equal\n\nWould appreciate some help or pointers to  USB-C to USB-C cable chargers and car chargers that work as the household mobiles are all Google.\n\nCheers from sunny Vancouver,\n\nNeil",
