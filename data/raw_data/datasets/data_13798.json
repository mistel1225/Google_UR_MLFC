    "content": "I was using a random app (cant remember which). The battery was sitting at around 41% then suddenly it froze for about 5 seconds then it shut off/went black.\n\nI have tried all the trouble shooting options given y 'pixel phone help' but none of them worked. Connecting to PC, giving time to charge, volume and power buttons at same time etc.\n\nThe 'find my device' last located my phone at the time I was using just before it died. So I assume its not just the screen.\n\nHas anyone bricked there phones due to a recent update? Help.\n\nEDIT: Grammar and spelling.\nEDIT2: Also my 1 year warranty expired 4 days ago ( - _ - )",
