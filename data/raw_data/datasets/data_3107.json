    "content": "I cannot print from my phone to my brother MFC-J485DW printer. When I got the printer I had a Samsung phone and used brother's  I print and scan app. For a few weeks, I could print if I unplugged the printer and plugged it back in about 10 minutes later. Now it won't work at all with this phone. My husband just got a new Apple 12 mini phone. I installed the same app, I print and scan, and am able to print from his phone.",
