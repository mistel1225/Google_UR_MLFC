    "content": "This is the first phone (pixel 3) that doesn't work when connecting a Square credit card magstripe reader through the USB dongle.  It seems to assume it's an audio device and says it's unsupported.  I need a magstripe reader option for my business and didn't expect this trouble with a google flagship device, when samsung, droid, etc. all work in this feature.",
