    "content": "I have left my device on charge overnight and when I woke up it was dead. I changed the charger and I tried hard reset, but nothing seems to work. I tried pressing the power button for sometime and i also tried pressing the power button with lower volume button for more than 30 seconds while plugged in, but it didn't work either. The phone was placed close to heating source while charging, could that have damaged the phone in any way?? I need help",
