    "content": "I've had my Pixel 4XL for 3 days now. Upon first trying to use Google Assistant, it goes to a window saying it needs an additional download, but every time I hit \"start download\" it goes to the loading screen then says \"An error had occurred. Make sure you're online and try again\". I let the phone finish setting up, tried it again, same result. Rebooted, checked for updates, gave it a few days, nothing seems to work. Only other thing I can think of is a reset, but that's my last resort. Any other suggestions? ",
