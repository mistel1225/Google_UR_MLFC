    "content": "I've been having issue with my phone calls since I updated to Android 11.\n\nWhile on the phone with someone, I'll receive another call from the same person and it rings non stop. Doesn't go to voicemail. The same person is not calling me and I'm still on the phone with that person.\n\nI cannot decline the call. I press Decline and nothing happen. It just continues to ring. If I answer, I'm stuck in the answering window/call but it's still ringing, I cannot answer and get out.\n\nOnce the call is over, I still cannot answer/decline. It will ring on a loop forever, until I reboot the phone and sometimes it will call me again!!!\n\nI checked on the web to see if anyone is having that weird problem, to no avail. It's driving me nuts. Help!!?",
