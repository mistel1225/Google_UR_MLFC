    "content": "Hi Folks, I've just updated Android 10 security update from April 5 2020 and I now get an almost unusable lag on the UI. I have restarted the phone in safe mode and the problem still persists. It is difficult to swipe - I can often swipe once, but I can swipe to the next screen. Lag using the keyboard means that it is unusable in swipe spelling mode and very slow typing. Often the point of contact on the screen seems offset - the item next to the item I want to select is selected instead. Can I rollback from this update? If so - could you link me to instructions on how to do so. The phone is vital for my WFH pipeline, as I am in New Zealand and under lockdown. Thanks in advance for any help.",
