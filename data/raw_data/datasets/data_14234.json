    "content": "Trying to play music or YouTube videos and sound won't work. Phone says it's connected to wired headphones except nothing is plugged in. Phone still rings and if I connect to a Bluetooth headset audio will play through them but when I disconnect, audio stops working and again says it's connected to wired headphones. I've tried restarting.",
