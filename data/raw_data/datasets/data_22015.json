    "content": "My speakerphone, along with my ringer and alarm suddenly stopped working this weekend. I've been on chat with tech support and went through all the troubleshooting steps to no avail. The only offer I have to fix the phone will take 5-10 business days. Normally I'd be happy to wait, but I'm an ICU physician and working with critically ill COVID patients. I use my telephone at work to communicate, and missing phone calls from colleagues/nurses is not an option-even more so now. I don't know how to get in touch with someone who can expedite a phone replacement. Any thoughts?\nThanks,\nMike",
