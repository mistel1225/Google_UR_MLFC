    "content": "I seemed to have followed every step and self help guide I can find ,but incoming calls won't get forwarded under any setting. This includes when I'm on the phone or on a video call, as well as during Do Not Disturb. \n\nI'm not sure if there are other settings I've got in place to overide this but it's driving me mad. \nAnyone able to help?",
