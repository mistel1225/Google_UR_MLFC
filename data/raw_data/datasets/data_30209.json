    "title": "I went through four google pixel because of warranty issues.",
    "content": "Once the fourth phone broke, my phone company said \"sorry we don't have any pixels left\". They wouldn't give me pixel 2 and made me settle for another brand, that I wasn't happy with. These months of using loan phones and putting up with broken pixels were very stressful. And I never received a good working phone that I paid top dollar for. I still feel very ripped off and now I read that people in America have filed a law suit against Google. I feel I need to be compensated as well. Shame I don't live in the USA. I want to talk to someone from Google, but it turns out this is very hard to find support, someone to talk to.",
