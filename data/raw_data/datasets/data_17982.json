    "content": "I'm using the Pixel 4, and I am unable to share public Instagram posts to my stories. I just don't have the option under the 'share' function. I've tried clearing my cache, switching settings on and off, reinstalling the app and signed up to the BETA version. I used to have a Pixel 2 and had this same issue. I've sent feedback to Instagram to no avail (unsurprisingly).\n\nI know iPhone users, and other Android users have this option. Are any other Pixel users having this issue?",
