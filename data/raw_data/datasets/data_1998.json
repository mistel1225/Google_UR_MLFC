    "content": "I lost around 30 gb space on my Google pixel 3xl. It shows me that it's in pictures. But i deleted everything there. Still shows me the same, that it's 30 gb in pictures. And it's getting slowly more and more there. I connected my phone to my laptop via Cable. Tried to find what it takes so much space. Could not find. I tried in my Google account to find those pictures. And I could not find anything. Can someone tell me how can I get my my space on the phone. \nGreetings\nJ.",
