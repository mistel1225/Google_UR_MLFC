    "content": "I've had this phone since february 2020 and had no problems. Since the may security update this has changed. Phone loses connection to cell tower resulting in people calling me unable to reach me.\nThe connection symbol says connected and when I call other people the phone connects just fine.\n\nTried resetting network / bluetooth but the problem persists. Also tried cleaning the sim card, but my gut feeling is this is a software issue.\n\nAnyone else had this problem?",
