    "title": "Android 11 and the bubbles notifications suck",
    "content": "Is anyone else having persisting issues with Android 11 and the functionality w.r.t. bubbles? I'm at my wits end.\n\nI am personally only a user of Facebook messenger, so the previous bubble/notifications system worked flawlessly for me. The new bubbles system seem to bubble when it feels like it, and i'm constantly missing messages as sometimes I don't get any sort of notification. I've tried turning the bubbles off, and notifications seem to work better, however I like the functionality of the bubbles. \n\nAnother issue I have is unlike the previous version, whenever you close the bubble, or sleep the phone, the bubbles always pop back up in the same position at the top left hand corner. As a right hander, with tiny hands, and a left hand/wrist injury, this is frustrating me to no end. I understand these are specific issues for me, however it's really reduced the ease of the functionality of my phone. \n\nThe next issue I seem to have is I wear a Garmin Venu, and I'm forever getting double notifications for messenger. I seem to recieve one when the bubble first pops up, and then again about 1 minute later if I ignore the bubble. Or, I'll flat out not recieve any messages to my smartwatch if the bubbles dont work (which is about 40% of the time). \n\nI don't understand why bubbles are so terrible, prior to Google implementing them through the OS, Facebook seemed to have a really clean and simple operating system for it. I WISH I could turn off system bubbles but turn on the old facebook bubbles. I wish they'd stop breaking things that don't need fixing.",
