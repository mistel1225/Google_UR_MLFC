    "content": "Tried all the suggestions from the following link https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/6090599?hl=en with no results.\n\nI used to have about 30% of battery left when going to sleep. Day after updating to RQ1A.210105.002 phone died on my way home from work. Repeated 3 days in a row. So, instead of having 30% left after 16 hours, it now dies on me after 9-10 hours.\n\nAny suggestions or observations?",
