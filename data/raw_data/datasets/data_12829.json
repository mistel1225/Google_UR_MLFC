    "content": "So, I have a Pixel 3a XL and ever since the latest Android update, my bluetooth connections for all of my devices have disconnected and reconnected sporadically. I first noticed it with my car when the music that was being streamed off of Spotify would pause or mute in the middle of a song and then randomly continue with the song. I then tried to see if it was an issue with my car or my phone, so I decided to try and use my bluetooth speaker for reference. I started watching a YouTube video and the same issue was happening. I tried resetting connections, clearing cache and some other stuff I saw on the internet. I've done pretty much everything except for factory resetting the phone. I really don't want to do that because it is too tedious for me to reinstall everything onto my phone. Can someone please help me?",
