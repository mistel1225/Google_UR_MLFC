    "title": "Reverse Image photos and notch cannot be hidden",
    "content": "Took phone out of my pocket yesterday and there was the notch and my photo for wallpaper was a reverse image (like an x-ray). I cannot hide the notch, yes I did everything Google Support walked me thru but it won't hide. Did a factory reset (after backing up to Google Drive) and notch still won't hide, photos won't restore to Gallery, and an app I use (Kissfit) won't authorize. When I view my backed up photos on the Google drive with my Pixel 3 XL, they are all reverse image. They are normal when I look at them using my PC. I did recently (a week or so ago) do the Android OS update - but the phone worked fine after the update. Anyone have this happen to their phone, and if so, how did you fix (if possible). Mine is 20 months old.",
