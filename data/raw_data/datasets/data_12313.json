    "content": "Hi there ! My phone  google pixel 4xl started playing up a couple of weeks ago, my battery display always says 50 %, it won't charge properly through the charging port. Only through wireless does it charge properly and even then the battery won't last as long as it should and as it always displays 50% I am never sure if its about to die or not. I have Gone through troubleshooting ! Have tried it in safe mode for over 24 hours still no change.!",
