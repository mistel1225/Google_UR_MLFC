    "content": "I've had the 3XL since it came out and two days ago while trying to voice text, out of nowhere Gboard pops up an ask me to allow it to record audio and I can't voice text without saying yes, WTF?\n\nIs there any way around this? Why did this just happen suddenly? I'm already disappointed with this phone (compared to the OG Pixel) but this really sucks.\n\nThanks all!\n\nPS I use the Message + app for texting, always have.",
