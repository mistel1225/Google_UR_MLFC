    "content": "Are Pixel 5's collectively delayed in US or is it just some. Not sure what is up but ordered on Sept 30th right when it as first available and had a shipping date of Oct 30th - Nov 2nd. But then on the 2nd when I checked I see a \"shipped delayed, we are working on getting it shipped\" message. I opened a support case to find out what was issue (ordered 2 phones 1 green and 1 black) thinking maybe 1 was delayed. But only getting canned support responses with ZERO info like \"we are working on finding reason\" for 3 days now. Anybody else experiencing this?",
