    "content": "I noticed when I'm using my Gear S3 connected to my Pixel 2 XL, I'm unable to use Google Assistant. I can type questions, but no voice search. I'm assuming the microphone on the watch is overriding the phone microphone, but I can't even use the watch microphone to ask my question. Anybody found a work around for this problem?",
