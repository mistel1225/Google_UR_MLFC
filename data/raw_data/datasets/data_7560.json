    "content": "So I took about 18 photos on my Pixel 3 yesterday, but when I go to the Photos App I only see one of them.  Further, if I go to the camera, click there to see previously taken photos, I only see that same photo (none of the older ones).  I then connected the phone with USB and looked in the DCIM folder and all 18 photos are there!  They just don't show up on the phone.  So I took a couple of new photos today and they show up, but the one that was showing up yesterday does not anymore.  Weirdness.\n\nIs there a way to have pixel3 rescan its DCIM folder?  It seems to have lost track of the photos.",
