    "content": "Depending on screen angle, sometimes it's yellowish and sometimes white. Is this normal for the phone? The last phone I had didn't change color at normal viewing angles.\n\nI don't have night light on or anything. Any thoughts? I love the phone but hate the constant color shift when I move the viewing angle.",
