    "content": "I just got updated to Android 10, using a Pixel 3 XL bought directly from Google for Google FI, and I am noticing a couple things that need to be changed. I am unable to search for things in settings. There isn't even a search icon in the settings. All there is a place to change DND or ring/vibrate/silent.\n\nThe second thing is in the recent apps, there is a search bar and a second app drawer. I don't see a way to remove or disable these. I don't need two app drawers, and I especially don't need one in the recent apps screen. \n\nAny idea how to add the search in the settings and/or how to remove the search and app drawer in the recent apps screen?",
