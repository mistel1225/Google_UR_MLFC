    "content": "I opted into the Android 11 Beta ever since it came out many months ago, but it came to the point where it was too buggy and decided to opt out but when I did my Pixel 3a won't go back to the offical version of android even after many updates, so I am currently dealing with a very buggy phone thats stuck in the Beta version of Android 11. I have tried both hard and factory resetting the phone to no avail. Is there any other way I can revert it back to an official version of Android 11?",
