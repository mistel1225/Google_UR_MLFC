    "content": "For the past 6 weeks during a phone call the call will go dead The person on the other side can hear me but I cannot hear them. I've contacted T-Mobile twice the first time they sent me a new SIMs card as it had not been updated for 15 years. That did not fix the problem. 2 weeks after I spoke with T-Mobile they did a complete factory reset on my phone yet the problem consist. My phone is not even a year old  I need to find the resolution to this problem thank you for any help you can give me.",
