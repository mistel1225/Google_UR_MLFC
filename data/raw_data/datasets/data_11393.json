    "content": "I received my new pixel 5 today and right out of the box I'm having problems with the phone crashing/rebooting.  In order to troubleshoot I have factory reset the phone, updated to android 11, and updated all default apps.  I have not installed any additional apps.  I have rebooted in to safe mode and the phone will reboot randomly during use.   I'm leaning toward returning the phone, but I wanted to check here first.  Thanks in advance.",
