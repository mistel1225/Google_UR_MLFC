    "title": "Pixel 3: Compass calibration not working at all",
    "content": "In any app where I can try and calibrate the compass (for example, google maps), I can pull up the option to calibrate the compass where it asks me to do the figure 8 motion 3 times. I have tried the figure 8 motion a hundred times in all kinds of ways, but there is no reaction whatsoever from the phone. Very frustrating. The accuracy is \"low\", and the compass is pointing in the completely wrong direction.",
