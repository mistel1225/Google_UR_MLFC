    "content": "Pixel 4 XL 64gb. My voice is not audible to the other party on both audio and video calls, when using Whatsapp and Facebook Messenger. Problem rectifies when i force close the app (sometimes) or restart my phone. Extremely irritating when it happens more than once in a day. Kindly update and any suggestions or tricks? P.S: tried cache wiping and app cache delete and app data delete too. nothing works..",
