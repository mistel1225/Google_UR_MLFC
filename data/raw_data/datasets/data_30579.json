    "title": "Why does Google not replace Pixel batteries? This is EVIL planned obsolescence. Will never buy again",
    "content": "I just finished paying off my 1st gen Pixel and it still works just fine but the battery doesn't hold a charge as long. I've tried all the tips and use battery saver but from what I've read the battery probably needs to be replaced. I was just told that Google doesn't replace Pixel batteries. \nThis is terrible for the environment and makes no sense, the phone is perfectly good. I would NEVER have bought a Pixel if I had known and I will now make sure that everyone in my personal and social media networks know that Google has disgusting planned obsolecent manufacturing practices.\nSHAME on you. I will now divest my entire live of any Google product use.",
