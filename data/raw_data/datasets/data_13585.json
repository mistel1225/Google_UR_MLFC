    "content": "Hi there,\n\nI've recently purchased a pixel 5. I use the colour inversion feature frequently (on apps which don't have dark mode). Everytime I switch it on (or off) the page refreshes. This didn't happen on my previous pixel 2 phone. Anyone any idea how to stop it from happening? Thank you in advance.",
