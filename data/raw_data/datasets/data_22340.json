    "content": "Have been using my pixel stand with my Pixel 3XL for just under a month and it was just fine. However, for the past two days, my pixel stand always has the orange light appear at the base whenever it is plugged into the wall. I dont even have my phone placed on it but the orange light just appears. It also does not charge my phone anymore. \nI tried to forget the device on my phone, unplugging and plugging the pixel stand as well as changing the cables, but nothing works.\nPlease advise.",
