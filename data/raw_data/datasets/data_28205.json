    "content": "I took it to the Verizon store where I bought it and they have no idea. They tried turning the phone off and on, and so on.\nWhen I walk, ride in a car, on a bike, I was even in a hot air balloon when it came on right in the middle of my beautiful video. I am really upset. I need it to stop doing it.",
