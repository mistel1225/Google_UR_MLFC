    "content": "A couple weeks ago I converted my wife from iPhone 6s to Pixel 4a 5g. All her apps came over, and they were even arranged the same way on the new Pixel as on her iPhone. Today I tried the same exact conversion from my iPhone 6 to Pixel 4a 5g. Twice. Both times basic settings and data came over (messages, photos), but NONE of my iPhone apps. Sure I can download and install 30 apps by hand, but I'd rather not. Any ideas what happened?",
