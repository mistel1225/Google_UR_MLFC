    "content": "My Pixel XL is not charging. It was working perfectly fine. I have tried all the tips on the support link, tried changing the cables but the battery charge sign doesn't come on. I really need help because I still have all my data in the phone.  I would at least like to be able to transfer my pics and data to a new phone.  The phone is in excellent condition.",
