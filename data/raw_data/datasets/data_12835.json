    "content": "I've had my Google Pixel 3 for almost 2 years, and it was great for a long time. But suddenly, I kept getting \"low on storage\" notifications. After looking around a bit and deleting a lot of photos and apps and clearing caches left and right, I found that \"System\" is was taking up 47GB. Then a few days later, it was up to 50GB. And today, it's at 55GB. Please help.",
