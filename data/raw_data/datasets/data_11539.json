    "content": "To help improve battery life I turned 5G off and noticed their was no 4G option on my Pixel 5 only LTE, from what I've read LTE is a sort of cross between 3G and 4G, because if this I would like to use 4G (which my old phone on the same SIM and plan could do) is this just my phone, or is this just how pixel 5 was designed?\nThanks in advance.",
