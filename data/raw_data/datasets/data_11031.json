    "title": "Nothing But Problems With Google Pixel 5 - Did I Get A Lemon, Or Is This Normal?",
    "content": "First, I had tremendous amount of problems transferring my old data from a Pixel 3 to the new Pixel 5 with a USB cable. As best I can tell, it simply cannot be done when you want your phone to be a work phone because Google is really pushing hard on the separation of \"personal\" apps and \"work\" apps or \"work\" profiles. The only way I was able to get the phone working as a work phone (that is, registered with a work email account) was to do a factory reset and manually install every app I ever had. Huge pain.\n\nSecond, I cannot tell when someone is calling me. No matter what I do with the settings, I get no ring, no vibration, and only a notification later that someone called. I've tried every setting I can find, and I cannot receive calls. I can only make outbound calls. This is totally unacceptable, obviously.\n\nThird, my reception is absolutely terrible. I know it's not me or the environment I'm in because I used my Pixel 3 just hours ago in the exact same locations and it was fine. But I've had half a dozen dropped calls with the Pixel 5, and three people have told me the sound quality is terrible and much of my call was broken up and unintelligible during the call. I'm a professional, and to not have a solid, working phone is just ridiculous. \n\nWhat can I do to fix these problems? Is the Google Pixel 5 just a crap phone, or did I get a lemon?",
