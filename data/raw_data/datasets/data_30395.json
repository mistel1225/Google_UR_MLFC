    "title": "Why is my Google Pixel 3a Over Heating so much?",
    "content": "My Google Pixel 3a has been over heating & getting really hot when I use youtube recording LIVE, & when I am recording short camera clips!  It doesn't happen all the time, but I have not had my Pixel 3a only less than a month!  It gets really hot sometimes, to the point it could cause a burn injury!  Could Google install a temperature gauge of some sort so we can see how hot the phone is getting because this is very disturbing that a new phone would get that hot!",
