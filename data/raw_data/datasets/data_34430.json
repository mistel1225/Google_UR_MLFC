    "content": "I purchased a Pixel 3 device on Thanksgiving and right on the second day, I noticed that on waking up the screen, sometimes it was flashing bright white. I read some articles online and every article said, it's a software issue and there will be an update soon. I waited for January update but didn't help. I finally contacted Google and they told me to Factory reset the phone and when that didn't work, they offered me to process RMA but they will be sending a refurbished device instead of a New device.\nAnybody else facing the same issue ?\nThis is really disappointing from Google on standing by the quality of their own device.",
