    "content": "I would like to stop my phone from automatically connecting to the Bluetooth in my husband's car when I ride with him. It over rides his phone. I feel like there has to be something that's a simple preference to change, but I can't find anything in my phone or online that works. I would rather not unpair from his car or have to turn my Bluetooth off all the time. Thanks!",
