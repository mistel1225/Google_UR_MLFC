    "content": "Hi,\n\nCould you please assist me with 2 questions.\n1. I didn't receive any $50 voucher or I might missed the activation code or etc\n2. Next week after purchasing I have accidentally dropped my phone. Likely it was in the case and the screen remains unbroken. But the back panel is destroyed. Straight after that the battery life narrow down to 2-4 hours depending on usage.\nI have visited about 6(!) different repair centers in Sydney and area and non (!) of them have a spare back panel for pixel 3 (any color) or either were able to help me with battery issue.\nI wasn't able to find online a backpanel as well (any color would suit me really).\nCould you please advise what should I do?\n\nCheers\nMarina",
