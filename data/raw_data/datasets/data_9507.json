    "content": "Hi, recently my pixel 3 xl shows flashing green screen and sometimes it went blackout. The weird thing is when that happens, the touch is still usable. If i remember all the apps position, i can use it even when the green screen or blackot occurred. And sometimes, the screen has a green hue but when i scroll down the notification, it seems to shows no green hue for a second. I believe that this is a software issues because i never dropped my phone. I thought the latest update will fix this but after about 2 weeks, the problem occurs again. Hoping taht you can provide me an useful and helpful answer.",
