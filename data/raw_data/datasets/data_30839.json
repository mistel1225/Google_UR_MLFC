    "content": "I received the OG pixel from a relative last summer, and I used for a while. The wifi then gave away, and I put it away after deciding to just purchase a new device.\n\nI recently decided to fix it and use it again, and I did. The phone is locked, though, and it is asking for the account of the person who purchased  it according to Google Support. \n\nThe problem is, he lives in China (where Google is banned) and does not remember the password. He cannot receive and password resetting emails, texts, etc. because of the ban.\n\nWhat can I do?",
