    "content": "Received a brand new Pixel 4a 5G (I'm in Italy).\n\nTried any possible solution to make Hotspot Wi-Fi working (it works on my carrier on other phones and since a long time). Once enabled the hotspot, no device is able to see the ID of the Network coming out, no way to use the internet through the phone, so device is unusable (I use it also for working sessions).\n\nChatted with the support and it was time wasted with no solution proposed / problem recognized.\n\nAny configuration to try ?\n\nThanks,\nLorenzo",
