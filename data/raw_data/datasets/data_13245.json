    "title": "Can you remove odd alarm icon top right of Pixel 5 without cancelling alarm?",
    "content": "The below odd alarm icon appears top right whenever an alarm is set - the only way I can remove it is by deleting the alarm, which I don't want to do as its my repeating morning alarm. I've moved from Pixel 3 running Android 11 and this icon did not appear on that phone. Can the alarm notification be removed? The fact it doesn't even look correct bugs me! \n\nI have attempted to install a 3rd party alarm app to circumvent this, and even when turning notifications off on the app the icon would reappear. Any suggestions? ",
