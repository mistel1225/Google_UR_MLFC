    "content": "Hi all,\n\nduring an automatic update received on Sep 17, my Pixel XL turned itself off and I haven’t been able to turn it back on since. I brought it to an authorised center and after 3 weeks they called me saying that there is nothing they can do to fix it. They replaced battery and screen and still nothing, it won’t boot up.\n\nTo make it clear, I haven’t launched the installation of any updates that day and the last thing I saw on the screen was a progress bar saying “finalising update”; at around 80% of the progress bar it all went blank.\nHave you seen this happening before? I read of a few other users having a similar issue but never got to the bottom of having it fixed. Please let me know if there something that can be done to fix it. I was planning to move to the 4XL, but I would have liked a much more smoother transition.\n\nThanks,\nRaffa",
