    "title": "How can I get Digital Wellbeing to give me a weekly report/average?",
    "content": "Just moved to Pixel 4a from an iPhone. I really like the ability to track my screen time and habits so Digital Wellbeing is really useful. However, I am wondering if there is a way to see my screen time and habits in a weekly average on my phone, as I can only really see one day at a time and even though there is a bar graph for the week it doesn't actually give a numerical average over any period of time besides one day. On iPhone, the screen time in settings would give a lot of data on the reports so just wondering if Google does the same as I find this feature very valuable and useful to me.\n\nI've tried clicking and searching around, and can't seem to see this anywhere in settings or found an answer online. Any help would be appreciated, thanks!",
