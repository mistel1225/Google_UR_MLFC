    "content": "Hello,\n\nA few days ago I upgraded my Pixel 3 to Android 10. So before the upgrade, the battery life was very good, almost 1.5 days with one charge, but after Android 10 upgrade I hardly reach the night. So There are several issues too with some apps and networking; besides that all around is just fine. My only rant is the downgraded battery life that I want a fix ASAP.\n\nBest regards.",
