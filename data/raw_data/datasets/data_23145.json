    "content": "Suddenly my pixel 3 won’t allow me to use fingerprint to log in and asks for password but then tells me my password is wrong although it’s not. I tried to restart it and then it gave me a reboot error and is stuck on that for the past 4 hours. Help. Any advice. And it’s no longer under warranty. ",
