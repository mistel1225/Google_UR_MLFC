    "title": "\"Share to Chrome\" option missing from Android share menu.",
    "content": "I used to be able to see a \"Share to Chrome\" option in the Android share menu - from any app in the ecosystem. For example, I would use the Pocket app and if there was an article I wanted to open up in Chrome, I would simply click the \"share\" symbol and one of the apps on the app list would be the Chrome browser; clicking on it would open up the page in the browser.\n\nI factory reset my phone, and once all the apps reinstalled and updated, I noticed that I no longer saw that option to share to Chrome on any of the universal share menus. I've since checked that Android is updated, I've updated all the apps, and I've tried using the share menu from a number of different apps.\n\nDoes anyone know what could have happened?\n\nThank you so much, in advance. :-)",
