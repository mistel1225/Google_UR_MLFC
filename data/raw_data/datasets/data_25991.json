    "content": "After updating to Android 10, my Pixel usb-c earbuds are no longer recognized by my pixel 3xl. When i plug them i get a notification saying \"Analog audio accessory detected ; the attached device is not compatible with this phone. When I play music with my pixel type c earbuds, the sound comes from the device's speakers instead. I tried other devices with my pixel type c and it worked perfectly. No problems. My problem started after updating to Android Q .\nAny help??",
