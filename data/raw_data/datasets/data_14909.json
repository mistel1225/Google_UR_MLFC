    "content": "My Pixel 3XL phone is set to screen calls from unknown numbers, suspected spam callers, and first-time callers. It worked fine until I paired it with a WearOS watch -- now the phone rings (although I can still manually screen calls) and my watch shows the call as well. How can I fix this and have my calls screened again?",
