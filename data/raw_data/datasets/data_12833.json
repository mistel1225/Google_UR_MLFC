    "content": "Hi,\nI've been trying to buy this phone ever since it released in India. The only platform which sells this device is Flipkart. On the first day it released, the stock got over within the first 30 minutes. After that I patiently waited for more than a week for it to be back on sale. I have never experienced such a wait for such an anticipated phone. After that, one day, at 4 in the morning, the phone came back in stock but then every pincode that I typed, it wasn't getting delivered. When I contacted Flipkart about this issue, they said that it depended solely on the seller and that they had absolutely no idea about what to do. These calls went on for several days without any use. If I could've predicted that this was going to be the situation with the Google Pixel 4a, I would've never set my mind on buying it. When a phone, sold by Google, comes into the market, there must be sufficient availability of the product and adequate response from the seller's and retailer's side, since it's expected that there will many customers. But this has been a very disappointing experience overall and it makes me look at the phone in a doubtful way. I just would like to put forth a question to you, should I wait for someone to own up to their fault and fix this issue or should I move on to another phone. Moving on will be an easy step for me as well as other customers but, it will surely leave a bad mark on the side of Google and Flipkart. Please consider this request.\nThank you,\nSteen Mariya Paul",
