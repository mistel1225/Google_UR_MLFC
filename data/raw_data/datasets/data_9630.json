    "content": "I accidentally hit the update button on my Pixel so I paused it to stop it but I would like to cancel the update completely. It is trying to update to Android 10 which causes major problems for my phone. I just had to do a factory reset earlier this week when I updated so I definitely don't want to do it again. How can I clear it so it doesn't continue when the phone is idle?",
