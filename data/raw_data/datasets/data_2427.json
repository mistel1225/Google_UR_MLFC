    "title": "Pixel 5 not able to receive any automated SMS such as bank, Doc, 2 step authorisation etc.",
    "content": "I have a Pixel 5 on Android 11 all up to date on a 5g SIM through Virgin Mobile (UK) and I am unable to receive any automated SMS texts such as my bank or doctor or 2 step authentications which send you a text code (normal person to person texts are unaffected).\nI have gone through all the possible steps and discovered eventually that this problem was tied to a combination of the phone AND the network. I verified this by using the same SIM in a different handset where by the problem disappeared and by using a different carrier SIM in my Pixel 5 and again the problem is removed.  I have now ordered a new SIM from a different carrier but I can not be the only one to have been affected this way, surely.",
