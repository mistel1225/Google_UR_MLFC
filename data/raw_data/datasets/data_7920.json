    "content": "My screen has stopped working, it is not cracked but it looks like a blue ink stain has spread all over the screen. I am looking to talk to someone about my warranty but am finding no options. Can someone please find me a human being that can talk to me about this issue as I am finding the website very confusing. I believe I should be able to post it somewhere for repair. \n\nPlease let me know.",
