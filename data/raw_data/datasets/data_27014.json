    "content": "An old Samsung phone I had had a fantastic option for answering the phone.\n\nWhen the phone rang you simply said:  “Answer” and the call would be answered and speaker phone turned on.  No more running and falling over furniture to answer the phone manually.\n\nHow about it Google...why not this way of answering the phone for your older less spry customers ☺",
