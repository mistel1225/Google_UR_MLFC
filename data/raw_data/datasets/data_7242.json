    "content": "None of the photos from my camera roll show up in instagram when I go to post or put one in a story (it says \"No recent photos or videos\"), and posting from the photo itself is not provided as an option. I have restarted, uninstalled and reinstalled, cleared the photo cache, and checked all permissions multiple times. Would appreciate any help I can get. thanks!",
