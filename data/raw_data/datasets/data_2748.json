    "content": "My Pixel 4a has an issue with the camera. There is a pale circle in the right half of the screen, but no surface damage on the camera glass. I send it to the repair center and it came back not repaired. There is no explanation to it, just \"No issues were found during inspection\". I even sent a picture that explains my problem with the package in case the stuff is not able to read! So I want to reach somebody who knows why exactly no issues were found? But the links on the support page for call back and chat just link me to the start page of google support. What is the number I can reach somebody who can help me.",
