    "content": "I have to reset the phone a couple of times a week because SMS won't send.\n\nVoice calls are frequently broken up. I can hear fine but the user at the other end can't here me. I haven't found a mitigation for this other than switching to my other mobile (iphone).\nPhone usage is in the metropolitan Brisbane (Australia) area.\n\nHow can I resolve or troubleshoot.",
