    "content": "I am having serious issues with my pixel 3xl 5ghz band. My laptop and wife's phones both work fine where my phone jumps to connect to the 2.4 network because of signal strength.\nTried restarting the modem, calling provider, everything but I think it's my particular phone. Any ideas?",
