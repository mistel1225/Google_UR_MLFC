    "content": "I am trying to get a callback from Google regarding my pixel phone. However I am from Finland, and even if it says that the customer service is open 24/7, I am unable to send a callback request. I have tried to do this multiple times at different times, but all I get is a text saying, \"try again within business hours\". What to do?",
