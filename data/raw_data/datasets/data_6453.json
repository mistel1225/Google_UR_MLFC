    "content": "I have done all attempts on previous forums in order to try and solve the issue I'm having and have gone through most of the basic troubleshooting steps and have gotten no where. I can connect my device to my car but it will not play the audio even though it says it's playing I don't hear anything from my phone or the car stereo. I have already checked my volume and made sure the bluetooth in question was able to play audio from my phone. I reset my bluetooth settings unpaired from the car and it's still not working properly. I would love some advice on what to do next.",
