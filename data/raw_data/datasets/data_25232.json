    "content": "The Google Pixel is a couple years old now, so I expect the battery isn't top notch. However, it drains quite quickly, even with battery saver on, and completely shuts off around 30%. \n\nI've tried using Method 1 from https://www.androidpit.com/how-to-calibrate-the-battery-on-your-android-device but it hasn't helped.\n\nHow can I get my phone to run all the way down to 0% without shutting off suddenly?",
