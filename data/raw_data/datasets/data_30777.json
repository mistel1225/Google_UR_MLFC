    "content": "My original pixel 3 I got from Google Fi had microphone issues so I got a replacement and it's microphone didn't work either. I have no time or patience to keep trying replacements. Is there any ways I can return the devices and get some kind of refund or credit so google and I can part and go on our merry way? It's been only 24 days since I got the original one so it's past the refund window.",
