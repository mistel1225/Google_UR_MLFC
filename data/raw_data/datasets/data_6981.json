    "content": "I have both a wired headset and bluetooth headphones, and am currently using these to wfh. When I receive a call, the ringtone only comes through the speakers on the handset and there does not appear to be any settings on the phone to have ringtones/notifications through a headset/headphones only when these devices are connected. No such issues with media through headphones, or the phone call itself.",
