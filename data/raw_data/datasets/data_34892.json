    "title": "Google Pixel 2 Screen/ Background lighting strange after slight fall",
    "content": "My phone fell from my nightstand to the ground yesterday- so not a huge drop. I noticed the background color was slightly off- if I turn off brightness it gets worse and is much more of a blue tone. I turned it off and on and restarted a couple times. It has randomly gone back to normal, but then goes back to the strange hue. It doesn't seem to be impaired in any other way but I'm not sure if anything can be done about this (more of an annoyance than anything).",
