    "content": "Hi \nWhen I checked my phone this morning, the screen is completely unresponsive. Fingerprint reader and buttons work but that's all. It's not been dropped (no damage to the screen) and no apps installed recently. I've tried soft reset and removing the SIM with no effect, and when I tried recovery mode, I just get a \"no command\" symbol. I've not tried a factory reset yet as I was keeping that for a final option. \nAny thoughts welcome\nCheers",
