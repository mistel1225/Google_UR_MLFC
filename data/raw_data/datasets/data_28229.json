    "title": "Battery Life is less than 3 hours with limited use",
    "content": "Ever since I updated my original Google Pixel (the first one) to Android 9 my battery barely lasts 3 hours with limited use. My apps are not the cause of the battery drainage as I have very few additional apps installed. I have my phone die multiple times when there is supposedly more than 50% charge left and have even had it die at 83%. I have tried restarting my phone to see if that helps, but multiple times it has brought a fully charged battery to less than 20% when it is unplugged and restarted. My brother who has the same phone is now also experiencing battery issues once he updated to Android 9 as well\n\nIs there anything I can do to fix this? The phone is perfect shape. Otterbox case since purchase, no scratches, dents, water damage to phone. I used to love this phone, but it's more of a liability now as it decides to randomly die when I need it for maps or keeping in contact with work and family\n\nThanks for any feedback",
