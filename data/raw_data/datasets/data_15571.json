    "content": "My Pixel 3a kept \"losing\" the AT&T eSim installed on my phone.  The esim option would disappear  completely  and default lt to the tmobile sim installed on the phone.  It acted like i did not even have an eSim.   To try and correct  it,   I reset the network devices including erasing the eSim.   When I tried to reinstall  the eSim using the card I originally  got from AT&T,  I got the following  error:  \"There's an is an issue with your sim profile. Subject code 8.2.6, reason 3.8 \"  I went to the local AT&T store and they tried to move my account  to a new eSim.   No dice.  They attempted  to help for an hour and finally just said the phone is not compatible (not likely since it was working  flawlessly  with an eSim for 7 months)  and I was forced to migrate my number to a regular  sim.   1- what on earth does that error code mean?,  2 what can i do to get my esim functionality back. 3- is this a Google issue or an ATT one?",
