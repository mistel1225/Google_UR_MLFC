    "content": "Yesterday I took a video through the messenger app and sent as a text message. After that the back camera has stopped working. The flashlight is also not able to turn on. Flashlight button says \"camera in use\" and is greyed out. I have cleared storage and cache of the camera app and have done a factory reset. Still, the back camera will not work. I have tried on a third party app as well (Snapchat) and I have the same problem where only the front camera works. The day before this happened my phone updated to the March 5 security update. So I'm thinking might be software related? Is anyone else having this issue? And if so do you know of a fix?",
