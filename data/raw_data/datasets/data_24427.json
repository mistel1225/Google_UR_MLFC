    "content": "Whenever I apply the Android 10 OTA update, it breaks the proximity sensor on my Pixel 3. Bringing the phone to my ear during a call switches off the screen as it should, but taking the phone away again just leaves the screen black. Happens in Whatsapp calls too.\n\nThis happened when I first got a notification to upgrade to 10 in September 2019. I reverted back to Android 9 and the phone was perfect again. I gave it two months hoping it would get fixed. Jumped on the 10 update yesterday and my phone is broken again. I reverted back to 9 and all is good again, but I am obviously missing out on important security updates.",
