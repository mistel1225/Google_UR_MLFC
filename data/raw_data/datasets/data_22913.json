    "content": "I live in Bahrain and due to certain regulatory restrictions, even though the android 10 system update is available, it's unable to download it for my Pixel 3Xl. The same with security updates too. These updates are available for more than a month, yet when I click to download, it says, unable to download and install. I'm not familiar with sideloading the update. The interesting thing is, it happens ONLY with Pixel phones and not with apple or samsung or xiaomi...which is quite perplexing. Now how do i install the update. I'm losing my patience. Thanks.",
