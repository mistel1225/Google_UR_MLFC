    "content": "Pixel 3 turns off by itself after 10 - 30 seconds after phone start (state when you can already unlock and use the phone).\nIn safe mode, the phone also turns off.\n\nIf phone is in recovery mode or in bootloader it does not turn off (UPD. This is not true anymore. Phone has turned off in recovery mode).\n\nIf phone is in turned off state and I connect it to the charger, a strange flashing animation appears. It looks like I am re-plugging the charger every 5 seconds. Here is the video https://photos.app.goo.gl/e1T31ginNUXBdcKW6 (the same thing with the charger that came with the phone)\n\nAlso, the battery is discharged fairly quickly even when the phone is off (from 50% to 19% during night)\n\nIs this a 100% battery problem or could it be something else?",
