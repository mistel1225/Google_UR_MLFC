    "content": "My phone is one month old. It was working fine till 2 days back. The fingerprint sensor started behaving erratically 2 days back,as in it wasn't sensing the fingerprints, then it started disappearing intermittently from the settings as an option,and yesterday it disappeared altogether. I can't find the option anymore in settings.",
