    "content": "This situation happened to my mom yesterday. While she was working some strange codes appeared on her screen. She didn't know what to do and asked me about it. Well, I really need your help. My mom uses the phone very carefully and one month only. When I turn the phone on I saw that everything was deleted and back to factory settings. Of course, there was not so many important information but still all the passwords from cards and apps. How do you think, was she hacked or this is a usual break of the system?",
