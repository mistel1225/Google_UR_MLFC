    "content": "My camera's level framing hint is off by 2 degrees. Is there a way to recalibrate the sensor? So far if i turn my body and move the camera to the left a bit, it goes back to 0 degree but the image remains level. But i would like to be looking forward and have the hint at 0 degrees when I'm stable.",
