    "content": "Hi all,\n\nI'm looking for a method to take a complete backup of the phone (including the /data/data folder) on a non-rooted, stock device.  I have no interest in rooting/unlocking the bootloader (can't anyway- this option is disabled), since I am not trying to modify the files.  This is strictly for forensic research. Adb pull results in \"permission denied\" due to non-root status, and \"run-as\" also is not an option in this instance. \n\nIt seems like Autopsy and OSForensics only pull logical copies, bypassing the /data partition.  Anyone else encounter this and discover a workaround?",
