    "content": "Using a USB cable works to transfer files to my Pixel C. So apparently the cable suffices. Trying to connect to my Pixel 2 phone, the USB is not recognized. I updated my phone to version 10, but the issue persists. In the list under 'settings - connected devices' there is no option USB. When I connect the cable, my phone bleeps and starts charging. When I search in 'settings' I can access the USB-preferences screen, but it is not responding.\nPlease help !!",
