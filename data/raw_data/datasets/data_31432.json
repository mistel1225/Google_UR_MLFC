    "content": "Hello, I have a weird problem and I don't even know if it is actually a problem. I mean, may be it's pixel phone's feature, or I don't know, but I want to at least try to solve this. When I edit a photo, each time a new album is created with these edited photos. As a result, my entire gallery is filled with albums of two photos, which makes it difficult to view it. Can I, for example, solve this in any way? Like, choose one single folder for all my edited photos?",
