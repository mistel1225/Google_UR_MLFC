    "content": "Got a google 2xl from a seller in Greece and after one month of use the camera stopped working. searched on the forums and found out that is a known problem while nothing of the suggested solutions worked. I returned the phone to the seller for a repair or a new phone. 3 months after the seller still tells me the phone is abroad for a repair and they have nothing new until they are informed by them. This is unacceptable, a phone that I own one month is being repaired for three and the seller is ironic and indifferent.  Please advice me on what should i do i am trying to find a way to communicate my problem to google but I cannot find any way to do so. \nThanks.",
