    "content": "I am on pixel 3 and upgraded to version 10. Whenever I try to turn off phone, it just restarts. Also, if I restarted the phone it only restarts (which it should).  So, it's impossible to turn off my phone now.  Always, whenever upgrading versions it never fails that the phone breaks. I left Apple iPhone for this reason, can't we get it our stuff together?",
