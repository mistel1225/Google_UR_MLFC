    "content": "Hello,\nMy phone and all of a sudden stopped charging using the original charger (which still works fine on other phones), and it's only charging with USB A to usb C chargers. I tried cleaning the port and factory reset the phone but it didn't work . Obviously the problem is quite common but Google refused to acknowledge this, and I'm no expert but it seems like a software issue. My phone is out of warranty since a few months  (conveniently) so to send it back and repair is gonna cost me 270 euros in france . This is really unacceptable. If this problem doesn't get solved I would seriously not buy another phone from Google.",
