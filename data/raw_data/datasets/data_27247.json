    "title": "App closing issues Android 10",
    "content": "I can't close my apps from the home screen using Microsoft launcher. I have to be in an app to be able to swipe up and close any apps and after I close them all I come to a screen that just looks like a bland launcher with a search bar and a few apps at the bottom. After pressing the main button I return to the Microsoft launcher. Also when closing apps, after I swipe up there seems to be a delay where I can't close the app until the icon at the top shows up which only takes a second but is frustrating when you're not used to it. Not sure if there's some setting I turned on by accident or what but my phone wasn't like this before I updated to Android 10 a few days ago. Thanks.",
