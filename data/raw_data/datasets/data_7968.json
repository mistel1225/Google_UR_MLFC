    "content": "Microphone will intermittently stop working. Recorder wont work too (BT mics will work just fine). No one can hear me on calls. After a certain amount of time, starts working again. I factory reset and it seemed to resolve issue, but after a few weeks issue re appeared. Was on warranty and had it checked, but lab could not re create issue....\nI am at a loss as to how to resolve?",
