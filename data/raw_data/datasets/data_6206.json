    "content": "I've tried searching in Recently added to find newly clicked photos from camera but couldn't locate them anywhere on the device. I could only find the last one clicked by opening camera app. Rest 5-6 clicked yesterday have been lost.\nGoogle photos is my default photo app. \nExisting photos in Google photos somehow have moved across folders, there's no clear order. The whole app is a chaos. It clearly looks like as if something is broken but I can't figure out what. Tried force stop and restarting. \nAnyone else facing this problem with their Pixel?",
