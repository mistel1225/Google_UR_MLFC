    "title": "I was having the battery problem. My phone doesn't charge more than 50%",
    "content": "The problem started from last 4 days. When I had low battery suppose 10% and when I put the phone on charging it suddenly showed 40% (not like 10% then 11%,12%) same as when I was using the phone suppose battery shows 70% then after some time (not quickly) it shows 40-45%. After talking to customer support and tried every possible troubleshooting even factory reset now I am facing new problem that my phone doesn't charge more than 50% and not even battery draining off as well as I can not see battery percentage at the top of my screen but I can see at the bottom of my lock screen. Also, when I go to setting and see the battery section it says \"problem reading your battery meter\" and under the battery it says \"phone has typical background battery usage\".\nIs there anyone had faced the same issue please help me with that. Thanks in advance.",
