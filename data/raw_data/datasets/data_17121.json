    "content": "I have a Pixel 3 XL running on Cricket.  My problem is that I cannot make phone calls at all.  The very moment I press call, the screen says call ended.  Now, I can receive calls without a problem.  I can boot into safe mode and make calls.  I can use facebook messenger to make calls.  But the Phone app will not place a call.  I am running Android 10, latest August security patch.  I have factory reset the phone--no good.  I have turned the phone off, pulled the sim card, waited 5 minutes, replaced the sim card turned phone on to no avail.  I have reset all app settings, all network settings.  Nothing so far has worked.  Again, I can receive calls all day long.  But when I make a call it hangs up immediately.\n\nThank You in advance for any advice.",
