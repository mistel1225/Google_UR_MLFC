    "content": "For about a week my friend has been receiving texts from me only sporadically and now not at all. Gifs and images will send but not text messages. Messages do not come back with an error that they haven't sent, yet are not recieved. Have tried turning data/wifi on/off, updated both phones, restarted both phones, re-added contact, cleared message cache, turned i-message off on friends iPhone, and she is still not receiving my messages. It only seems to be happening for her and I. My husband texted her from his pixel 3 and it worked fine.",
