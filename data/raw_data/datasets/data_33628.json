    "content": "Signed google pixel 3xl contract with Vodafone UK via carphone warehouse last week. All ready for my 60th birthday trip to Singapore, Australia and Vietnam over next 3 weeks. Delighted with the phone. \nUNTIL today. \nOn recharging from zero it seems to be stuck in an 80 second loop of recharge, start up, shutdown that I can't interrupt. \nSoftware issue??\nSeveral LONG web chats and phone calls to Vodafone and carphone warehouse today tell me they can't fix it remotely and don't have a link up to any Singapore outlet. Unbelievable...\nAlso I don't have a walk away option as I'm away for three weeks \nI'm a Google lover. But NOT impressed with status...\nAny help or suggestions? \nMaybe I'll go back to iPhone....",
