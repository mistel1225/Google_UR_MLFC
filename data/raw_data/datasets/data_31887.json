    "content": "My Pixel is stuck in a bootloop. My case ID is 9-3495000025864. I've been talking to Google Support every day for over a week and so far not a single person has been able to help me. I've been told my case has been escalated to level 3 support, but it has taken days to receive ANY contact from level 3 and when I did finally get an email, it was to suggest a solution (flashing Android to the device) that I had already tried which was unsuccessful. I responded immediately and haven't heard back since. \n\nWhen I originally came to Google for help fixing my phone (which is less than two years old), I had about a week and a half before I left on a trip out of the country. Since it's taken them so long to do nothing, now I have about four days. I was once a loyal Google customer, but since it looks like nobody's going to bother to help me in time (if they were even going to help me at all in the first place), I'm going to have to go out and buy a Galaxy S10 before I leave. Great job, Google Support, you lost another customer.",
