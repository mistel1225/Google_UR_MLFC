    "content": "I have tried googling to somehow figure out why it won't hold charge or even turn on. But have since found nothing, the charger works because the charge icon comes on the screen but that's as far as it'll go as far as charging, then it turns on to the Google page but that's as far as it'll go then switches off and repeats. I just need to fix this please help",
