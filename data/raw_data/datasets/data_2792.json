    "content": "Hi, I've got a Pixel 4a 5g and my friend has a Pixel 4a, both bought in December last year. Everything was perfect untill maybe around February we bith noticed a bug on our Pixels.  Sometimes when someone calls me it's name doesn't show up right away as it should, it takes a good few seconds to show. This happens on the lock screen and on the mini-menu that shows when you're being called while in an app.\nDoes anyone experienced this? I tried disabled all sort of features under Settings but to no avail. I have a single eSIM, my friend has a eSIM + a classic SIM. It does it even with contacts that are marked as favorites in the Contacts app.\nThis is extremely annoying and it absolutely ruins the Pixel experience. I posted this issue on Reddit and it seems other users are having it too, but no known fix.\n\nHow do I fix this?",
