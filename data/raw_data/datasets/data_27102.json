    "content": "I am using my new Pixel 4 I received yesterday, and am having issues with the sound when recording video on Instagram and Snapchat where there is a tapping noise being echoed by the phone that can be heard after the video is recorded. The louder the sounds being made in the video, the louder the tapping. I went through various steps with Google Support to no avail, and factory reset my phone per their directions, and it is still occurring. Is anybody else having this issue? I don't really want to replace a phone I just received if it is occurring on every Pixel 4 model, and is not a hardware issue, but rather a software issue that will require an update of some sort to fix it.",
