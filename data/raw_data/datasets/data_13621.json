    "content": "I have been downloading a file weekly from a website. The file contains links to a daily exercise video by Pahla B Fitness. Before I activated my Pixel 4a, I was using a Pixel 2. I had no trouble opening the downloaded file, clicking the link for that day, and casting to my Roku stick on my TV.\nHowever, once I activated my Pixel 4a, I cannot open the links. I tested the same file on my laptop, and the links work. \nI'm sure there's some setting I need to tweak, but I don't know what it is.\nI'd appreciate any suggestions.",
