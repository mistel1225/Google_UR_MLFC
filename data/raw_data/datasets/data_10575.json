    "content": "After the monthly update that I just did i noticed that I can't raise up the volume from the side button. Only way to do it is to lower down from the button and manual slide it up.\nThe volume was okay before the update.\nDoes anyone else has encounter this issue with this last update?\nIs not a big thing to raise it up manual but it's unusual and I really don't want to reset the phone to factory settings.\nI tried resetting the phone and it's the same.\nThanks,\nRadu",
