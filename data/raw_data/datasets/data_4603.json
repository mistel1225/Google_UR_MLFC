    "content": "Pixel 3XL\n Trying to light up and failing\n Stuck on the Google home screen\n You tried to turn off / on / boot / rescue / recovery does not help\n A dead robot icon appears and reads \"No response\"\n I connect to the computer, and nothing happens (the computer recognizes that a pixel is connected to it, but I do not have any login icon)\n I managed to get into some sort of software update and repair rubble through Google's troubleshooting, and the pixel really wrote to me \"waiting for rescue orders\" but there is no support for Israel and I could not continue ..\n The phone is currently disabled\n Can help me with guidance on what else can be done",
