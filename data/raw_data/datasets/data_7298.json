    "content": "I have been using Pixel 4 with a film screen protector or a glass screen protector and never encounter any touch issue until recently. It is either not responsive or \"invisible\" touch on its own. Even after the recent update, it did not solve the problem. I have to remove the screen protector but sometimes I also felt unresponsive touch (Always at the center of the screen). Anyone have such issue? Can Google advice?",
