    "title": "How do I rollback Android 11 update?",
    "content": "I just updated to Android 11 on my Pixel 4. However, there is a bug where the whole screen lags and I lose all haptic feedback. The lag happens when I try to type on the keyboard. It is intermittent. I can restart the system and it would be gone but after a while it would come back. \n\nDo I need to rollback this update? The phone isn't functional with the keyboard just freezing everytime I use it. I understand Android 11 has a keyboard feature so I suspect this is causing the issue. This isn't the beta version but the official rollout I got on my phone.\n\nEdit :\n\nIt's not a keyboard issue but seems to be a delayed response from the screen though the keyboard makes this the most apparent. I lose haptic feedback when this delayed response happens.",
