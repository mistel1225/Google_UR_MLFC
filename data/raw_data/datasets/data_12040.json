    "content": "I have tried everything including 5+ hours on the phone with tech support twice, Been through 2 factory resets after battery went bonkers, draining charge while thinking it was charging and not plugged in. First reset resulted in zero sync, 2nd reset loaded up 2 weeks of phone data, most of text data, and NO CONTACT DATA. Tried everything I could find posted going back 4 years, all to no avail.",
