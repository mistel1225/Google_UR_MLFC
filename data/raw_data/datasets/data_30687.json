    "content": "Okay, I have scoured the forums (fora?) so I'm not just posting here without due diligence. Until a few months ago I was able to connect my Pixel 2 XL  to my Windows system via USB, transfer files, everything was peachy. Then somehow I started getting the \"USB Device Not Recognized\" error. Tried every one of my six systems, tried different USB-A to USB-c (2.0 and 3.0) cables, tried different ports, updated my Pixel OS, am in Developer Mode, deleted Storage and Media caches and data - nothing changes.\nI've tried to download the latest Pixel 2 drivers but everything is Zipped and when I unZip the packet there's no executable or seemingly anything I can use to point the :Unknown USB Device\" in Device Manager to an updated driver.\nAnyone have any new ideas?\nThanks for looking and any advice you might have.\nTom",
