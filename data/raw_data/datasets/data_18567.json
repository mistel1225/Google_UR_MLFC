    "title": "Pixel 3a XL unable to make and receive phone calls under LTE network",
    "content": "I haven't been able to make and receive phone calls under the LTE network in Hong Kong yet if I force the preferred network over to 3G, I am then able to make and receive phone calls. Tried the following methods but no joy so far:\n\n- Clearing cache and user data didn't help\n- Uninstalling/Reinstalling updates for the Phone app didn't help\n- Placed the sim card into my old phone and there were no issues in making and receiving calls\n- Placed another overseas sim card into my Pixel 3a XL and there were no issues in making and receiving phone calls under the 4G network and under roaming too\n- Even when I magically end up being able to make or receive a phone call under the LTE network (which is like once out of every 10 attempts), the quality remains very poor and mobile data connection completely drops out\n- Mobile data connection and signal strength remains fine when not making/receiving phone calls\n- No network faults reports by the network operator in Hong Kong\n\nTrying to avoid a complete factory reset so would really appreciate any solutions that might help!",
