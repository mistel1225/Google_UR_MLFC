    "content": "I have a pixel 4 xl on Google fi carrier but I've never been able to get chat features (rcs) running. At one point it was infinitely verifying the phone number but then overnight the entire chat features menu vanished and it just says it's unavailable on my device and also that my carrier, Google fi, does not support it. I've tried clearing caches and force stopping data for both carrier services and messages. They're also updated to the latest version.",
