    "content": "I'm trying to backup my SMS and MMS messages as my phone has been buggy for a few months. I tried the SMS Backup+ that's recommended on other sites, but I get a Google security error so haven't done that. I would like to restore them, or be able to export them somewhere searchable.\n\nI text a lot for work and while if I lost the phone that would be that, but I can't bring myself to restore without backing up. \n\nSo are there any links or answers? Some way to backup or export would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThank you in advance!",
