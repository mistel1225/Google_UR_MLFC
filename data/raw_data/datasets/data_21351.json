    "content": "I can activate my esim. After having scanned the QR code the activation fails.\nIs this feature (e-sim in Pixel 4) available in Hungary? By Telekom Hungary?\nThe operator states they can support or they can guarantee the service for those phones that they are selling.\nBut what is the difference between a Google and a Samsung phone? OK, I know very well, that's the reason why im waiting so long for my Pixel 4.\nDoes anybody know (or suggest) how can I solve this issue?",
