    "title": "Pixel 4 Messaging app says \"sending...\" but message is delivered. Mainly to other pixel devices.",
    "content": "Pixel 4, up to date.  Messaging app just recently started acting up.\n\nWhen I send a message to someone with another pixel device, wifi or over network, it says \"sending...\" and eventually will time out and say \"tap to resend\".  But, it appears the person is getting the message on the other end right away.\n\nI've tested by texting 5 different people in my family with pixel devices (from pixel 1 to pixel 4) and get the same result.  \n\nTexting iphone people seems to work fine.  It immediately goes to Now SMS.\n\nThis just started happening a couple days ago.  I don't recall any recent updates to my phone.\n\nI have tried rebooting and clearing the apps cache.  Not fixed.  I don't want to reinstall and lose my messages (unless there is a way to archive them).",
