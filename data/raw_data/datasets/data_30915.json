    "content": "Hi Team,\n\nThis is the worst customer support which anyone can get from any company. Your executives will disconnect the call when they do not have answers to customer query. It has happened to me twice once by Surya and now today again by his supervisor Om. Both do not have any solution and do not want to hear the customer point. Gurpreet (another supervisor) also mentione that I will get a call back but I didn't get any. And when I wanted to speak to Manager they simply denied the request. I am chasing Google from last 4 days on my ticket GL0067941. No resolution from them. When phone was picked up from my place it did not have any dent on the phone but now when I got a estimate to PAY for repair of device it has dent even if its under warranty. Trail mail also contains the pictures which was shared with me by Google (3 are when phone was picked up from my plave and second now from your Technical team. I also have a log sheet which was shared with me at the time of picking up my phone which also didn't say anything about the dent or damage.\n\nMy issue is if there is a physical damage done post the phone was picked up from my place Why do I need to pay to repair the same?\nIf there is issue with screen due to some internal malfunction why do Customer need to Pay even when the phone is under warranty?\n\nWould appreciate if any of the Manager or anyone from Management team can respond to above request as your Execs and Supervisors are dragging it since long.\n\nRegards,\nHanish Kataria",
