    "content": "After a few days of use, Chrome on my Pixel 4a displays a \"no internet connection\" banner at the top, but data works just fine. This occurs on both mobile (Google Fi) & wifi data. The problem, other than the annoying banner at the top taking up space, is all my apps will stop notifications at this time... For example, I'll no longer get Gmail notifications when email comes in. Clearing cache and data doesn't help... Only a reboot. Attached a screenshot of the banner, right now, while writing this.",
