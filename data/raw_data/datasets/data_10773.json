    "content": "Hi there, I recently got a new pixel 5 and I'm mostly happy. I do seem to take some issue with the screen though. Coming from the Pixel 3 I was rather surprised that everything seems pretty washed out (dark texts look like grey etc) and it's pretty obvious when the phone is next to the pixel 3, not sure if that's normal. My other issues is that when nightlight is enabled the bottom 3rd of the screen looks very redish in comparison to the rest of the screen which is super obvious on darker backgrounds. Almost like a redish and more saturated gradient. Anyone else experienced that issue? I rebooted into safe mode and these issue appear there too. Any help appreciated",
