    "content": "I have been using my pixel 4 for few months. And a small black dot started appearing at a corner. I checked about it and later it started spreading. After 2 weeks, the entire screen is black now. I'm not able to use my phone anymore. I tried contacting support.google.com to get help with replacement or paid repair. But Google didn't respond to any of our queries #teampixel and #madebygoogle . I still request Google to please give me an option to solve this issue of my phone screen.",
