    "content": "When I go to install an app from my apps screen (::: button on home screen) I long press on the app which pops up two options:\n\nApp info and uninstall \n\nI swipe or tap uninstall and the screen exits back to home but doesn't uninstall the app. I am able to uninstall from app info but not the uninstall swipe. \n\nIt's an annoying extra step to have to take to go to app info. \n\nAndroid Version 9 all updates installed. Anyone else having this issue? \n\nIt also won't uninstall from the home screen  either. ",
