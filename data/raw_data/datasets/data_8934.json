    "content": "Hi My pixel 3a is broken.\nI was told by Google to send it to the Returns team.\nWhich I did.\nIt came back to me. The phone was returned to my address by DHL.\nSince then I've been waiting for Google to get back to me and they don't.\nI don't manage to get hold of them.\nPlease can you help?\nThanks\nSonia",
