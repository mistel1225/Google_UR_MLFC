    "content": "Hello, \n\nJust got the Pixel 5. Love the phone but aware the top speaker is under the screen. I've got the volume cranked up to full but it's hard to hear people I'm speaking to. Did a test this morning in my quiet living room. I could hear them but not massively. I feel as soon as I go into a louder environment it will be impossible to hear. Any one else experienced this? \n\nThanks",
