    "content": "Hi everyone!\nI got my brand new pixel 4 a few days ago and now have an issue with wireless charging.\nI bought a wireless charger on amazon (don't know if it's ok to post links here, but here it is: https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B07Y9J68TC/).\nSo, the problem is that when I place pixel 4 on top of the pad, the phone starts \"flapping\". I see current battery status, then it changes to \"wireless charging\", then back to the percentage, then... In the end, it either is charing or not, so I take it off and place again a few times to get it charging.\nI tested a pad with another phone, it works without this issue. I also tried it without the phone case, same thing.",
