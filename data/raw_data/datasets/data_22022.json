    "content": "I have a pixel xl 4. I have connected it to my bluthoot earphones (jabra elite 65t active) - and then lost control over the voice volume during phone calls (when not using the ear phones) - meaning its very louad and I have no ability to lower it (the volume key is responsive, but the sound volume stays the same). the only way i can fix it is by formating the device and not instaling the ear phones.",
