    "content": "I have 2 devices. A Pixel 3 and a Pixel 3a. Both are on Airtel eSIM with no issues. However since the past 3 days I see that the Wifi calling is enabled on the Pixel 3a but not on the Pixel 3. Airtel customer server is insisting that the feature is not enabled from Google's side even though I tell them it is working on the Pixel 3a. How can I get it enabled on the Pixel 3? Any ideas? Other Pixel 3a owners please confirm if it works for you.",
