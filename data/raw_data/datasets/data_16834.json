    "content": "Unable to make or receive calls, line keeps dropping and hanging up.  Other end may hear static or nothing.  All working with Android Auto in my car.  The problem is i'm not in my car much.  I tried disabling Bluetooth, clearing cache, updating phone, check settings. This happened one time a couple years ago, but an update solved the problem.  I know the phone is in working order, it's probably a software issue and I plus many other people need this resolved.  BTW my husband has an IPhone and his works great and is older than mine.",
