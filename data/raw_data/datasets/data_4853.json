    "title": "What are the haptic vibrations in camera mode? Can you shut them off?",
    "content": "Just recently, my phone will vibrate intermittently when in camera mode taking pictures.  The vibrations are slight and quick and in no pattern I can discern.  They feel like the haptic vibrations like what I feel when I switch from the front to rear camera.  What is this and how can I turn it off?  If I lower the haptic settings overall, it seems to affect the keyboard and other things, but not this.  I find this annoying and kind of distracting so any help is appreciated.  Thanks",
