    "content": "I returned my Pixel 3 XL to google 10 days ago and no replacement has been sent.  the phone was only 3 weeks old when it BRICKED.  I contacted support and with their direction I tried all their suggestions to restore and reset the phone to no avail.  Upon receiving an RMA number and return label I sent it accordingly.  it's now 10 days later and have contacted support 2 times by email, 2 times by Chat, and now once by phone.  each time they responded with very little other then the case has been escalated and they are waiting from Shipping or Warehouse for acknowledgement.  This is unacceptable.  your competition would have sent a replacement by now or if they had a local store would have replaced it on the spot.",
