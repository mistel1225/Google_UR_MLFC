    "title": "For some reason I have a second \"time\" on my ambient Display.",
    "content": "When my phone is idle there is a second \"time\" being displayed to the right of my indicator that looks like an alarm. I only have one alarm set for 5:30am, and I never change it. This time is sometimes up to 10 minutes ahead of my normal time. Like right now, it is 3:56 and this time says 4:06. It changes when I unlock the phone. I have deleted the alarms and the \"alarm\" icon will stay with that time next to it it seems to be pretty consistent with being 10 minutes ahead. Any ideas what this is referring to? I do not have any other Timer or alarm apps on the phone I use the built in Pixel alarm.\n\nI attached a screenshot, it is showing 3:59 as that unknown time. Any thoughts?",
