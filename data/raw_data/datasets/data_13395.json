    "title": "Pixel4a Camera Choppy, especially on recording video and Instagram",
    "content": "When I use my camera, when taking photos the focus takes a while to work, with some stuttery/choppy bars on the screen until it focuses. this is manageable. But whenever i take a video it is even worse as I pan it, and the choppyness is recorded in the final copy. This is especially worse when using the instagram app, where its nearly impossible to take a video with the choppy bars. (not sure about the right terminology here)",
