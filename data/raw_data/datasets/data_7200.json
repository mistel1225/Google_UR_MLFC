    "content": "Since I changed my phone to Pixel every time I send a text message, I get a notification that the message has not been sent but the receiver gets the message at least 4 times in a row. I talked to my network provider and they told me to change my SMSC number and it helped for 2 days and then the problem came back. Moreover, today I got 5 text messages from another person, and they sent it just once. What can I do to fix it?",
