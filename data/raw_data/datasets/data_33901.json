    "content": "I have had a number of calls that show up in my T-Mobile usage that I did not make, and somehow, without my knowledge, my phone was set to forward calls to a number that I have no information about.  It looks like the calls show up as wi-fi calls in the T-Mobile usage log.  I corrected the forwarding settings, but unauthorized calls were still showing outgoing.  This phone was linked to my google voice account. \n\nI have factory re-set the Pixel and installed a new sim from T-Mobile. After adding my gmail to the reset Pixel and then installing Google Voice app, I am now seeing unauthorized outgoing calls again.\n\nAfter re-setting the Pixel and installing a new sim, T-Mobile tech support is saying that this must be a pixel/google voice issue.  Is there any help you can give me to secure this phone and/or my google voice account?",
