    "content": "Hi, I recently upgraded to the Pixel 3, and am trying to figure out how to disable sound notifications from select apps such as Facebook Messenger. I still want to visually see the notification, and possibly vibrate, but no sound. \n\nI have tried the following:\n1.  Settings > Apps & Notifications > Messenger > Notifications\nThere is no way to change the audio notifications from this screen\n\n2.  Settings > Apps & Notifications > Messenger > Notifications > Additional settings in the app\nNotification sound doesn't have a \"silent\" option, nor a toggle option.\n\nSimilar issue for gmail app, and others.",
