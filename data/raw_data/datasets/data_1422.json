    "content": "My brand new Pixel 4a keeps dropping off of wifi CONSTANTLY without warning or reason. Every other device in the house if fine, but the Pixel drops off so much that I've burned through a ton of mobile data just doing regular things because I didn't notice it had dropped off WiFi again. \nThis is a brand new phone, so it shouldn't be having these issues ..",
