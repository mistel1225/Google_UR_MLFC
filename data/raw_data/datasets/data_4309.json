    "content": "Why isn't Google pixel focusing on making compact phones anymore unlike iPhone 12 mini? The phone sizes are growing ridiculously large. Doesn't fit in hands. Doesn't fit in pockets, pops out weirdly. Can't hold them while running, even fitting to arms feels so huge. As pillion, you can never use phone to navigate or take urgent Cals on bike, because it's difficult to pull the Elephant sized phones.",
