    "content": "As a previous owner of a Nexus 5, that was a great phone with 2 major flaws, the battery sucked and it took bad pictures. The best thing about the Nexus 5 was that it was the goldilocks size, not too small, not to big but just right. The Pixel 5 has good battery life and takes good pictures, where it errs is in size. The height of the device is too tall at 144.7 mm. What Google should do in 2021 is make the Pixel 6 with a height of 137.9 mm to match the old Nexus 5. To satisfy the people who like phablets also make a Pixel 6 XL version as well. Give them large batteries and good cameras and a lot of people that bought other Android phones will buy the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 XL.",
