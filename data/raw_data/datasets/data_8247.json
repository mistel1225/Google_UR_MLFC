    "content": "Hi, set up my pixel 4a. Signed in and it used my secondary name and email as the primary one. (The secondary email is usedso the first doesn't get spammed from different companies)   Deleted that email and user. Only have the one account linked to my phone. However whenever I send photos to people it sends it with my secondary name not my name. When I go into settings I changed the name of the account. However when I still send photos it says the wrong name. When I do a test and send myself the message/photo the first pic is from the wrong name and the second is from me. Please any help",
