    "content": "I've spoken to customer service and everything was great at first. However, I've received a white pixel phone due to stock availability and I've suggested that I can wait for a black one (the original colour I sent in for replacement). \n\nAccording to \"policies\" I have no choice and will need to stick to white. I asked for which policies, and have been replied with various paraphrased emails that say, \"Sorry, it is stock unavailability\" even though the representatives quoted that they were following policies.\n\nThe lack of communication, avoiding to answer my question in regards to policy (that they brought upon themselves) and re-phrasing emails over and over again is just ridiculous.",
