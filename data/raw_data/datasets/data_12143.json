    "title": "Pixel 4a Silent Notifications automatically being set for apps",
    "content": "Recently got my pixel 4a and one of the most annoying things that I\"m running into is that the notifications are randomly being set to silent mode. This is happening to all of my apps, not just a few either. I made sure the notifications are set to \"Default\" at first, and at random times ( I can't pin point a pattern) it would set the conversations or notifications back to silent, so i wouldn't hear the sound my phone should make. \n\nIve done a bit of research and I believe there are others that have this issue as well. Anyone have a workaround? It's frustrating to constantly have to check your phone to make sure you don't miss a notification.",
