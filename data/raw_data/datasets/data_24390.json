    "content": "I live in Bahrain, and  I bought a Pixel 2 xl from Dubai. I found out that Bahrain doesnt get the updates for the phone over network, so I was updating it by sideloading the new updates every month by myself and everything worked fine. \nBut the Jan 2020 update hasnt been posted on the developers page for any of the devices and I cant download it to update my phone. What can I do to update it now?",
