    "content": "I have just changed from an original Google Pixel, to a Pixel 3. I have remained on the same network (EE in the UK) and swapped the sim card from the old device into the new.\n\nHowever, the reception on the Pixel 3 is much worse than on the Pixel. I used to get reasonable 4G coverage in my house, so I could easily use Skype. However, the Pixel 3 seems to drop out of 4G into \"H\" or \"E\" and things like Skype are now basically unusable.\n\nIs this a software or hardware issue? It's pretty disappointing to be honest, as the aerial on the Pixel seemed pretty good.",
