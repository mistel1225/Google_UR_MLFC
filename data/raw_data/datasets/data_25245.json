    "content": "After installing the Android/Pixel security updates for December 2019, Pixel 2 device stopped functioning. \nIt is stuck now on the Google animation loop mode, refuses to power on or start through the bootloader. \nWithin the bootloader, Recovery Mode doesn't work either -- any press of the button results in screen blacking out, and turning back on to the Google logo/white screen. \nThis Google logo/white screen keeps going on and off constantly.\nWhen connected to charger, the battery sign shows and then disappears to show a black screen\nHave tried pressing Power On - holding 30 seconds; multiple times -- no change\nHave tried Power Off on bootloader, and then restarting -- no change\nTook the phone to different servicing shops, and they are unable to solve the issue\nHard / soft reset option not available either\n\nAny suggestions on what to do next? Thanks!",
