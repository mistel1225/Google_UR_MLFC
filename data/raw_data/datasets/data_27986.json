    "content": "I have a 3a XL with Android 10.  I need to add a SIM to E-Sim.  I have read the help article but it seems to be missing some information.\nI can enable the \"2 number\" feature but exactly what is the process to add it as an e-sim?  Do I have to remove my original Sim and insert the 2nd Sim and then add it as an e-sim?  And then replace with my original Sim?",
