    "content": "My Google Pixel 2 XL has major issues since updating a few hours ago.  I've had this phone a year and a half now and have been absolutely impressed by it's speed, battery, quality, camera, etc.  It truly is an iPhone equalizer, if not better.  Each time I use the phone, I discover a new problem.  Here's a list of discovered problems that I have had in the first three hours of Android 10:\n\n1) phone lags and is sluggish\n2) gets hot during normal usage\n3) battery drains twice as fast now\n4) battery won't fast charge\n5) Gmail crashes\n6) no SIM card recognized\n7) couldn't make a phone call unless I used Wi-Fi calling\n8) couldn't receive calls\n9) can't check voicemail \n(I know 7, 8, and 9 are all due to 6)",
