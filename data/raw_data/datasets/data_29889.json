    "content": "I have read different forums and tried to leave my phone charging which does charge it just does not turn on. When it turns on it shows the google logo then turns off. I am currently out of Canada and need to speak to a representative urgently in order to figure out what to do. I spent a whole year waiting for this phone, saved up and bought it only for it to break in 3 weeks and now I am out of the country with no working phone, please help me.",
