    "content": "Battery backup on the Android 10 was a mess.\nAfter downgrading with the help of the Android developer forum, I noticed a huge drop of battery from 75% to 48% immediately after downgrading.\nAndroid 10 seems to have a battery calibration issue rather than a battery drain issue apparantly.\nOther than this whole battery issue, Android 10 is a pretty sweet upgrade from pie and I hope this battery issue goes away for good.\nWaiting for the next build to roll out soon",
