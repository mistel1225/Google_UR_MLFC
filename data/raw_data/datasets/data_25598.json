    "content": "My phone died because of low charge. Then I tried connecting to the charger, it didn't work for a while. \n\nLater it got charged. I switched it on, this time it stopped charging. \n\nAfter 2 days of looking into the solutions, I can only say none of the supporting materials worked so far. \nCurrently, phone is not even charging while its Power OFF/ON. \nI have been using this device for more than a year now (Pixel 2 XL) \n\nApart from this issue, the phone works totally fine.",
