    "title": "Received a broken device as a replacement for my OG Pixel 4 that had google hardware/warranty issues",
    "content": "I had an issue with charging and screen flickering on my original Pixel 4, I sent it into Google for a warranty replacement before consulting my carrier (mistake). The refurbished device I received 14 days later had a scratch on the screen and a small ding on the top of the chasis. Immediately after turning it on for the first time the screen flickered wildly. I figured maybe it was just sorting itself out, but lo and behold three days later the screen quits completely. I started another help session with google one week ago (Wednesday, July 22) and they agreed to do an advanced replacement if I authorized a $1100 hold on my payment. I don't have that kind of money available during these hard times and have requested repeatedly over the past week to set up a normal return and no one is getting back to me. All said and done I will be unable to use my Pixel 4 for an entire month , for which I still have to pay my phone bill and Google Support will do nothing in the way of an apology / compensation for their repeated inadequacy. Has anyone else had to deal with this?",
