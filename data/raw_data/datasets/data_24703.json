    "content": "Hey. Just got my pixel 3a black 64GB from b&h and I'm noticing that the screen has a warm tint on the top and a cool tint towards the bottom. Moreover when I turn the screen horizontally, the change of colors is even more noticeable, which causes great discomfort when using. But now I'm in Russia for years, I don't know what to do",
