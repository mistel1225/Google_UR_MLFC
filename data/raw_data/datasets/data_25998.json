    "content": "Since a week, I am unable to share videos taken on my Pixel 2 xl on Whatsapp. The videos are not that big. Once shared, I get this message under the shared video - Untitled Bin. The recipient is unable to see the video and they see the same message. This was not happening a week before. Anyone having similar issues? I am not sure if this is a whatsapp issue or the way videos are saved on Pixel.",
