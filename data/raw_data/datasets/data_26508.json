    "title": "New Pixel 3a screen cuts out when pressing firmly on it",
    "content": "I bought a Pixel 3a last night and have noticed that when I apply firm pressure to the middle of the screen around where the power and volume buttons are, it cuts out or displays a weird pattern of horizontal lines like the connection to the OLED panel is being broken. The touch works fine as it will still register a long press even when the panel is blanked out.\n\nI wasn't expecting to have an issue like this less than 24 hours after purchase. Is this a known issue, or have I just got a dud phone? \n\nI know you don't generally apply pressure like that, but I was expecting something a bit more robust.",
