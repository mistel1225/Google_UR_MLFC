    "content": "I have issues with one of my hands and have difficulty holding down my phone while simultaneously holding the volume and the power button to take a screenshot with this new update. I loved the ability to just hold down the power button on Android 10. I've tried to swipe up to get the screen shot option but nothing is showing for me and I know others are having the same issues with the swipe as I am. Is there a work around for the two button screen shot or can someone tell me what I am doing wrong with the swipe? Thanks",
