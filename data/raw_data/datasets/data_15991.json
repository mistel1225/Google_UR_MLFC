    "content": "Hello, \n\nIt appears that ever since the 11 upgrade, my Pixel 3 XL's earpiece volume is extremely low. \n\nI have all the volumes on max. The volume through bluetooth speaker or car is fine. And speaker phone volume is the same as it use to be, But the earpiece volume I can no longer hear anyone or anything unless I am in a place that is completely silent. \n\nI have tried a reboot several times to no avail. Am about to try a master reset. Is there anything else I could do that would pinpoint if it is a mechanical concern or software related?\n\nThank you for your time,\n\nSean",
