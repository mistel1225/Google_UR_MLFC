    "title": "Pixel 2 - Shipping and Refunds Support Department - Bug??",
    "content": "My phone was plagued with a static screen. I believe the issue was a connection to the display. I sent in the phone under warranty to the repair center and have expected to receive a refurbished phone. It has been 3 weeks since the repair center received my phone and they have still not shipped a refurbished phone to me. At this point I would have rather gotten the phone repaired at a local shop.\n\nThe case was forwarded to the shipping and refunds department. They filed the case as a bug on October 31st. I have not received any updates and all of my inquires have been ignored. \n\nHas anyone experienced customer service similar to this? My attempts at getting in contact with the shipping and refunds department have failed and my only contact information is an email address. Is there a way to contact the shipping and refunds department? \n\nGoogle support's customer support has advised me to stop calling them even though my case has not been resolved.",
