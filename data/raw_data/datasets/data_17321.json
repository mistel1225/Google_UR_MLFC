    "content": "My Voice Match module won't enable after training. I go through the training process but at the end, the Next button won't appear unless I jump to another app and come back. Then when I do get the Next button and I click it, I get the driving warning, I hit OK, and that's it. The Hey Google module is still disabled. I've rebooted the phone and made sure my phone is updated. Thanks",
