    "content": "For a while now my phone has been shutting down when there still appears to be battery charge remaining.\n\nJust now for example, I was on 13% - and it just went into it's shutdown cycle - as it was doing this I plugged in the charger and rebooted. \n\nAfter its usual boot cycle the phone came back on with a battery displaying 53% \n\nTotal time from shutdown to reboot? A few minutes at most.\n\nNow, am in to believe that in those couple of minutes the battery suddenly gained 40% charge?\n\nSeems a bit odd to me. \n\nAny thoughts on this?",
