    "title": "Pixel 3 selfie distortion STILL a problem",
    "content": "It has been years and the front facing camera is still entirely useless for selfies. Photo processing will squash and distort your face if you aren't perfectly in center. Contacting support has done nothing, they give us the same responses: \"This is the first time I've heard of this issue\" \"Have you tried factory resetting?\" \"Clearing the cache?\" \"Deleting apps?\" \n\nThen when nothing works, they offer you a replacement phone, and guess what? The problem still persists because it's a software issue. \n\n90% of us bought the pixel 3 for the camera, and to have it be THIS bad is upsetting. Especially when support keeps brushing it off as a \"non-issue\" and won't listen to us when we say it's a problem on ALL pixel 3 phones. \n\nIf you want to recreate the issue you can do so by turning on the golden ratio grid and putting your face in the top corner. Take a picture and quickly click on the photo so you can view before and after it processes. \n\nMany of us found a work around before the Android 10 update, by turning HDR off (which greatly reduced the photo quality but at least we didn't look squashed). But the recent update has even prevented that from working. \n\nI love this phone, but seriously, address the camera issue PLEASE.",
