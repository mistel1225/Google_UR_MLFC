    "content": "I've had my Pixel 3 XL for a couple of months and I love it. I also have a Pixel Stand for charging.\n\nI put my 'phone on charge of an evening and it charges quickly to 100%. For a wee while now, I've noticed that - even if the 'phone is at 100% at 21.00, by morning at around 08.00, it's down to 85 to 88%. The strange part is that, during the day when my 'phone gets the most use, I hardly drop battery strength at all.\n\nMy 'phone is on standby - not completely switched off - overnight with all the battery-saving, data-saver and Do Not Disturbs turned on. I don't have any third-party apps that could affect it.\n\nI'm not making a big deal of this, it works all day easily, but I'd love to know why this happens.",
