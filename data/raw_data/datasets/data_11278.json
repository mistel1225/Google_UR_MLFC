    "content": "Hi guys\n\nHad my pixel 4a for 2 or 3 weeks. For the past 3 days my mobile data randomly stops working and the \"LTE\" icon dissappears and displays no mobile data connection. When I pull down the notification tray it shows that mobile data is still switched on and displays a \"H\" underneath the icon.\n\nWhen this happens I lose all mobile data connection, 3G&2G included. I've spoken to my mobile provider and they have looked into it and are adament its nothing on their end and its the device itself.\n\nWhen this happens I've tried turning off mobile data for a few minutes and turning back on, then on airplane mode for a few minutes and turn back off and restart the phone and nothing helps.\n\nIs anyone else experiencing this? Any idea how to fix?\n\nThanks in advance",
