    "content": "Hi,\nJust sharing something I found interesting. I just compared 2 photos side by side from my old Pixel 2 against my pixel 5. Both photos were pointed at the same subject and at the same zoom level (3.2x). The results were not what I expected. Both phones were running the stock camera app with the same version #.\nThe pixel 2 was taking clearer and shaper photos than the pixel 5. I know google updated its Super Res Zoom algorithms with Google camera 8, but man, its actually worse than not having it. Pixel 2 doesnt support super res zoom so I dont understand how its taking better photos.\nThe problem is that the pixel 5 is creating really pixelated \"checkerboard\" patterns around text and objects and the pixel 2 does not seem to do this, resulting in a clearer image.\nIm getting more and more disappointed by this phone and regretting my purchase. The only reason I buy pixel devices is for the camera and stock android. But more so for the former.\nAnyone else notice this? I will post a link to some images to highlight the differences.\nLink to comparison https://imgur.com/gallery/ydKlB3u",
