    "content": "Hi, my main concern before buying the pixel 4a is that its service stations. What i should do if I'll face any issue with the phone I'll buy. I've searched a lot for this but I don't see any authorised service centers who can fix the phone. Since I don't live in big metro cities, how tough is it to get the phone repaired?",
