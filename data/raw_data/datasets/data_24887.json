    "title": "Playing Chrome media while in lockscreen mode - how do I stop it from timing out?",
    "content": "I'm listening to a video via Chrome on my phone. I can lock the phone and then restart the media audio. However, it times out and shuts off after about 10 min. Of interest I can hit play again from the lockscreen but it doesn't work. I have to unlock the screen, start the video, lock the screen again, and then restart it from the lock screen.\n\nI find this process really disruptive to my listening experience. Are there any settings that prevent this time out from occurring?\n\nTIA",
