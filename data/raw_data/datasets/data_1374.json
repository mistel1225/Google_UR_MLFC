    "content": "So for the last three days my phone has had an instant drain and then shut down after reaching about 50%. Today it was at 53% and I was reading an article then the screen went blank and shut down. I plugged the phone in restarted it and it said 53% so I went to check battery usage and I watched my batter go from 53 to 25% to 20% to 8% to 0% in less then a minutes time. I have checked my battery usage and it states the apps are running normal battery usage. I don't know what else to do. Help!",
