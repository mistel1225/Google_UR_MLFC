    "content": "Lots of photos turn out to be corrupt when taking pictures using Pixel 3. The rate is around 1 in 50 and it's really frustrating. Look at the below album for example. Turn motion On then Off to see the difference. \n\nhttps://photos.app.goo.gl/c8BLZqrbth6MnTtKA\n\nI've tried clearing the cache and all data from both the photo and the camera app, but this doesn't solve the issue.",
