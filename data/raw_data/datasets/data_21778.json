    "content": "When I enter the google searching bar on the wall, it said \"Google keeps stopping.\"\nI also can't access to assistance as well.\nSo I updated all the system and app, restarted the device many times, followed the instruction on the internet, but it doesn't work.\nShould I have to reset or just wait?\nI don't remember because it was to fast to read, I think I read the message means 'it's hard to access google right now in Korea\" something like that.",
