    "title": "Google Pixel 4XL. Nano-SIM and e-SIM can not activate same time (ONLY ONE IMEI)",
    "content": "All Firmware/Security Patches are up-to date. Normal restart, but no firmware-reset yet (need to re-install everything) - Normal Nano-Sim and E-Sim are working, but only separate. According Phone Information there is only ONE IMEI. This can not work of course. DontÂ´t have original package anymore to check, but as far i know it should work and have at least 2 IMEI. - Also deleted and re-install e-SIM. No use. Where is the 2nd IMEI ?\n\nPlease help.",
