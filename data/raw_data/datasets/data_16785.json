    "content": "No clarity for ALL CARRIERS EXCEPT \"IN\",  \nin the sense Android 11 is not rolled out in India for pixel owners if I am not wrong. Then if it is true why the source is propagating like Android 11 is available to all pixel owners. Is not disgusting to Pixel owners in India?...As a routine part and exercises of monthly updates or major upgrades, we are all used to get the same as first as prominent and prioritised before releasing to rest of the other brands. But this time where it is already released on 8th, but today 10th...Plz find the ground reality and give a true justification. Really hates to hear the same ancient song lyrics as \"It will take 2 weeks time to reach to Pixel Owners\"",
