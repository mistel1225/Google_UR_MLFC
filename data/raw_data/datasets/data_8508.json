    "content": "So as above, my Pixel 5 wont connect to my laptop with a USB cable.\n\nNow, my laptop doesn't have USB C ports, so I used a USB A to USB C cable.\nThe cable I used works for data transfer for all my other android phones, but not the Pixel 5.\n\nI searched the internet for solutions and not one worked.\n\nSo I contacted Google Support and after a couple of hours of chatting, they said they'd replace it under warranty.\nThat device arrived today and guess what...\n\nIt doesn't connect to my Laptop.\n\nAll my other android phones do. My wifes Pixel 5 also doesn't connect to my laptop.\n\nSo, what the heck do I do?",
