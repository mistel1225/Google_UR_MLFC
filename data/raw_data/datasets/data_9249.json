    "content": "Yesterday the fingerprint scanner stopped responding to any touch (not vibrating when touched etc) , as if there was no sensor there at all.\n\nAt first I thought I might have broken the sensor somehow, but looking at the device settings I can see that Pixel Imprint, or any other options to use a fingerprint scanner for passcode lock etc are gone?\n\nBeen on Android 11 for a few weeks now but this has only started since yesterday. Anybody else experiencing this?\n\nWill back it up and maybe give it a factory reset to see if it helps...",
