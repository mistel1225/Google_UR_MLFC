    "title": "Why Cricket Hotspot works in Samsung J7 star and not Pixel 2 XL?",
    "content": "We have the top plan for Cricket, Unlimited & 15 mbps Hotspot.  Ever since we switched back because they were \"NOW\" offering hotstop, our 2 unlocked Pixel 2 XLs do not work when trying to tether/turn on hotspot.  I have 2 unlock phones, Samsung J7 Star, from MetroPCS and to my surprise hotspot does work both of them.  Whether it is with our 3rd line or just one of our sim cards.  What is going on with the Pixel that is not able to activate the Hotspot for the Criket network, it just doesn't make sense to me.  The Pixel 2XL nor the Samsung J7 are in Cricket's \"hotspot supported devices\", nor were they bought from Cricket.\nI already restarted, reset the network, not sure what else to try or why this is going on.",
