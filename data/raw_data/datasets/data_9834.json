    "content": "I can connect via bluetooth to the handsfree link in my 2014 Honda Civic and my music plays, but it shows that there's no device connected so I cannot use my music controls. It used to show the song playing and I could change the song using the steering wheel controls. I can still hear the music and can control with my phone, but it kind of defeats the purpose of having handsfree technology. I've tried deleting the device and re-connecting. I also contacted Honda and they said it was and Android issue and that there's no update available to my car system. Has anyone else had this issue? Any suggestions?",
