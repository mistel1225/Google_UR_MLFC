    "content": "Whenever I'm listening to music, watching videos, or absolutely anything that involves audio, the audio at random times will make a distorted crackling sound then the audio goes out completely, usually this pauses/freezes the video or audio that's playing, this happens even when connected to Bluetooth and the only thing that temporarily fixes it is rebooting my phone until it happens again shortly after.",
