    "content": "sorry - bit of a Luddite here. I have to log on using my @gmail account but I only want to use my @comcast.net email as my default. I've entered the address and password, but when I try and log on I keep getting shunted to the gmail account, even though the comcast.net e-mail and password appear to be on my phone somewhere. How do I access it every time when I turn my phone on?  Apologies in advance for the newbie question. . . . .",
