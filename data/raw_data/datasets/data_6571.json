    "content": "Hi, i have a pixel 5 , after the recent update . The Bluetooth gets cut (only the audio , device is still connected but no output/input) off when screen is turned off. This happens when i am listening to music and also if i am in a call(via whatsapp) , using a Bluetooth device. I tried with different devices but still the issue is there. In some cases the audio comes back after some delay.",
