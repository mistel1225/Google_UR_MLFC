    "title": "After recent Android Pie update I have no cell service",
    "content": "After the Android pie recent update to build number PQ3a.190705.001, I no longer have cell service and after removing the SIM card and re installing it three times as well as deleting all third party apps then performing a factory data reset as well as a network connectivity reset and being sent a new SIM card I still have no cell service. Google's answer was to replace my phone but would not do so under warranty because I have a slight crack in my screen next to my speaker that has no bearing to this issue. after explaining to them that I'm not looking to replace my phone and just roll back the most recent software update their response was only to offer a new phone after I go to there pre-approved installer to fix the phone screen and then I can submit it for replacement. in other words I have to spend $150 to repair my screen so they can send me a refurbished phone and never attempt to resolve why the software update shut off my cell service.",
