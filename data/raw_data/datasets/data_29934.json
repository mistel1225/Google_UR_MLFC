    "content": "Had the Google Pixel 2 for like a year, and we just bought it out to switch providers... Yesterday the screen just went black. I could tap stuff, and feel it vibrate like I did something, and it would make sounds, but the screen was just black. Every now and then by tapping power it would slightly flash in the top half of the screen for a fraction of a second. It would show the power, time, etc. which would normally be shown.\n\nI tried turning it off, holding the buttons to start in safe mode, and even brought it into the phone store, where they restored the phone to factory settings, and even tried taking out the card (because we put the card in an old phone so we could at least use our phone account).\n\nConsidering the phone is like a year old, shouldn't it be covered by an automatic warranty? How do I go about getting this repaired? The phone repair shop is going to charge close to $300 to fix it, which is nuts. They said this is common with the Google Pixel, as if Google is just selling garbage to people and telling them to deal with it when the tech breaks. Can I not get this repaired for free since it's fairly new?",
