    "title": "Google Photos storage filling up despite unlimited Pixel 3 (and sometimes \"empties\")",
    "content": "The last month, I noticed my Google Photos storage increasing, despite all my photos being taken by a Pixel 3 (unlimited until 2022). No other photos were being uploaded other than by the Pixel 3. When working with support to understand what was filling up my storage, they just kept quoting the storage rules/policy but no \"fix\".\n\nDuring the call, the storage fixed itself with Photos online storage going from 9 gb to 4 gb (that is where it has been for a very long time). Storage stayed at 4 gb for a week and now started to fill up again and has maxed out. Again, I took some video with the Pixel 3 and some pictures (not that many) and as they upload default at full, they should not have taken up any more space.\n\nGoogle doesn't seem to have a way to see what \"counts\" against the space in Google Photos. So hard for me to troubleshoot.\n\nAnyone else see this?",
