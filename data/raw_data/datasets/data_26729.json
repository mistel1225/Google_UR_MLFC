    "content": "I dropped my phone and its screen broke, as well as pixels in it that now turned dark, also, the phone now sometimes does gestures on its own (drop down menu) and changes brightness or colors randomly. I know Google's warranty doesnt cover accidents (great warranty...), So ive been trying to get into contact with google phone support to know how much it would cost to fix it (since its gonna take me at least 100 dollars jut to send it to the US and back without the actual cost of fixing it), but it seems that reaching google phone support is more difficult than finding a unicorn.\n\nCan someone please help me with this issue so that i know what to do? I attached some pictures for reference",
