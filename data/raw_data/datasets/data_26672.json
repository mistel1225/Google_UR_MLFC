    "title": "August 2019 update breaks mobile data connection",
    "content": "After rebooting my Pixel 3 XL to install the August 2019 security update, Mobile Data connection drops out constantly.  En/disabling Airplane mode, or en/disabling Mobile Data does not fix issue.  Must power down (not restart) phone and turn it back on again to get data working again.  \n\nAs of last night, I have also found that several phone calls are not coming through, as well.  Several people just get sent straight to voicemail (they are not on the blocked numbers list), while calls from other people come through without problem.",
