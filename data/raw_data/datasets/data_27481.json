    "content": "My Pixel 3 suddenly has a roaming indicator. I check with verizon, and they say that they are having no issues in our area.  My phone also indicates that I'm connected to their network.  I also have the option for data roaming turned off.  I'm not sure why it's suddenly doing this. And it forces me to download any incoming MMS messages. I've reset the connections and restarted the phone to no avail.",
