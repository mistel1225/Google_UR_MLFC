    "content": "After upgrading to Android 11 today, i switched to gesture navigation so i could get the screenshot options. The problem is, when i swipe up to access the app drawer, it doesn't seem to work. I can't get to my apps at all. So far, Android 11 is really buggy, in my opinion. Bubbles don't work either.",
