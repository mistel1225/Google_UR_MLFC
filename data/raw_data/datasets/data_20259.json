    "content": "My Google pixel 1 has been dead for months, but I am trying to get it started up again. When I first plugged it showed that it was dead and started charging. Then I turned it on and ut started to work and load, but then it shut off and has been a black screen and unresponsive since. I tried holding down the power button. I tried holding the volume and power button at the same time, but nothing seems to be working.",
