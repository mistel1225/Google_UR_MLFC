    "content": "So, the Pixel team still hasn't learned its lesson with how to handle microphones on smartphones, apparently. ;)\n\nI was documenting an iOS 13.2 (!) bug while, inadvertently, showcasing a different kind of issue on the device with which I chose to record (the Pixel 4 XL, latest public version of Camera app - 7.2). \n\nhttps://youtu.be/wmhcF7G_ae8\n\nTake a listen. You can hear a weird, dull popping, at random times - like something was tapping the mic, but it wasn't. Unless it was a ghost? LOL \n\nOne hand was swiping the iPad screen, the other was holding onto the phone - in a silent room, indoors. \n\nThe mic anomalies are quite evident toward the tail end (very end) of the video. You can also hear the pops when I say \"okay\" toward the middle. Then, possibly, there's also light crackle. \n\nHere we go again... the mic on the Pixel 4 still needs tweaking (like mics on earlier Pixels did).",
