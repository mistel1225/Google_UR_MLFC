    "content": "The December 2019 update installed and after the reboot the phone immediately had issues. I have rebooted it multiple times since and the issues persist. \n\nSo far I have identified the following: home button not responding, notifications bar at the top not responding, mobile data will not switch on, wallpaper reset, apps permissions were forgotten. These are only the issues I've been able to identify in the hour since it started. There may well be more.",
