    "title": "Multiple issues w/ Android 11. FB messenger will not display over apps in widescreen, launcher crash",
    "content": "Howdy all. I've had so many issues with the Android 11 install. As in the title fb messenger won't work in widescreen mode, I have to close what I was looking at (youtube, a game, etc) and reopen messenger. Also the launcher and the keyboard will frequently crash, requiring restarts. Battery use seems a bit higher than normal on my pixel 3, and I'm restarting an average of 3 to 4 times a day to restore functionality. \n\nI'm not sure if this is a \"feature\" or a bug, but now when I select a link to copy, it's only available to paste into a text window once. If I want to paste it multiple places (ie different chats or tweet responses or comments) I have to copy it again.\n\nFeels like a very buggy release. Are there any ideas/options for either rolling back the install or patches on the horizon?",
