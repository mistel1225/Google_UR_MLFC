    "title": "Why does my 4a go blank screen after starting a phone call?",
    "content": "When placing or receiving a phone call my pixel 4A goes completely blank and does not revive while on a call. I cannot perform any other tasks while on a call. The only thing you can do is increase the volume or decrease the volume or hang up! I would always like to perform other tasks while communicating with somebody on the phone also turning on speakerphone is an important capability for a cell phone.\n\nVery frustrating! Is there another option other than safe mode?\n\nThanks and regards,",
