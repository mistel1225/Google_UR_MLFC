    "title": "Sound started disappearing after a couple of minutes after Android 11 update",
    "content": "After upgrading to Android 11 I started experiencing the following issue. When I listen to an audiobook or music through speakers my phone is connected to by a wire, playback stops shortly after the screen switches off. If I turn the screen on, sound resumes. I'm not in a battery saver mode and it used to work fine prior to upgrade. I haven't done a factory reset yet, want sure if it's needed for pixel devices.",
