    "content": "After upgrading to Android 10, elements of the camera interface are overlapping. It's more an inconvenience than a deal breaker, but an annoying one. I've attached a screenshot.\n\nThe issue occurs ONLY when using Gesture Navigation.\n\nThings I've tried: phone restarted; camera cache cleared; changed font size from largest to default; changed display from largest to default.\n\nCamera version: 6.3.026.265696615\nAndroid Versioin: 10 (QP1a.190711.020)",
