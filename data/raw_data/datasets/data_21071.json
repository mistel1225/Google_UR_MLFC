    "content": "I have the Pixel 4XL, I got it about a month ago, and was able to set up face unlock easily when doing the original setup. It has worked fine until the past few days it started needing 2 or 3 tries to recognize my face. \n\nso, I deleted face data thinking it must have gone bad somehow. But now when I try to set up the face data, it just continuously tells me 'fit your face in the inner frame' , no matter how close or far away I hold my face, that's all I get.. After a minute or so, it gives up and tells me to try 'fast setup' with the exact same results. 'fit your face to the inner frame' \n\nI have restarted the phone several times. Really don't want to try a factory reset, hoping there is some fix to this? \n\nAny way to work around this? With no fingerprint scanner on this model, face unlock is the only option! Help!",
