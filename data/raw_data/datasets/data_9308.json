    "content": "My phone is telling me I've reached the 15GB limit on my Google Account Storage but I thought that we get free unlimited full resolution photo storage with Pixel phones (until June 2021)? Can someone let me know why it's saying I've reached my limit? Do I have to do something so that my Google Account recognises I have a Pixel?",
