    "content": "My device is Pixel 2 XL. I am losing quite a bit battery life on standby. It may be the network causing this huge drain. My charging has slowed down. I was on 26, plugged in and after 70 minutes the battery was on 96. This doesn't look okay. Everything was fine in the beta releases. Seems like this stable version isn't that stable after all.",
