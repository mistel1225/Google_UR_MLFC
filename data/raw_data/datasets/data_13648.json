    "content": "my pixel 4xl just updated to android 11.. turns out this update screwed up my phone to the point I literally want to upgrade my phone to a different make just to get rid of android 11. There are a slew of unacceptable issues. This is outrageous. I use my phone for my business and now I'm having issues being able to do my work. \n\n1 - Do not disturb no longer working correctly. I keep it set to only allow contact's to ring. This no longer allows contacts or stared contacts to ring. I've tried everything from changing settings, to restarting the device and more\n\n2 - network is not working correctly. Did all fixes I could find, but still not getting full 4g\n\n3 - important apps no longer working. Example - my crowdfire app I use to post to several social media accounts automatically now is unable to post photos correctly. Again I've tried all fixes I can find. \n\nI've cleared cashes, uninstall and reinstalled apps, restarted phone, changed settings, turned off phone and left it off for 5 min then restarted. Im at a loss. I'm seeing others having similar issues that were not resolved via a factory reset so I am leary about going to that extreme if it's not going to resolve anything. \n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated.",
