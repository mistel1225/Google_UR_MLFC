    "title": "Pixel 2XL phone switching off everytime charger is connected.",
    "content": "Since the past few days, whenever I connect the charger to my phone, it switches off. I tried booting into safe mode but the problem still persists. Ive tried cleaning the port, however it was of no help.\nThere has not been any update nor did I download any new application.\nIve been facing issues with the port since the past few months. It started with my Type C earphones. They worked perfectly fine for nearly 5-6 months until after June. Since then the phone won't detect them and neither did it allow to make changes in USB preferences. There have been instances when my phone would show a charging notification despite being unplugged.\n\nPS: The chargers and earphones are NOT faulty and work well with all other devices I've tested them with. And yeah, the chargers are \"Made by Google\" if that indicates quality, lol.",
