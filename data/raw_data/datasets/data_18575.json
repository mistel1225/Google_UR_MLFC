    "content": "Why can't a massive company like Google seem to figure out how to enable switching front and rear cameras while recording a video? This is such a basic function that it's extremely EMBARRASSING that the all-mighty powerful Google flagship phone can't seem to handle something that has been possible on basically all other devices seemingly for over a decade now? My next phone might be one where the company actually listens to the customer feedback to create or improve basic functions, instead of working on new features and gizmos that no one cares about and basic functions don't exist....",
