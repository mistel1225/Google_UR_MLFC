    "content": "I have exhausted countless hours going over the \"fix\" instructions that are posted here yet to no avail. My phones cameras are dead! I bought it December 23, 2017 at the Best Buy store Eaton Center in Toronto. I live in the Philippines and I am very disappointed that there is no support for this phone here. I am thinking that I made a big mistake in choosing Pixel 2 over an iPhone which has very good support here. I paid about CAN$1,000 for this! What can you do to help? I am willing to pay for international shipping both ways if I could have my phone repaired or better yet replaced. Thank you.",
