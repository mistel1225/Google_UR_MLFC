    "content": "Hi!\nFraming hint level on my camera is off by 1-2 degrees on my Pixel 4 XL. I have tried re-calibrating the compass from Google Maps and also deleted users information for the camera app but the problem remains.\nMy Pixel 3 XL doesn't have the same problem.\nIs there any way to fix this issue or to calibrate the phone or camera sensors?\n//Greg",
