    "content": "Was wondering if someone could take a look at this.\n\nThere seems to be quite a lot of units popping up where there's a gap between the display and the frame/body. \n\nhttps://forum.xda-developers.com/pixel-5/help/assembly-problem-gap-screen-case-t4177669\n\n I'm not the owner of the above thread but I do have the issue. \n\nCan someone from Google clarify the issue.\n\nIs this normal?\nDoes this cause issues with waterproofing?\nHow/why has this happened on a Â£600 device?",
