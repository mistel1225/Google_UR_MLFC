    "title": "My Pixel 2 XL (Android 10) is stuck in vibrate mode for all notifications.",
    "content": "I believe this started with the Android 10 update.\n\nSpecifically for Hangouts I have checked the app's internal notification setting, general phone setting, OS setting for that app, and do not disturb.  All of these suggest I should be 1) receiving notifications and 2) hearing audio notifications.\n\nRestarts have accomplished nothing, nor has toggling any of the above settings multiple times.",
