    "content": "Last night I dropped my phone about 5ft. It has a case but landed on the screen. Upon picking it up I kept getting System UI errors until I finally managed to restart it. The system UI errors have persisted but not as often. \n\nThe big problem I'm having now is I cannot turn on my wifi/bluetooth/mobile hotspot along with the phone being clunky and slow now. It'll make the attempt to connect then instantly drop. I'm still able to use network data. Soft reset/safe mode/software updates did not work and I'm hesitant to do a factory reset because of the wifi not working. I'm overseas for the foreseeable so I don't have access to UbreakIfix. Most of the locals have never done anything with a Pixel either and don't want to risk it.\n\nI'm guessing something is wrong with the motherboard or a loose connection inside. Without connecting to a hotspot in the meantime is there anyway I can tether my network connection to my tablet or another phone? \n\nI've also heard of applying pressure to the corner right above the power button but it hasn't changed anything. Or is there anyway I'd be able to use my Surface Go 2 with Google Fi? Any help or ideas are greatly appreciated.",
