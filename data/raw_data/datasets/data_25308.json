    "content": "Hello!\nI have fingerprint and pattern lock on my new pixel 3a. I was using my phone normally and set it down for a minute or two. When I tried to unlock it, it recognised the fingerprint but asked for the pattern for \"additional security\". When I put in the pattern, it doesn't recognise it anymore, even though I know it is correct. Then it locked me out for 30 seconds. I restarted it, but alas, when you restart it needs the pattern. At one point, after 18 tries, the same pattern worked and I was able to unlock. When I went to the settings to change the pattern settings, it is not recognised again. The phone locked itself again and is not recognising the pattern anymore. I've tried at least 30 times and it is still not working. I need my phone asap, someone please help!",
