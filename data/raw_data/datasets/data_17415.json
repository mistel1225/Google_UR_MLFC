    "content": "I tried to unlock the phone by using my password which is correct it works on web. I see that there is an option to do factory reset of phone but there is no description how to do that when is not possible to access phone settings. I am wondering is there any other way instead of reset? Can this be a new bug introduced by some recent update? This happened to me one time before but after some time it was possible to unlock phone.",
