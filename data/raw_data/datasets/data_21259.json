    "content": "My son has been using my old Pixel since December without issue. Today while he was using it the phone screen went blank and now we can't get anything on it. Looks like it has completely shut down. Tried all of the troubleshooting steps of charging, using different chargers, checking the USB, ringing it etc. No response. Is this a known problem with old Pixels doing this or something I am missing?",
