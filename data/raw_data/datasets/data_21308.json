    "content": "The past couple of months at least my phone which is a Pixel 4 XL has been very sluggish / slow. It doesn't matter if it's via Wi-Fi or data. I often have to switch over to safe mode in order to access some websites because it just doesn't load.\nI don't know how to figure out which app can be causing it I read that's probably what the issue is. I don't know if doing a factory reset will help it all. I kind of hate to do that but will if I must. Any suggestions would be appreciated. Does anyone else noticing this issue? Thank you in advance.",
