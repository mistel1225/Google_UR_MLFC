    "content": "Pixel 2XL. Purchased 3 months ago. Suddenly this evening whilst watching a film, the colours on my screen looked odd - it's like a yellow filter has been applied.\nI have checked colour correction is off, started in safe mode, checked the different colour display options. Night mode is not on. I have restarted. There is no change.\nWhites look yellow, black looks grey, all other colours are faded and I am noticing a flicker.\nAny help very appreciated.",
