    "content": "Why is there so much wasted white-space at the bottom of the SMS pop-up keyboard? There is like half an inch of unused real estate at the bottom of the phone that could allow droid developers to make a larger font sized keyboard for people with larger hands. Maybe I've just been spoiled with my larger screen size on the previous phone Nexus 6P that I owned.",
