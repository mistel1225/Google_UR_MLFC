    "content": "My Pixel will randomly shutdown or crash regardless of battery percentage. I'll loose it at 70% at times. Then it struggles to charge. My system is up to date, I don't have apps that drain the battery, yes I checked, and safe mode doesn't affect it. Anyone have this problem? Has anyone home through Google successfully to recieve a new phone on warranty? I feel that this is a device issue I cannot fix.",
