    "content": "My phone has been acting up since updating the system to Android 11. Yesterday, there were phantom touches to the point of being useless. Today, that comes every now and then, but now a portion of my screen is unresponsive to touch. I factory reset my phone, but still had the same problems. Also, I cannot even type because it can't tell that i am trying to press certain letters. I tried restarting but now locked out of my phone because i can't even unlock due to the enter button being on the side of the screen that is unresponsive to touch.",
