    "content": "Whenever I drive and say \"Hey google\" the assistant pops up, however, it does not respond to anything after that. It's like it can't hear me. I don't know if this is a problem with having google maps open or something else. \nPlease help as the assistant is quite important for me while I drive.\nThanks",
