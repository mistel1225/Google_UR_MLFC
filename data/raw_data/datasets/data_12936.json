    "content": "Will Pixel 4a be available on any other website other then FLIPKART or any offline stores in INDIA \nFLIPKART is having issues with the stock and also they have not yet provided any official response on the same. I have read the comments in the community page where people have literally tried ordering on 12:00 and still were not able to get the phone. So can you confirm any date of offline store launch with stores like Croma or Reliance in INDIA or atleast some other e-commerce, because i do not trust Flipkart anymore after this. And Im very sure that they will only put it back after ending there BIG BILLION SALE.",
