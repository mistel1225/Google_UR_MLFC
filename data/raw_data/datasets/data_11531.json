    "content": "I'm in NZ. We only have 1 official retailer but delivery is delayed to January 2021. The official model released in AU/NZ is GTT9Q. However, there is 1 parallel import online store that sells the GD1YQ model (which is better because of mmwave support = better future proofed) but because it's a US model, I'm worried if it won't work well with the NZ network (maybe US models are set to different frequencies?). \n\nCan an expert please advise. \nThank you for your time.",
