    "content": "I've just updated to 9.0 few months ago, and never really noticed a battery drain issue. But just two days ago I noticed that after I unplugged from the wall charger and use some apps for a few minutes, the battery would experience a sudden drop (see screenshot). I'm not running any significant apps in the background (I thought the new Adaptive Battery thing would let me know), and I haven't changed anything since Nougat and Oreo.\n\n\nAs you can see, the phone was fully charged 39 minutes ago, and during this time the Screen was only on for a total of 17 minutes, and Facebook was only used for a total of 11 minutes.\n\nEDIT: scaled down the ridiculously large screenshot...",
