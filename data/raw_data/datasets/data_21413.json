    "content": "I use my Pixel 3 for my business, and use a bluetooth headset so I can talk and still work. The problem is my phone unlocks in my pocket when I answer a call with the headset, and a couple seconds later my pocket hangs up with the phone screen. I have tried flipping the phone around, and the power button for hanging up. It still happens constantly. I cannot find any settings about a proximity sensor either. My other phones never had this issue, and I recently switched from iphone which I didn't have a problem either. How do I correct this?",
