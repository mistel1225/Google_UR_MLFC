    "content": "Hello, I started having issues in the last days, at a glance stopped showing upcoming events 30 minutes before schedule. I really miss this information.\n\nI checked related questions and answers, like enabling showing all notifications on screen, allowing \"calendar events\" and \"reminders\" in `at a glance` preferences.\n\nIs there a way to \"reset\" to default settings? Or a hidden config I deleted?",
