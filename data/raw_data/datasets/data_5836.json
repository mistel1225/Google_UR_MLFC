    "title": "I am using adaptive charging on my pixel 5, although displayed my phone charges still very fast.",
    "content": "As far as I understood, adaptive charging slows down the charging process so that the phone reaches 100% when your alarm goes off. \n\nI have setup a smart plug before my charger to automatically turn off the charger when the battery hits 80% to save battery quality. When I plug in my mobile in the evening, it displays \"adaptive charging\" and shows me when it's full in the morning, but my phone reaches 80% within an hour. \n\nDoes adaptive charging only really work for the last couple of % or does it need to calibrate and I am screwing over the calibration process?",
