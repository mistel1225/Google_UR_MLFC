    "content": "My phone's recently been acting up, and seemingly out of nowhere. For some reason, the \"Downloads\" folder in Google's default Files app shows a hourglass with \"Can't load content at the moment\" under it. This happens when I download a image or a video, and the only way to fix it is to delete a recent file. The file type categories at the top still work fine and show all the files, but the main Downloads section where all my folders are won't work. Any help or experience?\n\n\nI've tried:\nResetting the cache\nResetting the storage\nSafe mode\nRestarting",
