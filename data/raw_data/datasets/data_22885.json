    "content": "Hi. My mobile carrier recently started supporting e-sim for iPhones and Samsung fold. I requested for a switch to e-sim but I was told that they don't support the pixel line at the moment. Are they right or shall I just get the QR code and set up the e-sim. I'm not sure it'll work.",
