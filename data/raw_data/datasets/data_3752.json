    "content": "Hello,\nThe wifi is not working anymore on my month-old Google Pixel 4A.\nTurning wifi is impossible: when I try, it crashes the user interface and the wifi is still turned off.\nThe same applies for bluetooth, whereas 4G mobile data is still working fine.\nI'm really confused. I tried starting the phone in safe mode: no  change. Turning airplane mode on and off has no effect either. Resetting all network settings didnt fix the issue.\nIt's not related to my home wifi network as other devices are working fine.\nI'm clueless and frustrated at this point, especially because it's a brand new phone.\nDid anyone else experience the same issue?  Suggestions are highly welcome :)\nThanks a lot in advance for your help.\nLeo",
