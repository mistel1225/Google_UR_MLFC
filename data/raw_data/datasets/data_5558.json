    "content": "I'm using the pixel 5 with android 11 and pixel buds 2 with firmware 553. Music keeps cutting in and out when walking around and I noticed if I cup my hand over my ear it makes it worse. I've tried to forgot the earbuds, turned off the in ear detection, and clear bluetooth cache but it keeps happening. Any ideas?",
