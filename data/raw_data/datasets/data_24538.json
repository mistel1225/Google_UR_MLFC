    "content": "Despite trying Google's recommended solutions, my Pixel 1 won't turn on. I've left it plugged in, tried holding the power button, or a combination of the power and volume button, and nothing happens, just a black screen. This occurred after my phone turned off (not shut down) then the screen wouldn't show up again. I could tell at first that the phone was still on due to trying to restart it since it vibrates when restart options show up, but now it won't do anything at all. Is there anything I can do to fix this?",
