    "content": "I dropped my Pixel 2 and now it won't turn on. I had texts set to backup, but when I restored the data to my new phone (Pixel 5) there were important texts missing. Apparently it only backs up 25mb of texts. That is super annoying that it doesn't tell you that. So, now all the texts from my father who passed away are missing. I'm wondering if I take the Sim card out of the old phone and put it in the new phone, can I retrieve the texts that way?",
