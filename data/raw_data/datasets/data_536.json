    "content": "Hi. Since getting this phone (Dec 2020), I have had to manually update Android each month in order to get security updates. I do not receive a notification. The attached image, taken on May 9, shows my phone is upda to date as of April -- which it was not. The May update had been out for days. I had contacted chat support a few months back and cleared some cache and data (I don't remember which), but the next month, again, no update notification. Why? How I restore normal functionality. Thank you",
