    "content": "I received my new Google 3 yesterday. Today, when it was on about 30% battery, I turned it off for 5 minutes to put a screen protector on.\n\nIt now won't turn on. I've held the power button for 30 seconds etc. I've plugged it into mains and computer - no luck. I've also used 'Find my device' to try and ring it in case it's just the screen playing up, but it 'can't reach device'.\n\nThe only slight bit of 'life' I can get is if I hold the power and volume down button for 30 seconds. This puts it into 'Fastboot' mode, with the error code 'combo key'.\n\nIt says use volume keys to switch to different menu, which lets you flick between 'start', 'restart bootloader', 'power off', 'BarCode' and 'Recovery Mode'\n\nHowever, if I then click the main button to select any of those options, the phone just goes black again.\n\nAny help much appreciated!",
