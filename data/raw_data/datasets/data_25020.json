    "title": "The pixel4 screen has green light on the upper and lower parts",
    "content": "When the screen displays dark pictures in full screen (like the two in the album, note: not a pure black picture. When pure black, the OLED is not illuminated, so it is not observed), you can see green light in the upper and lower parts of the screen under weak light intensity (such as indoor, in the dim place).\nThis situation has always existed since the purchase of a mobile phone. But recently I found that when I touch the screen, it flashes (sometimes it flashes by itself).\nWhen a light-colored picture is displayed, there will also be a weak blue or green light, but it is not obvious.\n  Now, I think I should need a new screen. It is very difficult for me to send my mobile phone to the United States from China, so please help me! ThanksÔºÅ",
