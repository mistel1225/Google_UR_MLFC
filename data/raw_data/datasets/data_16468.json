    "content": "On a Pixel 4 XL with Android 11 while using Maps app, the volume started to be restricted.  While trying to increase volume the phone went into Talkback by itself.  In the process of figuring out what was happening, I reduced the Talkback response time from 3000 ms to 300 ms.  Now I cannot respond fast enough to get the unlock pattern to come up so that I can unlock the screen.  Essentially, I am locked out.",
