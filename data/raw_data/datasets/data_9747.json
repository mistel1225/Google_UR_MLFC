    "content": "I ordered google pixel 4 from Amazon, it said that it was unlocked, but it was unlocked only for US networks, not for Croatian. I tried reaching the seller, they said they can't do anything. When i try to put my croatian SIM card it says that it can't be supported. How can I unlock it to all networks? I cant't use any US networks in Croatia.",
