    "content": "I was just on a chat about my Pixel 3a and am confused and frustrated.  The representative I was speaking to said that in order to use WiFi to send MMS, I had to manually turn off the mobile data when I want to use Wifi.  (I have a horrible mobile signal at home and MMS take 5+ minutes to send.)  Is this correct?  I have never heard of such a thing.  \n\nSo to confirm, when I arrive home I switch networks to WiFi.  Then when I leave I have to remember to switch my network back to mobile.  Is this really what they're saying?",
