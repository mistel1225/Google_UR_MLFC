    "content": "Yesterday i have updated android 11 in my Google Pixel 3a, which (my phone) is 8 months old. From today morning the phone is being muted now and then. Just No Sound! I can hear nobody in phonecall, no media, no youtube...nothing. \nI've searched for similar issues and tried some solutions, but nothing worked. Only restarting the phone solve the issue for a while, but after sometime the problem is back again.  \nEven connecting headphone doesn't help at all! 'Do Not Disturb' mode is not on and media volume, call volume everything is checked.",
