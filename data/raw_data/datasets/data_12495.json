    "content": "Without performing a factory reset -- I am switching from the Pixel 2 XL to the Pixel 4a and began the data transfer earlier today. However, the 4a's battery was nearly drained and the phone was becoming hot so I had to stop the transfer. Now, the phone is giving me no option to continue data transfer, even when connecting both phones via the charging cord. I've exhausted all options I can find and am getting nowhere. I'm really only trying to transfer text messages and call history at this point. Any help is GREATLY appreciated! Thanks in advance!",
