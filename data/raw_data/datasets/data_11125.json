    "content": "On my LG V50, I had a handy option in the notification tray whenever a Bluetooth speaker or headset was connected which allowed me to specify if I wanted the audio outputting to the peripheral or the phone speaker. I guess I was wrong to assume this was an Android feature and it was actually an LG tweak. Really hoping I'm missing it somewhere, otherwise my pixel just became a nightmare. Anyone have any suggestions?",
