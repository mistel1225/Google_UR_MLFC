    "content": "Since I've updated my phone to Android 11 with the NAGGING request to do so, my phone has glitches. I was on a very small and difficult to navigate window chat with support when it disappeared. I emailed the thread I had going with the support person only to get an automated response and then totally ghosted by support. Is there any way to contact Google or an email manned by humans? I've googled it, but surprise, that information is not shown. I guess they really want to keep their support personnel incognito and continue with their reputation of horrible customer service.",
