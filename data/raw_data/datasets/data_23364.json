    "title": "Pixel 2 - Waiting for replacement or refund",
    "content": "My Pixel 2 for the second time after a OTA update won't turn on. Only problem is this time a factory reset won't fix it. \n\nI was told my support that if I send it back in then I would have a replacement within 5-10 days. Over 2 weeks later stil no replacement. I then got an email from a supervisor to inform me there are no replacements in stock, but they'd inform me once they have a replacement ready. \n\nSo here I am, with no phone, and no resolution date. Surely there are laws against this? I sent my phone to a repair center in Poland, and I am left in limbo. No estimate date for a replacement and no response when I ask for a refund.",
