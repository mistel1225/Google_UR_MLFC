    "content": "Just in the last few days, since the camera app updated, I've noticed a red tinted area on the center of all my photos. It's always in the center and I can't change/remove/color correct it. It's wreaking havoc with product pics. Help? In the pic here you can see an area that's in the middle of this skein of yarn. It's supposed to be blue-purple, like at the top of the skein, not grape. I take pictures daily and this issue definitely started when the camera app updated.",
