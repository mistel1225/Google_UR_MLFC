    "content": "Out of nowhere (since march 9, 2019) my Pixel is stuck in an infinite bootloop. It can't do anything with it, not even a factory reset. This phone has 11 months of age (!!!) (I still can't believe it). It is a refurbished one since the first one had a fatal software problem and they replaced it. Seriously what is the problem with your phones Google? Very disappointed, not a good service. Can't even get another back because the warranty (they gave me 6 months for the refurbished one) is over but it makes no sense: in what world does a phone lasts 11 months..!!?? #GooglePixelGate",
