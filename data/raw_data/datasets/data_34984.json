    "content": "Currently, I have two issues with the phone. \n\n1. The phone overheats while talking (near the top speaker).\n2. There is a complete change in color (probably due to heating) of the device exactly at that same spot. I've attached pictures below. \n\nThere isn't an issue with the software. I've already tried a reboot and a complete factory reset. I've looked for a proper update to the phone as well. It doesn't solve the issue.",
