    "content": "I promise it it not my photography skills but I take a picture and it is perfectly aligned and proportioned and when I look at the photo, the subject has shifted and there is too much sky or they have an arm cut off but when the photo was being taken it was fine. \n\nIt's almost like the photo is being Zoomed in during the editing but I can't zoom out. \n\nIt is really annoying as I was taking beautiful photos of my family and nearly all need to be cut or realigned and some cannot be used.\n\nThis is seriously and 100% not me taking the picture off centre or slightly slipping or moving. It is something with the camera.",
