    "content": "Is there a way to talk to a human about shipping a pixel 3 with a swollen battery back to Google?\nSwollen lithium batteries are chemically unstable and vulnerable to fire. They are considered a hazardous material and must be shipped in special containers by a hazmat carrier. Under no circumstances can they be shipped by air.  Google support agreed to replace the phone which is six months out of warranty but sent me a FEDEX air express shipping label. I called FEDEX and they told me what is above.  I need to talk to a human at Google who can answer the question - the chat won't do it.  The practice of shipping phones like this by air would be a violation of Federal regulations - and device support should stop asking customers to do that. It is unsafe and potentially dangerous.\n\nCan anyone give me a number to call to talk to a human who can fix this?",
