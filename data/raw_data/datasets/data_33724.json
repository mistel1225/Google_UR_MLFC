    "content": "I recently just bought a pixel 3. It was brand new, and nothing was wrong with it out of the box. However, I've noticed that when ever someone calls me, I can hear the ringtone, but no visual shows up on the screen. The only way for me to answer the call is to press the power button, swipe up, then click the \"return to call\" button under the pin pad. I don't believe this is what's supposed to happen, since it is very hard to answer a call. \n\nThis is the same case for when I am on the home screen of a phone. When someone calls me, I can hear the ring tone, and feel the vibration, but nothing pops up on screen. I've read on other forums that there should be a notification in the notification bar, but nothing shows up for me. This has made it very hard for me to answer calls. \n\nSomeone please help!\n\nThanks, \nKevin",
