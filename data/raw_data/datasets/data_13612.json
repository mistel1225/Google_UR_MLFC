    "title": "Sent my Google Pixel for repair but stuck a delivery depot - Sent in Google supplied packaging.",
    "content": "I have the exact same issue. I smashed the screen on my Google Pixel 3a and paid Â£140 to get the screen replaced. I requested that Google send me their correct packaging, which I received in a timely manner. I sent the phone off in the supplied packing - however, noticed a week later that the phone had still not been received by Google.  I called DHL yesterday to track my parcel and received the following text message...\n\nWe have your DHL shipment (*************) on hold at our Edinburgh depot as it contains a damaged electronics which are prohibited on our network. This will need to be collected from our service centre DHL UNIT 2 CHARIOT DRIVE EH28 8PA ** This will be held for 30days before its destroyed.\n\nThe DHL depot is 80 miles away from my home. What am I to do? I've done everything as instructed. Can anyone assist, as I can not speak to anyone from Google?\n\nRegards\nRosanna",
