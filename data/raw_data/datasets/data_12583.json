    "content": "Hi,\nMy Pixel 2XL camera has stopped working. Specifically the back camera. Front camera still works fine but whenever t\nI switch to the back camera or double tap the power button the camera app ounces, shows black screen then gives the message as shown in the screenshot.\nI've force stopped the app, tried safe mode, cleared storage, even did 2 complete resets.\nAlso I've bought the phone from US but now using in Bangladesh.\nI'm trying to understand what are my options now.\nCan anyone please help?",
