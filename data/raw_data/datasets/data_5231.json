    "content": "Updated my pixel 3 to Android 11 and now it's charging faster but the battery is draining even faster. I'm able to use the phone for about an hour after a 100% charge before the battery percentage begins to go down like a timer, then subsequently goes off.  \nI have uninstalled apps, done a factory reset, however the problem still persist.",
