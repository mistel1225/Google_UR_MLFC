    "content": "So, as the title of the post indicateds, a small grey circle  is present near the centre of the frame when I want to take a photo. If the area right of centre is white, then you can quite clearly see the same small grey circle in the picture that has been snapped.\n\nI have cleaned the lens cover twice, first with a paper towel, then with fine cotton and lens cleaner, but the small grey circle persists in my photos.\n\nI don't want to return my new Pixel A4 before I have exhausted all the possibilities.\n\nThanks for any constructive input..",
