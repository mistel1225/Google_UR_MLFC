    "content": "I filed a warranty claim with Google a few weeks ago. They had me send in my Pixel 2, which was working but had some really problematic ghost touch issues. They replaced the phone with a different pixel 2 but when I took the replacement phone to Verizon to have them activate it, Verizon told me the IMEI was not compatible with their network. I left Verizon, went home, and called Google to tell them of the issue. I asked them to send me a different replacement phone that would be compatible with Verizon. They have not made any efforts to do this at all. They \"escalated\" the case 2 weeks and that has yielded zero results. For some reason, their case supervisor said she was sorry I was having trouble with my SIM card. Through email/chat/phone I have explained to them 15 times minimum that it is not a SIM card issue as the Verizon employee was attempting to use a brand new SIM card. The phone they sent me is uselessly sitting in its box on the kitchen counter. After claiming a \"warranty tool software issue\" and not responding for a few days, the supervisor, Kate, finally today suggested I need to find a loaner phone first and then google could start to look at my warranty options. This makes no sense. I'm looking for any alternative means to help resolve this issue.",
