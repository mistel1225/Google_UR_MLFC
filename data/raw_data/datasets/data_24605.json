    "content": "Using the google play music app. Since updating to Android 10, some songs (ones I bought from itunes long ago) are not playing over my Bluetooth headphones. Other songs from Amazon store ext play fine. If I disconnect the headphones, the song plays through the phones speakers just fine. This only seems to be effecting this app, and confirmed on two phones both after updating to Android Oreo.",
