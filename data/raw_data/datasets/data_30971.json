    "title": "pixel 3xl (project fi) notifications to fitbit and wear os not working",
    "content": "I have tried changing the notification settings.   I have also tried two different devices (fitbit and wear os/Fossil).     I had a fitbit and it was working fine.   I had to reset the notifications a few times as the notifications kept stopping.   But now I can't get any notifications to work on the fitbit.   I got frustrated with this so I bought a fossil (Gen 4) (wear os).    I have just had this for a day.   For the wear os I can get phone notifcations and gmail.   But I can't get any notifications from outlook to the wear.     Also, the gmail notifications do not reliably get sent.   Reading I have done makes me think the problem is with the latest Android or with the pixel 3 xl.   I think it may be with the battery saving technology.  I have disabled this, but I still can't get the notifications to work.",
