    "title": "Pixel 5 astrophotography photos with wide angle lens turn out green and grainy",
    "content": "Astrophotography pictures with the primary lens at 1x all turn out amazing, but when I enable the wide angle at .6 the quality is awful, green blotchy and full of noise. Exact same horizon shots included below, one with primary and one with wide angle. The wide angle for astrophotography is one of the primary reasons I bought this phone, please don't tell me this is by design!",
