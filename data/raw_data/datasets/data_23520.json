    "content": "When I press the share button in Google Assistant on my Pixel 4 XL (after opening an article that's in my Discover feed) nothing happens. The share button works fine on other Android devices I own. \n\nIf I click the three vertical dots and open the article in Chrome I can share the article from there. But tapping the sharing button from Google Assistant doesn't do anything.\n\nCan anyone help me restore the functionality of my share button? Thank you.",
