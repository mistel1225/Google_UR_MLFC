    "content": "Recently upgraded to Android 9 security patch dated May 5 and started getting several requests of \"[insert random name here] would like to send a message to 45567\"  from the following so far: \n\nCom.android.sdm.plugin \nConnectivity manager \nOemdmtrigger\ncom.qualcomm.data\n\nIs something broken with the latest update on my phone?\n\nOn Freedom mobile too.\n\nUpdate (I can't seem to reply to my own post): I've sent a Twitter message to freedom. Will keep this thread advised.\n\nEdit: it seems like disabling visual voicemail  solved the problem by hiding it for now and it will do while waiting for Freedom to fix the issue, i guess.",
