    "content": "My phone's battery has been draining extremely quickly (down to 15% within 4 hours)  and has been charging extremely slowly. Even when I turn it off, it barely charges. The outlet and cord both work, and I have tried others, so that's not the issue. I have also tried all the recommended fixes including a factory reset and there has been no improvement. \nI still have $500 left to pay off on this phone and can't afford another, is there any way to fix this?",
