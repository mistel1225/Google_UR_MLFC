    "content": "In my android phone, I chose \"always\" instead of \"just once\" option while choosing an app to share a word file in Google docs. If I choose .docx file it goes directly to the option I put always. But if I choose a different format like pdf it keeps asking me to choose the app for sharing. I want to be able to choose the sharing method with .docx files again.",
