    "title": "I filed a claim through Assurant, got my \"refurbished\" replacement, and the speaker is broken.",
    "content": "I have tried contacting support, which is impossible. Phones are shut down and the site is set up to error when you click \"Next Steps\" in the Contact Support section. I have emailed Assurant. I have emailed the Support rep from the previous claim. I need a new return label to send this broken device back, and I need a new replacement phone that works. I paid the $99 deductible, and that is on top of the $139 protection plan.",
