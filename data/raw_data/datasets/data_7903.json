    "content": "My Pixel 3a battery has swollen. Its been 15 days since a case has been logged. But no further action is taking place. Each time I speak with Google support, the only response I get is, please wait for 24- 48 hours. But then there has been no progress for 2 weeks. I am worried if it's dangerous to use with a swollen battery but I don't have a backup phone as well. So I'm forced to use the same device. I am really disappointed with the service for Google Phones",
