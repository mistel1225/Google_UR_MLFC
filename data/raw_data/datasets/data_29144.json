    "content": "Dear google team Hello,\nI recently purchased your Pixel 3a, and I managed to enjoy it for 2 months before the back camera crushed (the front camera works well).\nIMEI 359677096358124\nIMEI SV 03\nBuild number PK3B.190705.003\nIn every time that I try to activate it a black view appears and after a few seconds it closes by itself.\n I tried all the advice's mentioned in the Google community:\n1. Restart\n2. Clearing  Camera cache\n3. Camera Forced stop\n4. Camera Update\n5. Safe mode\n6. Even Factory reset\nNothing works! Just keep crushes.\nI trust the good service of Google to support me with a good an quality solution of this inconvenient situation.\nThank you,\nOfer.",
