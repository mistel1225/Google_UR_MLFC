    "title": "Google pixel freezes and restarts despite troubleshooting",
    "content": "My Pixel has randomly started freezing and restarting. I've tried doing an update, clearing space, deleting and/or updating apps, restoring factory settings and opening in safe mode. Whilst in safe mode it seems to be OK with the bare basics, until I start adding apps again (one at a time). It crashed after I added different apps (facebook & gmail). Is there anything else I can try to get my phone back up and running? It has also sometimes had a weird pixelated screen. It was purchased a year ago, so should still be under warranty I believe? It was purchased from an ebay seller who may not longer be on ebay, and I'm in Australia, although the phone came from Asia.\nThanks\nKim",
