    "content": "Hi all, \nI have just moved from a Pixel 2XL to a Pixel 5 - Most of the transfer went great.  However I have an issue with the Photos app.\n\nI have thousands of photos stored (from my Pixel 2XL) in my Google One drive (I have a 1tb plan).\n\nWhen I open Photos on the Pixel 5 the first screen has about 7 or 8 photos (a couple from last month and a couple from 5 years ago!) and just says \"Getting your photos...\" at the top (with a moving line underneath).  This has been like this for about 30 hours now.  The phone has been turned on constantly and has a great wifi connection.\n\nIf I select \"Library\" at the bottom right I can see all the google create libraries (and look at the photos in them).\n\nIs there anything I can do to speed up the process or is it stuck ?\n\nAny help would be much appreciated.",
