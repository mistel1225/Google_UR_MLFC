    "title": "Just got a Pixel 3a XL and I'm experiencing a LOT of stuttering in a game I play. Any solutions?",
    "content": "The game is MLB 9 innings 19. I've tried updating in game settings to \"normal\" instead of \"high\" (those are the only 2 options.) I've tried turning off digital well being and toggling WiFi on and off several times. I've seen some suggestions of modifications to the data files in the app/data file for other games, but haven't resorted to anything like that yet.\n\nFrom the reviews and previews of the phone I read and watched before purchasing the processor should be capable enough, I saw people running PubG and Asphalt, so a baseball game shouldn't be an issue...\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated!",
