    "content": "Hi,\nLast week I noticed that my  Pixel 3 XL back cover seems to be coming loose on one side (the side with the power and volume buttons). While the corners and other 3 sides are still nice and tight, the center of this one side keeps cracking open by 1mm. \nI use Google Pixel wireless charger to charge the phone all the time.\nIs it possible to get this fixed under warranty and is this the best course of action? Please advise.\nI bought the Pixel 3 XL in 2018 November.",
