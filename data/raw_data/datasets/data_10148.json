    "content": "Hello\n\nNormally when I take a photo in portrait mode the camera saves 2 versions of the photo - 1 in portrait mode and another in normal mode. Both versions appear in the photos app with a thumbnail for both images allowing you to switch between the two when you open the image. \n\nLately the camera just saves the photo taken in portrait mode and the normal version just doesn't appear at all. \n\nIs this a recent update (which I don't like) or has something inadvertently happened and there's a way to get the old settings back for this?\n\nMany thanks for your help.",
