    "content": "Every once in a while I'll go into my text messages and notice that messages I've tried to send to someone will be marked as \"message not sent\" and then I can send it as an SMS. Which is fine, except for when I don't notice it hasn't sent until hours later. Is there any option or way to have my phone notify me when a message has not sent successfully?",
