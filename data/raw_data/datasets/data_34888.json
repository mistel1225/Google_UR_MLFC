    "content": "Dropped my phone from my lap (landed on the back, had a protective case on) from table height and then 5 mins later, I realised my whole screen is unresponsive. Tried to type, swipe, nothing worked. Everything else was normal, there wasn't a single crack on the screen as well. I could use the volume and power buttons. I forced switch it off by pressing on the power button to restart it. It restarted and now I had to input my pin instead of my normal fingerprint as per any normal restart on my phone. Sent it to three shops (phone no longer under warranty), and none could diagnose what happened to my phone. They tried replacing screen and yet still doesn't work. One guy checked for faulty digitizer and still can't fix it. Anyone has similar issues?",
