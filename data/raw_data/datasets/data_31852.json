    "content": "My Pixel 3 went suddenly black, and rebooting resulted in a bootloop, stuck at the google logo.\nSo I tried to flash the latest factory image (April). Keeping the -w option (erasing userdata) results in an error message \"failed to erase partition\", bootloop still there.\nI fear that some hardware defect on the internal storage messed up my partiotions...\nAny help?",
