    "content": "Not sure if it's connected to the Android 11 update or my WiFi, but today I started noticing during my WhatsApp calls that when the screen goes to sleep during a call, the call starts getting choppier or I just don't hear the person on the other end unless I turn the screen back on. Has anyone else experienced issues since updating? \n\nI'm also still experiencing the screen flickering when I turn the device on and random reboots (which I think I've traced to WiFi/cellular data while roaming around). Doesn't seem like Google is going to be fixing these issues anytime soon. It might just be time for a new phone.",
