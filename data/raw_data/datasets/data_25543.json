    "content": "I am having a persistent issue with my Pixel 3 that's been present since I first bought it. I've noticed this problem only occurs when I'm on a video call (such as on Whatsapp) for a long period of time. Naturally the phone gets hot as you'd expect, but sometimes too hot to touch, however the real issue is what the speakers do at this temperature. When the phone reaches these heat levels, if you knock or move the phone in almost any way it will make a really really loud static noise, and the image from the selfie camera used for the video call will vibrate on the call. This stops people on the other end hearing and seeing you properly, and it means they can also hear the static. This seems to be a serious issue that makes me think the phone is damaged internally. Also I have done research into this and found no relevant info anywhere that might help.\nAny help is appreciated, thank you.",
