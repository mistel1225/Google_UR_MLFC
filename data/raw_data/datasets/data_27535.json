    "content": "Anyone who had to purchase a Micro-SD card knows that many cards like SanDisk says that their cards are water-proof, magnet-proof, shock-proof, impact-proof, etc: \n\n\"Water proof:\nSanDisk SD, SDHC, microSD and microSDHC memory cards are tested to withstand up to 72 hours in 1m salt or fresh water; IEC 529 IPX7. Product must be clean and dry before use.\"\n\nhttps://kb.sandisk.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/4687/~/sandisk-cards-environmental-tolerance-%28waterproof%2C-temperature%2C-magnetic-and\n\nSo does anyone know what are the durability ratings on Pixel phones? So say for example, if my phone becomes water damaged due to salt water if I drop it while taking picture in shallow ocean water, can I still recover the data because the storage is water-proof for sea water up to 1 meter, or similar rating?? (spare me the cloud storage option please, pretend if u didn't backup in a long time because vacation area slow wifi)\n\nPixel phones are known for camera, and so not having Micro-SD option to me doesn't make sense too.\n\nThanks.",
