    "content": "On Android 9 there was a setting to disable home screen (folders, search bar and app drawer) going dark with a dark wallpaper but on Android 10 I can't find any way to disable it.\nThere is a dedicated dark mode now (which I hate) so if that is disabled then all elements should remain light.",
