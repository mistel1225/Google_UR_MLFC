    "content": "Hi,\n\nI will not describe an issue but just make a suggestion for the Google Camera app.\nIs it possible to add an audio level meter to the app ? For me, audio and video are both equally\nimportant during video recording. I consider that adding an audio level meter is as important as\nadding the compatibility with external mics (which is awesome).\n\nAt the same time, is it possible to check if it possible to record videos greater than 4Gb in\nAndroid 11 ? I have heard about that, but I can&#39;t confirm that it is possible with the Google\nCamera for now.\n\nThanks in advance !\n\nTony",
