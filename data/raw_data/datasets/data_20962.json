    "title": "Pixel 3a, fully patched, Google Fi stopped talking to my Bluetooth Panasonic 5 headset station.",
    "content": "I've had this happen once before.  I updated the Android software, and I had to move my Panasonic base station 3 feet away from the phone, rather than 8 feet away.  The 'update' made the bluetooth Less reliable.\n\nI's 3 feet away now.  Just stopped working again even though it shows up as a connected device.  No updates on the Panasonic, Ever. So the only thing that changes are software 'updates' on the Pixel.\n\nAnd the whole point of a Pixel, is that you get the updates faster, which end up killing Something each time.\n\nAnd then I restarted the Pixel, seemed like a good idea?  NOT\n\nMy Call Screening stopped working AGAIN after the restart.  No more call screening.  Worked fine while trying to debug the bluetooth issue (but, Call Screening REGULARLY just disappears).\n\nWith the Pixel, something it going to just stop working every day, it's the worst phone I've ever owned, and I have several iPhones, which can be problematic, but their BASIC FEATURES work.  I can use the iPhone as a Phone.\n\nI can't do that with the Pixel.\n\nTried forgetting and re-pairing,   Tried turning Bluetooth off and on.\n\nPixel is the perfect phone to buy if you DON'T HAVE A LIFE and want something to distract you from the C19-end-of-the-world crisis.\n\nBut, as a phone, the very worst money I've ever spent.",
