    "content": "Hi all,\n\nI recently used Pixel's support chat regarding an issue with blocking outgoing SMSs. The rep assigned to me wasn't very helpful. I signed off the chat with \"You have been extremely unhelpful. Bye.\"\n\nFive minutes later, I get an email in my inbox from an unknown email address saying \"Hey you piece of shit. I'm coming for you.\" It could be a coincidence, but there's a reasonable chance that it's the same fellow.\n\nDoes anyone know the kind of access provided to the chat support staff? And, how do I reach out to someone who works at Google with this info? I have the pseudonym used by the rep while chatting with me and the email address that sent this mail.\n\nBest,\nAmrit",
