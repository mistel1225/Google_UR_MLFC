    "content": "During my phone call especially with my bank I cant use my alphabets where I need to enter in my NRIC which is alpha numeric. Google support team says to clear my cache and reset phone but is this an issue or its a design by choice. I can see letters under each number example under 2 I see A,B,C but how do i switch to it and use it. My previous phone half this price gave me both letters and numbers :-(",
