    "content": "I was given Google Pixel 4 as a gift by a friend. She no longer has the receipt. The phone battery doesn't hold charge, warranty is still valid, but Google refuses to help. I contacted Google customer service by both live chat and via the phone, I was asked to send pictures of the phone, however they say they cannot help me as I have no receipt. What should I do?",
