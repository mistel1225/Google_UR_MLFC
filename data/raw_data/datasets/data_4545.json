    "content": "I had Pixel 5 for a couple of months.  Some of Apps stopped working starting today (3/23/2021). When clicking on App icon, it seems like it would start, but either open and shut immediately or never open.  Restarting the phone didn't solve the problem.  What can I try to fix the problem.  Apps that stopped working includes a couple of banking apps, a couple of email apps, Duolingo, Amazon Alexa, school parent portal app, security app.",
