    "content": "My Google Pixel 2 fell in water while a headphone jack adapter was plugged in. The phone fell into clean toilet water, but to be cautious of germs, I rinsed it quick in the sink without the adapter plugged in. My phone has fallen in water before so I didn't think anything of it, so I dried it off with a towel and plugged it in the be charged overnight. It was plugged in for maybe 7-8 hours, and when I woke up I noticed it had crashed. It turns on, but every time I plug it back in it crashes. I let it dry a bit, tried plugging it in again, and it lasted a few seconds longer before crashing again. I'm now letting dry for a few hours before I try again, but is this permanent damage? Please note that my phone has a history of randomly restarting or crashing.",
