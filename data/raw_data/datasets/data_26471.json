    "content": "Guys,\n\nSince yesterday, the Google app is using a lot of battery on my Pixel 4.\n\nI charged it to 100% and went to bed, woke up in the morning with 70%, all that had been running according to the phone was Google.\n\nI had closed all apps prior to going to sleep, and had an alarm set on the phone.\n\nIs anyone else getting this?",
