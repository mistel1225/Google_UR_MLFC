    "content": "After I restarted my phone for the Android 10 update he icons on my phone screen vanished.  The apps are still all on my phone in the app drawer but when I move them to the home screen they disappear after a while if I am using one of the apps.  I've tried restarting my phone a few times but every time the phone starts up it gives me the blank home screen (and multiple other blank screens).  Is there a fix for this?  I am using doddle launcher",
