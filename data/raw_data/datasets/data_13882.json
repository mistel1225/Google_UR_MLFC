    "content": "Hi there,\n\nI've moved from Apple after 13 years of using their products. The last Android system I've used it was Android 3 Honeycomb.\n\nI LOVE Chrome on my laptop (desktop version) for ability use POWERFUL uBlock Origin adblocker (where on desktop Safari such a adblocker not exists)\n\nI've found out on Android Chrome - there are no adblockers!!!!!! There are only separate browsers - but I need Chrome for all my MULTIPLATFORM passwords.\n\nIn iOS Safari I can install even few adblockers and \"activate\" them - on Android Chrome - there is only very simple build in Google adblocker which almost does not work.\n\nThere is one good adblocker on Android Chrome but requires Root - but I do not want to Root or mess around with my Pixel 4.\n\nAre there any adblockers like I can do with iOS Safari?\n\nThank You\nBart",
