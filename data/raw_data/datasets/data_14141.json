    "title": "Pixel 4 XL keeps rebooting every hours after Android 11 update",
    "content": "After I update Android 11 OTA on Pixel 4 XL, it constantly reboot about every 30 min to 3 hours.\nI tried factory reset and restore from backup.\nAnd safe mode but the problem persists.\nI don't have any app that control LED but you should be aware that I switched and transfer files from my previous Pixel 2 XL.\n\nTo clarify:\nAfter rebooting, I can use it normally for some time, then it reboot again. Safe mode with Wifi use but problem still persists. I might try factory reset after recovery mode but I don't really sure it's gonna solve the problem as I found this: https://piunikaweb.com/2020/09/16/some-google-pixel-2-units-randomly-restarting-after-android-11-update/ \n\nOn an unrelated note, I try screen recording don't save and file permanently lost before I do factory reset and I haven't tried again. Few photos have lost before but not often and making me check after every photo taking.\n\nPlease help",
