    "title": "Outlook E-mail access almost unusable",
    "content": "Since I received my Pixel 3XL I would describe the performance as inferior. Sometimes the phone seems stuck and is not loading websites but the biggest problem that renders the phone almost unusable is the fact that within Microsoft Outlook all loading operation (loading E-Mails) can take up to several minutes (per E-mail). I have to use outlook for my work E-mail (no other app allowed by IT) and I am accessing my work E-mail and my Gmail through outlook.\nI had no issues on my Nexus 6p but since I switched to the Pixel 3 XL this is a nightmare. I receive up to 150 E-Mails per day and clicking back and forth between E-Mails varies from 10s up to 1-2 minutes (independent if the size of the E-mail). I don't have this issue if I use the Gmail app, but as I mentioned not a workable option for my work E-mail.\nRestarting the phone does not help, I also removed the data restrictions or battery saver for this app without any effect. I would be thankful for any ideas.\n\nPhilipp",
