    "title": "Pixel 4 will not play voice navigation during podcasts",
    "content": "I start navigation to a place. I'm connected to Bluetooth. Instead of hearing the voice navigation, the foreground app, typically a podcast, pauses and there is silence instead. I have tried this with two different podcast apps, and the result is the same. Often, it happens even if there is no other app open on the phone.\n\nIt seems to help if Google maps is the foreground app, instead of in a small window, but even that is not reliable.\n\nI was able to do this on my Samsung 8 without any problems at all. \n\nNow I just wish I had my Samsung phone back.",
