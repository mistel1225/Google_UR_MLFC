    "content": "After receiving Google Pixel 3A mobile ordered at Flipkat Online, suddenly on external box checking, I found that it is written on box that manufacturing date of my Google pixel 3A is in April 2019  which is well before official lunching of Google pixel 3A ...as we know Google pixel 3A lunched in May 2019.\nNot only that Mrp of product is written as Rs 46000/ on product box which is not Matching with Mrp of Google pixel 3A in India. I am totally confused. Not only that phone is hanging when taking pictures and also image taken quality not as expected from Google mobile. Kindly give me proper resolution as I am suspecting it may be refurbished or fake.\nNot only that serial no showing in mobile(by dialing code in my mobile  for IMEI number).....not matching with serial number shown on sticker separately pasted on mobile box. Only IMEI number of box( 359678091098467) is matching with IMEI number shown by code dialing at my mobile. ",
