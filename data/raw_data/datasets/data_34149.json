    "content": "I've had my Pixel 3 for a little over a month.  In the last two weeks, it has started lowering the volume to mute occasionally while I am listening to Pandora on the headphones that came with the phone.  I'm not sure if it's an issue with the phone, the headphones, or Pandora.  It does not happen when I'm listening to Pandora on the phone without headphones.  Is there some feature of the headphones I'm not aware of that is causing this?  Or is it a glitch? It doesn't happen the whole time, but once it starts happening, it keeps happening no matter what I do with the phone.  I can change where it's sitting, hold it, pause and restart the app, and it just keeps happening.  It doesn't go straight to mute - it lowers all the way down to mute as if I were pressing the lower volume button.",
