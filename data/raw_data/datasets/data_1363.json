    "content": "Hi,\n\nI would like to see an update where there an more volume steps available than the current 25. I don't want to root my phone to be able to do that.\n\nEspecially at night if you want to hear music via your BT speakers, its either too quiet or too loud, nothing in between...\n\nRegards, Ramin",
