    "title": "P3XL \"PRE-ALARM\" GOES OFF 2 HRS BEFORE SCHEDULED ALARM",
    "content": "I'm awake at 4:45am because I set my alarm for 6:45am and I get an alarm (different sound than actual alarm) 2 hrs before my scheduled alarm time.  \nI have to unlock the phone and as soon as I pull down the notification panel, the PRE-ALARM stops.\n\nThis has been since day 1, on all alarms, I have factory reset the phone a few times, and the issue persists.\n\nWhat would make my alarm have an alarm?",
