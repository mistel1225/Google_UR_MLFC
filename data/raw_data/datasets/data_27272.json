    "content": "So my wife and I are both on Verizon Wireless. She has a Pixel 3 XL & I have a Pixel 2 XL. Whenever she sends me a photo via MMS the filename & all exif data is stripped when I save them to my phone from our message thread. All the saved photos are renamed image000000.jpg. \n\nNow this only happens with photos sent from my wife. If anyone else sends me photos by MMS the filename for them (if i save them to my phone) is the date/time stamp. Can't for the life of me figure out why only from my wife is all the photos data stripped. Any suggestions would be great, thanks so much for any help!",
