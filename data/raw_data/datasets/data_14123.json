    "content": "I recently purchased Pixel 4A and planning to buy a case for it. I am waiting for Official Google Cases for Pixel 4A from Google Store Here which says Coming Soon. But, in Flipkart, where I have purchased my Pixel 4A, says they are ready to buy. You can check them Here. All I want to know is, are they both same, I don't wanna get dissatisfied after purchasing this case.",
