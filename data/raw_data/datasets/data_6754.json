    "content": "I have had a long discussion with support to try to find the right link to file a hardware issue. Support sends me links that don't work. Finally I get a question on my location, Wich I answer ( sweden )\nThis is the reason that links doesn't work. Now, it's apparently all my fault that I don't know how Googles support forum resolves geo location.\n\nThis support agent sends me below rude email after case is resolved AND makes sure I can't answer back. I you are a support manager reading this you will not enjoy below\n\n\n\" \n\nProduktexpert på diamantnivå \nScottG_TC\nJohan, thank you for the appology for the way you were speaking to me about the link I provided. Maybe next time you will provide all the relevant infromation (like being in an unsupported country) before you come down on someone for providing you somehting that doest work.\"",
