    "title": "My 2xl's touch screen occasionally doesn't work",
    "content": "So a couple days ago my touchscreen just suddenly stopped working, at first I thought it was just my fat fingers but as the day went on it happened for about 30 seconds every hour or so. This has been happening for the last 2 days, with today being the worst (my phone not responding to my touch for about half an hour) I tried resetting my phone (not hard/factory reset), I tried going into safe mode, I tried deleting apps I used recently to try resolve it, yet the problem still persists. What can I do? Is it a hardware issue? \n\nP.s. To let you know its a 2xl bought last year (December) in a jb-hifi store in Canberra, Australia.",
