    "content": "Hi. I have an app that is draining my battery at a rate of 1% per minute. The battery menu in settings isn't telling me that anything is wrong. but if I put the phone in Safe Mode with it running only stock apps, it runs normal. Any suggestions on how to find the fugitive application? Currently charging my phone 6X per day to make it through work. I'm hesitant to reset my phone because it takes me about 3 hours to reset all of my work applications manually :(",
