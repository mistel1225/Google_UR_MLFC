    "content": "That's right... on my Pixel running Android Pie, which obviously has a vertical app switcher, sometimes after a restart or just COMPLETELY RANDOMLY, the app switcher decides to revert to the old horizontal version! In fact, where the \"No recent items\" icon (1st image) is normally shown, the old Nougat icon of the same thing (second image) is shown! Really obnoxious and weird, so please fix ASAP!",
