    "title": "Pixel 2 can't get past Pattern lock screen",
    "content": "The phone has been slowly having performance issues like slow down over the past 4 months. Lately, the phone has been not registering the Pattern used to unlock the screen on startup. It will just be unresponsive to further inputs until the screen goes black. After restarting the phone multiple times, it still gets stuck on the Pattern screen, and Finger unlock is no longer an option after the restart.\n\nI already know I'm going to be told to Factory reset the phone; I'm merely making this post in the lottery-odd hope that Google support will realize this is an issue. It is sad. The phone is essentially useless now.",
