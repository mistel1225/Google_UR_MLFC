    "title": "Battery dies at 40 - 50%",
    "content": "How large is this issue of the battery life being degraded to only 40-50% and the phone shuts down. The phone will not turn back on until you plug it into a charger. At which point you can turn it back on within 30 seconds and it will have a charge around 55-60%. So we know that its not a battery issue.\n\nI was told I can buy a new Pixel 3 if I like. Why would I buy any other device from Google when this is my 4th Pixel Xl 128. Yes that many replacements. I'm kinda a sucker so I was looking at the Sept. Release of the new one till this happened after the last update. Now looks like Samsung here I come.",
