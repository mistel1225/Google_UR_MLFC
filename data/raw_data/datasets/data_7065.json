    "title": "Sudden system settings change, particularly navigation and lock screen, and some settings broken.",
    "content": "Earlier today I phone seemed to \"reset.\" Instead of swiping left or right to go back I now have a small back arrow on the bottom-left to navigate back. Other swipe controls still work. I tried setting it to three button navigation, but only the back button works. I had to restart the phone to be able to get back into the settings after I opened an app I could no longer get out of. My lock screen now stays blank until I press the power button. The motion sensors don't react to anything, including me moving near the phone or moving the phone itself. Playing with the lock screen display settings changed nothing: the phone keeps a blank screen until I press the power button. I'm assuming all of this came from an Android update, but I didn't intentionally update my phone, and didn't see it installing an update.",
