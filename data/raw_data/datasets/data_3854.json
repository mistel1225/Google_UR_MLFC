All I can get now is this suggestion strip along the bottom which generally just gives you put an ing or ed at the end of the existing word.\n\nExample is  I went too the store 2 buy to ice cream.  \n\nThere's phrase would be underlined in red previously and multiple suggestions of the same phrase would appear. I could top one and it would change the phrase. That is gone now.",
