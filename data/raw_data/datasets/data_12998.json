    "content": "Wifes pixel 3 xl is doing the black screen thing that mine did back when i had one. Back then it was still fresh and even after the basic troubleshooting like factory reset/safe mode it was said it was a possible software issue and wait for an update. Her phone is on android 11 so i would think if it was a software issue it would have been resolved by now with how common this is.",
