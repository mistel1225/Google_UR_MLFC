    "content": "I cringe each time I see the notification \"[App Name] got your location in the background\" – because it's grammatically incorrect!\n\nAsk a coder – precision of language is important. So... It *GOT* your location?! The right word here is \"has\" – HAS your location. A real Android would never make this mistake!\n\nI won't adjust my nerd glasses about \"got\" – look it up on the Googles. For a system push, it's simply wrong. \n\nThis may not seem like a big deal, but to me it doesn't seem like a big deal to correct. Same number of characters, improved meaning. In the meantime, I can't stand gotting a phone that doesn't speak my language.",
