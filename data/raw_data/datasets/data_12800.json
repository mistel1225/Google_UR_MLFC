    "content": "Getting no help from the Google Store on a refund for a defective Pixel 4a .. (Confirmation #'s 29000030750, 9 904900030722..) Each time I call Customer Service they ask me for various numbers and then disconnect me without resolving the problem.. I returned the Pixel 4a via the United States Post Office, and their tracking number indicates that Google received the phone back (Tracking # 9505 5112 4182 0279 3060 80) ..  I also want to cancel Google Fi, and have the un-authorized charge from \"Google Mountain View\" for $25  stopped..  Google has all the transaction inf0.. I feel like I'm getting the run around by having to look for various transaction numbers, and then being disconnected..  I need a Google supervisor's help . thank you",
