    "content": "I have a pair of pixel buds 2 with a problem with charging, the right earbud seems to need to be at a very specific angle in order to charge. This wouldn't be anything more than a slight pain other than the fact that the angle it has to be at isn't possible when you close the case. I have been using ipa to clean them (70%) is that the problem? Do I need to replace these? Thank you for any help/advise in advance. (By the way just did a recaptcha that said a mailbox was a parking meter)",
