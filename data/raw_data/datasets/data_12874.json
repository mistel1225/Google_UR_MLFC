    "content": "Where is the Call Screen setting in Pixel 3a Android 11? I have looked everywhere. When I search settings for \"call screen\" or \"call screening\", the results are empty. I know that Android 11 broke (or vanished) call screening for Pixel users. It broke it for me, didn't vanish it. So when a call comes in, I do have the Screen option, but it no longer works right. The fix is supposedly to disable it, reboot phone, enable it again.\n\nBut how can I disable it if I cannot find the setting? Other posts have said that Call Screen is near the bottom of the main Settings screen. NOT SO for Pixel 3a in Android 11.\n\nPlease help.",
