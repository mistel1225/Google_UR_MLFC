    "content": "I've tried to remember my unlock pattern with no luck. I won't accept my fingerprint anymore. I've tried 76 times, I'm not sure how many more the phone will allow me to try. I unfortunately don't have find my device turned on. There is countless pictures I can afford to lose. Is there a way I can have Google unlock my device? Or any other way I can at least extract my photos?",
