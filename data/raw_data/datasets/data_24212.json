    "title": "Music suddenly not playing through car speakers when connected to Bluetooth",
    "content": "My Pixal 3a has suddenly stopped being able to play music through my car stereo. It was fine yesterday. Now when I press play on Google Play it just plays through my phone speakers. The Sync is still fine as I can see the name of the song on my car's media screen. I've tried re-starting the phone making my car forget it and then reconnect. I've also tried turning the setting to allow my car to access media on and off. This makes the music on my phone stop but then when I press play, nothing happens (eventually if I keep pressing play it works but through the phone speakers again). \nIt was working fine the day before. I just downloaded the latest update last night but it made no difference.",
