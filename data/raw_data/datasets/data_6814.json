    "content": "I have three weeks left of the two year warranty (says the Google 'Repair' page). Happily, I don't need it! \n\nBut as my UK mobile network says its Pixels become unlocked 721 days after activation, I should be able to use any sim in less than two weeks. As long as the phones being activated exactly coincided with the warranty starting. I don't know, as I didn't own the phone from new.",
