    "content": "So I have a pixel 4. I love the pixel 4. At the time of it's release, it had the most innovative features of any phone on the market(imo). It had the ML chip for faster speech processing, face unlock, motion sense, and all the google software experience features that make pixel's great. \n\nToday I look at the launch of the pixel 5 and I have to ask... why?\n\nThe ML chip is gone, as is face unlock and motion sense, even squeeze is gone! The only things left that make it stand out is the software experience, which I can get from something like one plus... I get that they upgraded the battery and ram, but honestly, that's just normal hardware refresh stuff, and is inconsequential background noise to the overall experience of the device.\n\nWhy google, why did you gut all the things that made the pixel unique and just make another Samsung clone with better software?",
