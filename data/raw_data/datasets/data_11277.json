    "content": "My dad recently got a Pixel 4a and was enjoying taking pics. All was working well. In the last week the camera has begun taking pictures that are 90 degrees clockwise from what is shown on the screen.\n\nFor example, if he holds the phone upright (12 o'clock) the picture will turn out 90 degrees clockwise, as those the top of the phone was pointed at 3 o'clock. It is always 90 degrees clockwise from wherever the top of the phone was.\n\nWe tried clearing the camera cache, restarting, turning auto rotate on and off, and uninstalling and reinstalling the camera app to the extent google allows. I cannot replicate the problem with my Pixel 3XL and the same camera app. Help.",
