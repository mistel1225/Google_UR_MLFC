    "title": "Call issue with USB-C Earbuds on OG Pixel XL",
    "content": "When I receive or make a call with the USB-C Earbuds plugged in, I cannot hear any sounds from the phone, not the waiting sound nor the voice of the caller. This seems only happens when I hear a notifying sound before the call starts. if I open the notification bar before call (means there will be no notifying sound), everything works fine.\n\nAny solutions for this?",
