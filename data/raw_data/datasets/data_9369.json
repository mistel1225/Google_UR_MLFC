    "content": "My Pixel 3a is having voice problems.  People cannot hear me using the device microphone, and Google Assistant does not appear to hear me.  However, I can get Live Transcribe to work just fine, suggesting the trouble is not the microphone.  I am running Android 11 with the December 5 security update.  The trouble appears to have begun today, as I have talked on the phone since that update.  I can use my Bluetooth headset for voice, if needed.",
