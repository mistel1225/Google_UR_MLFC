    "content": "Ive had multiple pixels now and have never been able to get text announcement working with my chrysler/jeep uconnect radio.  Its the last gen version RHB uconnect radio not the newer uconnect radios they are putting in the current gen vehicles.  Bluetooth, calling, and media streaming works fine but I have never been able to get text announcements working.  Its works when I connect other android phones but never a pixel.  Ive also tried messing around with bluetooth options in developer options but so far no luck.",
