    "content": "I have a new Pixel 4a. After updating to Android 11, I have a persistent silent notification that my \"Device is charging via USB\" when it's not plugged into anything. It still shows battery and charges fine but it's not actually connected to anything so I don't know why I'm getting this notification.",
