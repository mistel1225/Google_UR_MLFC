    "content": "Hello,\nSuddenly i got locked out of my device and it says it requires me to 'password required after device restarts' but i don't know what this password is as it's not my pin code.\n\nI unfortunately have forgotten my google account password as well, i am overseas so i tried a few passwords before selecting 'forgot my password' and putting my sim card in my phone and trying the sms code, google denied the code and said they would review my account.\n\ni don't have find my device set up either.\n\nCan i factory reset my phone without access to the phone or google account? and will i be able to set it up with a new google account? \n\nThank you,\nTara May",
