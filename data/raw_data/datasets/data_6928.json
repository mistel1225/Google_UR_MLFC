    "content": "Fingerprint sensor is no longer working to unlock certain apps.  The problem started after the January 2021 update.  My specific problem is Applock will no longer recognize fingerprint unlock on Pixel 5 with Android 11 with latest updates.  I have seen other postings from other users about other apps on other models, but always Pixel phones (App Lock by Norton, HSBC, etc).  February 2021 update did not resolve the issue.",
