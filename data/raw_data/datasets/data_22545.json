    "content": "New Pixel 4 XL - Notification Sounds (only sounds) for Text Messages and Emails stop working.  All Screen Notifications and Vibration work fine with each incoming Text or Email.   Power cycling the phone restores functioning Notification Sounds, but within a short time (minutes to hours) the same anomaly recurs and there are only screen notifications.  All settings are verified as correct both when Sounds work and when they don't.  Phone calls alert normally without fail.  I have also experimented with changing each option within Notifications menus, selecting then deselecting (dots, pop ups, etc.) to see if anything affects the issue.  They do not.  The only \"cure\" is a reboot, but the \"fix\" only lasts a very brief time before text and emails are all silent again.",
