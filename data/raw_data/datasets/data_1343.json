    "content": "My pixel 2 will completely shut down when my battery life is around 30-40%. I can turn my phone back on, but it will shut itself off again like it is out of battery even though I still have a decent amount. Every time it shuts down it flashes a white battery symbol. Is there anything I can do to fix this?",
