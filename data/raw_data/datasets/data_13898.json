It is entirely safe.\nNOT NOW....ENABLE\"\n\nClicking ENABLE brings up \"Accessibility\" menu. CCleaner is on the list, saying, \"Not working. Tap for info.\" Tapping the icon results in \"This service is malfunctioning.\" \n1. I am not interested in any response that includes that I cannot use CCleaner anymore.\n2. No, this is not my fault. All I did was allow the upgrade to Android 11.\n3. If there is no way to get this to work, then I want to know how to revert to the previous version of Android.",
