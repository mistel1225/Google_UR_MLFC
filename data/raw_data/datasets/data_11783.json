    "content": "I updated my Google Pixel 3a to Android 11 tonight and now I am having trouble with my Nova Launcher app. Whenever I try to return to the home screen within the nova launcher app it takes me back to the google launcher home screen. This happens virtually when I try to do anything in the launcher including adding widgets, customizing app icons, or force quitting out of apps. Does anyone else have this problem and is Google aware of it?",
