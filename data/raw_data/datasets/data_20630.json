    "content": "Microphone stopped working after latest update. Google assistant can't hear. Callers can't hear and no apps can hear. I typically only use voice for calling or assistant so I don't know what else could cause this.  I've tried.\n\nRestarting\nReset Bluetooth and wifi\nFactory Reset\n\nNothing is working. Phone is only 6mo old. No drops. No damages. NOTHING. just stopped out of the blue. Very frustrating.",
