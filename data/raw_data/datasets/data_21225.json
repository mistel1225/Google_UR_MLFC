    "content": "I was using google chrome. I did have several tabs open (between 20 and 30), when the screen suddenly turned bright white. It stayee lit up like that ans unresponsive, then turned to many shades ot green as if it were quickly scrolling and back to bright white. The power button made the screen go black and its been black ever since. Holding down the lower button or plugging/unpluggint the charger causes a tiny vibtation, the same thing that normally happens according to my settings when the phone is acting normal. This makes me hope it could be a display issue even though it also seems obvious it is something bigger than that. Please help!",
