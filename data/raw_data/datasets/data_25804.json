    "title": "Brand new Pixel 3a XL. When I swipe my finger from side to side I get a narrow white line",
    "content": "When I swipe between screens I see a narrow white line about 1/3 of the way  up from the bottom. It's usually about 2/3 of the way from side to side. Goes away quickly but ??? This phone is literally brand new. Swiping lightly or heavy doesn't seem to make a difference and it happens both when in a case and when not.",
