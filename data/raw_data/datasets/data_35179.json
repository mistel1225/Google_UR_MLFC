    "content": "My phone just started displaying the error message \"Analog audio accessory detected The attached device is not compatible with this phone. Tap to learn more.\"  No devices, not even a charger, are connected to the phone.  It happens all the time, and I can't clear the message . I'm not sure if it's a coincidence but it started recently after the latest Android update.",
