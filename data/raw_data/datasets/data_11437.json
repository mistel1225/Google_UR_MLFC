    "content": "I currently have a Pixel 5 and I find the vibration insanely weak, even when I'm holding my phone it's almost imperceptible. I have my vibration control turned to maximum and I still can't perceive any vibration notification. My Pixel 4XL vibration would almost give me a heart attack when it would go off, but at least I could tell when someone was calling me.",
