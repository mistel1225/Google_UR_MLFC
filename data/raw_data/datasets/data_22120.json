    "content": "Overnight, my Pixel 4 stopped charging on the Pixel Stand. When I woke up this morning, the battery had drained to 49%, and now it will no longer charge on the Pixel Stand.\n\nWhen I put the Pixel 4 on the stand, sometimes it initially states that it is wirelessly charging, but then within seconds, it displays only the charge remaining in the battery and no charging occurs.\n\nIf I connect the Pixel 4 to the USBC cable, it goes into rapid charging mode as expected and begins charging (and remains charging).\n\nI bought the phone in October 2019 and the Pixel Stand arrived in December 2019 - it has been wirelessly charging correctly since that time, until last night.\n\nI've done a bunch of searching and trying things this morning, none of which have helped.\nRebooting the phone (with \"Restart\" from settings and \"Power Off\" then back on again).\nRemoving the cable from the Pixel Stand and reconnecting it\nMoving the phone around on the stand, trying it vertically and horizontally.\nTrying it with the other USBC charger that came with the Pixel 4 (same output rating etc, just a shorter cable, as far as I can tell).\nRemoving the Pixel Stand pairing from bluetooth settings (it mostly won't reconnect after doing this, until I put the Pixel 4 on/off the stand lots of times).\nRemoving the case (Official Google Pixel 4 case from Google Store - supposedly compatible with wireless charging)\nSqueezing the phone gently around the G area.\n\nDoes anyone have any further troubleshooting steps I could try before trying to figure out how to contact Google for a warranty claim?",
