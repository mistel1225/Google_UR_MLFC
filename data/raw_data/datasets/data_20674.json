    "content": "Google Pixel 2 USB connects to Windows and Linux without any response, the USB socket is clean, the developer options have been set, and the phone has been reset many times, thus changing the data cable and computer (including USB2.0, 3.0) many times.  I have upgraded to Android 11 Beta.  This problem has occurred on Android 10 and many people have been affected.  I just want to lock my bootloader\n\nFrom Google Translate, I hope you can understand the meaning",
