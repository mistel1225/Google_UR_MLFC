    "content": "I use the recorder Google app in order to record a series of voice recordings and believed I'd be able to see and pull an MP3 or a WAV file from my file manager but there's nothing when I'm on the recorder.google.com I'm able to play my recorded audio but there's no option to download it. Is this not the right app to use if I want to create an easily extractable audio file?",
