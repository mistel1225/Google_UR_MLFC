    "content": "Hi. I'm using Google Pixel XL and I'm unable to use the upper part of my touch screen (one inch). It's not working. I can't pull the notification tab down. Surprisingly it is working when the phone is locked and not when the phone is unlocked. I have tried everything from restarting my phone, cleaning the screen and even factory data reset. I'm also unable to use the search bar in apps such as YouTube as they appear on the top right or left part of the screen and you keep tapping it and it just won't work. Any help would be appreciated. Thank you.",
