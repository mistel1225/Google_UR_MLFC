    "content": "I used Google Assistant with my iPhone that was on Verizon and was able to use \"Hey Google, call my phone\" to locate it with no problem. When I ported the same phone number to Google Fi and bought a Pixel 3, I didn't expect to have any issues with Assistant. If I ask one of my home devices to call my phone, it recognizes my voice, says it will call the device ending in xx35 and calls my phone. However, the call goes straight to vm. If anyone else calls my phone it rings, so the phone is not on DND and it's not an issue with the phone service. Any ideas?",
