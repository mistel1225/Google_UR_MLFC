    "content": "After unlocking the bootloader, contactless payment stopped working for me. Then I decided to lock it back, but now the phone does not see the operating system and at the same time, it can not unlock the bootloader. I searched and many write that the phone is now a brick. Is it possible to do something? If not, is it possible to send the phone for repair?",
