    "content": "A message came up on my phone saying that it detected liquid or debree in the charging port and had automatically disabled the port.\nI left it overnight to try out and have cleaned out the port (tiny bit of fluff in there) and got a message saying liquid or debree no longer detected and I was free to use the port again - but it still won't charge. It doesn't even detect that something has been plugged in.\nIt's like it is still disabled?\n\nAny tips? Anyone had this problem before?",
