    "content": "I have had my phone for about a week now, and it still does not recognise my phone number. Simply saying, 'number unknown' when I look at in the settings > About phone menu. \n\nI have just recently updated the phone and received a notification that another number was registered with my google account but this is not my number as I transferred my existing number from my previous provider. \n\nI am with BT Mobile in the UK",
