    "content": "Since upgrading to Android 11 yesterday, several apps are now crashing (that I have never had problems with before), and Bluetooth connectivity is awful. Audio to my BT headphones (which worked perfectly prior to the update) works only sporadically. I have to reconnect my headphones multiple times each hour. \nHow can I roll back to Android 10?",
