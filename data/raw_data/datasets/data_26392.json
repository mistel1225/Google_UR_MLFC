    "content": "My 64GB Pixel 3XL is running out of space, partly due to my Images folder taking up 24GB, even though my Photos settings are set to back up all folders, and I've 'freed up storage space' through the photos app. It shows that Photos is taking up 728MB but Images is taking up 24GB? What's the difference here? And how do I free up that 24GB?",
