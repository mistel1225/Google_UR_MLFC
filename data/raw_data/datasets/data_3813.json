    "content": "Hello,\n\nI have some problems with google Pixel 5, because he has very low signal strength of LTE and 5G compared to others with the same sim-card.\n\nI have 3 smartphones iphone 8+, Samsung galaxy s9+, and pixel 5 and I have tested all of my phones with the same sim card, but the signal strength of pixel 5 was definitely the worst and even It had often no signal of LTE just 3G or EDGE.\n\n How can i solve this problem?",
