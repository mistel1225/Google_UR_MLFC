    "title": "Why is the sound settings menu still glitchy when casting?",
    "content": "When casting to my Chromecast, using the YouTube app, on my Pixel 4.\nFrequently the volume buttons just stop working. It's not a hardware issue (ie the physical button still seems to work) as I can still do screenshots.\nI can either reboot the phone, or go into the sound settings menu for the phone and change the media volume, cast volume or ring volume. Taking the latter case the menu is glitchy (and has been as long as I remember and I got the phone on the launch day).\nThanks to the new screen recording feature (great feature!) I've recorded what I mean.\nThis happens very frequently but not every time I cast.\nI tried to add the video as an attachment but pressing the paperclip attachment icon seems to do nothing. Again I'm on my phone writing this. So I've uploaded the video too YouTube as an unlisted video:\nhttps://youtu.be/uWSg-VXnffE",
