    "content": "Hello, I have a google pixel 1, but I can not enjoy it, it has problems, it breaks it and it restarts when I want to call. Sometimes it gets hot. They are periods when they work normally, do not restart and call normally. What can be the problem, does anyone have any idea? The biggest problem is calling, but the messages go smoothly. Help me.",
