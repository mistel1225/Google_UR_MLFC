    "content": "My Pixel 2 was at around 10% last night when i have plugged it into the original charger. I have then went to sleep to find a phone that is dead in the morning. This is a 9 month old device in excellent condition. No Drops. No Spills. I have tried cleaning the port. Tried several more chargers, wall chargers, pc cables, car charger but to no avail. \n\nI have tried long-pressing the button for more than a minute but nothing happens.\n\nThe Phone is cold to the touch, meaning that there is no charging happening.\n\nThis was purchased during my stay in the US but i am currently to a place that does not have official google support.\n\nWhat can i do about this ?",
