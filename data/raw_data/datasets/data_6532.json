    "content": "Coming from the iPhone, I like that the pixel has a visual voicemail option in the phone app. When I was first considering getting a pixel, my buddy had let me use his and I enjoyed the feature. I went ahead and purchased a 4XLthrough Google, and had it activated on my Sprint network. I've never had the voicemail tab in my phone app, and there's nothing in settings I'll let me activate it. If I go to settings, and I tap where it says voicemail, the only thing it lets me change is the phone number in which voicemails are coming from. \nI've seen sources say that Sprint has restricted this feature inside the phone so I can use their own app that charges me a fee for the visual voicemail feature. I don't understand how that could be the case whereas my parents who are on the same plan have iPhones, and yet they don't have to do that. Is there a way I can get my voicemail tab back, or is there something here I'm not understanding?",
