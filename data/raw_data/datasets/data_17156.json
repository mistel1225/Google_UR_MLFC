    "content": "Based on the official document, looks like Android Slices is officially released. But I couldn't find any usable slices component on my device, is there any way I can turn on this feature? In the keynote, I notice the lyft has support this feature, but I couldn't see the slices component for lyft on the Android search either. Just want get more info regarding this specific feature. Thanks.",
