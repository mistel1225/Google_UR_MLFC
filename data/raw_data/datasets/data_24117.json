    "title": "Phone power button stuck. Phone keeps buzzing and restarts randomly.",
    "content": "All of a sudden my phone started buzzing and camera app started to pop up. I hadn't dropped the phone in the recent times nor had water damage. I contacted Google support and the customer service agent told me that the phone has a hardware issue and that because my phone is outside the warranty time, it will not be replaced. Tried all the troubleshooting over the phone including factory reset. The problem persists.\n\nIs this really how Google operates? Even without ANY user error or fault, they're not willing to repair the phone?",
