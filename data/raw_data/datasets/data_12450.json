    "content": "I've noticed that my phone will randomly exit out of horizontal view and stay in vertical view. I can't rotate the screen at all, with or without auto rotate on. Apps like youtube and netflix are broken, even some games. I've tried to restart my phone, turn on and off my auto rotate, and use safe mode. The screen seems to rotate just fine in safe mode but not normal mode",
