    "content": "I have been having texting problems with my Pixel 4a 5G's native Messages app since I got the phone in early Decemberâ€“so much so that Google just sent me a replacement phone this week. \n\nThe texting function seems to be mostly working on this new phone, EXCEPT if my husband texts me from Signal (encrypted texting app) I don't receive his texts.  If he switches to his native Messages app, I receive his texts in my native Messages app, but if he uses Signal, I don't get his texts. \n\nDoes anyone know if there is a setting on my phone that might cause this? \nThanks",
