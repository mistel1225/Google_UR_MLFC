    "content": "Hey all,\n\nI Encountered a Strangers behavior on my Phone - in Photo and Video Mode the Phone allways switches between the lenses / Sensors without any reason - which Makes photography really annoying. Tried different settings in the camera App, but the Problem is still present. Software is on the newest Version, I already deleted the camera cache. I Made a Video, but I can only Post Photos Here - the best description ist, that the while Pictures jumps to the left, Then Back - accompanied with a noise coming from the camera (Sounds Like a shutter).... Has anyone a Suggestion how to fix this? \n\nThanks in advance!",
