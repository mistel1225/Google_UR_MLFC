    "title": "Pixel 4a speaker volume fluctuates when playing games",
    "content": "When playing games (in landscape mode), the left or right speaker volume would drop significantly and then go back to normal in a short amount of time. This happens randomly and would only happen to one of the speakers at a time. I haven't noticed this issue when playing videos or listening to music. The games I usually play are Bang Dream and Princess Connect.",
