    "content": "Over the last day or 2, my new Pixel 3A has failed to ring when people call me the first time.  Instead, the caller hears ringing (though I don't) and they are sent to voicemail.  If they call back immediately, the phone does ring.  If they wait a few minutes to call back, once again it doesn't ring.\nI have power cycled the phone and also the network was refreshed by the provider.  I have cleared the cache of the phone app which didn't help.  Wondering if anyone else has had this experience and if there is a known solution for this.\nThanks",
