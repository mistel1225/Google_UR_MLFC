    "content": "I live in the UK and haven't been to Belgium whilst I've owned this phone, which is about 2 years now. \n\nFor some reason, YouTube has started advertising to me Belgian and I can't watch videos only available in the UK. Newly downloaded apps have defaulted my country to Belgium, and whilst the Play store is showing my location as UK, it is suggesting I change to the Belgian store (See screenshot below). \n\nI've checked through every Google account and phone location setting, including checking via the Google homepage as well, but no luck. Can anyone solve this mystery for me? Any help would be appreciated!\n\nEdit: I did change provider to Lycamobile a few months ago, who use the O2 network. I don't if or how this might make a difference. ",
