    "title": "Why is Auto Correct so Relaxed on Pixel 4xl",
    "content": "I'm coming from iOS so I'm not incredibly familiar with Android, however the one thing I'm noticing with my Pixel 4 xl is how horrible the auto correct is. If you type something incorrectly it pulls up the suggestion but if you hit space to go to the next word it doesn't replace it. It just takes your horribly spelt word and commits it to memory. Am I missing something in settings or is Androids auto correct just a touch lazy on this front?",
