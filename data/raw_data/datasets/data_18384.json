    "content": "Recently my phone camera went blurry and couldn't focus then suddenly it went black and since then my rear camera is not working.\nWill it randomly works for like 2-3 minutes in 24 hours and then again stopped working. This has lead to other problems like not able to access snapchat, not able to answer video calls, Amazon app not opening, YouTube not working it keeps loading, flash light has been disabled and may be more which I don't even know. And all of these out of nowhere, without even having physical damage.\nAnd I did ever possibly step already\nClearing cache, force stop, safe mode, factory reset everything!!\n\nPlease help!",
