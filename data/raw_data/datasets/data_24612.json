    "content": "Hi folks,\n\nrecently I became owner of a Pixel 4. Mit long after that it turned out that I was used to the comfort of a fingerprint-sensor to access multiple apps. As the Pixel 4 lacks this sensor I wonder if there is a way to use the faceunlock as a Fake-Fingerprint without needing the apps to support faceunlock. I found \"fingerface\", but I don't want to root my phone. Does Google have a workaround maybe?\n\nGreetz",
