    "content": "The first thing my new Pixel 4a phone did was an update to Android 11, A few weeks went by and I was prompted to restart the phone to update to Android 11 and yesterday at least another few weeks, I was prompted to restart the phone again to update to Android 11 and I did but this time the phone was caught in an endless loop. I had to force the phone to shut down and once again it seems to be working okay.",
