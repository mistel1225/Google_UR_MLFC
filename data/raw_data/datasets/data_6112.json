    "content": "Ever since Dec 30, 2020 I have not been able to see my call log.  It still states that \"today\" in recent calls is Dec 30.  I cannot see any calls I made, missed or answered past that date.  I tried to restart my phone multiple times, but nothing helps.  I also cleared the cache in my log.  What else can I do?  Another note, my husband has the same phone with no problems.",
