    "title": "auto arrange icons on home screen alphabetically",
    "content": "I want all my home screen icons to be listed by alphabetical order.\n\nIn particular, if I install a new app, and drag its icon to the home screen, I want it to be inserted there in alphabetical order (i.e. automatically re-arranging all the icons which come after it).\n\nThis is the way that the app drawer already works.  I want my home screen (which only has my favorite apps) to behave the same.\n\nWhat I currently am forced to do whenever I add something is manually drag many icons around.  Total stupid pain.  It keeps getting worse as I add more stuff.\n\nI have web searched this, and I found nothing for stock Android 10 (like my Pixel 4 XL).\n\nBut the question is constantly asked, for example:\nhttps://androidforums.com/threads/alphabetical-order-for-apps-on-home-screen.1227021/\nhttps://forum.xda-developers.com/lg-g8/help/auto-arrange-icons-t3922014\n\nDid I miss something, or is this a known major defect with Android?",
