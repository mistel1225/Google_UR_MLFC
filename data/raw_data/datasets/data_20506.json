    "content": "My son just got a brand new google pixel 3a xl from B&H.  He was trying to get it set up with Verizon.  It seemed like he would need a new sim card, because the one from his Moto g4 plus looked like the wrong size.  When he spoke to the Verizon rep, she told him that that sim card should fit, and told him to go ahead and put it in.  The sim card is now stuck.  She told him to just try to get it out with Pliers.  Since not purchased through Verizon, it really doesn't matter to them.  I don't know what to do.  Help!  I purchased a Square Trade Warranty, but it's a brand new phone, and I don't want to void the warranty by trying to open the phone.  And, of course we don't want a refurbished or repurposed one.  Help!!!",
