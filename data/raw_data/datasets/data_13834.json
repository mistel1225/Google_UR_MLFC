    "title": "Pixel \"Hey Google\" issue with Pixel Buds 2",
    "content": "Google Assistant will stop responding to \"Hey, Google\" on my phone when I enable it on my Pixel Buds 2. In other words, you can only have \"Hey, Google\" enabled on either your Pixel phone or your Pixel buds and not both.  This seems like a developer fix but I wanted to throw it out there to see if anyone has come up with a solution.\nThanks for any help.",
