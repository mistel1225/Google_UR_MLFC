    "content": "Hi.\nI'm on my Pixel 2 XL and am trying to get dark mode on WhatsApp.\nI've enabled Override Force-Dark, and it's not working.\nI've read that you then need to restart the phone if it's not working, but it switches the setting off whenever it happens.\nThrough a bit of testing, and reading other forums suggesting you switch on and off Developer options and it'll work. However, this doesn't save the changes I made\nTo clarify, Dev options and override dark are on. I switch off dev options, everything Grey's out but when I switch them back on, the override dark is off \nPlease help, if you know and have the time \nThanks.",
