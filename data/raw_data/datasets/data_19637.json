    "content": "Suddenly, my pixel 4 xl screen just turn black and I thought it was out of battery, but the speaker was ringing due to an alarm programmed to 9 am. The touch input is working, but I can't see anything. I asked the google assistant to turn on TalkBack so I could navigate with the screen off and share my screen on my android tv. So the phone is working properly, but the screen doesn't contribute. I decided to erase everything but didn't work. Now I think I'm on the setup screen (can hear sound feedback) but now I can't even turn on TalkBack. There is any way to fix it? Or should I just give up and send it to a repair shop? Without a screen, I'll need to switch back to my iPhone...\nI'm in Brazil, so there is no google store support :/\n\nThank you!",
