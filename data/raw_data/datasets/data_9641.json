I'm using USB type A to USB type C, there is no problem with the cable, I tried another device USB tethering and it's working perfectly with my computer but my pixel 4a USB tethering is not working. I switched no data transfer to USB tethering.\nWhen I tried other device USB tethering, In device manager, I can able to see \"Remote NDIS driver\" but when I connect my pixel 4a, I can't able to see it.
