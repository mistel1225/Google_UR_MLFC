    "content": "I'm picking up my phone, the same as aways.  But, since Android 10, Google Assistant is too sensitive and constantly pops up when I pick up my phone.  I'm not trying to pull up on the corners (gestures).  It's constantly in the way when I pick up the device.  Even if disabled, the prompt to enable it pops up.",
