    "content": "Many places such castle, churches, etc, with magnificent artwork in the wall and ceiling.  It's imposible to cover the entire room with normal photo.  It's also imposible to use photosphere because too many visitors in the room and they're constantly moving.  I tried to use Fisheye photo from the center of the room to take only the the ceiling and the walls from above my head so that will include the entire ceiling without seeing anybody.  The Fisheye Photo feature doesn't seem to allow me to take Fisheye photo horizontally.  Is that true or I just don't know how to get it done?",
