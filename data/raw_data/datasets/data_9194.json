    "content": "I got a new Pixel 4a with 5G before Christmas.  The fingerprint scanner didn't work.  Spent a couple hours with tech help including a factory reset.  Didn't fix the problem.  Got a replacement phone sent to me and now the fingerprint scanner is also dysfunctional on this one.  Basically, when I try to set up the fingerprint the scanner doesn't respond.  Nothing happens, though yesterday when I tried it I got the message that the scanner was dirty.  No it's not.  It's brand new and I also cleaned it with a damp cloth.  Is this happening to anybody else?  I don't want to return this second phone until Google gets a grasp on what's happening. Thanks in advance.",
