    "content": "Hi. As the title says, every time I attempt to power off the phone the phone restarts. \n\nI tried resetting the phone and the same thing keeps occuring. \n\nBattery drain is an issue too. Going from 100 to 25 while remaining pretty much idle. Battery manager didn't state what the battery drain could be attributed to. \n\nSeems to all have occurred after the march update. \n\nThanks.",
