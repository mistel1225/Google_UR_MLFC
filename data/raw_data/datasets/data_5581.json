    "content": "My 3aXL started having problems about a week ago. Screen regularly froze but after a restart would work again. Today, those methods no longer works, I can still lock and unlock phone, use the side lock-screen & volume button but I can't do anything on it. It won't register any touch-input. Do I get a screen replacement ? Stupid and obvious question but I just wanted to know if there are any other methods available.",
