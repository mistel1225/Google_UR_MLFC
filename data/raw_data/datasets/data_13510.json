    "content": "When I turned on my Pixel 3 today, the Google logo on a white screen just flashes on and off.\n\nI went into Fastboot mode, then Recovery mode, then No command screen, then Reboot system now and again the result is the Google logo on a white screen just flashing on and off.\n\nIs there a solution anyone knows of that doesn't mean me resetting to factory settings?\n\nThanks in advance!",
