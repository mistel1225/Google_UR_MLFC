    "content": "i only bought my phone on 21/12/20. i have not damaged it in any way. it suddenly cut out yesterday and will not switch on even plugged in. the cable is fine and works with other devices. the screen looks completely blank (nopower/charging symbol). ihave tried holding both buttons on while plugged in etc etc. The port is not dirty. the screen is fine and i have tried phoning the phone in case he screen is the problem but it is definitely the phone that is off. it should be under warranty but on this website i try to follow the filing links but get sent round and round in a loop. i had been happy with the phone until this...please help",
