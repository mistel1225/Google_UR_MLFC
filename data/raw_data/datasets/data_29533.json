    "title": "problems with the front facing camera and the speaker",
    "content": "Essentially every time I start the Pixel 3 front camera, either from the camera app itself or using ANY 3rd party app, the camera starts up blurry and with a loud static noise. This has been going on for a few months now, and is at the point where it happens EVERY time I start up the camera. Also the one speaker don't work properly (stereo sound don't work), this is even more problematic because the phone it's always in vibrate mode that means that i can't hear incoming calls and the loudspeaker don't work when i'm on a call. \nplease i need a prompt solution.",
