    "content": "In the last few days my Pixel XL has been freezing and requiring restarts. The phone will now not start at all. If I plug in the charger no battery symbol appears. I have tried starting by holding down the power button and in safe mode by pressing the volume down and power. In all cases after about 30 seconds the phone vibrates very briefly and then nothing. \n\nOne attempt to start the phone today did result in a screen saying there had been a failure and gave an option to perform a factory reset, which I did not do. But since then multiple attempts to start the phone have failed. Any ideas on what to try next? Sending to a repairer is probably not going to be economic but happy to try things myself.\n\nThanks,",
