    "content": "I am a new Android user and have just bought the Google Pixel 3 XL. I set it up on all default options and added my Gmail account information. After downloading a handful of apps the Play store became stuck on \"Pending Downloads\" for any update or new install. Searching the web this appears to be a remarkably common problem with many recommended solutions. I tried every single one of them including some extra ones and nothing worked. Except today, finally, a complete Factory Reset did the trick. I find it bizarre that what is now a mature platform can have such a basic and common issue persisting and am curious as to why such a deep flaw continues to exist?",
