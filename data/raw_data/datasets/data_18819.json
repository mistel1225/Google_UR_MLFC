    "title": "Pixel3a: When calling (both in and out-going), nobody can hear me.",
    "content": "So, when I try to call (or get a call) I can't be heard. I can hear whoever's on the other line however. When I turn on my speaker-phone, they can hear me, but that's not a proper/longterm workaround. \n\nI've reset the phone. Both microphones (top and bottom) are clean and are working with every other app, aside from CALLING, of all things. I've installed any and all recent updates. Bluetooth is off. I don't accidentally have the mute button turned on. I've gone through google's troubleshooting guide. I've also tried to see if the problem persists when in safe mode. It does. \n\nThis has also randomly happened in the past. Sometimes I couldn't be heard, but then the next day, it would be working fine again for some inexplicable reason.\n\nI only just bought the phone a year ago (from Best Buy, not some unverified reseller), this is unacceptable-- Getting a new phone or factory-resetting it is unreasonable if this is a fairly common occurrence, which it seems to be.",
