    "title": "Android Q emojis are emotionless and Gesture lack configurations",
    "content": "I'm not sure if anyone has noticed, but besides adding new emojis, Google has changed some of the old emojis. I actually use Android message web, which luckily still has the Android Pie emojis, and when I compare side by side, Emojis on Android Q are quite emotionless. I just wonder if some of us feel the same :)\n\nFurther, I love the gesture option for the navigation bar, but it lacks configurations. Why doesn't Google allow us to configure what we wanna do with the bottom left and right? I don't really google assistant anyway.",
