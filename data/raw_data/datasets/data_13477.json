    "content": "When I navigate to storage, \"Images\" are listed to take up 24+GB. When I open my files app and look at the storage associated with \"Images\" there, it's only 51MB.\n\nWhy are these different?\n\nI've connected my Pixel 3 to a PC and have manually deleted images/videos in app folders like WhatsApp/Telegram already. I have deleted a majority of the pictures on my phone, deleted backed up photos/videos...yet still, Images shows for over 24GB under \"Storage\".\n\nI've tried turning it off & on again three times.",
