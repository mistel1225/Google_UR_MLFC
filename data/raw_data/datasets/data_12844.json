    "content": "Hello. I have an odd problem that I can't find others experiencing. \n\nMy Security settings are set to screen lock with a pattern.  However, for some unknown reason my phone switched to the pin security mode, without me setting it.  The pin set to an old pin that I set. \n\nWhy did my screen change its settings by itself?",
