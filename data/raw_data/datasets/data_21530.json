    "title": "Why are alerting notifications showing up as silent?",
    "content": "Ever since updating to Android 10, I've been having issues with notifications coming through as silent when they shouldn't be. \n\nIt's been happening with a few different apps, such as Android Messages. I'll set the notifications to be alerting, but they end up coming through as silent. However, the setting never gets changed, and I can keep going back and confirming that it's set to alerting, despite coming through as silent.\n\nI've seen other people on Reddit complaining about the same thing, so I assume this is just an Android 10 bug. To everyone here, have you experienced this, and do you know of a fix?\n\nEdit: I've attached a photo showing a Bumble notification that is clearly set to alerting, but despite this, shows up as a silent notification.",
