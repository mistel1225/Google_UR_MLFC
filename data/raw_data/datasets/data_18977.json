    "content": "Hi, I've been using an external microphone with my Pixel 2 XL in the last few months with no issues. But a few hours ago, I was recording an audio, so I've recorded one part and when I started recording another one, the device just stopped recognizing my external microphone.\n\nThe microphone was plugged in whole time and now the phone recognizes it as some kind of USB device, but not as microphone or something. \n\nPlease help",
