    "content": "I've had the Pixel 5 since launch and I've had no issues until recently where it seems the glass is chipping in various places at quite a rate. This isn't something I expect from a flagship phone. The screen shouldn't be chipping for no reason with such ease. What are my options? Is this covered in my warranty?",
