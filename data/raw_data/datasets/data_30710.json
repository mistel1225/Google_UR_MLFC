    "title": "Pixel 3 USB-C port issues with cable connection reliability",
    "content": "I'm having problems with my Pixel 3's USB-C port that are manifesting in cables not connecting securely.\n\nWhen I have a charging cable connected, slight movements will register a disconnect even when the cable appears to be properly connected. Sometimes, the cable will even fall out altogether.\n\nAs I still have the charger for my OG Pixel and a compatible cable (I had to replace the cable that came with the phone due to an unrelated issue), I tried various combinations of charger, cable and power point to no avail (the cable I'm using to charge my OG Pixel has a more common tendency to fall out of the port altogether). I've also checked the USB-C port on my Pixel 3 for any debris and couldn't find anything.\n\nChecking both cables in my OG Pixel results in a secure connection with no fiddling around required. As of now, I'm at a loss as to what to do next.",
