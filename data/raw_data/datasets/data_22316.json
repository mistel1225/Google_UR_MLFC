    "title": "Phone screen keeps going black with no way to get it back on, something sounds loose in phone",
    "content": "I think i have a hardware issue with my phone, it sounds like there is a loose bit inside of it. the screen just goes black but my phone doesn't turn off or anything i still receive messages and notifications. I did believe at one point it could've been the software (the new update/ an app) but I went through the \"Fix an pixel screen that isn't working right\" section of the help center, i tried everything on there which has led me to the conclusion that it could be a hardware issue. I have contacted google support but haven't received an email back yet. \n\nany suggests on what i should do from here would be extremely help full. as i cannot just go to a bestbuy or a phone store to get it fixed i am hoping to be able to send it back to google themselves to have it fixed if i cannot figure it out",
