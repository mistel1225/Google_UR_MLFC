    "content": "Hey,\n\nmy Pixel 3 shuts down when taking a few pictures with the camera and when using some other apps. Parallel to that my battery just gets empty. When I restart the phone it normally shuts down again... Does anyone has the same problem? It's still happening after a factory reset...\n\nThank you!",
