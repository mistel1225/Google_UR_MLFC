    "content": "I'm in Canada and need a new phone, but I'll be moving to the USA sometime over the next year. In the USA, I assume Google will consider me to be in international territory because I purchased the phone in Canada--is that correct? If so, is there an easy way to get my plan switched into the American system so I don't have to buy a new phone or accomplish great feats of administrative endurance?",
