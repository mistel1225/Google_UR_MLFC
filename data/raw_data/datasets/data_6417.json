    "content": "Is there a way to whitelist apps so their usage isn't counted in your daily digital wellbeing tallies? For some reason DWB is counting my Clock app usage at seemingly random times for massive amounts of times each day. I don't even use the app! I don't set alarms or even have it running, but as you can see attached I allegedly used it for five hours today. It throws off the overall weekly tally on the DWB app which makes tracking actual usage impossible.",
