    "content": "I have an original Pixel, and have always used it to connect to my car and Bose speakers.  It used to connect automatically and had no issues for a couple years until recently.  Now it will not connect to anything via Bluetooth and will not show any devices under Bluetooth list and is undiscoverable by other devices.  I assume my phone is just shot but wanted some opinions or ways to fix the phone's Bluetooth capabilities.",
