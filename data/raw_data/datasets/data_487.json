    "title": "Why only support pixel phones for a very limited number of years?",
    "content": "I dunt understand how Apple can provide 6 years of software updates but pixel only 3. My phone is still in great condition and works, why push people to purchase new phones when unnecessary? It's kinda gouging as well as a huge negative impact on the environment with more electronic waste. My decision to continue with pixel and Google Fi are greatly impacted by this. We have 3 phones from the pixel family and an IPhone. One customer might not impact you, but if others have the same sentiment, it could impact you. Especially with word of mouth when recommending.",
