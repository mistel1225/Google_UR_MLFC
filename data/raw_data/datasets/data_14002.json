    "title": "Pixel 4a vibrates when media is playing. Normal?",
    "content": "So whenever I'm playing any media(audio/video) on the phone, the entire back panel vibrates due to the sound waves. And the vibration gets intense as I increase the volume. It really is annoying and doesn't contribute to a good experience\nAfter noticing this myself, I went online and read other reviews to check whether only my unit was faulty, and it turns out to be a design flaw/issue with the Pixel 4a. A lot of people are reporting this.\n\nNotably, Pixel 3 had similar issues, but Google's response to that was around the IP water and dust resistant coating/seal. Pixel 4a does not even have an IPXX rating.\nExpecting Google to do something about this.",
