    "content": "I backed up data from my Pixel 2 XL yesterday and did a factory reset after that as I was meant to get it repaired. I also have a Pixel 4 XL which automatically gets backed up in my Google Drive.\nThe problem is that when I am trying to restore my 2 XL today, it shows my 4 XL back up in the Google drive instead of my 2 XL back up that I took yesterday. Any suggestions to help me restore 2XL data please?",
