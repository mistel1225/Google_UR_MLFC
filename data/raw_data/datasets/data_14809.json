    "content": "Since the android 11 update, the 'double-tap to check phone' feature is not working on both of my Pixel 3 phones. \n\nWhen time and info is showing, double tapping does not bring up further information (e.g. message details or media player controls). \n\nSimilarly, 'lift to check phone' also does not seem to be working as it did previously. \n\nIt is enabled under Settings > Display > Advanced > Lock screen > Double-tap to check phone > On.",
