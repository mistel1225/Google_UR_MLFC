    "content": "Been trying for a few weeks now, but nothing came up no matter how many times i have contacted fb support, no answers. So i have been getting this issue that when i try to send photos from messenger, no media shows up, and i have to do it manually, sometimes it just says LAODING MEDIA... Then nothing shows up. I do not want to factory reset, yet i uninstalled fb and fb messenger and re installed them multiple times but no results",
