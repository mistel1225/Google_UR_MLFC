    "content": "Hi, beginning of this week I couldn't make any calls because the phone just freezes when I try to make a call but worked fine when I restarted the device.\n\nThis morning my speaker stopped  working which made me miss my alarm, my mate rang me and I had no sound but just vibration. \n\nSo I restarted the phone in safe mode and everything gt back to normal working order. Did some research and thought I'd reset the phone and now the microphone and speaker is not working. I believe it's a software issue.\nWhat should I do?",
