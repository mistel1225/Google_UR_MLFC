    "content": "Phone has been fine for over a year and now the colors on screen are suddenly washed out. Yes I've tried dark mode, adaptive brightness, adaptive color, accessibility options, etc. It also will not be present when unlocking one moment/use an immediate unlock/use after that will show the issue. Restarts don't help. As a matter of fact as I was typing this everything slowly went back to normal then slowly went off again. It's the strangest phenomenon, like the automatic screen adaptation is broken, and doesn't really turn off when you turn it off.",
