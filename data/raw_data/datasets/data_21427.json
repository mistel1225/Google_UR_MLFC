    "content": "Pixel 2 xl on EE(UK) contract. Have had nothing but problems with the phone and user experience with phone and customer service has been diabolical. Too many issues to list here but rest assured I have sent anyone and everyone emails,bug reports etc to illustrate my issues.just about every setting at one point or another has taken on a life of its own. Doesn't matter who gets email response is always the same.....that's if you actually get a response. Not long ago I took off my case and what do you know hairline cracks appeared all coming from the same corner of the phone. Do I dare tell anyone...no.as I'm sure I'd just get no response anyway. My contract is now finished with EE so decided to get a very cheap SIM until I decided what to do. I backed up my entire phone to my pc and did a full reset and reinstalled only bare minimum....phone is now worse than ever... even the boot up screen is different and,yes,I've redone my settings. I feel that I've spent a small fortune on the phone and nobody cares about the bad experiences I've had. So think it's time to ditch Google and to hell with brand loyalty. Question is which phone? I do not use my phone for gaming or watching films etc.  I like photography ,YouTube Vids etc and pretty much use phone for emails etc. Maybe midrange but with some extra \"oomph\" under the hood? Suggestions appreciated üëç",
