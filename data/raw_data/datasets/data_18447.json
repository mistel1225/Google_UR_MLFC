    "content": "I already have 1 contact with this setting and it allows the notification to come through correctly as I want (if volume is set to vibrate only, it allows notifications from that contact with same vibrate setting, etc), but I'm trying to add 1 more contact and have been unable to find this option now. I know I can do this by changing setting to allow starred contacts, but I don't want to have to change all my starred contacts just to allow these 2 contacts to get through. Did this option go away, and the one contact I have this set for is just grandfathered in?",
