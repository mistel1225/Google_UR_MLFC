    "content": "I have the Bedtime mode under the Digital Wellness set up to start at 11pm every day, but it does not turn on automatically. If I go to Settings->Digital Wellness ->Bedtime Mode and toggle it from \"Based on schedule\" to \"Off\" then back to \"Based on Schedule\" ... Then it turns on. But it does not turn on automatically which defeats the point, and if I forget to do this step I get woken up late by notifications. I have tried restarting my phone and I am up to date on updates. Anyone else having this problem?",
