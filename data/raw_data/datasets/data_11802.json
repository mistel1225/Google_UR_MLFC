    "title": "Why won't Pixel 5 RCS, call screening, and hold for me features work on First Net?",
    "content": "I bought a Pixel 5 and was initially on AT&T with it, but then switched to First Net. As soon as I switched to First Net I lost RCS functionality on my text messages, Google's call screening feature, and the \"hold for me\" feature. I have tried looking for solutions to this issue, but haven't found any. The features aren't even visible in the settings menu anymore. The features worked fine while I was on AT&T, and I loved using them. I'm just looking for any solutions to this issue so I can use the phone to the fullest of its capabilities. Is this an issue on the Google side of the house that could be elevated and resolved, or is it something on the First Net side of the house?",
