    "content": "Help! Is there anyway to DISABLE AUTOMATIC NIGHT MODE??? :'(  It has ruined so many moments I wanted to just quickly capture. If I NEEDED the night mode option- i would switch to the Night Mode setting, I don't understand the purpose of also having it automatically added to the camera. I just switched from the 2XL and I'm regretting it deeply already. :'(",
