    "content": "I got the Pixel 4 back in December and I had no problems. However, recently my phone has been overheating. Its been overheating with what I consider little things like watching Hulu or YouTube. Not only is it overheating a lot, but the screen has started to freeze. When it freezes I try to touch the screen but nothing happens. Then I just lock/unlock the phone. Any suggestions? Thank you.",
