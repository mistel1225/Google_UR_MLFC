    "content": "I just got a new Pixel 4 yesterday from Google. The phone is great and everything seems t work fine...except for in certain circumstances, the screen glitches momentarily. \n\nFor example SOMETIMES when swiping between photos there is a momentary drawing issue that quickly disappears.I am not sure why it happens sometimes and not other times. I don't know how to describe it better than to say it's a glitch...something I've seen on computer monitors that were going bad.\n\nIs this normal? Should I return the phone due to this problem?",
