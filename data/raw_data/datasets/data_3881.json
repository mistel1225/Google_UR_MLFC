    "content": "I have a pixel 4 with verizon service. I have recently realized that no one is receiving the picture messages I send them if the picture is taken from my phone. I can save an image from online and send it, but if I take the picture myself, it tells me it sent but does not get received. A while back I was playing with my camera settings and I wonder if I changed something there that makes my photos non-receivable. ",
