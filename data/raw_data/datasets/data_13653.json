    "content": "So I was using my phone at work and it just suddenly went dark. It got stuck in a boot loop for over an hour. I managed to get it to start in safe mode briefly before it froze and turned off again after about 30 seconds. Every time I would manage to get the booter screen to open (hold power and down button), it would reboot again before I could manage to get anything done. \n\nNow it has stopped. However, all it has now is a black screen with three options: Lockdown, power off, and restart. I tried to power off and restart with no results. At one point I managed to get an option to boot in safe mode. Same deal. It says safe mode in the lower left corner of the screen, but it is still black and only gives me those three options. \n\nIf someone could please help me find a solution to this I would be very grateful. I just paid this phone off 3 months ago and seriously cannot afford to just upgrade or buy a new phone. And I absolutely need it for my job.\n\nEDIT: Some extra details. While the phone was stuck in the boot loop, the top half of the phone around the camera area got very hot. I put it next to an open window so it could cool down. Once it cooled down, it stopped the boot loop and ended with this issue. Over the summer I had an issue where the OS got corrupted and I had to factory reset my phone as well.",
