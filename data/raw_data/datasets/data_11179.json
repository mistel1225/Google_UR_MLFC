    "content": "Hi all,\n\nI would've loved to have a chat to someone in the live chat, because the support has been outstanding and they are very helpful.\n\nI purchased my first Pixel 3 in 2019 and that one day stopped charging for no reason. Google replaced it.\n\nThen the camera on the new one stopped working, so they replaced it with a refurbished one (because they said they didn't have any new ones)\n\nNow this one is having the same charging issues my first one had, and on top of that the battery is getting pretty hot and draining really fast, even when I'm not using it and no background apps are open.\n\nI would like to talk to someone at Google regarding my options, but I don't think I can trust another Pixel 3, will I just have the same issue again?",
