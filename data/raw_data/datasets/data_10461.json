    "content": "Appears that the pixel 4a struggles to maintain a stable WiFi signal. Unless you stay in the same room as the WiFi router it just drops the signal. \n\nHaving moved from a Samsung phone with zero issue and having numerous other WiFi enabled devices in the house that have no issues with staying connected to the WiFi i can't help but think that this phone is off lesser quality. \n\nI have reset all options, re booted router, connected it first, used 2.4ghz, 5 ghz disconnected every other device but it appears to just fraggle it I move 15 feet away from the hub. No chance of walls are involved. \n\nSurely this is not acceptable, if anyone knows of a fix please shout up.",
