    "content": "1. It is not under Apps & Notifications / Default Apps. (Yes, some apps are listed, but Contacts is not listed.)\n2. It is not by Apps / Contacts / Open by default. (It says, \"No defaults set\")\n3. I don't want to run a different launcher. I just want to use a different Contacts app.\n\nIt seems like a simple thing, I just can not figure it out.  Any help would be appreciated...",
