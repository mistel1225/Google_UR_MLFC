    "content": "My pixel 2 is new to me.... It's on perfect shape, it's been refurbished. Got a new SIM from a carrier and it reads the carrier, phone number, IMEI, carrier I'd code, same APN settings show in the APN list although I don't know if they are totally right or not. Looks like they are though. Anyway the phone also says the radio is off and I can't get it to turn on!!! What is up???",
