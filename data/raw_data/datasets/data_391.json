    "content": "Pixel 3 XL. Previously, had option on incoming call to answer or let the phone handle the call to find who and purpose of the call.  I don't believe this was part of Google Assistant but could be wrong.  The feature is no longer showing up. I think it departed on Android 11 install but not certain of that either. Letting Pixel handle incoming was great for getting rid of spam calls,",
