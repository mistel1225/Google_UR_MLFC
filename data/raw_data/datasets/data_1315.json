    "content": "Really hoping you can help as my wife’s pixel 4a seems to have bricked itself a couple of days back.....\n\nFirstly, the notifications pull down only shows one row and will not pull down further to access quick setttings. From this no notifications are showing either.\n\nSecondly, the phone is showing as having signal but with a cross within. It can make calls but can only send and receive WhatsApp when on WiFi. If I go into settings to switch on mobile data the toggle moves straight back to off. I have also tried resetting the connection settings but this hasn't made any difference. I have also tried the sim card in my pixel 5 (which is linked to my own google account) and there were no signal issues.\n\nThirdly, it doesn’t look like google has backed up/synced since the issue started a couple of days back but can sign in to google from a third party device (to rule out someone else changing password etc).\n\nLastly emails seem to be patchy in sending and receiving but guess is linked to the signal issue above.\n\nI’ve restarted the 4a in safe mode but this doesn’t make any difference. Is a factory reset the only option or is there some kind of hardware fault at play here? Ideally looking to avoid a factory reset given the pain of setting up apps etc and losing the last couple of days’ of pics etc.\n\nThanks in advance \nGethyn",
