    "content": "We switch an old htc to a pixel 3a.  Everything transferred over but the ext messages and the call logs.  The only option was to backup the text messages.   There was no option on the htc to export.  The backup created and HBK file that I can't do anything with.  There is no import option on the pixel 3a and I can't find a way to open the file.  I need a secure 3rd party app that I can trust so that I can open and save.",
