    "content": "I couldn't upload photos in Google maps. There are two ways where we can upload the photos by selecting particular place in Google maps. 1.Camera 2.Folder. I have selected the second option as I can't upload photos immediately. It showed me gallery app isn't available. But in Google pixel 4A I have photos application that works as a gallery in this case do I really need another gallery app??? Even I tried installing another gallery app and again tried to upload the pictures in Google maps again it showed the same that is gallery app isn't available.",
