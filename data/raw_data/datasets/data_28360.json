    "content": "My wife and I both have pixel xl phones. Both recently updated, running Android 9.\n\nThis issue is only happening on her phone. She makes our recieves a phone call and call appears to be connected. She can hear the person on the other end but they cannot hear her.\n\nWe ran across a blurb about several things to try if there was no sound on phone calls. Generally, if she turns off blue tooth and restarts the phone, every thing starts working again. Then she can restart blue tooth and everything still works. \n\nBut it will eventually happen again.\n\nToday, she had to do this process three times before the phone worked again.\n\nWe need a permanent fix to this. Not a temporary fix that has to be done repeatedly.\n\nIs it the recent Android update? If so, how does she get rid of that update and go back to the previous version? Also, why is her phone doing this but not mine?\n\nWe both use our phones for work and she uses it on blue tooth in the car routinely. This is a Serious problem that impacts her ability to perform her job. Please help.",
