    "content": "When taking pictures with rear camera there is a halo of blur around images. If trying to focus more on the right or left side the lens starts clicking. I've tried restarting the phone, clearing the lens and laser, clearing the camera app cache, updating android, checking for app updates, and tested in safe mode. Attached some image examples. Thanks for any help!",
