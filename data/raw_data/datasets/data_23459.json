    "content": "pixel 3a android 10 all alert sounds work only through headphones, including alarm clock and phone ring (but media sound is OK, as well as charge alert and assistant wakeup sound)\n\nTried to turn off/on, to reset all apps, to plug/unplug headphones many times.  I'm not ready to reset to factory yet.  Also tried installing \"Disable Earphones\" app; this works, but then I can have either the headphones or the speaker on, and have to switch manually (and watch commercials).",
