    "content": "Tonight, my new pixel 4 suddenly started to restart without touching for several times. I would used it for 2-3 mins and put it aside. While I return to check, it's been restarted again. It has happened for 5 times even I manually turn it off and on.\n\nI just finish transferring the data from my old phone to my new Pixel 4. Let's to say, I haven't officially started to use it yet. I have a case bought from google store so I don't think this official case would cause an external effect (I also tried to remove the case but it still happened).\n\nWhat should be my next steps?\n\n=== 12/25/2019 updates\nSo I've contacted google support. I return to the factory setting that the auto-restart issue has been temporarily resolved for a week. But now it starts again, along with even more issues:\n1. When I tried to have a phone call, I cannot hear the other person's voice, nor can they hear mine. If I used messenger or line, I can hear their voice, yet, they still cannot hear my voice. I've contacted google support in Taiwan, they provided me with a series of steps including using my phone in safe mode. My phone does not work properly in safe mode either. \n2. After restart my phone, it takes quite a while to load all the things (which did not happen when I first started to use this phone). When I tried to log into my contact list, it frozen, then restarted by itself. \n3. I tried to keep the security and google play system updated. Yet the things above happened and I manually restart, I notice the most recent google play update did not work -- which means I have to update it again.\n\nDoes anyone have similar experiences?",
