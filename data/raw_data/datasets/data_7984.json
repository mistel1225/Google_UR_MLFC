    "content": "My Pixel 4 xl is connected to my hearing aids, so I can change the hearing aids programs. I prefer to listen through the Pixel 4 XL speaker/mike instead of hearing the phone though my hearing aids when making or receiving phone calls. By default, the phone picks the hearing aids. I can change it to the phone but within a short time, the phone changes it back to my hearing aids. Is there a way I can make this change permanent?",
