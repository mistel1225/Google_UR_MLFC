    "content": "After upgrading to Android 10, my phone occasionally gets stuck, the screen flickers and reboots on itself. I was disregarding it as a once or twice affair, but it's happening more frequently now, 4-5 times/week. I worry this might happen when I'm doing something important and will lose work because of it.",
