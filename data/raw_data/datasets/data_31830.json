    "content": "I saved a copy of a video I recorded on my pixel 3. I then used the video stabilisation tool in the Google photo app on the copied video and it ruined the qaulity. It won't let me undo this and it overwrote all copies in my library. I read there was a function to 'undo edits' but this is not showing up as an option anywhere. Is there anyway to undo this? Has anyone else experienced this issue? All my backup files have been affected aswell.",
