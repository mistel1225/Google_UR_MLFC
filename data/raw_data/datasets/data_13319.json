    "content": "I got the OTA update for my Pixel 3XL today and when the device restarted, I had a slurry of issues. \nMy notification panel (lockscreen and pull-down) is completely empty, I can hear notifications and see badges above apps but the panel remains empty.\nMy mobile data does not work - if I try to enable mobile data, the switch toggles but nothing happens. Re-opening settings shows the setting in the off position again\nMy recent items is completely broken - as soon as I enter recent items, my most recent app disappears and then it tells me \"No recent items\"\nI cannot update any apps via the play store - I have tried everything short of a factory reset\nQuick settings doesn't work, I can access the first 6 settings in the notification panel but cannot pull down again for more quick settings\nThe settings app doesn't have a search function anymore(though I'm not sure if that's a feature or a bug) \nI have tried everything but a factory reset - I cannot do that yet because my university requires an app for MFA and does not enable you to have a backup device. Once I get the MFA set up on another device I will try a factory reset. \nI've even tried sideloading the latest OTA for my device using ADB from here.\n\nIf anyone has run into any of these issues and has a fix, please share. I will update this post with the results of a factory reset.",
