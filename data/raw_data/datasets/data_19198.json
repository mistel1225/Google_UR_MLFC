    "content": "After I installed the July 2020 update. My pixel 3 xl stays stuck on the screen that has the \"G\" with the progress bar underneath it. My phone allows me turn it off holding the power button and after turning if off  a few times (due to going back to bootloop screen mentioned above) the phone finally skips that screen and goes back to the home screen. Then a notification appears stating the update ended up with an error. This repeats every timeI install this update Anyone else have this issue?",
