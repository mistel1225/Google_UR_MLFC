    "content": "Hi there.\n\nI am bit new in Android (since October 2020) and before I was with iPhone since 2010 but I've moved to Pixel 4 because its lower price and superior camera.\n\nSo I had to sell my Pixel 4 to buy new Pixel 5 and....... to do this - same as with iPhone - I had to remove my Google account in settings and then Factory Reset.\n\n100% I had it backed up just before Reset and I've purchased Pixel 5 and........ it does not see my back up (in that weird place of Restore - where you have to choose to Restore from....... other Android smartphone via cable - but then you have to say you do not have Android Smartphone and to restore from online backup).\n\nDoes backup DIES with removing Google account from Pixel smartphone and Factory Reset?\n\nI've done all settings from scratch in my new Pixel 5 (took me about 2 HOURS!!)  and I see \"Settings\" back up take only 7KB !!! (not even 1MB).\n\nWhat Settings are backed up in those just 7KB data?\n\nGoogle drive Backups also specify there are 40 apps  - but what data from them backed up - does NOT say.\n\nAre those backups multi device compatible? Are they........ ie. Android 11 but restored on Android 12 compatible?\n\nThank You for help",
