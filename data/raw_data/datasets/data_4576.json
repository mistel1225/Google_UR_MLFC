    "content": "After update, cannot unlock by fingerprint but shows, \"fingerprint software is not functioning\" (im from Hong Kong so it is tranlation from traditional Chinese) every time when i press the sensor.\nWhen i tried to add fingerprint record, when i press the sensor it will mention cannot make a new record.\nIt means the sensor is work at least can sense every time i press it, so i assume it is a software issue.\nSo i tried to have factory reset.......then...........the sensor no function at all, tried to add fringerprint again but the phone doesn respond, just stop in the screen asking for pressing the sensor......\npoor me.",
