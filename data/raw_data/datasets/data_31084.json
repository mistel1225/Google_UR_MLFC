    "content": "When setting up my Pixel 3 XL, as it was connected via cable to my old Pixel, the old phone lost power, so so setup was interrupted. I now cannot finish setup. I have some apps, but no texts were transferred. How do I finish setup? The answers on this site tell me that a \"finish setup\" will appear in the settings, but it doesn't. How do I finish transferring all my texts, as well as anything else that wasn't transferred?",
