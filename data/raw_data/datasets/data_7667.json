    "content": "Hey. I have a problem with my Pixel 4a. I bought it 4 days ago and immediately noticed that when watching a video on YouTube, the top speaker does not sound correctly. the low frequencies found in the upper speaker produce distorted sound. the top speaker is not designed for low frequencies and is not producing them correctly. most often heard in videos with deep bass at a volume of 50 to 90% volume. if you make the volume at 100%, then everything will already be loud there. but, like most users, I use the volume from 50% to 80% when watching video or music, very often the speaker \"chokes\". lower bass speaker, works correctly and gives low frequencies. Is this a speaker marriage or is it necessary? And can this be a warranty case? I asked other Pixel 4a users, they also complain about \"wheezing\" in the upper speaker, when watching videos, music, etc. In \"Special Opportunities\", removing the left channel (upper speaker) does not help, since by dragging the slider to the right, the upper frequencies disappear from the upper speaker, but the lower frequencies and it is this hoarseness that remains in the sound. I donâ€™t understand what to do now. I bought a new phone ((\n\n\nwheezing is clearly audible at  4:44\n\nP.S. Especially wheezing is heard when I expand the video to YouTube in full screen. the loudness and volume of the video become larger and the wheezing on the upper speaker is already clearly audible.\nP.S. In safe mode, the problem is still there.",
