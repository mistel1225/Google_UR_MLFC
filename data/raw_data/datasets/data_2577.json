    "content": "Hi, I've just bought a Pixel 5 and I could never imagine this level device could have this kind of non sense - is there really NO WAY to organize my app drawer? I mean I have A LOT of apps I use and the most convenient way I found throughout the years is definitely having main apps on the main screen and the rest organized using folder on the so called app drawer. Why it's not an option on Pixel? \n\nAlso, I've tried different launchers which might safe the day, but there's another flaw (and I found a lot on this, seems like Google simply refuses to fix it) - any 3rd party launcher loses its snappiness and there's a delay between going back to main screen and opening an app.\n\nCome on guys, you take away an opportunity to use a 3rd party launcher but at the same time refuse to fix what I believe is the most common reason for one - not being able to organize my phone the way I like.\n\nAnd if there's a way to work around this, I would love to know it and would highly appreciate any help, cheers!",
