    "content": "I just ordered a pixel 3a, then realized I'm not sure if its compatible for the Square app for small businesses. I don't see it listed on the compatibility page, but neither is the pixel 3, although the pixel 2 is. Is that a failure to update on the part of square, or are they actually not compatible?",
