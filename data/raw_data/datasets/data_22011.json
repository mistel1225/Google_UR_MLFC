    "content": "Hi, I have a stalker and his threats against me have recently escalated drastically. He has hacked some of my accounts already. I have been in contact with the police and tried to tell the FCC but neither of them are of any help. I'm severely worried about my safety. I know he uses a Google Pixel 3, I know its IP and he used a burner Google phone number. Is there any way I can contact google and tell them about this user? Can they stop his account or anything? I'm sure this violates the terms of service? I need help soon, he knows where I live and I'm really worried.",
