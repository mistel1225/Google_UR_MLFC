    "title": "Bluetooth volume defaults to maximum on each new connection",
    "content": "Everytime I connect bluetooth headphones to my pixel - the volume changes to max volume. \n\ne.g. my volume might be on 60% before connecting, and I would put the buds in my ears and once connection is established it would jump to 100%. \n\nIts scary each time (catches me off guard), and worst of all causing me ear damage (imagine my shock when playing Linkin Park). \n\nI found this post which suggested 'disabling absolute volume' but this did not work. My 'disable absolute volume' is ON and i am still experiencing this issue.",
