    "content": "Since the upgrade to Android 10 on my Pixel 2 I am having issues with non-working sensors - orientation, gyroscope, accelerometer, step counter ... I tried factory reset after each security patch but nothing helped. Sensors work randomly after power off, but stop working after some minutes. Any hint on what could I do? Are you guys aware of the issue?",
