    "content": "Hi everyone!\nI've bought a Pixel 4a that arrived on Tuesday, for my wife.\nSince that, first thing we did was to set it up and download all the updates.\nYesterday I realized that typing w/o swype felt very buggy and, checking it further, THERE'S NO MULTITOUCH IN THE SCREEN.\n\nI was about to factory reset the device and, for some reason, it began working again... After a while, it came back to not-normal.\n\nAfter closing all the apps, a hard reset and factory reset, the problem persists as the phone won't recognize more than one touch simultaneously. I've also enabled the High sensitivity option in the Screen menu. We don't live in the States so returning the device is nearly impossible for us.\nThe device has the OMOTON screen protector but I'm 80% sure that this isn't the root cause.\n\nShall I remove the screen protector or wait for further software updates?\nAny idea?\n\nThanks!!!",
