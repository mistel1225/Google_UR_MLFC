    "content": "Hello, I have a big spot on the display - oleophobic coating defect. It's very disappointing thing for the new phone... And i have no way to change it in the store because i bought it the USA and opened only at home in Uzbekistan. Google should pay more attention to quality control of its products. Can you give advice on how to restore the oleophobic coating?",
