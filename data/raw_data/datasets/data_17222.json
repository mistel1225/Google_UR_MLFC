    "content": "NFC stopped working. I've tried to pay few times but payment terminal at the sop didn't \"see\" my phone.\nLater I downloaded app called 'nfc tools' and pixel didn't see any card. Then I tried the same procedure on other phone (s6 edge) and phone detected all cards immediatly.\nAfter that I did factory reset of the pixel but that didn't helped either.  2 days ago NFC was working perfectly fine.\nPhone is brand new (bought pix 4xl 8 days ago :/ )\nAny advice what else I can do?",
