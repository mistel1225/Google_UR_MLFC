    "content": "I have my 2 weeks old Pixel 4 XL. Once I restart the device, the screen went black after the Google logo. Only the time, mobile \nsignal and battery logo are shown and blinking at the top of the screen. I attach the video link for demo. \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y8M-Gvpzlk\n\nI tried to hard reset (wipe data) for the device. It looks normal during the setup page. However, the problem happen again once the setup is done and after I press the power button. Here is the video link :\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wfm9sct1j6Q\n\nAnything I can do before I send it for warranty claim?",
