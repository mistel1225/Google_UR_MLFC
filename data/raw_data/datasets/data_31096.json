    "content": "My Pixel 3 Bluetooth has issues turning on. If it does manage to cut on it connects easily. It has been getting worse overtime and it is getting to the point where it won't cut on at all even after restarting my phone. I haven't downloaded any new apps since the problem started happening. Every other time I try to cut it on it shows an error message that says it is not responding (like an app (picture))",
