    "title": "Pixel 3 won't turn on after shutdown / restart. Does not recognize charger.",
    "content": "I received the phone two days ago and it worked fine that evening. I had an issue where it was not recognizing my lock pattern the next day so I rebooted it and it wouldn't turn back on. Held the power button for 30 seconds as I had seen online and that worked after a couple tries. The lock pattern issue happened again later so I tried to restart it and I haven't been able to turn it on since. I have let it charge overnight, held the power button for upwards of a minute multiple times, tried to turn it on while plugged in, in and out of the case. I am at my wits end.\n\nI'll probably try to get a replacement but I thought I ought to at least try here first. Any help would be greatly appreciated!",
