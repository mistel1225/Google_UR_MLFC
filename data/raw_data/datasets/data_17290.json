    "content": "My pixel 3 was able to connect to my wifi 5ghz router. However, it suddenly disconnect since two weeks ago and now keep showing \"connecting\" and then \"Saved\" when I try to connect it.\n\nAll other devices are still working fine with the 5ghz including iPhone, iPad, XPS laptop. \n\nI tried reset the wifi setting and factory reset for both pixel 3 and router, it doesn't help. \n\nMy pixel 3 can still see the 5ghz signal but keep showing \"connecting\" and then \"Saved\" when I tried to connecting. \n\nAny suggestion here?",
