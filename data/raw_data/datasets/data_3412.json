    "title": "Using Dual exposure toggles adds too much noise",
    "content": "Whenever I try to use the dual exposure toggles on my Pixel 4a it adds a lot of noise, for example, to the darker parts of the picture if I bump up the shadow toggle. The noise is retained even beyond the processing. I have attached two pictures - both were shot in normal camera but one was with the dual exposure toggles manually changed. You can see the noise in the darker sections of the picture. Does anyone else have this problem ? Is this how it's supposed to work ? Is there a fix ? The noise makes the photo unusable. This also happens in day time photos, when there's plenty of light, which is even more annoying. Please help.",
