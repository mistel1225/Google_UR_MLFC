    "content": "Yesterday my phone started randomly shutting off when the screen would sleep. Or at least I think it is shutting off, the only way I can use it afterwards is by powering it back up. I have tried a factory reset which as of thus far has not helped my cause. The battery is displaying as normal and I have had this issue while charging and while unplugged. In fact, I first noticed this problem just after plugging my phone in. I was on the latest Android distro as this began and am currently updating my phone back to the latest as I type this. \n\nI have tried to physically manipulate the phone, slight twisting, pressing in certain places and none of this seems to affect the phone as has been the case with other users. \n\nAnyone has any ideas?",
