    "content": "On my Pixel 5 the camera will automatically use night sight unless I press the button to disable it every single time I open the camera app. \n\nI do not want night sight on unless I navigate to the night sight tab of the camera. It is very inconvenient to have to turn it off every time I open the app to take a picture. \n\nCan I permanently turn auto night sight off without having to do it every time I open the app?",
