    "content": "On the Pixel 4 XL, if I open the phone keypad and start typing a name, it brings up a list of matching contacts - which is of course what I want. However, it only shows one number for each contact. In my Google Contacts, I have a friend called \"Rita\" - she has a home number and a mobile number against the contact. On my old Samsung, it would show both numbers and I could choose whether to call the home phone or the mobile. On the Pixel, it only shows one number. Going into Google Contacts, I could see that her mobile was set as \"default\" so I removed the default - but then the phone pad just showed her home number. I'd like to be able to type her name, and select which number to call, like I did on the Samsung Galaxy. Is this not possible on the Pixel?",
