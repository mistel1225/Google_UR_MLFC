    "title": "Pixel 2XL running Android 11 shuts down every time I plug on the battery or headphones! HELP!",
    "content": "I have tried cleaning all my cables and ports, including the phone's. Nothing has changed. Previous owner says I has happened to him before, on an android 10 update, but that it had stopped after the 11beta.\n\nI bought the phone recently, used. However the phone is completely intact, no damage to the outside or screen. I live in Brazil, so since the phone was bought outside of the country and brought in, there are no repair shops that deal with the brand or change/replace parts. This has become so annoying in fact, I have to plug the phone in about 20-30 times until it charges without turning off and ending up in a on/off cycle.\n\nHELP!",
