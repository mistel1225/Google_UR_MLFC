    "content": "The battery on my Pixel XL has been draining super quickly after some of the recent updates, meaning it would last less than 4-5 hours.\nThis time, after it fully discharged, it wouldn't charge or turn on anymore.\nI've tried all the troubleshooting including volume up and down, left the phone plugged in for the night, but the screen remains black. The only response it shows from time to time is a red light (not the same as the little flashing red light that indicates the phone needs to charge before you can turn it on). I believe it comes from me moving around the cable. However, the cable, charger, outlet are all fine, so it can't be that.\nHelp.\n\nEdit: I took off the cover and noticed that, when plugged in, the bottom part of the phone causes this strange electromagnetic feeling on my hand. Goes away when I plug it out. Does this indicate some sort of battery issue or is it normal and I simply never noticed because I never took off the cover?",
