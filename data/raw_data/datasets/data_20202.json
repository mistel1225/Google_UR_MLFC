    "title": "Android non-spanish keyboard upside down question marks in received texts.",
    "content": "Please correct android software from auto-inputting upside down question marks.  Never have used spanish keyboard.  Android always auto-inserts upside down question marks whenever hard returns are input into texts being created. Those don't show up on the originator's view of text being created.  It converts during transmission & is present only in the received text (both Android & Iphone recipients).  If any hard returns (making line spacing between \"paragraphs\") are keyed, the recipient (both android & iphone recipients) receive sender's text showing upside down question marks substituted for each hard return input by sender.  (1 hard return changes to 1 upside down question mark; 2 hard returns send 2; 3 hard returns change enroute to 3, etc.)  Does NOT happen with Iphone-originated texts.  Iphone hard returns for line spacing are received by androids & Iphones as intended, single, double, etc. line spacing.  The unintended, undesired, confusing upside down question mark(s) is solely an Android-originated problem.  PLEASE fix this Android software fluke.",
