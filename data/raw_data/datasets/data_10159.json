    "content": "I upgraded my phone, and all of my apps and contacts were successfully uploaded to the Pixel 4a.  The problem is that the Pixel thinks that contacts that were on my home screen on the old phone are there on the new phone.  But they are not there, and it tells that they already are when I try to put them on the Pixel home screen.",
