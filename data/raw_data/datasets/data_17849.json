    "content": "I have a pixel 4 with emergency contacts setup. When one of the emergency contacts I setup calls me, the call quality is so bad. Its been going on for quite some time.  I deleted all the contacts in my emergency list and the call quality immediately improved. I tried adding them back but quality went back to bad. Anyone had this issue before?",
