    "title": "Pixel 4 XL Notification bar randomly opens and can't be accessed from inside 3rd party apps",
    "content": "The problem started by not being able to swipe down to view notifications within apps.  If I go to the home screen, I am able to swipe the bar down.  However often, sometimes 20 times a minute thereafter the notification bar will open randomly while I am using apps.  This happens even if there aren't any notifications.\n\nI have done the following\n- Factory Reset\n- Boot in safe mode\n- Deleted most of my apps\n- turned off motion, sense, gestures and all notifications\n\nThe top 10% of my screen seems to have significant lag to the touch or spots aren't responsive in certain apps and games.\n\nYet it still is happening.   Any ideas?",
