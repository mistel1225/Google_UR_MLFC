    "content": "I bought this phone because of the camera, 1 year later they made an update on the camera app and it's a total fail. I cannot use the camera AT ALL. I try to open the app and it crashes and shuts down immediately. It's been like this for days. What am I supposed to do? I feel absolutely ripped off and ave no time to deal with this.",
