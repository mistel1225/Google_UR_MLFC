    "content": "On my Pixel 3 XL running Android 10, under developer options, there is a section called theming with an option called accent color. I have changed it to green, and that works fine for a week or thereabouts, but then it resets to default.\n\nIt's not a huge deal, but it's a minor irritation that something like that would reset itself.",
