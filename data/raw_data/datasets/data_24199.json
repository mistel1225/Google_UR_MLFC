    "content": "Hey all,\n\nI purchased a Pixel 2XL (Verizon model through Amazon)  last month and used it with Hello mobile, a Sprint based network, and all was working fine. However, the battery was dying too quickly so I did a warranty exchange on it. I've been sent about 3 replacement devices  because none of them will connect with the network I wanted to use. I've checked all the IMEI numbers and all of them showed up as incompatible on Hello Mobile's website, and also other CDMA network websites as well such as Verizon, Sprint itself, Boost mobile, etc.. They are only show up as compatible on GSM networks upon further testing,  and I'm using T-mobile right now. I've been going back and forth with customer service and everyone has told me that the phone should be compatible on both CDMA and GSM networks.\n\nI contacted Verzion about the phone to see if maybe it was still locked to their network and gave them my IMEI to check but they don't even see the device in their database. I also did one of those 3rd party IMEI checks and it shows up as clean. So now I'm stuck and not sure what to do. Does anyone have advice about this?\n\nThanks in advance.",
