    "content": "Can we please have the ability to delete the Pixel Tips app? I'm on year 5 of owning a Pixel, so I don't need 200MB of my phone storage to be wasted on an app I don't need. I keep clearing the app cache and storage but it keeps going back up to 200MB. I just want this app GONE.\n\nAdditionally, every few days, at the top of my homescreen, where it normally says the date and temperature, it says \"Welcome to your new PIxel,\" even though I've had this phone for a week now. It's really annoying because the only way to get that to go away is to click on it, which opens the Pixel Tips app.",
