    "title": "Passes Don't Show up When Holding Power Button",
    "content": "I just updated my Pixel 3a to the new March Feature Drop and I notice my passes are not showing up under the new \"power hold\" menu. I've never used Google Pay before but I thought I'd give it a try with this new feature. I added my gym membership (it's a bar code) to Google Pay but it is not showing up in the new menu. All I see is the message saying \"Add payment method\". If I open the app however, I can see it and use it fine. Not a deal breaking issue, but one that is annoying.",
