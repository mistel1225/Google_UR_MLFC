    "content": "It seems like a recent update may have caused this issue since its popped up in the last few weeks.   When connecting to my vehicle via Bluetooth (Uconnect) I can't get any notifications, map directions, app volume etc unless some media is playing.   If I'm streaming music from Google Play or even YouTube I get it all.   Not playing anything I don't even know if a text comes in.  Navigating with Google maps will not even give the audible directions unless music is playing.   I've tried reconnecting, clearing cache,etc with no help.   I thought driving mode may be the issue but verified it's turned off.  Anyone with some tips or suggestions?  Pretty annoying to deal with.",
