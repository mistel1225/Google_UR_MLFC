    "content": "I tried setting up face lock on my new pixel 4 multiple times, however, it keeps saying that certificate expires and would not allow me to proceed. I see that most people facing this issue have a used pixel but mine is a new phone and I just updated to android 11 trying to fix it. It didn't work.\nHow can I fix this?",
