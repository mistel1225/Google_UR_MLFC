    "title": "Sound cuts out intermittently when on a call",
    "content": "When talking on the phone, the other person's voice cuts out intermittently, usually just for a few seconds.  I can't seem to find a pattern, it happens at home as well as at work and elsewhere.  I shake the phone or try to move around and the sound will come back.  There doesn't seem to be any consistency. I already spoke with my cell provider and they reset the connection, but that didn't help. I do not use Wifi calling.",
