    "content": "Trying to retrieve hijacked accounts, data didn't sync from previous phone, I missed important call, caller stated a Verizon msg stating the customer has restrictions set? I don't use Verizon! This isn't a pixel! I've tried everything. It behaves badly!  My photos don't upload or DL! Nothing automatically syncs! I send reports, never to get answers! I have numerous active accts I can't access. 1 being the one I had years, it's active, it's being used by someone, but sign in sez, google prompts turned off, or something is wrong with the way you are signing in? It's hacked! And about to take legal action against google!",
