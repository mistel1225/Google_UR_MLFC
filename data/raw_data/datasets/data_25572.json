    "content": "Anyone else have a pixel 4 / 4 xl that's on Google Fi (esim) that now shows 2 different signal indicators?? There is only the esim activated and no physical sim at all. Why am I now seeing two Google Fi signal strength icons at top of screen and dual SIM options in chat and settings etc, both for same Google Fi phone number and strangely with same IMEI number? Anyone else have this issue with Pixel 4 XL on November security update? The indicators show the exact same signal strength and are the exact same esim. Searches don't show anyone else asking this question.",
