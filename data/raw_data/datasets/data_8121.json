    "title": "Is there a fix for the wifi dropping issue?",
    "content": "I use my pixel 2 exclusively on wifi now, and use a hotspot away from home. Every other device that uses the hotspot does not have this problem. It will still say \"connected\" to the hotspot but no internet. I'll get a pop up and notification every 20 seconds on my pixel 2 saying there's no internet. I have tried restarting the phone, forgetting and re-adding the hotspot, and even did a factory reset at one point. It will finally start working after fiddling with it for what seems like a long time (no idea what triggers this as it seems to be different every time) only to do it again a while later. I did some searches and it seems I'm not the only one but the only solutions offered are ones I've been trying. It's happening more and more often now so I'm hoping for a permanent fix or at least a fix that works on the first try every time. thank you.\n\neta: my phone is updated fully",
