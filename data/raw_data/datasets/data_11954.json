    "title": "Pixel 5 Always-On-Display Constantly Blinking Brightness",
    "content": "When I set my phone down on the desk, the always-on-display will be showing. The clock and notifications will be visible, but dimmed. Literally every ten seconds, the screen will brighten. It will stay like this for five seconds, and then go back to being dimmer, where it will stay for only ten seconds, and continue the cycle. At first, I thought it was an app I have called Signal Spy, which keeps track of which network I'm using. It's one of those that stays in the notification tray permanently, and due to its nature, it's in constant flux. However, I closed this app temporarily, and the screen blinking continued without it. I want to be able to keep my phone on my desk next to me, because it's SUPPOSED to brighten when a notification comes in, but it's not supposed to just do it every ten seconds, because that is PROFOUNDLY DISTRACTING. Is there anything I can do besides factory reset my phone, because something tells me that is absolutely not going to work.\n\nPS: Other people are talking about a blinking \"light\"? I don't think this is that. It's the display itself.",
