    "content": "I recently purchased the new Pixel 4. The battery is barely lasting the day, (Lasts 6 hours)\n\nI have done all the recommended steps like disabling smooth motion, always on display and voice commands etc with no improvement.\n\nLooking at the battery use Facebook killed 55% in 27 minutes of use. https://imgur.com/pnVRisr\n\nDoes anyone have any tips for me to improve battery life except the obvious? or is this normal now?! Thanks!",
