    "title": "GCam \"touch to focus\" is unreliable and has many issues",
    "content": "It's been like this for months. Nothing has been fixed.\nTouch to focus often does not respond to you pressing or has a delay, the focus often fails to focus, where you touch. Then a lock button appears at the top, which is just as unresponsive.\nAnd suddenly from a slow paced phone, it become an F1 phone, when it comes to hide the lock button, if you spent time trying to get it to focus, then if you fail to press lock button on first try in 2 seconds, then you can start over.\n\nOn top of that, if you use touch to focus with flash on, then the exposure is locked when the flash is off, and it doesn't even use flash to focus. It's surprising that the best camera phone has arguably the worst manual focusing. It's only to be used as a point and shoot phone, which it's really good for.\n\nFor comparison Nexus phones had a reliable touch&hold to lock focus and exposure. This is replaced by lens camera, which I personally only activate from Google Assistant button, not from camera.\n\nCan we finally get a better solution, please?",
