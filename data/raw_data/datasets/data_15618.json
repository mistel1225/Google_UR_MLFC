    "content": "I just literally used my pixel to take few snaps underwater, just about after few minutes the USB got disabled and soon after an hour the microphone stopped working. Also the front and back cameras have water clogged which literally can be seen from the outside. The pictures aren't coming clean now and also no face detection any more. I hate it, had S7 edge few years back which never caused any problem when I used it to capture pics while at a beach. I hate you Pixel for causing me pain. I'm currently at Gulf region where I've no option to claim for return also. Being a loyal Pixel customer experiencing this is so hurtful. You literally fooled the customers by saying it's IP68. Water squeezed inside like anything. Pathetic experience.",
