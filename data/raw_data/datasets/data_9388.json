    "content": "I got my Pixel 5 today and after setting up the phone and installing all my apps, I tried to connect my Fossil Sport watch. It just won't finish installing and fails at various levels. The best I've had, after 6 attempts at resetting and starting install from scratch is the Pixel 5 telling me the watch is set-up, and the Watch telling me it is \"finalizing updates.\" Most of the time it fails as soon as the phone finds the watch. \n\nBy fails, I mean it gets hung up and stops progressing to the next step. each time I let it run for nearly 30 minutes before giving up and restarting. The most recent time (that made it almost to the end) I let run for 45 minutes. Something is clearly up here. For the record, I actually re-added it to my Pixel 2 and it went flawless. \n\nAny suggestions on what to do here to still use my watch with my nice new phone?",
