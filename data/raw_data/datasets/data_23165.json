    "title": "Pixel XL screen goes black during calls and I can't hear the caller",
    "content": "Recently, my Pixel XL started blacking out on calls, doesn't matter if I'm calling or it's an incoming call. This happens with any calling app. I can't hear the caller and he screen only comes back if the other person ends the call. I've tried wiping the proximity sensor, restarting, etc. but nothing has worked. I feel like I should throw this phone in the garbage at this point, because it won't fulfill its main function even though I've only had it for 10 months.",
