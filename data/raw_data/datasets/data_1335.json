    "content": "Using Routines, I get GAssistant to turn OFF DND, I can't get it to turn ON. Has spent hours on this. I can get GAssistant to turn on/off flashlight, without problem, even to start a third party radio app. But turning on Do Not Disturb has proved impossible. I have been able to get GAssistant to \"say\" they are turning on DND, but nothing happens. Please, advise.",
