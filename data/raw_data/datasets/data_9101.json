    "content": "Edit: so when I went to \"advanced settings\", my number was listed as \"unknown\".  So I inputted my number but it's still sending the texts back at me.\n\nHi, whenever I send a text to my group chat, the text I send is sent back to me as if sent by someone else.  I wasn't having this problem up until this morning.  How do I stop it from doing this?\n\nIn \"group details\", my number is listed as \"me\".",
