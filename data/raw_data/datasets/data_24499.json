    "content": "I've updated to Jan patch. Force quit, cleared cache & rebooted & like everyone else (& there seems to be A LOT of people with the same issue) it hasn't helped. Working fine one minute now useless. I use the camera a lot for work & only just \"bought\" the phone out at the end of it's contract. Very annoying. Any idea when a patch will be out to fix it???",
