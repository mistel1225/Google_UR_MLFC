    "content": "Hi\n\nI've owned my Pixel 3 for week now and I do like the phone but have a number of minor grievances with it and have had a few bugs.\n\nThe latest one I've found is that the charging sound is not working when connecting the wire. I double checked and I definitely have the option turned on. I toggled it on and off and still nothing.\n\nAnyone else experiencing this?\n\nI wouldn't mind so much if there was a charge indicator light but obviously there isn't...\n\nCheers",
