    "content": "I'm looking for a way to go back to android 9.0\nI installed android 10 a week ago, now any phone call crashes the OS and then spends 1-2 hours on relaunching screen.  The other apps work, but very slowly, and I just have to hope no-one calls! The headphone jack is no longer recognised so it will only ever play out loud too...\nI have tried factory reset, removing recent apps, and even Google says they would just replace the phone (except I can't afford 5-10 business days without one)\nI'd be grateful for any help!",
