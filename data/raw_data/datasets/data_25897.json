    "title": "While watching YouTube on wi-fi, pixel 3 froze, beeped, and shut down. Now it won't turn back on",
    "content": "As the title says, while watching YouTube, the phone froze and made a long beeped sound. I pushed home, the volume buttons, and power button to close the screen, But nothing was happening (except the beep). I held the power button down and the phone just went black. It won't turn back on.\n\nNote, I had just plugged the phone in to charge (it was at 30 something percent).\n\n1. I tried turning it back on...obviously\n2. Took the case off and held the power button for1 minute.\n3. Held power and volume up (and then down) for at least 1 minute.\n4. Charged 10 minutes uninterrupted and tried the 1 minute power button. (Also tried one hour and over night charging to no avail)\n5. Pressed the power button fast about 30 times. Also the volume buttons.\n6. Charged all night and tried power button and volume button series? Nothing has changed. It's just off.\n\nI only bought the phone this year 2019 in June (now November), So less than 6 months ago. What else should I try? I bought the phone straight from Google, not through a phone service.\n\nAny advice is appreciated and welcome!!",
