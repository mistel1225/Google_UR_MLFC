    "title": "Msg app freezes; blank screen on convos, not sending/receiving properly. Reset every half hour.",
    "content": "Since the v11 update, or thereabouts, my messages app freezes all the time. I get a blank screen when I click on a previous conversation, and I often can't even start a new one. Many texts aren't sending, and apparently I'm not receiving some too. I have cleared the cache and reset it regularly, which helps for a short time, but soon starts freezing again. This has been happening more and more.",
