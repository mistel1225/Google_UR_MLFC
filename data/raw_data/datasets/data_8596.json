    "content": "I just got my Pixel 4a last week and it won't connect to my earbuds (Edifier TWS1). It can discover them, just won't connect. I have no trouble connecting them to my laptop (Macbook Pro) or old phone (Samsung Galaxy S7), so they definitely still work, and the Bluetooth on my Pixel appears to be working because my CovidSafe app is active. I've tried turning the Bluetooth on and off and resetting my earbuds already.",
