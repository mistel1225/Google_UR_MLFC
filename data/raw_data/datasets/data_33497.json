    "content": "My Pixel 3 XL keeps having this notification pop up randomly throughout the day, even when I don't have anything connected. I charge my phone through the Pixel Stand. The only time I ever plug anything in the USB-C port is when I originally got the Pixel 3 XL. Anyone know why this is popping up? And how I can get it to go away. Other than this my phone is working just fine.",
