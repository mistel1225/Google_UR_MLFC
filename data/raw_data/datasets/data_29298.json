    "content": "Two days ago my phone pixel 3a (purchased 10 days ago) started having an infinite reboot upon startup issue. Basically, when power on, the phone shows the google logo and then restarts over and over again.\nI can go in recovery mode and have tried to reset it to factory settings, but the issue persisted. After searching online for my issue, I have found that many users are experiencing the same issue. Unfortunately, most of the solutions suggest a hardware failure. One thing to mention is that the battery can be charged.",
