    "title": "Why is battery draining so quickly on Pixel 2 XL after update to Android 10 (& Oct 2019 update)?",
    "content": "I have been following threads on the excessive battery draining issue after updating my Pixel 2 XL to Android 10 in early September 2019. My 2 XL worked great on Android 9 Pie for almost two years...battery started draining quickly immediately after update to Android 10. Google support rep gave me typical list of troubleshooting options like a factory reset, restarting in safe mode, etc. Having read that these ideas did not fix problem, I opted out of those \"fixes.\" Also, the October update has done nothing to address problem. If anything, battery life is worse now than when I originally updated to Android 10.\n\nOne of many examples: Charge phone to 100% overnight and after unplugging and not even using phone, I notice it has lost 1-2% battery. Then browsing Google support/community forums for about 10-15 minutes, phone battery drops another 5-7%. Crazy! And I hadn't downloaded any new apps or anything prior to issues updating to Android 10.\n\nGoogle, please acknowledge and fix this battery draining issue!!",
