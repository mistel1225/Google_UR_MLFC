    "content": "My phone screen cracked, I got Ubreakifix (Google's specified repair people) to fix the phone but now whenever anyone calls me and I answer on speakerphone they hear an intense feedback and can barely hear themselves speaking. The earpiece is vibrating so hard against the glass that I can barely hear music on my phone. Is there a better way of fixing this?",
