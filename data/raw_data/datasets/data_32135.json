    "content": "Ever since the latest update (today is 04/14/19), my phone is completely trashed. Photos and videos do not load. I cannot stream or cast. Bluetooth works only sporadically. I cannot preview anything. Websites either take forever to load or do not load at all. I cannot fill out forms as drop down lists no longer drop down. I cannot click certain links as my phone no longer responds to to taps or clicks.\nI am beyond angry at this point. This phone, that I spent a ridiculous amount of money on, is now useless.",
