    "content": "My pixel 2xl screen goes black out whenever screen times out or I turn off screen. It will never get back unit it decides to come back on it's own. When it comes on every thing works well.Usually, before I did factory data reset, my alarm sometimes, but not all the time, wakes the screen up. I have tried volume down and power button options several times when the screen goes out but to no avail. It will rather come on by itself. I don't know whether I bought the phone or it bought me. Now it's has been reset,  it responds to cable and charger plug( only soft plug in sound, no charging  display) in and vibrates when you try restart (power and volume button) but no LED lights. Hope I can get help here.",
