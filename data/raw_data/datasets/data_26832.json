    "content": "On the Pixel 4, I can't find a way to see my notification details on the lock screen.  It just shows the notification icons and I can't see the details unless I unlock the phone and pull down the notifications.  This is not as quick as just being able to turn the screen on to see the notification details. Was this an oversight? Or am I missing something?",
