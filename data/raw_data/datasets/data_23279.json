    "title": "My pixel mic and speaker doesn't work",
    "content": "My google pixel mic and speaker had stopped working since the security update on March 2019. Every application that uses either the mic or the speakers doesn't work. When I receive or make a call my phone crashes and I have to restart it. When I start recording a video, this message appears on the screen: \"can't record audio. Another app is using the mic\". I can't send audio messages with apps such as WhatsApp and I can't watch videos with apps like Instagram or Telegram.\nAfter the security update on April 2019, the speakers started working but after a few days they stopped again.\nI have performed factory reset twice, still no change.\nI would appreciate your help. I had to go back to my Nexus 4 to be able to at least make phone calls.",
