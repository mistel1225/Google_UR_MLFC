    "content": "I'm having issues with my virtual keyboard. Basically, the tap area for each and every key isn't wide enough. After a week of use, it now automatically changes certain common words to other words. For example, I can not type \"of\". When I do, it automatically changes it to \"if\", and I have to go back and change it half a dozen or so times before it will stay \"of\". Same with \"is\" it keeps changing it to\"us\". Basically, the Gboard key press area is not wide enough for my fat fingers. After a week or two it starts automatically changing correctly spelled words to my commonly misspelled variations. I've tried 'resseting' Gboard, so it will forget my horrible typing. Works for a couple days and then starts doing it all over. Any help or suggestions?",
