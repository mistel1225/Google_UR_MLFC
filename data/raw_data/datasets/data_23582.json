    "content": "Reminders have suddenly stopped working on my Pixel 2 XL. This has happened in the past and the fix was to allow notifications for Google in my notification settings but that didn't help this time. It seems the reminders I create on my phone are getting synced to my account because my Home shows my reminders but if they do not work on the phone they are useless.",
