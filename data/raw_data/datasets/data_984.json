    "content": "This morning I noticed that the microphone only seems to work for the first phone call. After the call has finished, the microphone stops working for either telephone calls, (video) conferencing or even google assistant.\nWhen I restart the phone, the first call is okay again.\n\nIs this a known issue with this update?",
