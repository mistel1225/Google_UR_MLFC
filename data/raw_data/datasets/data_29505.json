    "content": "I just got my Pixel 3a yesterday and got it setup to work with my Smart Home devices (thermostat, security camera, etc.)\n\nI have geofences setup so that certain events trigger when I leave home, such as changing the temperature and turning on the camera. \n\nEver since I got the new phone, the devices have been randomly triggering on and off during the night. I also have a mileage tracking app that said I drove 35km in 4 minutes.\n\nSomething on my phone is telling these apps I'm away from home, so I thought I'd check Google Maps - strange thing is, Google Maps is still showing me at home. \n\nHelp! This is getting really annoying. I was using an iPhone before and had none of these problems.",
