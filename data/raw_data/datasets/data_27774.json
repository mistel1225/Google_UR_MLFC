    "content": "Bought this Pixel XL off my friend. Great condition. Been using it for about a month now and all of a sudden, the phone will randomly freeze when I am using it, and then restart/reboot. It was doing that about once a day for a few days, and now it's happening 3-5 times a day. Any idea on what to do about this? I have tried booting it into Safe Mode. and it is still randomly freezing and restarting. Think I might have to do a factory reset.",
