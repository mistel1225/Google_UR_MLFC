    "content": "I'm having an issue where my Pixel 4 XL has a lot of static noise on the screen when trying to take a picture. The pictures themselves turn out fine, but live HDR may be causing an issue. \n\nI first set up the phone with a dummy account so I could show it off to my family and friends while I was preparing my previous phone for transfer. That was when I first noticed the issue, but after doing a factory reset and setting up with my main account the issue persists. All camera modes as well as video mode have the issue.\n\nI have tried connected and disconnected from service, with 90 Hz forced on and off, before and after updating, and with both resolutions. Am I the only one having this issue?",
