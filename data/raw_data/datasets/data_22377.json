Answer says symptoms point towards a hardware problem, but given the additional information from multiple users it does not seem to be a hardware problem.\n\nAfter an update this summer Camera won't start on Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL for some users. Sometimes it may start (just after reboot or if you hold phone upside down a few times while starting camera), then it will not focus. This only applies to main camera, and applies to any application attempting to use camera.\n\nThis is clearly not a hardware problem and it affects multiple users. And it came the same day as phone was updated. I assumed a fix would follow soon, but it did not.\n\nReboots, clear cache, uninstall and reinstall camera, resetting phone, etc has not helped.\n\nPlease acknowledge error and give feedback on plans forward.",
