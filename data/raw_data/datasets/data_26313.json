    "content": "After android 10 update I am no longer able to see WhatsApp dialogues when receiving phone calls or video calls. I have WhatsApp notifications switched off under Settings| apps & notifications because I want to see the WhatsApp dialogue when I receive a call and not the WhatsApp header system dialogue. You still work fine with android 9. Many thanks.",
