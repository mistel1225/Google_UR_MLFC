    "content": "The bottom part like 2/5th of the screen just stops working properly or at all. When I restart my phone everything is fine for about an hour. Then it just starts misbehaving again. I really can't do anything with my phone at that point except restarting. Is there a solution or will I have to do a total factory reset?",
