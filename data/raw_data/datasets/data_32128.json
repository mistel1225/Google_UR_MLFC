    "content": "I am trying to record video in 60fps for 1080p and I am forced to select an option that switches between 30fps through 60fps. The priority is set on lighting.\n\nI would like to have a manual toggle for 30/60/Auto FPS please.\nI know the phone can do 120fps at 1080p, so I don't see why this option doesn't exist. \n\nThank you.",
