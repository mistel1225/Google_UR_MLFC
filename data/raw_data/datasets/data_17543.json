    "content": "The screen of my pixel 4 xl will randomly stop responding to touch,  like the phone is frozen, no response to touch at all anywhere on the screen. I have to tap the power key to turn off the screen and then turn it back right on. This will bring the screen back responding to touch but it's super annoying. Is that a known issue with pixel 4/4 xl, or just my device?  Looking for a permanent fox to this issue.",
