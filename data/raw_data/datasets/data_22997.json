    "content": "Hello everyone, \n\nI am facing a couple of issues with my pixel 3a device. \n\nFirst, even after I close an app running in the background, they are shown as if they are still running. But when I click on the app, I receive a message stating \"app isn't available\".\n\nSecondly, when I receive a call in WhatsApp I receive two answering options at the same time (one being as if when I have WhatsApp open and the other being when I am in the home screen) when this happens, no matter how many times I answer the call; the call will not connect. I have to reject the call and call them back again.\n\nI would like to know if is it just me facing this issue or anyone else has faced this issue if so could you please help me with it?\n\nThank you in advance :-)",
