    "content": "I use the favorites screen in the phone app to make many of my calls. Is there a way to automatically close the phone app completely (Show home screen) after hanging up with someone? The problem I have is if I make a call to a favorite which only takes one press and then end that call, the favorites screen is now front and center again and one press anywhere on the screen and I'm calling another favorite. I have to hit the home button etc to close that phone app or I'm making accidental calls all day. Any settings that might help with that? Thanks!",
