    "content": "I've a pixel 4 and did the huge mistake to download Android 12. Now my phone is unusable. How long will it take to fix this. \nIf it takes until August I'll have to switch to another device.. kinda mad.. was expecting couple bugs. But this is ridiculous.. all apps are crashing after 2sec. \nOnly chrome web is working somewhat... \nMails.. can't access\nInstagram can't access\nReddit can't access... \nI'm a Social media manager.. my life is over",
