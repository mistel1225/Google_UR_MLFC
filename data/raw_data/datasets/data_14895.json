    "content": "Hi everyone. So I updated my wife's phone and she immediately let me know that her usb c earbuds that were supplied with her Pixel 3 XL stopped working after the update. I also have the same phone and getting the same error, both have the new Oct 2020 update. Everytime we plug in the headsets, we're getting the Analog Audio device detected error and no sound from them. She's never had this issue before, only happened right after the update. I never use those earbuds so I never tried it. \n\nAnyone else can confirm if they get the same error and if there's any fix for it. Guessing this is something new so doubt that there's a fix yet but if there's any workaround, that'd be great. My wife is not so happy I broke her phone lol.",
