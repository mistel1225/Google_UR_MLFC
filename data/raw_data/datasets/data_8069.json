    "content": "My Google Pixel 5 will randomly drop calls (even to my voicemail) and tell me 'server unreachable' after it hangs up.  Originally when I got the Pixel 5 at launch I would answer the phone calls and not be able to hear anything (nor they hear me) but now it's escalated to just dropping the calls randomly. I would say I'm loosing 80% or more of my calls.",
