    "title": "Pixel 5 - How to get links to recognize installed web browsers",
    "content": "I just got a new Pixel 5 and was able to transfer (most) of my data from my Nexus 5X. I have multiple browsers installed (DuckDuckGo, Photon, Opera) but when I click on a web link in an app or in the Google News feed, the only options are Photon or Chrome. The other 2 browsers don't show on the \"open with\" list. \n\nIf I make Opera the default, then the only 2 on the list are Photon and Opera. On my Nexus 5X clicking on a link will bring up all my browsers to choose from putting the most recently used browser at the top but that doesn't seem to be the behavior now. Is this broken or is this the way the Pixel 5 works?",
