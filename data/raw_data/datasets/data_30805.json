    "content": "Why the usb-c audio adapter that comes with my google pixel 2xl is too big for any headphone cable? Any regular headphone cable i tried seem small and fit loose on the adapter. Is this not a standard 3.5mm? Do I need to purchase another google usb-c audio adapter?\nI recently bought bose soundsport ear-in headphone for Android, but again it did not fit. Itâ€™s loose that it falls off of the adapter and the sound is not transferring to the earbuds (definitely not connecting). \nMy new headphone though fits and works with my apple ipad, but of course unable to control volume.\nHow can I use my headphone with my google pixel?\nPlease advise, thanks!",
