    "title": "Google Messages RCS Duplicate Image Glitch",
    "content": "Encountered a very annoying bug with Google Messages that can be easily replicated. It only occurs in RCS enabled conversations; SMS/MMS conversations are not affected. \n\nIf you either clear Google Messages data, or restore a conversation from backup, you will invariably find that any photo you were sent has been duplicated. The duplicate appears as a low resolution, pixelated version of the original, almost akin to a thumbnail, and cannot be individually deleted. \n\nI'm using a Pixel 3a on Android 11. Another user encountered this issue using a Pixel 4 XL on Android 10. To say this bug is ridiculous would be an understatement. Has anyone else experienced it and, more importantly, does anyone have a solution? I've attached a sample screenshot.",
