    "content": "This Pixel 4a 5G is advertised to have support for HDR playback on Netflix as is stated on the Website and specifications, but why is Widevine L3 only and not L1? I have read that more users have this same issue so where is the fix for it? I have contacted Netflix support, uninstalled the app and reinstalled again, device firmware is up to date and everything is stock as out of the box so how come is here no support for even an HD playback, let alone HDR as mentioned?",
