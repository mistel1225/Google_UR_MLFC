    "content": "When my google pixel 3a XL is completely powered off and I press the power button (not a long press) there is a line that goes from the left side to the right side and it only appears for a split second then disappears until I do it again. It will appear anywhere on the screen but it always goes from the left side to the right side. I have not damaged the phone in anyway possible and have no clue what has happened can someone please help me!!!",
