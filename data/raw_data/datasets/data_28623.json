    "content": "My phone started to turn off by itself and not turning on for a few minutes when I am turning the screen on and off a lot (ie, when messaging someone). It then would not charge properly on any cable or base. I tried to put it in safe mode and it starts charging normally. In any other mode it charges 2% and hour(says \"charging slowly\") I uninstalled recent apps and it did not fix the problem. I tried factory reset and it did not fix the problem. I can only charge in safe mode and it still shuts off. Anyone that can help with this problem?",
