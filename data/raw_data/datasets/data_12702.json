    "title": "Chat Bubbles not working on Pixel 3 XL",
    "content": "I upgraded to Android 11 last month and the new chat bubbles feature didn't work with the google messages app after the update. I was hopeful that it would be fixed with the October update, but it still doesn't work. I have chat bubbles enabled for the app and set to allow all conversations to bubble. I have cleared the cache on the app and app launcher and restarted my phone already. I'm not using a third party launcher either. I was really looking forward to this feature and I'm very disappointed it doesn't work since one of the big selling points for getting the Pixel phones is to have the best Android experience and get the newest features first.",
