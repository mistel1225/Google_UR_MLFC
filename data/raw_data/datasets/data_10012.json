    "content": "I couldn't figure out how to allow my Pixel 4a 5G to transfer files from my pc. Every time I tried it came up with an error. However, I solved this problem after much searching - the issue is that Google has file transfer via usb turned off by default. Why they do this is anyone's guess, but it was a pain in the ass to figure out so I'm posting this here to let others know how I fixed it. You have to go into Settings, type USB Preferences, and then plug your device in and click \"File Transfer / Android Auto.\" That will do it - if you need to see it, this site has a demonstration: https://deviceguides.vodafone.co.uk/google/pixel-4a-5g-android-11-0/connectivity/transfer-files-between-computer-and-phone/",
