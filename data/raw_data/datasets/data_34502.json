    "title": "Several sound issues",
    "content": "The main issue is that the sound for phone conversations is lost periodically. Most of the times it still works on speaker, but sometimes it doesn't. When this happens I also lose the sound in the wired headphones (the phone ignores them and plays the sound in the speaker). Sometimes the phone app hangs and crashes and sometimes the phone shuts down by itself. I don't know if the issues are related.\n\nI tried the following (without better results):\n- changed phone (returned and got new ones, identical behaviour in three phones)\n- changed SIM card\n- phones were updated to latest OS and security patch\n- factory reset\n- restarted and used in safe mode\n\nAny suggestions are highly appreciated.",
