    "content": "If my phone is sitting on my desk or on my phone stand, I can't swipe up or reply to a text without picking up my phone. A lot of times, I'm doing something else with my phone when I'm trying to reply to a text. If I put a finger on the side it seems to work but I wasn't sure if there was some setting I could change.",
