    "title": "Pixel 3 wont turn on unless plugged into computer",
    "content": "The device won't turn on or stay on unless plugged into a computer.\nI tried factory resetting to no avail.\nWhen plugged in the computer doesn't see any device nor does the device charge or indicate at all being plugged in making flashing factory images impossible.\nI tried contacting support and they said to take it to UBreakIFix, which I did, but in order to get it fixed they must also replace the entire back of  the phone because of a small crack. Apparently Google has an agreement with them that they have to replace that stuff in order to even look at the device. The whole reason I didn't replace the back previously is a lack of funds on my part to afford that, especially with the possibility of a bad motherboard or battery.\nI don't think I missed any steps in troubleshooting, but the fact that Google requires UBreakIFix to replace the whole back is ridiculous and makes me being able to afford that very unlikely.\nAt this point I have no phone and I'm not sure what to do. Any help is appreciated.",
