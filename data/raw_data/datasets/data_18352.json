    "title": "How can I escalate an issue?",
    "content": "I've had several conversations with support regarding trying to get my Pixel 4XL repaired, but all of the discussions have ended with false promises (saying I'd receive an email and never getting it), or being ghosted. I'm just trying to send in my phone to get it repaired - I don't care about the price of the repair or anything else, but I do need them to deliver the shipping supplies. I already have a request open but it's been several weeks with no updates.\n\nHow can I escalate this issue so I can send in my phone to get it repaired? This back and forth has gone on for over two weeks now, and after being ghosted by the last support person, I figured the best next step would be to escalate the issue. Does anyone know how I can do this?\n\nThanks in advance",
