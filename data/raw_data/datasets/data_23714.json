    "content": "I have tried rebooting in safe mode and cleared the camera app cache but the problem still exist.\nThe camera will sometimes keep clicking and refocusing when trying to take a photo. Regardless, one side of the photo will become very blurred, on landscape orientation it will either be the left or right edge, top or bottom edge on portrait. \nI have requested for callback support everyday since 2 days ago but nobody has called me at all.",
