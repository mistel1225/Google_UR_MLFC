    "content": "After hard resetting the device and starting again from scratch, my Pixel 3 XL won't display the album art for alot of my music. As I doesn't have a microSD memory card slot, I couldn't just use my MP3s from the memory card I was using (without fault) in my old Lumia 950. What's the best way of loading MP3s onto the Pixel 3 range? I really hope the next Pixel has a microSD memory card slot, it makes things so much easier.",
