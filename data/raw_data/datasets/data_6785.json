    "content": "For the past few days Google Assistant on my Pixel 3 suddenly started announcing \"Alright but first you'll have to unlock your device\" when I try to initiate a call by activating google assistant from my Plantronics 5200 Bluetooth Headset. Obviously google has F#$!'d something up as I haven't changed any settings. \n\nLast month I experience the same problem trying to send text messages in the same way for about a week before it was fixed. \n\nGetting sick and tired of Google screwing up basic phone functionality! How does one make Google aware of issues like this so they can be fixed?",
