    "content": "I just got my new pixal 4a phone.  During the porting of information I placed the sims card and rebooted the phone. It didn't recognize the sims was in there.  The tray will not reopen.  I took the phone to Best Buy to see if they could open it.  The guy tried for nearly 30 minutes.  I purchased the phone through Google. Now I'm sorry.  Customer Support isn't open thanks to COVID.  I am not sure of my options.  I currently do not have a phone at all now.  I purchased the extra warranty, and guess I'm going to box up the phone, and return it to google. Does anyone have any suggestions before I do that?\nthanks!",
