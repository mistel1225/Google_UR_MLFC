    "content": "I upgraded to android 11 about 3 weeks ago and got another update on Oct 3rd which had some security fixes. Since around then (could have started a day before ) my phone has been losing battery alot faster than usual and I haven't installed any new apps. It also starts to get really hot when I use bluetooth and it never used too. Any ideas on what could be causing the battery to deplete quicker and my lhk E to heat up all of a sudden ?",
