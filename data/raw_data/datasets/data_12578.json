    "title": "I want to turn off Accessibility mode, but I can't scroll to settings. How do I get past this?",
    "content": "I have tried the swipe up and right, swipe down and right multiple times; most of the time the phone doesn't respond at all, when I was able to access the Talkback settings... there is no option to turn off Talkback. I am told to go to the Settings app... which is now completely inaccessible since I cannot scroll the apps installed on the phone, or search them, or bring one up with voice commands, or access them as an emergency option in case, oh, I dunno, I activated the mode by accident.\n\nVent: This may be the most poorly implemented accessibility feature I've ever seen, after 20 years of working in SV. Why on Earth would it be possible to open an alternate UX that is completely alien to 99% of users, and not have a means to back out of it?",
