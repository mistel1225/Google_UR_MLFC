    "content": "I am currently on my 2nd Pixel 5 and the third is on the way. The first two have had gaps between the screen and the body. Not huge gaps, but enough for my fingernail to get in and dust/debris to be stuck in. From reading all the posts, this is a widespread issue and google are not currently offering any fixes. Should I just refund and get a different phone?",
