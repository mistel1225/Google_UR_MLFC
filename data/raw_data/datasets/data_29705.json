    "content": "My Pixel Buds no longer play audio.\nThey pair fine to all devices, Pixel 3a, LG G6, iPhone 6 and Surface Pro 3 laptop. \nI can still turn them on/off, volume up/down and play/pause using gestures, just no audio. \nI don't even get the standard sound that they've turned on/off. \n\nI've reset them numerous times (hold 40 Seconds). Re-paired them to the phones again and again. \n\nThis started a few days ago (I've only had them for a week), where the sound cut out. But after placing the headphones back into the charging case for a few minutes they seemed to work again. \n\nAny ideas on how to fix his? .",
