    "content": "I have been using Pixel 4a since 2 months now. I think the battery performance is a let down. I have restricted all my apps to use battery in the background. During the night when I turn off my internet, screen brightness etc. the battery still drains to 13-16% in the morning. Not sure what is eating up my battery during the night also. If I use my phone for 1 minute (may be less than that) continuously, 1-2% of battery drains.\n\nI have restricted all my apps in the background\nI have the latest Android software\nI reboot my phone once everyday\n\nAny other suggestions are most welcome. Thanks.",
