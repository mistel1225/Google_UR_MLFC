    "content": "Pixel VoLTE and 5G support 0 replies\n  Please stay abreast of the technological advancement of the times. Unfortunately, I have supported Google phones for nearly ten years since Nexus One, but unfortunately, I found that the new Pixel 5 encountered great inconvenience and obstacles.  I usually travel on business. Why are all Pixel phones still not allowed to enable VOLTE or even 5G in other areas where the service is provided?  This is as frustrating and unacceptable!  Imagine if the 3G network is shut down, how can I make voice calls in countries other than my hometown (especially Hong Kong)?  In order to solve this problem, I hope that Google guarantees to provide OTA patches to allow the use of VOLTE and 5G in other countries or regions (at least within the expected time frame).\n  I look forward to your letter to solve the problem as soon as possible\n  detail\n  Connectivity, network, Bluetooth, Google Pixel 5\n  Like (1)",
