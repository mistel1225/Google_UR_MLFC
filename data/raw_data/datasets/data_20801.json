    "title": "Problem viewing Pixel 3A thumbnails in Windows 10 Explorer",
    "content": "When I use Windows 10 File Explorer to transfer files from my Pixel 3A to fully patched PC I can see thumbnails for all photos taken on or before 16th March 2020. However, photos taken from 21st March onwards have no thumbnails. I have a strong suspicion that a phone software update during this time has created the problem and note that on other threads Google reps are suggesting a work around using cloud storage. I find myself wondering if this problem is a bug or a deliberate attempt to force customers into using cloud services.",
