    "content": "I have a Google Pixel 3. I keep getting the \"running out of space\" then \"memory is full\" errors. I've gone through the phone, first using the File Cleaning app & cleared everything out, but that didn't change anything. I deleted all of my photos, music, documents, and leftover files from deleted apps - no change. I've cleared the cache of every app, emptied the trash folder in photos, restarted my phone - no change. It's at 94% full right now but was at 100% until I deleted a few photos. \n\nIt looks like system apps are taking up most of the space but 43GB - I have a 64GB phone. This is becoming very frustrating because now I have no photos, no games, no apps and can't use the phone in the way I should be able to use it. If I wanted to just be able to text, call & surf the internet I would have purchased a much cheaper phone. I chose Google because I very much appreciate the lack of bloatware.\n\nYou can see by my photo that Other Apps is taking up the most space. However those are 90% Google apps (maps, drive, chrome, One, etc) and then my banking apps which I have to have. There are several unidentifiable apps that I don't know what they are and if they are needed. Since Google pops warnings that warn you strenuously against deleting any native app, I'm afraid to delete them. (Device Health, Android System Webview, etc) \n\nI need to know how to fix this. And please, if the person named \"Penelooe\" who is described as a \"Google Expert\" is going to respond, please pass my request on to someone else. Her responses are never helpful. \n\nThank you!",
