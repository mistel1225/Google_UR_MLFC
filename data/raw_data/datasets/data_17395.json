    "content": "Hello,\n\nMy pixel 1 has been stuck in a boot loop after a factory reset. After the factory reset, I can set up the phone normally. Then somehow, the phone reset itself and boot loop with Google loading screen.\n\nSometimes I can load pass the Google booting screen, and go into the home screen for a few seconds then the phone reset itself again and repeating. \n\nWhat I noticed is that the battery percent is jumping every time it resets. For example, the phone was at 79%, after it resets itself to 63%, then the phone reset with battery back to 72%, then 76%\n\nI wonder if it is the battery problem or something more serious.\n\nThank You.",
