    "content": "I see many people recently posting with the same bluetooth connectivity issues after updating to Android 11. Some of my BT devices won't connect anymore, or they won't stay connected, or they flap connecting/ disconnecting. This is a MAJOR issue and needs to be fixed ASAP. I had ZERO issues with bluetooth while on 10. Updating to 11 was the only cause. I'm not resetting my phone. That's not a fix according to everyone else. Safe mode makes no difference. Fix the bluetooth issues NOW or tell me and everyone else what we need to do to fix our phone's bluetooth!",
