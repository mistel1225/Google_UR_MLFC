    "content": "Hello,\n\nI would like to customize my ringtone with an MP3 file. I have moved the file to the \"Ringtones\" folder but it has not come up as an option when I try to change my ringtone. Only the default are present.\n\nI have restarted the phone after doing this, and still no option.\n\nI've seen many posts about this and they say to put the file in the \"Ringtones\" folder, which I have done through a file manager... but still I can't see my music files appear as an option to set as a ringtone.\n\nAre my files hidden? How do I fix this?",
