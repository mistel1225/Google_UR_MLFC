    "content": "Recently in the Clock app, when using the timer, the alarm does not sound and the countdown goes negative. I was using my Pixel 3 timer for baking and when I checked how much time was left, it said -2:00. As in it went 2 minutes PAST my timer without a notification or sound. The timer was functioning properly a couple weeks ago.",
