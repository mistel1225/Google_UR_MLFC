    "content": "Trying to get rid of pointless home screen date and temperature as well as pointless Google search bar which take up 2/7th's of the home screen. Have attempted removing (but not possible) and performed Google searches. I deal with about four meetings a day and manage a minimum of 40 projects at a time; I think I know the date. When I'm checking the temperature, it's for tomorrow, which is multiple selections regardless of you telling me the temperature now. I can see outside! If I want to find something on Google, why can't I hit a single icon and that expands the keypad and text box; why does that have to take up a whole row of the home screen?\nOn a minor note, when I chose the option for home screen and launcher on this page, only one option shows and you have to scroll and then it expands; if I had built any of these functions, I would be embarrassed.\nRight now I have 27 days left with trialling this device and my instinct is to return it and go back to my previous manufacturer.",
