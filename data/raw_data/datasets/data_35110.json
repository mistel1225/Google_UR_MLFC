    "content": "Hi guys, \n\nI had a problem with my pixel 2 having rapid battery drain. I was having to charge the device multiple times just to make it through a day of general use when I used to be able to last on a single charge. Oh I also had radom reboots with decent battery.\n\nAnyway I sent me to phone away via EE to get repaired under warranty. The report came back that basically they couldn't see the battery drain but the device was overheating so that may be causing the issue. I'm unsure which parts where changed and which weren't as they wouldn't tell me this. \n\nI got the phone back yesterday and, as a test, thought I'd run the \"safe mode overnight\" and see what happened. It was charged to 87% at 12:52 am and not touched throught the night. \n\nI woke up this morning at 10:05am so just over 9 hours and was sitting at 60%. This seems a lot of power for the device to have dropped literally doing nothing. I'm worried the fault still exists. \n\nAs I write this I've already dropped a few %. I'll see how my use goes today but I think it needs to go back :(",
