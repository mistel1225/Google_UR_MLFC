    "content": "Dot point description:\n\n- Pixel 4a, less than 2 months old\n\n- Failed to charge one morning despite charging fine previous night and having only sat on my desk since.\n\n- I use the cable and  charger that came with the device\n\n- Liquid or Debris warning showed up\n\n- NO dust or liquid present upon examination of the port and cable\n\n- Charged fine with a different cable from another pixel owner in the family\n\n- Same issue later with the second cable\n\n- Issue persisted since, regardless of if a cable is plugged in the message keeps appearing, followed by a notification that the port is OK to use, then back to the liquid and debris warning again every few minutes.\n\n- Issue persisted after both software update and booting into safe mode\n\n- Inspected by local phone repair shop who also stated they could see no issue, they briefly cleaned the port just to be sure\n\n- No change in behaviour since, message is still repeating\n\nThank you in advance for your help!",
