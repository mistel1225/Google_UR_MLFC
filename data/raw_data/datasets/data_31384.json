    "content": "So my phone connects to my truck just fine. I can make calls and listen to music. Now if I open an app like Instagram or Snapchat. It will not play the audio from the videos, etc. But will still play the music from Spotify. I tried disconnecting and reconnecting the Bluetooth, etc. Same issue still persists, I did not have this problem with my last phone.  If there is a solution please let me know, thank you.",
