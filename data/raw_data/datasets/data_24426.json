    "content": "Hi! I'm having a serious problem with my pixel 3's network connection.\nI bought my pixel 3 unlocked on amazon.jp while living in Japan for a year (july 2018-june 2019), and was connected through the company \"Mobal\" with a SIM-card that worked on a SoftBank network. The subscription has been terminated and was always possible to terminate immediately. However, I have now bought a new SIM-card in my home country (Sweden) and when inserting it I get a message saying: \"SIM card isn't supported. Ask SoftBank whether this device can be unlocked\". But when I contacted SoftBank they told me: \n\n\"Please find our policy of unlocking the handset.\nYou can have your handset unlocked only if:\n\n1)You are currently the subscriber of the mobile number.\n2)You were ex-subscriber, but the subscription has been \nterminated within 90 days.\n3)The handset should be purchased through Softbank shops\nor Softbank online shops by yourself.\n\nSince you don't meet the conditions, you cannot have your\nhandset unlocked by us.\"\n\nSo they are apparently not able to find any indication that my phone was connected through their network, since I was a subscriber through another company. \n\nDoes anyone have any idea about how to solve this this problem? Has anyone else experienced this kind of problem?? It's super frustrating!",
