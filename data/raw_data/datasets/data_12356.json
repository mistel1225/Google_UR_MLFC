    "content": "For 3+ years, my Google Pixel 2 XL phone camera has worked flawlessly.  Phone is still in excellent shape, no dropping, errors, scratches.  It's in prime condition.   All of the sudden when I tried to take a picture yesterday, the camera app started, did not show a camera image, and then terminated.  I followed all of the cache and storage clearing steps, turned of the phone, tried in safe mode to rule out any new apps (which I haven't added anyway), and got nowhere.  Also followed final recommendation to factory reset.  Same problem,  camera stopped working.  I put the phone in developer mode and connected to my Windows PC Android Studio to watch Logcat.  Although the app does not display an error, Logcat shows:  \"mbd: Camera 0 encountered a fatal error while opening: Camera encountered a fatal error (4)\".  I believe my camera hardware arbitrarily decided to stop working spontaneously.  What do I do now?  Nothing I'm guessing?",
