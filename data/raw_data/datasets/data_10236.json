    "content": "Android Alarm does not work at all. No sounds. It is not hardware - I can play the alarm sound manually just fine. Don't waste time with the \"uninstall updates\" advice, it does not work. I just installed another alarm app from the play store and it works perfectly.\n\nLook at the community posts. Google broke the alarm a long time ago and has not fixed it, which is just another example of their disregard for quality and customer service.\n\nIf anyone at Google has  real answer, let's hear it.",
