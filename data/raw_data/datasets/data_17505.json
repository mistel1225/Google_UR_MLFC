    "content": "Did some checks and notice there's only 1 authorised ( non Google owned) shop in Singapore available to get our pixel serviced. Is there any plans to get this to at least 2 stores?\n\nI pose this question as i have doubts in getting a Pixel just in case there wont be any official/authorised store in the future (in case the first store goes bust). And... knowing not many ppl use Pixel im afraid getting the phone serviced at random stores will make matters worse. Since they dont have any experience working with this phone.",
