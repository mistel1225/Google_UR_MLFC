    "content": "I have a Pixel 4XL, a Pixel Stand, and a recently purchased Mophie charge pad all purchased from the Google Store.  I also have a Pixel 4XL case that I purchased from the Google store.  When my phone is in the case, it will only sporadically wirelessly charge on the stand or the mophie.  If I take it out of the case, it works better but isn't consistent.  Is this the intended result or might something be wrong with my phone or case?",
