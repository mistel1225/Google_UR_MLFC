    "title": "Normal operation on my pixel 3 XL is continually getting interrupted for performance enhancements.",
    "content": "I have some sort of app running that is constantly posting a full screen ad and then after dismissing it, it shows some sort of performance enhancement being done(network, battery, performance, etc).  Very annoying and happens during calls as well. I'm not aware of any app I added that does this.  Is this a built-in system app?  Any idea where/how to find and control this behavior?",
