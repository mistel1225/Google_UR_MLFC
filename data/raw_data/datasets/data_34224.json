    "content": "My wife's Pixel 2 crashed tonight. It entered a black screen wherein the options are start, recovery mode, barcodes, and power off. The phone can't enter recovery mode when we try because it shows the device status as locked and flashes the error that it is unable to load the boot slot. I can't do anything else from the device since the device can't use the start option either. If I can't fix this, the phone is a brick. Is there any way to change the boot slot to enable the entrance to recovery mode?",
