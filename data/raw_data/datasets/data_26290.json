    "title": "Pixel 2 LTE Issues - no LTE on particular carrier",
    "content": "Good day all, posting from the Caribbean. My Pixel 2 was only getting H+ on my home network (Digicel) but was able to get LTE on another local network (Bmobile). Before anyone suggests it, switching networks is out of the question.\nI saw a previous post that suggested that this issue was happening elsewhere, especially in Latin America.\nDoes anyone know if any progress has been made with this issue? Or what channels one can go through to find out?\nNote: I no longer have the Pixel 2, but I want to go back to Pixel.\nThanks in advance.",
