    "title": "SMS taking long time to send, Pixel 3",
    "content": "Been having issue for last couple of days sending SMS, just hangs on \"sending...\" For around a minute, will usually eventually send but occasionally will fail. If I get sent an SMS I receive it instantly, it's just the sending which is massively delayed. O have asked my carrier and they say there are no problems on the network. I'm using Google Messages but I have tried other SMS apps and the same thing happens, I've also tried clearing the cache and restarting the phone and turning off RCS but nothing solves it so far.",
