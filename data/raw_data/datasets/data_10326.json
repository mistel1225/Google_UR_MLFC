    "content": "My pixel 3 xl, after Android 11 update, it shows 2 major symptoms that are critical.\n\n1) Everytime when I go to work and return, the devices reboots 3 times on each trip.\na. when I arrive at the station, b. when train arrives, c. when I leave the train.\nI keep my wifi off and uses my mobile data but this is not a resolution to the issue.\n\n2) When I am driving and connects the device through bluetooth, it makes random calls.\nI drive with my bluetooth off cuz I am afraid this might call people that I am uncomfortable with.\n\nSeriously, also somehow the phone does not let me enable OEM unlock so cannot even downgrade to android 10.\n\nGoogle must be shame with this issue because this is unheard of situation.\nAll my colleagues and friends mock me for buying google phone while they have samsung and iphone.\n\nAccording to the communities, the problem deemed to been existing since early October but somehow Google is not doing anything.\nI am seriously switching over to other brand if this is not solved by end of this year.",
