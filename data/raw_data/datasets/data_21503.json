    "content": "Hello Community\n\n3 days ago I was using a navigation app in the car. Then the bottom speaker started sounding strange and then the speaker completely stopped functioning. Since then the phone does not ring anymore, video chats are not possible and several other things are not working properly because the sound does not work.\nI of course tried already a lot of different steps to solve the issue but it seems to be a hardware problem.\n\nI bought the phone in a Media Markt 4th of January 2020 in Germany. I got in contact with them via phone because I live and work in Ethiopia. The Media Markt service said I need to get in contact with Google directly and gave me the following number 0800 7235105. The phone service is not working because of Corona and I am unable to get directly in contact (i am always linked back to the Help Page when I want to get in direct contact).\nHow can I solve the issue?\nThank you for your support...",
