    "content": "Inconsistent icons not following system theme for System Settings on dark theme. I have tried restarting the phone when applying each icon set and theme. I have also tried restoring to factory default.\n\nThe only icon set that showed consistency for Pixel 3 XL running on Android 11 was the default icon set that has thicker borders.\n\nThe same issue pervades on the pre-configured themes.\n\nThe first image shows the icon set that showed consistent icons while the three icon set boxed in red did not.\nThe second and third image shows the difference when using light theme and dark theme.",
