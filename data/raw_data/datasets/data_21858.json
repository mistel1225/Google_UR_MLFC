    "title": "Why is the WiFi connection on my 3a so unstable?",
    "content": "For the past 2 months, the WiFi on my pixel 3a has been very unstable to the point where I have to use my data.\n\nIt intermittently cuts for a moment and then reconnects. However, when it does reconnect (as displayed by the WiFi icon) none of my apps are working as if they are connected to the Internet. I have to then manually turn the WiFi on my phone off and then on. After this do my apps respond to the reconnection. \n\nIssue is experienced at home and work.\n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated.",
