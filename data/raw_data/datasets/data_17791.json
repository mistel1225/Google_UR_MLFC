    "content": "On my second factory refurbished warranty replacement Pixel 3 and all three phones (2 replacements and my original phone) have an issue with playback. \n\nBasic troubleshooting has been performed, safe mode, full factory reset, reset with backup, and reset with build from scratch. The problem shows up intermittently and only impacts video playback and no other function. Issue is horizontal lines, generally on the left side of the screen, with blocks of solid green, eventually video will freeze and audio continues to play. If I wait long enough I get a video playback error.\n\nExamples here:\nExample 1\nExample 2\nInfrequent behavior\n\nAny ideas?",
