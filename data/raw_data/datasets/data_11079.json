    "content": "Using a Pixel 4a. I have connected a headset with a mic and trying to make calls. The earphones work fine, but not able to transmit audio. I tried recording to test, I only hear a \"woosh\" kind of sound and then the mic works no more. Happens anywhere I try to use the microphone with the headset. The headset and microphone works well with other devices.",
