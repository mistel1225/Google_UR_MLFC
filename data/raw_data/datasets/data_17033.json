    "content": "My Pixel 2xl had a system update 2 weeks ago. Since that update my Pixel Buds (the original ones with the string) will not stay connected. I have to resync them each time and they only stay connected for a few minutes. \n\nAdditional, my Samsung gear2 seems to be drain battery when connected to the Pixel 2XL. I did not have these issues before the last update.\n\nAny help would be great",
