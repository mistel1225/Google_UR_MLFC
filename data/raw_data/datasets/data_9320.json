    "content": "Hello all,\n\nMy 2XL has performed flawlessly until this past week. It is now crashing and turning off throughout the day, but only when the screen is off. Sometimes it is able to sit idle, and others it powers off the second the screen also turns off. The battery level does not seem to be a factor as it has happened minutes off the charger at 100% and when below 20%. The phone was pre-ordered so it is 3 years old, the battery was replaced last November through Ubreakifix so it's only a year old.\n\nGoogle support suggested safe moe, however that did not fix the issue.\n\nAs for the odd charging and battery statistics. Until today, when the phone would power off, it would not turn on unless charging, but that is no longer the case. When plugged in, it would initially quickly cycle between red, green, white charging icons before turning off with no led light. My battery statistics are saying that it has been 65 days since being at 100% but that's not true as I charged to full last night. The battery also seems to be draining abnormally fast despite no apps reporting high usage.\n\nI intend to do a factory reset this weekend as I have run out of options. I found two users on the forum that described a similar issue but neither had helpful replies as one was under warranty and one was on beta.\n\nThank you for any and all help. My 2XL has been incredible and I was hoping to have a few more months with it.",
