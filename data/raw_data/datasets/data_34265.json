    "content": "Starting Thursday 02/14 after 6:30pm EST I can't hear the caller on any phone calls, when I make a call or when I receive one. I tried to remove Bluetooth, add Bluetooth, tried speaker call and none work. I can't hear anything, tried this with other phone calling apps as well same issue.  I did restart, check for update, start and stop the app, cleared cache.. nothing worked.  Any suggestions?",
