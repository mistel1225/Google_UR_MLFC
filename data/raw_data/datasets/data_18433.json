    "title": "Pixel 3 has rapid battery drain after June update",
    "content": "My battery will not hold a charge after the June 5 update. My phone plummets from 70-80% to zero within seconds. If I can limit use and keep it to around 50%, I'll suddenly (and randomly) get the 15% battery saver notice and then the phone counts down to zero and immediately dies. I have not changed usage, all apps are up to date. I'm one month outside of warranty and getting zero support from Google on this. I'll try a factory reset this weekend, but I'm really frustrated right now. ",
