    "content": "I returned my pixel 2 for a 3a and just received an email stating I will only get a $20 refund because the pixel 2 didn't turn on\n There were cracks on the back of the phone but it was working perfectly fine. I'm very disappointed at not receiving a full refund and have found it difficult to reach customer support to speak with someone regarding this.",
