    "title": "Disable 'Enable Voice Match' prompt permanently",
    "content": "I want to disable the pop-up screen which asks me to enable voice match. I have two Google Home devices and I got sick and tired of my device unlocking every time I wanted to turn on my lights. My solution? Turn off Voice Match and turn off 'Okay Google' on my Pixel.\n\nTo my demise, no matter where I'm at on my phone, the words \"Hey Google\" will bring up the enable voice match prompt. Why doesn't this remember my selection? Does Google think I am stupid for saying no? This is completely ridiculous why I can't say no to a feature I absolutely do not want. \n\nEven when I've completely disabled Google Assistant on my phone it still listens to those keywords. I know that the experts will say it should only be listening in the Google App or on the home screen but this is NOT the case. It is listening all the time and it's driving me crazy that my phone has this annoying pop-up every time I say the words (to control home devices).\n\nI still use voice search as an accessibility feature so disabling the voice permission is absolutely not a valid solution.  \n\nWill this/can this be fixed? Just give us a 'remember this option'.",
