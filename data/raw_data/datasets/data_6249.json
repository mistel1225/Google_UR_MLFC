    "content": "My work is using WEAP with PEAP & MSCHAPV2. My credentials (Identity and Password) are correct.\n\nInitially, over 6 years, I was able to connect just fine using the credentials provided. But recently, I noted I was not longer automatically connecting. After resetting my site's credentials and trying to reconnect by forgetting the wifi network, I noticed a new field labeled \"Domain\" as a required entry. In the past, this field didn't exist, or at least never showed. What is this field? Why is it needed? Could it be the reason why I can't connect to the network? If so, how do I inquire with my site's I.T team so they understand what needs to be done to fix this issue?\n\nOn another note, I tried to see if another user with a pixel had this same field and they did not. Apple devices don't request it, nor do other android phones from what I surveyed.",
