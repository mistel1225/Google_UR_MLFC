    "title": "When is Google going to fix this emerging issue; can't hear ringtones, notifications or use speakerp",
    "content": "It's been a while now but my speakerphone function no longer works during calls, now my ringtones don't work and no notifications make sounds. I've had more conversations than I can count with Google representatives and not a single solution has worked. I've been told that it is an emerging issue therefore I need to wait for some developer to miraculously create an update to fix it all.\n\nThis is a terrible experience, this will be the first and last time I purchased a Google phone! I have an expensive paperweight at this point..\n\nWhen the heck is this being fixed and how is Google going to make this right?!",
