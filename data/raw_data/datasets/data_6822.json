    "content": "I was watching a video and suddenly the phone screen froze. Tried to restart, but it just went off. It looks like dead - no response to fastboot mode or charging.\nBefore it worked perfectly - no bugs, freezes.\nI can't contact customer service. Tried to connect via google store, but it just redirects to google help site.\nHow can I contact service? Maybe there is an e-mail. I still have warranty.",
