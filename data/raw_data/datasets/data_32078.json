There is a yellow-highlighted error at the bottom: \"Slot Unbootable: Load Error\". When I use the volume keys to scroll to \"Recovery Mode\" and select with the Power Button, it simply returns to the error screen. After searching this forum, it appears I need to call Google Support, but I have to post my problem first. This is the obligatory post so that I may have Google call me.",
