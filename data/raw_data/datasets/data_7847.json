Full factory reset, so when I reboot, only my google account can be used (FRP)\n2. Full Factory reset, so that another google account can be set up on it (eg. when selling)\n\nI dont want to FR just yet (so reluctant to experiment)\n\nWhich are the respective options to do the 2 above types of FR please?\n\nThanks",
