    "content": "I have updated my pixel 3 to android 11 about a week ago. After 2-3 days of updating, my battery percentage is stuck at 8%. Even if i charge it overnight, the battery takes full charge but battery level always shows 8%. So i have no clue when my phone has low charge or full charge. What should i do? I have drained full battery twice and then restarted after charging but still this problem persists. What to do?",
