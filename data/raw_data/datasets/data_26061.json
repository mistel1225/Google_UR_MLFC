    "content": "I contacted support a while ago about my phone suddenly not having the eSIM feature after rebooting. I was on google Fi with an eSIM. Being bounced back and forth between pixel support and google fi support, I was finally told to send it in for repair. I set up the repair and sent it in and on the same day of the repair center receiving it, I get an email saying it’s being returned to me with nothing wrong! \n\nIt seems no one understands my issue. eSIM does not work! It’s not only that it doesn’t work, it’s that it has disappeared as an option completely, with the only option being to use a physical SIM. Resetting to factory settings has done nothing for me. Upon start up of the newly reset device, the set up screen still only gives me the option to insert a SIM. No more eSIM. No more downloading the SIM. \n\nAnd yes, this was purchased through the google store. And yes, it is the unlocked (non-Verizon) model. The eSIM feature was present up until some random day when I rebooted my phone while bored and taking a dump that it magically vanished from my device as though it was never a feature to begin with. \n\nI just want to be able to use both to have my work and personal lines on the same device. I would just go back to my old dual SIM phone if this can’t be resolved.",
