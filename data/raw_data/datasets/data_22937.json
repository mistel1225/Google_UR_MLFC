    "content": "Hi guys.\n\nI have a Pixel 4 XL, and I'm on Vodafone Germany.\n\nWith my old Pixel 2, VoWiFi was rock-solid. Calls were never interrupted.\n\nSince two weeks now, I have a Pixel 4 XL, and under the same circumstances calls abort all the time after 5-10 mins. It doesn't matter who I call (fixed or mobile network), or who calls me. It is definitely my VoWiFi.\n\nFor me it's hard to believe it's a network-side issue (with network I mean operator network), but I believe it must be an instability in the implementation of the Pixel 4 XL's VoWiFi client.\n\nAnyone else having this? Any recommendations how to track this down?\n\nMany thanks in advance for any help.\n\nKr,\n\nRalf",
