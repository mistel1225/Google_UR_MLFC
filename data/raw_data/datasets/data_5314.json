    "content": "About 3 weeks ago my phone went nuts. The phone will ring, but when answered the caller cannot hear me. If I call out, the callee cannot hear me. Sometimes I can hear whoever is on the other end, sometimes not. A factory reset has been suggested, but I'm concerned about \"personal information, including SIMs will be deleted\". What is SIMs info, and can I delete it? Google Pixel XL (first gen), Android 10.",
