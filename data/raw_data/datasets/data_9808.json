    "title": "Unable to use Google chat from France but was able to last week?",
    "content": "I have tried to use the live chat to access support for my Pixel 3. What I thought was an issue with the keyboard I think now is more linked to the screen becoming unresponsive? The initial issue was an occasional mis-typed word, this has now evolved into apps closing at random, scrolling in the opposite direction to the command being used, maps 'jumping' and just general difficulty using the phone in any predicatable way. The chat assistant last week helped me to reset the keyboard which I think helped a little, but it hasn't solved what have become more apparent issues. \n\nThe phone was bought in the UK, but I now live in France - I have got both french and english selected as languages but the chat option has disappeared from my laptop and my phone.\n\nThanks :-)",
