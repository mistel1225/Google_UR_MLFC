    "title": "Temperature reading missing or out of date",
    "content": "About 2 months ago I started having an issue with the temperature reading on my home screen next to the time. It disappeared and I tried all the fixes suggested on the forum but that didn't fix the problem. Now it occasionally shows up but is stuck on one temperature for the whole day and may disappear on and off. I can't trust it any more and was a feature I had come to rely on. I travel quite a bit and it's very helpful to know the current temperature wherever I am.",
