    "content": "My Pixel 2 XL crashes whenever I try to make it a hotspot. I tried multiple times to the same result. After the first initial crash my phone has been acting MUCH slower ever since and my factory issued charging block and chord have stopped working IMMEDIATELY following the first reset. I have tried different chords and blocks as well leading me to think it is an issue with my phone.\n\nI have had a similar charging problem with a Pixel 2 XL before and they had to send me a replacement. Now it is starting to show the similar symptoms. However, the last Pixel started encountering problems when I first tried using the factory issued headphone adapter.\n\nIs it common for the Pixel 2 XL to have a life span of about four months? It has happened to me 2/2 times now and I have only used the factory issued charging chord and brick for my current phone except for today when I started testing if other chords or bricks will work. I charge my phone from grounded and surge protected outlets only.",
