    "title": "Why am I not getting audible notifications for Gmail, Gvoice and Messages on Android?",
    "content": "Pixel 3a using Android 9 and now Android 10.  I get audible notifications from some apps like eBay and Bumble, but no audible notifications from Gmail, Google Voice, and Messages.  The visible notifications definitely show up on the screen, lockscreen, notification bar, etc., and the phone vibrates.  I've disabled every Do Not Disturb setting I can find and still I get no sound for the notifications that matter most to me. Is there a solution I'm missing here?\nDetails\nGeneral Search Feedback, Android\nUnsubscribe\nCommunity content may not be verified or up-to-date. Learn more.\nNo replies yet.",
