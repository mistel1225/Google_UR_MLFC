    "content": "I'm attempting to view my phone's display on my Windows PC. It looks like this should work using Windows' Connect feature via the Notification Center. I've applied the correct settings in \"Projecting to this PC\" but when I open the connect app and go to \"Cast\" on my phone, my computer isn't displayed in the list of devices. Any tips on getting this working would be appreciated!",
