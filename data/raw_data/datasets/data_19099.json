    "content": "I woke up this morning and my Pixel 3a was turned off(not normal). Upon restarting I was able to initially enter my passcode, but before I could do anything else it rebooted. Now that cycle continues in a loop. It reboots whether I touch it or not about 20 seconds after booting up. Once it went into a sort of recovery screen that had only one option Factory reset or  try again. Since I actually use my phone I would prefer to avoid a factory reset if possible. I was able to get the device to boot into safe mode and it still rebooted itself.",
