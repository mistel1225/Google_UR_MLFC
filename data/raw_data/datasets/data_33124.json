    "content": "my phone dropped , I used it normally for 30 minutes after that. then began crashes (system ui stopped working) and after 5 minutes phone turned off and I can not turn it back. Screen has no reaction. when i press power button and volume down button I cant access boot menu, just feel vibration and that is all. I dont think it is a screen issue because i used phone normally after drop. I cant ring to my phone, laptop cannot see phone. just a vibration.",
