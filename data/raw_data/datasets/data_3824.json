    "title": "Why can I not answer incoming call if phone is unlocked?",
    "content": "I have no trouble answering calls if phone is locked.  However, if I am looking at the phone, perhaps already in the phone app but not calling, and I get a call, I can not get it to answer by either pressing the \"answer\" button or swiping up.  This is frustrating because I often call someone who has trouble using phones.  She will accidently hang up and then try to call me back.  When my phone rings I can not get it to answer.  I am aware of this happening with others as well.  All the solutions I have seen suggested are not relevant to my situation.  I have Android 11 and it is up to date.",
