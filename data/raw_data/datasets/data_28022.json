    "content": "Is there a way to turn off the long home button press to activate Google Assistant while still allowing Squeeze to activate it?  I find the long press annoying as I seem to bring it up numerous times when I don't want to and the squeeze works perfectly.  I can't see a way to turn off just the long press.  Only thing I found was turning off assistant totally which I don't want to do.",
