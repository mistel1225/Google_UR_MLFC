    "content": "I have a Pixel 2 and it's been great. It's work easily with all my various Bluetooth earbud options. I recently got a Jabra 75 headset for work calls. The main action button on the Jabra headset will accept and end calls just fine. Unfortunately, it won't begin audio playback (start/stop podcast, etc). I have tried unpairing, repairing, asking Jabra tech support, and various other workarounds but haven't succeeded. \n\nAny ideas?\n\nThanks in advance!",
