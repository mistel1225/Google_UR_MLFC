    "content": "For the last several days, whenever I send a text in a group, I can only get a reply from one person. Also, Any replies that the group is sending, are coming through hours after they are sent. This is mainly happening in group text, although there have been a few times with just a single person. Everyone that I am having issues with has an iPhone, so I don't know if that is why...I have tried clearing the cache on my msg app. I have tried to reset my network/wi-fi settings, and I have tried uninstalling my msg app and using a third party app to no avail.",
