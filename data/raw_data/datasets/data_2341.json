    "content": "I just got my Pixel 5. I had a Samsung Galaxy for 7 years. Samsung phone had a built in app to hear voicemails. Info for date, length, and source were all on the screen. All you had to do was click on the notification and listen. Then delete or not from the screen.  Pixel only has access to Verizon voicemail, which is awful. You have to login with a PIN, then listen to all the envelope info before getting to the message. What a pain! I want an app for Pixel that does what Samsung's does! Other than that I'm enjoying the Pixel.",
