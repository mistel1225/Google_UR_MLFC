    "content": "Yesterday my Google Pixel 3 XL was absolutely fine. I put it on charge overnight, and now nothing. Literally nothing. \n\nIt doesn't seem to be charging, it won't switch on, there's absolutely no sign of life. I've tried different chargers, holding the power button for 20s, holding the power and down button for 20s. Nothing. \n\nI've tried contacting Google directly. I connected to a live chat, but there was no-one there. I've tried doing a call back, someone / thing rings me and then there's no-one there. \n\nAny suggestions what's happened to my Pixel or what to do next?",
