    "content": "Tried to go into safe mode , phone kept on doing soft restart . hard reset / wipe also didnt help . while sometimes phones does a full reset and also cannot recover from it and requires me to wipe out the whole phone back to factory settings. the soft reset/restart to lock screen happens 2-5 times a day . the hard reset happens every couple of days and the restore to factory settings happens every month or so . \nthis has been happening since day 1 when i bought the phone in early December. none of the Google updates helped . nor removing the \"problematic apps\" as safe mode doesnt change anything",
