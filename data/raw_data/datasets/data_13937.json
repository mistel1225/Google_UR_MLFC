    "content": "I put off system updating for a while and finally did it, and I really dislike the new drag down screen. I liked before where it showed a lot more options, now half the screen is music even if I'm not listening to it. It feels like showing me past songs I was listening to it even random songs, when all I want is to turn on airplane mode, screen cast, flashlight, DnD or whatever else without having to pull down twice, and then start side swiping.\n\nI'm at the gym, and I can't even pause or get to the music track on Newpipe in anyway because when I pull down it shows the song and the app, but clicking it does nothing while before I could pause, rewind, or open the playback all from the pull down screen.\n\nIs there a way to roll back updates, or at least make the pull down screen the way it was before?",
