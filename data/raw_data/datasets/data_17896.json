    "content": "Whenever i come back to homescreen from any app or page my display seems too bright and takes some time to become normally lit. Top section where time and network is shown, this is the area where it's noticable. The top section is to brigh to see when i come back to homescreen, but gets a darker and visible shade after few seconds. Never happened before this recent security update. Also in app drawer apps with dark black icons show a black color dragging shadow when i scroll in the app drawer.",
