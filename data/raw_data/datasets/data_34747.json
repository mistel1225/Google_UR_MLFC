    "content": "Every time I try to make a phone call on my phone, the other party tells me I sound very bad. My area does have a good phone reception, and I don't know why I have this problem. I've looked it up and I see how this is a common issue. What can I do? Part of my work is to make phone calls and being able to receive them.",
