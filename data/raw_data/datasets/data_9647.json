    "content": "Bought a telescope but want to take pictures with my Pixel 5.  I read some reviews that some smartphone telescope adapter don't work with some Pixels, so want to check.  Also, my earphone jack doesn't fit into the hole on top of the phone, what is that for?  BTW, I LOVE this phone, especially the three day battery and the night light camera mode, although I wish that was more easily disabled on screen.",
