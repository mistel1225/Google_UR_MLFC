    "content": "I am very disappointed with my Pixel 4A 5G. The experience is a big downgrade from my previous Pixel 2 XL. The keyboard is extremely inaccurate and typing makes me seem like an illiterate idiot. Voice to speech is error-prone and nothing in comparison to what I was used to with my Pixel 2 XL. I feel like Google sacrificed too much to achieve a price point and profit margin. It's not at all what I expect from a pixel phone and I'm seriously considering ditching the Pixel 4a5G for different product and possibly OS. I tried working with customer support but there was no improvement in quality of experience. Does Google even care about the phone business anymore?",
