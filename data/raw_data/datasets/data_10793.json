    "content": "I first noticed this with Google Camera when I couldn't open the recent photos to view the photo I had just taken. Then I saw a notification that showed that the photo was still saving, so I waited, but after a significant amount of time, nothing changed. I force stopped the app, I wiped storage, I rebooted, I reverted the camera app to the original version, and I tried downloading another camera app, and that couldn't save photos either.",
