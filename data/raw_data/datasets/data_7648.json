    "content": "Since December I've been having issues with the touchscreen on my Pixel 5 I brought this to the attention of Google and Pixel support and the only response I got was if I paid the shipping and that I would get a refurbished phone well I don't want to refurbish phone when mine's brand new it's not even 2 months old and now today I'm having to touch the screen up to 10 times to open an app if it even opens I've got all my sensitivity set to the highest they can be for using a screen protector I've switched to every screen protector they make for the Pixel 5 which there's barely handful of those out there even and also today it seems like all my buttons stopped working all together Volume buttons power button everything so what's going to happen here what's the fix because I'm sick of being told well do this or do this or going to the developers there is no developer support on our settings it's nowhere to be found just like you describe on your page there's nothing called developer support in the settings under system so you need to fix this otherwise I'm going to a Samsung phone you guys really let me down on this",
