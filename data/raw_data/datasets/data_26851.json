    "content": "Whenever I open the camera or any other video/photo app like snapchat or houseparty, the camera will sometimes make a rattling noise and stay out of focus. I normally have to shake or lightly tap my phone to stop the rattling and have it refocus. I think something in the inside of my phone is out of place and whenever I tap/shake it, it moves back into place. Is there anyway to fix this?",
