    "content": "I use my phone regularly as a speaker phone in my car for work. Just upgraded from a pixel 2 yesterday. Using the spanking new pixel 5, people can only just hear me, it's muffled and cuts in and out. Swapped SIM back to pixel 2, called same people and they said it's way better.  \n\nThere seems to be an issue with the noise cancellation on the pixel 5. Any way to fix or am I reverting back to the pixel 2???\n\nBoth are running latest updates android 11 using native phone app.",
