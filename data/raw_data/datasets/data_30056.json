    "content": "My Pixel 2 XL randomly disconnects from Android Auto in my new (2019) VW T-Roc.  I've tried different cables but not luck. The disconnect is not related to movement or use of the controls or phone, navigation or music.  VW tell me the car has the latest software.  On a 2 hour journey it disconnects over 20 times.  If I wait it restart the connection but I nee to press the App button to get back to navigation.  Its dangerous as it distracts me from driving.    Does anyone else have the same problem?   Or know how to debug?",
