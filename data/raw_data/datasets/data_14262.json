    "content": "My Pixel 3 XL was replaced due to battery swelling.  The support person I was dealing with, via chat, sent me an email with a return shipping label, which I used.  Later I received a new email with a different return shipping label.  The destinations for the two shipping labels were different. How can I make sure that the returned phone is received and I don't get charged for the replacement?",
