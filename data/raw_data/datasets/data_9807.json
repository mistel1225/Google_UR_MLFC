    "content": "I have continued critical issues with my phone.  After multiple chat reps and countless minutes with Fi support...still no help. I had my first Pixel 4a 5G for only 2 weeks before it became a brick with a black screen at 100% battery. would not even reboot in safe mode at all - NO response even with Fi support. It took forever to get my replacement, despite Google saying they would rush it (they did not). I have had the replacement for 10 days now and it just froze and would not respond at all.  I had to do a bootloader reboot after 10 days.  There are other issues I am experiencing.  I do not feel comfortable with this phone and say steer clear from the Pixel 4a 5G and Fi service (or non service). This is ridiculous.",
