    "content": "This is the shortest life phone I ever owned. In less than 1 month, my Pixel 3 XL died.\nTried everything I could, pressing power button for 1 min, power + volume down / up for 1 min, charging for hours, nothing helps.\nAfter 12 hours, suddenly the phone can be turned on. However, it died of in few minutes or longest 10+ minutes. Even I done factory reset, the phone could just off in setup screen.\nAll these happen when battery level is 50% - 60%.\nAfter several hours leaving it charging, this morning, it can't be turned on again. \nHow frustrating I am.\nAnd I read complaints regarding overheating issue earlier, and yes I am having overheating issue too with video call + wireless charging.\nDid Google look into user matters seriously ? \nWhat should I do now with my phone?",
