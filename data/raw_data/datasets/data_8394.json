    "content": "Hi,\nMy Pixel 4a 5G can't connect to the Free Mobile 5G network in France. This carrier is not listed as supported despite using the exact same frequencies as it's concurrents in France and being the one with the biggest number of 5G antennas in the country. It seems like there is no logical reason it couldn't work, is there any way to force the Pixel 4a 5G to connect to the 5G network ?\n\n(BTW everything is okay with this carrier and I am near a 5G antenna so nothing wrong on the carrier side, it's definitely the Pixel phone...)\n\nThanks in advance.",
