    "content": "My pixel keeps changing time zones, jumps 10 hrs 30 mins ahead. It jumps back and forth seemingly at random. Clock settings are all set to auto so I'm not sure why it's happening. I turned off \"Automatic time zone\" for now but am wondering if there's a better way to fix this weird issue.",
