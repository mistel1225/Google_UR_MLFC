    "content": "The photos clicking using night sight for astrophotography are cracking up at the top of screen making it blurry which was not the case 3 months back when I purchased this phone. I have attached both the recent and the previous photos ( the last picture is the one taken 2 months back and it looks fine)clicked using night sight. Is this a software issue?? How to get this resolved?? Can I get a replacement as the device is in warranty",
