    "content": "When using the squeeze function or swiping from the bottom corners the assistant appears, but it's not reacting to my voice (the dots are floating up and down, but not elongating). To get the Assistant to listen i have to say: \"Ok Google\" then the assistant is listening.\nThis was working before. \n\nAfter saying: \"Ok Google turn on flashlight\" the flashlight turn on but when i tap on the microphone in the attached photo the assistant is not listening either.",
