    "content": "It's been around 5 months now since I started using Pixel 3A. I am facing a sound issue since two days and haven't found a solution. \n\nWhen I make an outgoing call, there is absolutely no ringing tone. Even if the call connects, I could hear nothing from the other side. But if I switch on the speaker, I am able to hear the other side. When making a call with speaker on, I can hear the ringer tone. I checked with support team and followed all trouble shooting steps including factory settings reset, no luck. Only option left is to check with repair center but then it ll not be open for few weeks or months. \n\nI hope you would have heard similar issues from others not exactly the same. Would anyone be able to help me fix this?",
