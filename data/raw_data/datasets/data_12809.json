    "title": "Abnormal Battery Drain on Pixel 3 XL after Upgrading to Android 11",
    "content": "Just got the OTA update to Android 11 for my Pixel 3 XL. Ever since, my battery drains much faster. I've been working from home due to COVID and my phone would normally take almost two days before I would need to charge it. Now it seems like I can even make it 8 hours.\n\nI haven't tried a factory reset yet as I'm dreading having to reconfigure everything. Posting this just to make the issue more visible to Google.",
