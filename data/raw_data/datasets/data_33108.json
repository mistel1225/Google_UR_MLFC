    "content": "What can one do to fix the bad speaker quality on the pixel 3xl? I can't believe this high cost phone has such horrible speakers. It buzzes when speaking on the phone without speakerphone. It buzzes worse when playing music, higher volume makes it worse. Base sound is the absolute worst.",
