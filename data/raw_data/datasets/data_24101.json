    "content": "Hello, community! \n\nWell, the title says it all: got a new Pixel 3a (actually, my first one) today and found out such a \"defect\" in the upper right corner of the screen. Yes, I'm not quite sure whether this scratch (or crack) on the internal black frame is a common thing on assembled devices... And that's why I'm asking here. This \"defect\" is most visible during non-black color picture display and while looking from above (as on the photos attached, sorry for their quality). As a result, this scratch/crack just clearly exposes that small portion of the screen below the frame. \n\nCould you please clarify - should I worry about this? Should I claim for a repair/replacement or just live happily with the phone since all other functions work normally?\n\nThank you a LOT in advance!",
