    "content": "When I receive a Viber message notification but for some reason I don't want to open it that moment, the notification is being removed after ~30 minutes from notifications drawer, from lockscreen, notification dot also removed from app icon. From everywhere that would remind me that I had a message. If I open Viber app it still shows as unread though.\n\nDoes anybody have the same experience and anyway to fix it?\n\ncheck my video at 15'' to see lost my notification without open it.\nhttps://filebin.net/wecby3kmio8whsde",
