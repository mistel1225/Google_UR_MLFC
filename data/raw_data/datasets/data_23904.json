    "title": "Pixel 2 microphone not working after update",
    "content": "After updating this morning, my microphone no longer works for Assistant, voice to text, etc. Does work when using speakerphone and while recording video. I have restarted in safe mode with no luck there. This has to be the update I would think. I checked the permissions for the apps and found none to be lacking microphone permission. I know there are tons of Pixel microphone problems but this genuinely seems like a software issue. Thanks for any suggestions you may offer.\n\n\n\nUpdate: I did a factory reset and the issue is still present. I will say, it is still the same firmware and security update so I don't think I've narrowed down the issue yet.",
