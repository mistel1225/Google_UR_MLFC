    "content": "I have a pixel 4a device. I am trying to connect it to a computer via it's cable but computer doesn't recognize it. In the device manager it says unknown USB device. I tried two different cables on two different pc, no help. The thing is the bootloader is unlocked and I want to lock it, but without connecting it to the PC, it seems like it is not possible. Any idea what is causing the connection problem and how to fix it?",
