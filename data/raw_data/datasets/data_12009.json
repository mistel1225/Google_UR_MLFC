    "content": "Every time I charge using the power brick, the charge gets interrupted. It will charge for a minute or so, then the screen will light up as it would when you unplug the phone. The battery doesn't have the lightning symbol on to indicate charging. And then suddenly it'll start charging again. \n\nAt first I thought my wall outlets were finicky but I've tried every wall outlet and it still does this.",
