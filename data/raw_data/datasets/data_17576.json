    "content": "My Pixel 3 has been stuck in bootloops before but this time I can't even get the bootloader to work. It keeps on restarting out of the bootloader when I try to reboot in safe mode. Everything I've found on the internet suggests booting in safe mode but I can't even reach safe mode or reset to factory settings.",
