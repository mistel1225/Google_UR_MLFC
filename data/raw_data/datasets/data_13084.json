    "content": "The option to 'Use randomized MAC' under Wi-Fi settings doesn't appear to be there.\n\nI was under the impression this is a new feature of Android 10, which my Pixel XL is running.\n\nJust looking to confirm if this setting should be there, or if it's somewhere else?\n\nDoes anyone with a Pixel XL on 10 have this option?\n\nDocuments online suggest it should be in the following place;\nOpen the Settings app.\nTap Network & Internet.\nTap Wi-Fi.\nTap the gear icon associated with the wireless connection to be configured.\nTap Advanced.\nTap Privacy.\nTap Use Randomized MAC\n\nThanks",
