    "content": "Is there a way on the pixel 2 XL running the newest Android 10, delete select call logs. By default Google decided the only option you have is to delete All logs or hold and press each one to delete. Imagine doing this for text messages. I'm looking for a way to say I want to delete all call logs from XYZ user. Or I can toggle mutliple random call logs and then delete them with only one hold and press.\nIf there isn't a feature for this, where can I suggest and complain to have this added. It's annoying deleting all these unknown and spam numebrs or going in one by one removing weeks of info I want cleaned up. Is there a 3rd party app that can do this?",
