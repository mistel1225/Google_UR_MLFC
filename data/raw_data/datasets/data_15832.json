    "title": "SiriusXM audio stops when screen display goes to sleep",
    "content": "When I go walking I like to listen to SiriusXM channels thru their app.  But when I put my phone in my pocket after starting it and the screen goes dark, a few seconds later the app either closes or just stops the audio.  This does not happen with iHeart or TuneIn.  SiriusXM had no answer other than to reinstall the app.  Battery optimization is not the reason.  I really don't want to keep my screen on the whole time I walk or listen.  I've carried another phone with no SIM card and tethered to the Pixel, listening to SiriusXM on the spare phone, and this does not happen so it seems to be a fault of the Pixel.",
