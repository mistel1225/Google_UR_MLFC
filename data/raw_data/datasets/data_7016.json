    "title": "Has Pixel 2XL Maps been downgraded to get me to buy a new phone?",
    "content": "Apple was caught releasing \"upgrades\" that caused older phones to perform poorer - downgrades masking as upgrades to get customers to buy a new phone. This got me thinking.\n\nNow that my Pixel 2XL is no longer being supported, since the last release I find that Google Maps works intermittently. I put in a place, and it says it is searching for directions, but never kick starts. The little circle just keeps circling... so far for 35 minutes while sitting on my desk with good 4g reception and connected to WiFi at my desk. \n\nOther times it works normally. So I switch to WAZE and it works fine. Trouble is I am used to Google Maps, and prefer to use it. I've followed all the trouble-shooting advice, but nothing changes. The fact that WAZE works rules out the location sensor. \n\nHas anyone else noticed this, and might it be related to an \"update\" which may actually be a performance downgrade intended to prompt users to toss an otherwise perfectly good phone for a new one?\n\nOr has anyone experienced this and found a real fix?\n\nAndroid version 11 - the warranty expired two months ago.",
