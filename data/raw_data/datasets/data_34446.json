    "content": "Hello, my Nexus 5x finally went into death of bootloop. I bought the pixel 2xl however due to not being able to turn on nexus 5x, I was not able to transfer all the data (text msges specially) Now I've found a work around to turn on nexus 5x and I would like to transfer those data to pixel 2xl. The problem is, I'm no longer on set up screen on pixel 2xl and have been using the phone for few days. How would I go about transferring the data to pixel 2xl now? I tried to search the forum, but all it shows was how to do it during set up screen. Any help is useful.\n\nThank you.",
