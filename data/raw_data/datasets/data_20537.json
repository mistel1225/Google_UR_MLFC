    "content": "I have a Pixel 3 XLand the back of the phone is popping off because the battery is swelling.  I've never had a Google phone device do this before.  Seem like a lot of folks are having this issue but i search this community and there is no definite answer. First time in my time using mobile phone that battery bloat. this is not right.  Am I going to have to wait until the phone explodes?  I think Google should do the right thing and exchange the phone.",
