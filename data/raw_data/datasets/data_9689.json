    "content": "My first Pixel phone was a 2.  I dropped it & smashed the screen so I got a Pixel 5, otherwise I would have happily kept it.  My wife is still using her 2xl and just got a notice that her last security update will be this month.\nThat's 3 years + 1 month of support (yes, the Pixel 2 was released in October, but we ordered on release day and actually received them in November).  Back then when I switched from iPhone I saw that Google offered 'at least 3 years' of updates.  That sounds like 3+ years... I know it's actually one month more than promised but for practical purposes they cut off support just about as soon as they could.\nBecause I bought a Pixel 5 before seeing how this actually played out I'll be with Google for another 3 years, but if the same thing happens then I'm going back to iPhone.  I mean, I use an iPhone 6s for work that still runs the current OS and patches.  That's 5 years and counting... it's like getting a free phone at the 3 year mark when compared to Pixel.",
