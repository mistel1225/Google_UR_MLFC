    "content": "On my Pixel 4 XL after update I have turn on Face unlock and eyes open to unlock phone. Phone unlocks with both eyes open but also unlocks with one eye open. By the way phone does not unlock with both eyes closed. To resolved issue I have deleted face unlock data, re-add and restarted phone but still unlocks with one eye open. Any suggestions",
