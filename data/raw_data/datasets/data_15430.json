    "content": "Hi guys, 3 weeks ago my sister bought an pixel 3a, that arrived a few days ago. Since then I've been trying to update it to android 11 bc the ota it's available but every time that the phone restarts in the update it is still in android 9 and in the updates there's only and \"update error\" message. We're from Chile and we bought it through Amazon in case that info is useful for u.\n\nSaludos!",
