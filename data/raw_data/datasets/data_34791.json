    "content": "Hi, sometimes when I edit a photo in Markup, and then save it, the edits disappear. The edited photo doesn't show up in my Markups folder or the original folder the photo was in. The only way I have been able to save these edited photos is to share them instead of saving them. \n\nAny advice on how to save Markups would be much appreciated.",
