    "content": "Has anyone here used the Seek Thermal camera? I'm tried using it and the Pixel 3a doesn't recognize the device. I reached out to Seek but thought I would try here too.\n\nI don't get an error message or pop-up or notification. I plug the camera in and nothing happens. The Seek App just states that it cannot find the hardware.\n\nI'll keep looking around for answer...while I wait for responses.",
