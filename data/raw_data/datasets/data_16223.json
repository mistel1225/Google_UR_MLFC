    "content": "I was on Google Fi support for 3 hours this morning and they couldn't help me they tried everything and said they would e-mail in a couple days. The phone was just set up yesterday with the help of Google Fi.  I just by accident found that the screen protector that I purchased especially for a google pixel 3XL was causing the issue and the support person did not even ask if there was one on the phone-I now have sound after hours of support-maybe they should ask that before they start changing everything on the phone and finally turning it over to a specialist.",
