    "content": "Can't use this phone anymore. So frustrating. Somehow all my contact names on whatsapp disappeared too. Because of the frequency of these annoying pop up messages, I can't type or do anything with the phone. Switched it off and on. Cleared cache, storage but nothing works... so random. A couple of months earlier, my phone started having BT issues in terms of not connecting. It worked at times & didn't at times. It was annoying but I thought they'd fix it with the next update. Who knew this would happen. Now everything else is not working. Help!! This is very frustrating and stressful!",
