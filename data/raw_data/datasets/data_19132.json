    "content": "My battery is constantly stuck at 51% even though I've been running it for over an hour now. Accubattery is reporting my estimated capacity as 11000+ milliamps. I have screenshots to prove it. Should I just let it die then put it on charge. I've tried restarting it a few times and leaving it powered off for a good 20 minutes. Any ideas?",
