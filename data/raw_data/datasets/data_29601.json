    "title": "Pixel 2 XL: My screen has been flickering since yesterday. Much worse when viewing notifications",
    "content": "I have restarted the phone. I have placed the phone in Safe mode - both made no difference. It is only when I turned off all notifications that the display almost entirely stopped flickering - except when watching video recordings. It still happens very briefly when I awaken the phone or open an app. This issue only started happening yesterday afternoon. Do you have any ideas what could be happening please?",
