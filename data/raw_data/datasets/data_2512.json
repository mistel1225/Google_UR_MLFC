    "content": "Sometimes when I get spam calls, the volume is jacked up 3 or 4 times the sound of normal phone calls when the phone is ringing.\n\nIs this a setting that I can turn off, or is this a defect with the speakers?\n\nThe only consistent pattern is that those loud calls are usually spam calls.",
