    "content": "It's not a problem, it's a feature I'd like to get back.\nIn messaging, one person, you used to be able to go into the menu (three dots top right) then details, notifications and simply turn them off or on. Then beyond that have more granular options like 'display silently' 'notification dot' etc.\nCan we please have this back?",
