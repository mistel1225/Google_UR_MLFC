    "content": "My Pixel 3 is losing battery like crazy. It took it exactly 10 seconds to get from 30% to shutting down. I still qualify for warranty. The Google support page gives me two options; ask for a call or chat with support. When pressing on either, it redirects me to the frontpage, and I am stuck in a limbo of not getting further. Any advice on how to contact google support?",
