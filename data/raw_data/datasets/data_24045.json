    "title": "FedEx did't deliver the my Pixel 4 XL. Google said: Can't help, call the police.",
    "content": "I bought a Pixel 4 XL 128 GB on October 22 at Google Store with the expected delivery date on Oct 29. While checking FedEx tracking page, the delivery date was Oct 25, then by the end of the day, they changed to Oct 28. After that, the delivery date was changed to \"Pending\". I called FedEx and Google and both of them said they'd open an investigation. On Nov 1 FedEx updated tracking status to \"Delivered on Oct 28, signed by: signature not req.\". However, this shipment required \"indirect signature\". FedEx told me by phone this was the driver's fault because he didn't get any signature but they can't do anything for me and I should contact Google. Finally, Google closed my case and here is the final answer.\nThanks for contacting Google Shipping and Refunds Team!\nWe have carefully reviewed your case. I am sorry to inform you, but we deem your claim request as denied. Therefor, we cannot process a replacement or refund for this matter.\nAs a next step, you may consider initiating an investigation with the carrier or notify local law enforcement. Or you may also file a claim with your bank. Weâ€™ll be happy to assist in an investigation.\nThanks!\nJobelle\nThe Google Support Team\nI don't want to file a dispute with the credit card company because I know I will be blacklisted by them or by Google. I think police won't help much, specially because I think this package was never delivered. I don't know what to do. Any idea what I can do to have my money back?",
