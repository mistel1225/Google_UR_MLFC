    "content": "Phone says analog audio accessory detected and not compatible with my phone which is an XL2. There is nothing plugged into my phone I don't use it audio connections and every since it came on it does not go off it will not go off and I have a charging problem now. How do I fix this? I have reset my phone, I have erased apps that it could be an issue with, I have tried going to the settings and doing as it says, and I've been trying to go to settings and follow advice in other news feeds. Nothing works!",
