    "content": "Last week my original Pixel phone became unusable. It will work great for about 30 seconds then completely lock up for about 2 minutes.  \n\nEverything I do it ends up with the \"Android XXX is not responding\" Close or wait.\n\nI get that for System UI and everything else. I've done a couple of factory resets on this, but have no idea what would cause the performance to get to the point it's unusable.",
