    "content": "I use Now Playing ever since I got my Pixel 5. It's very convenient. I only have one issue - I can only export the track list to YouTube Music, which is unavailable here. So please, add support for other streaming services (like Spotify, Deezer, Apple Music) or even exporting to a Google doc.",
