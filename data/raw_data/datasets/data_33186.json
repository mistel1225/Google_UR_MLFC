    "content": "After the latest update, I am getitng 2 popup text notifications when using FB Messenger app. I get the apps popup as well as the phones SMS text popup in front of it. I tried asking FB for help but got nowhere. Have asked other Pixel users if they have the issue and so far nobody does, Not sure what happened. I did not change anything in settings. I have SMS OFF in Messenger settings. When I do not have Messenger window open, I only get the default FB Messenger bubble alert. It's only when I have FB Messeneger window open and chatting do I get the SMS style one as well in foreground. This was never an issue until lately. Could be Pixel issue or FB Messeneger but cant find an answer anywhere.",
