    "content": "My phone has been like that for a week now. Just stuck at 66%.\n\nI just have to guess if the battery is about to go out. The phone seem to work just as before but just hard shutdown when it drains out and still show 66%.\n\nEven when the phone is shutdown, the screen shows 66% when I plug the cable. Did the same thing with OEM charger and wireless charger. So it's not the charger.\n\nNo idea what to do at this point but it doesn't work to not know when the battery is gonna go out.\n\nThanks for the help",
