    "content": "I let the battery on my Pixel 4 go to 0%. It automatically shut down and after I charged it and turned it back on it has not been working properly.\n1) The first problem, and probably most annoying, is my mobile data stopped working. I've tried resetting the data connections, safe restart, restarting the phone, etc but nothing happened. I can still make and receive phone calls, but absolutely no texts.\n 2) The bottom right button (I use the three button setting) does not work. The phone recognizes when I touch the area as I can see it \"click\" on the screen, but it doesn't do anything when I click it. \n3) Most of the icons disappeared from my quick access menu. Only wifi, bluetooth, flashlight, autorotate, battery, and mobile data show. Note - mobile data is greyed out and can't be clicked on. I cant pull the menu down to edit it.",
