    "content": "Ever since I bought my Pixel 4, the ringtones never worked, and neither did the alarm. Also, I couldn't put my calls on loud speaker. I decided I could live with that since my phone is on vibrate anyway — and I learned to wake up hearing it vibrate (I know, that's a LOT of compromise already).\n\nBut lately the vibrate function also stopped working — and, to make it EVEN worse, after I reload the phone, it won't play the sound files at all (music, voice recordings, video etc.) I have to reload it 5-7 times to make it work again.\n\nSo... Any suggestions? Since I bought it over the Internet and there are not official Google stores in my country, warranty option is out. Should I get it fixed? Or better replace it with something newer?",
