    "content": "I placed my Pixel 3XL on a hot surface and discovered it in time that the rear cover was not damaged. The rear camera lens looks clear, but the camera image is blurry. I am thinking that the heat partially melted the lens cover adhesive and some of the gases have stuck to the inside of the glass. How can I remove the lens cover only, and clean or replace it?",
