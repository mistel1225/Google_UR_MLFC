    "content": "My Pixel 1 has been randomly crashing lately. The interface will lock up for about 5-10 seconds, then kick me back to type in my password as though it has rebooted, but without actually performing a reboot (no startup animation, just directly back to the login). When I log in and check uptime in Termux, it shows that the device hasn't actually restarted, as my uptime reflects the time that I actually last performed a full reboot.\n\nThis will happen seemingly randomly, whether I'm using the device or it is sitting idle. I performed a factory reset and am experiencing the same behavior afterward.",
