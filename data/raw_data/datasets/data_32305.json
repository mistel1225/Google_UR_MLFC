    "content": "Hey all,\n\nI need to upload a file via an app (beneflex) but when I click \"upload\" the app automatically goes to my Camera Roll and the file isn't there. I tried taking a screenshot but had the same issue - it's not available for upload because it's not in my camera roll. \n\nWhen I go to my photo app, it is listed along with other screenshots/photos I took that day. \n\nI also found that I have a similar issue when trying to upload a .gif via Facebook. The Google Assistant app made a .gif with a video I recorded, but when I saved it, I could only access it in my Google drive or under the \"Assistant\" tab in photos. It was not in Camera Roll and therefore inaccessible for upload on Facebook. \n\nAnyway to move these files to Camera Roll or is another fix available?\n\nThanks.",
