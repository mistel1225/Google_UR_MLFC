    "title": "YouTube app suddenly not working in Google Pixel",
    "content": "This has happened to me a couple of months ago, with the native Play music app and is happening again with the YouTube app.\n\nAll of a sudden YouTube app is not responding, just once in a while a system pop-up shows up informing me the app \"keeps stopping\".\n\nI've of course tried everything, even the joke generic advice from Google's support: Restarted the device, force-stopped the app, cleaned cache, etc. Nothing works. So I am asking here, hoping to avoid the only thing that worked last time: hard resetting the damn phone.",
