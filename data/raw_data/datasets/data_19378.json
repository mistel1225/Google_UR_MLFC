    "title": "Why new box every time I search using the google searchbox at the bottom of my pixel homepage",
    "content": "I use the convenient google searchbox located at the bottom of my home screen on my pixel 4 XL.  The issue I have is that while I am browsing the page it brings up, I often need to search something else. Because of the ease of using the search bar, I quickly swipe back to the home page and search on the google searchbox again, not realizing it searches on top of the search that is already open (like it can only have one window/tab open)\nPlease allow more versatility of the searchbox and include settings such as 'open new window with each search' or 'searchbox is set to default searches to: chrome; google; firefox; etc' or 'open new tab with each search' etc. \nThank you for the consideration and taking the time to read this.
