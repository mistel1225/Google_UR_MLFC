    "title": "After android 10 update P2XL bricked. Is Google compensating?",
    "content": "Ever since Android 10 was installed my P2XL is stuck on the Google splash screen. It sounds like an on going issue as per this forum and the internet. I've had my phone for just a year and a half. This bricking should be fixed and at no cost to the owner. I'm still not finished paying for a premium phone you would think would last longer than a year an a half. None of the fixes work for my phone and ubreakifix is asking 490cdn to replace the mother board. How does this become the fault of the buyer when the root cause is out our hands. I have not modified the phone in anyway. Just take the updates.",
