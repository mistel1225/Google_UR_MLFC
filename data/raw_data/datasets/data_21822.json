    "content": "Hey I didn't know what gsm meant until an hour ago and I bought a pixel XL 2 gsm unlocked a couple of days ago and now I'm nervous it's not going to work with my prepaid Verizon account. Everything on Google I've read says that the Google pixel will work on both but I've seen a pixel for sale that says gsm only and now I'm stressing. I already ordered the pixel instead of pixel XL and had to return that one today and really don't want to have to order a third. Thank you for any help!",
