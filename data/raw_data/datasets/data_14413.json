    "content": "My Pixel Stand stopped wirelessly charging my Pixel 3, so I bought another Pixel Stand.  The phone’s not charging on it either.  Great -- now I’m out $79 and have two Pixel Stands I can’t use.  How likely is it for the wireless charging circuits in the phone itself to fail?  Has this happened to anyone else?  Anything I might try to get it working again?  I’ve tried safe mode, soft reset and resetting app preferences.  No effect.",
