    "title": "Pixel 5 top part of phone near speaker feels weak/hollow",
    "content": "When I tap the top of the phone to bring down the notification bar I feel and hear a springy sensation as if the phone is weak/hollow or possibly that something is loose. Everything works fine but it feels like the phone is weak. It has done this out of the box but I notice it more and more. It does not feel like a premium build quality. When I tap around on the bottom half of the phone it feels nice and solid. Is this normal? Is anyone else experiencing this?",
