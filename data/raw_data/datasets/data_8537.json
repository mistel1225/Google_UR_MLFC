    "content": "Got a new Pixel 5 and the sound quality during calls is beyond dismal. Everyone sounds muffled and robotic and if they are using their speaker phone - forget trying to hear or understand anything they are saying. If I attempt speaker phone on my end, the sound quality is bad also. Are there any changes coming down the road to fix this?",
