    "title": "Google apps fail on the new Android 11. Any idea how to fix?",
    "content": "After the latest Android update, to Android 11, some of the Google Apps are closing immediately once I start them. Google Maps and Google Finance so far.\nOnce I open the app, a brief popup shows, but not long enough that I could see what it is and app closes. So it's unusable. I've uninstalled and installed WebView and Chrome, but no change. The only way it seems to work is if I downgrade the apps to the previous options. Old version of Maps seems to work fine with latest version of Android, just not the latest.",
