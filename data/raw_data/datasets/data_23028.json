    "content": "When connected to headphones, I occasionally gives out a loud beep and then the volume drops to zero\n\nI've been getting this for a while, but feels more frequent recently. Most of the times I happen to be using bluetooth earphones when this happens (tried multiple separate devices) , and I can't be sure if it happens otherwise.\n\nA quick lookup showed people having but similar but not exactly the same problem; reports of phone rebooting, etc. The beep is quite loud, more than annoying.",
