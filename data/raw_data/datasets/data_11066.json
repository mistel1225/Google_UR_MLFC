    "title": "My pixel care was not transfer to the replacement pixel phone that google store provided me",
    "content": "When I purchased a pixel phone from the google store, I also bought the care that is offered. I currently have a damaged phone and need to have it replaced, but when I  file a replacement, the insurance company told me that the IMEI number with my phone does not reflect as having google care attached to it. It seems google failed to attach the care to the correct IMEI number. I opened a case with google support to get this issue resolved, but it has been nine days, and no one can tell me why this has taken so long or when it would be resolved. I would like to know if I can escalate beyond a supervisor as support has failed to provide any information or updates as to why this has taken so long to resolve?",
