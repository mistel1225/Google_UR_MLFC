    "content": "Hi,\n\nI just wanted to know if you guys have had any issues as of today for the camera app. It was working fine for me until today. I've done everything that I can do in hopes of fixing my issue. For me, it keeps crashing even after restarting the phone, un-installing and re-install ung the updates, and even seeing if it comes up on other apps. Nothing worked.\n\nI've had no issues with this phone since I've had it and I love it. I really don't want to get a new phone anytime soon unless I really have to. My phone by the way is a Pixel 2 XL 128gb.\n\nPlease let me know if there is anything else you need from me.\n\nThank you for your time!",
