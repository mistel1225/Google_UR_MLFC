    "content": "Today I updated my Pixel 2 with the system update I was sent. I've had endless problems since! My apps are running super slow or they won't open and my Hotmail isn't syncing or updating. Absolutely fuming! I rely heavily on my phone and now it's not working properly. I've restarted my phone so many times, nothing is helping. Please fix this problem ASAP!",
