    "content": "I'm trying to copy files from my Pixel 2 to my Windows 10 computer before doing a factory reset. I've already done a backup, but I'd like to be sure that I don't lose any pictures, files, whatever. I've read about transferring files, but I don't want to transfer I want to copy and still have a copy on my phone. Verizon is having me try all kinds of stuff to fix a performance problem and before I wipe my phone I'd like backups in more than one place. Any suggestions?",
