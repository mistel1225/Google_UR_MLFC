    "content": "Calls only sometimes not ringing and not registering on call log. Either I get  a voice mail or  my close friends and family now just text me and tell me to call them. I have contacted Verizon numerous times and no help or explanation.I have wifi calling activated because my sim status is usually -109--117. Internet is AT&T fiber 300. Also during a call, suddenly the other person cannot hear me, but I can hear them.These problems occur daily but not 100% of the time. I work from home and I am here most of time. I have lots of other issues with phone that I tolerate, but this has to be resolved. I miss business calls.",
