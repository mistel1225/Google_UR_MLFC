    "content": "On previous phones I've had with face unlock which worked very well, and had fingerprint scanners within the screen for when it didn't (too dark); it only worked when your eyes were open.\n\nWith the pixel, the face unlock works with partially obscured face, closed eyes and you can frankly gurn at the phone and still open it... I actually had to try hard to cover or obscure my face enough for it not to work.\n\nIs it supposed to detect your face and unlock when your eyes are closed?\nThis seems like a security issue.",
