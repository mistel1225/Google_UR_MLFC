    "content": "I am a disabled person, and I currently have an iPhone. I am however considering getting a pixel 3xl. However I wanted to find out if the pixel 3xl voice assistant (hey google) can dial 911. For example, I can say “hey Siri, call 911” on my iPhone and it will call emergency services. Does the pixel 3xl or the google assistant do this also?",
