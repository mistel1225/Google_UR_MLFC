    "title": "Backed-up app data list empty. Is my app data lost?",
    "content": "I did a factory reset of my Google Pixel 2 phone and later realised I didn't find my restore code for my Google Authenticator app. So I did a new reset and chose to backup from my Google Drive backup that was only 1 day old to save my mistake.\nMy background picture was back, as phone numbers, sms and soon all my apps were back. But no apps had their data left. \n\nSo I went to Settings > Google > Backup > App Data and saw that the Backed-up app data list is empty. Automatic Restore is on and in the backup menu it says \"Waiting to Back Up\"\n\nBy this list being empty: does this mean I lost all my data? There is a possibility it have never saved any data at all, or did it get cleared when I did my factory reset?",
