    "content": "Couldn’t get any results from doing things listed above.  Took my phone and charger to local phone dealer.  He tested my charger, it was okay. He examined my phone and said he thought there might be lint or pocket fuzz in it. He cleaned the port on the phone where one puts charging cord in phone.  He used a different charger and it worked okay.  Didn’t see how he cleaned it.  Charge was $20.00.   Glad to get it back.",
