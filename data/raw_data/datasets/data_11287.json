    "content": "I recently received a Pixel 5. When I loaded it the Google fit was functioning properly. Over time it simply stopped working. I have gone through the settings and made sure that activity tracking is activated and that full system access is granted through the permissions. Google fit still won't work. I downloaded a second app called Qardio to see if it was an application issue. The second app wouldn't track my activity either. I've double checked the settings and I've double checked the permissions to verify that everything is in the correct order. Please advise.",
