    "content": "Hello, received my pixel 4a 5G (clearly white-unlocked) from Bestbuy today. Started it up, during setup noticed the keyboard was glitching with keys popping in and off the keyboard, then once it was loaded, the glitching and flickering happened to everything from fandom blue blocks appearing in different spots, to the icons flickering on an off, individual icons, not all of them. I updated it to the March 2021 update hoping this would fix it but it didn’t. It’s all packed up now to get replaced by google but was wondering if anyone else has encountered this ? I only found issues posted regarding the bottom of the screen or something, not the kind I was experiencing.  Oh and yes, factory reset and safe mode both didn’t fix the issue either.",
