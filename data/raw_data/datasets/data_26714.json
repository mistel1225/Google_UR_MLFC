    "content": "Google pixel 3a I use for work. \n\nLost about a hundred photos,  there is a time gap in my photographs taken. \n\nThe photos directly before these have large areas of grey about 1/4 - 3/4s covering the image, as if they were corrupted.  Attached is example of what I mean. Occurred more than once. They aren't visible on the desktop version, etc etc. \n\n\nI spoke to Google support and screen shared who told me to post here. Cleared cache etc, restarted. Troubleshot with them but they said they can't help and I should post here. \n\nIs there any hope of retrieving these photos? \n\nThanks.",
