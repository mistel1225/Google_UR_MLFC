    "content": "How do you stop the extreme battery drain on the Pixel 3 XL from 30-25% to 0% in seconds? I was already about to charge it and have the charger next to me when it still have around 25% of battery left. Then it suddenly shows a notification saying the battery is at 8% already and by the time I plug the cable, the phone was completely shut off and shows a 0% battery charge.  This happened to me several times. Phone is on the march security update. How to fix this?",
