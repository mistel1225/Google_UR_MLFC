    "content": "Recently I have been experiencing that if I am on a Whatsapp voice call or messenger video call, if I minimize the call and start using another app such as Instagram or Facebook the call gets disconnected. The call gets connected if I move back to the call window. I am not able to use any other app when I am the call.",
