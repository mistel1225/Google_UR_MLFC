    "content": "After updating my phone from Android 10 to the 11 update apps on my phone either take longer to open or don't open at all. I've uninstalled the apps that I was having trouble with and reinstalled them. The problem still exist. I've read alot of bug reports about it online so far. Is there a way to downgrade back to 10 without using a laptop/pc untill the bugs are fixed with the android 11 update?",
