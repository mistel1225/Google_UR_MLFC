    "content": "I just received my Pixel 4 today. When I try to record a slow-motion video, an error appears after 3 seconds of recording: \"Something went wrong. Part of this video may not be saved\".\n\nAll my apps are up-to-date, I have 80% of battery and 80% of free space.\n\nIs there something I can do to fix this?",
