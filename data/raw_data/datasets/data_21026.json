    "title": "Pixel 3a odd navigation & settings changes",
    "content": "My phone randomly (it was in my pocket, was not doing anything, but might have been unlocked in my pocket) has started to display some odd behavior after appearing to restart.\n\nGesture navigation is not working properly. I can go forward and back with side gestures, but I cannot access the home screen or the app menu by swiping up from the bottom. The only way to access the app menu is to swipe up in the middle of the screen from the home screen.\n\nI am also unable to switch between apps by swiping along the bottom of screen.Changing this to 2 button or 3 button does not fix this: the home button simply does not work, but the back and forward buttons do.\n\nAdditionally, the top menu has changed: I used to be able to swipe down, then swipe down again to access an extended menu of options. I can only swipe down once now to toggle wifi, bluetooth, etc., but I can not change the icons that were in this menu like I used to be able to.\n\nDigital Wellbeing has disappeared from my settings.\n\nLastly, dark mode switched off. I can switch it back on, but the setting changed. Previously, my phone remained in dark mode after restart, but now it switches to light mode every restart.\n\nThese are the changes I have noticed so far, but many of my settings, app info, etc. remains intact, making me think it wasn't a factory reset. I am up to date running Android version 10.\n\nCan someone please assist with this? The changes to navigation are severely inhibiting my ability to use the phone. Thanks!",
