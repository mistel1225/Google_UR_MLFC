    "title": "I can’t update or even uninstall google chrome on pixel 4",
    "content": "I was having problems with gmail crashing so I looked it up and apparently google says to update webGL and google chrome. Fine. So I update webGL no problem, and then I go to update chrome but it’s stuck on the pending phase even though there’s nothing else getting downloaded and the internet is working fine. When I click away from it it immediately stops downloading. I even tried uninstalling google chrome but it just doesn’t let me do that. I’ve also tried all the troubleshooting things like restarting refreshing clearing the cache and clearing the storage and everything like that. Would appreciate the help\n\n\nEDIT: I just tried installing the apk listed and the phone just said “you can’t instal this app”",
