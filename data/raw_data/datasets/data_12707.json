    "content": "Pixel 5 on Android 11 notification dot not working on any apps and never has, despite being turned on (texts, email, etc.). Have turned on and off do not disturb and it didn't work. Have turned off notification dot, restarted phone, turned dot back on again, didn't work. Have tried reseting all app permissions and notifications. Didn't work.\n\nSeems like it must be a software issue? Any help would be greatly appreciated.",
