    "content": "My device is set to \"Do Not Disturb\" but to interrupt for calls from starred contacts. However, calls from starred contacts do not ring.\n\nI checked my sound settings and \"ring & notification volume\" is turned on and loud. \n\nIf I change the \"Do Not Distrub\" settings to interrupt for calls from any contacts, it still does not ring when a contact calls.\n\nThe only time it will ring in \"Do Not Disturb\" is if I set it to interrupt for *any* call.\n\nSo it's something to do with the contacts not interacting with \"Do Not Disturb\" maybe? I just updated to Android 11, problems started after update.",
