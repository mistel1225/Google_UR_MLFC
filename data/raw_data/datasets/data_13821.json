    "content": "Hello everyone,\nI just moved to a Pixel 4a from an Xperia ZX (Android 8).\nOn the Xperia, I was able to set which homescreen was the default, but I'm not finding this option on the Pixel.\nPractical example: I like to keep a central homescreen and if I swipe left or right, I can easily access two other homescreens on the sides. I was able to create three homescreens on the PIxel 4a just fine, but the default (the one with date and where wallpapers are centered) is the \"leftmost\", while I want it to be the second, or central.\n\nThank you,",
