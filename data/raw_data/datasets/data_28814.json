    "content": "There seems to be a dead spot on the screen of my brand new pixel 3a. It's in the lower left corner. When I am using the Google keyboard I can't press the \"a\" key (or even slightly to the left of the key without an \"s\" or \"sa\" showing up on it's place. Also notice it in landscape mode when it happens to be on sa \"back\" button or sa bit of text I'm trying to highlight. Tried the screen test, safe mode start, and using it with and without a cover as recommended by Google help. It's the same. The only way I can type or swipe some words is to rotate the screen so the keys reorient and thus are not on the\"dead\" spot. Frustrating! Ideas?",
