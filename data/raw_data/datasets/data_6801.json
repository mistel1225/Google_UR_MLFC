    "content": "So my 3xl has had zero issues. I'm 1.5 years in, and this week this issue started where on a call I could hear the other person but they couldn't hear me. On speakerphone, 4/5 times it worked. With the phone's headphones in, 1/2 times it worked. But never just on normal call setting. \n\nLet me emphatically say: I have tried everything suggested: deleting apps, checking for updates, soft reset, and I did a factory reset. After the factory reset and another soft reset cycle, the problem persisted, as did the inconsistent success with headphones or speakerphones. Aside from literally taking this bitch apart- does anyone have any insight or suggestions as to what I should do next?",
