    "title": "How to get back pictures that were suddenly gone?",
    "content": "Almost 90% of my pictures where deleted on my google photos app.\nAll pictures that where in different folders like messenger, downloands, screenshots, etc, where not deleted. Only the ones under \"camera.\" I did not have the backup setting on. I simply just had all my pictures on my phone, because I did not want them to mix with the pictures that I had on my google account. So they were not saved on my account.\n- I have restared my phone a few times.\n- I have cleared the cache for the photos, and camera apps\n- I tried to do an android data recovery program but it only found the same pictures that were on my phone and not the deleted ones (Its possible that I might not have done this correctly)\n\nPlease help, I had so many pictures, videos, and memories with these pictures :(",
