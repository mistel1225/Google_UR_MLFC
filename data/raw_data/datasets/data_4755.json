    "content": "Recently my apps won't work. For example, when I select the Gmail icon it looks like the app is going to open but then it goes back to the home screen. I disabled it, re-enabled it, cleared out the storage and cache. The app worked briefly but I'm having the same issue where I can't open it. Same thing with accu weather, imgur, list note and more. I have restarted my phone multiple times and it seems like the more apps I try the worst the problem gets.",
