    "content": "Dear all,\n\nI have a problem with my Pixel 3XL(till latest update). It sometimes happen not to keep the volume setting when I play contents by Audible app or Google Play Music. It's usually getting small that seems to be threshold for controlling the volume. It's happened since last year. At the first time, I got the issue was that the volume was getting small by degree. But, After feedback, The volume sudden small. I don't remember it's after updating Android or not. \n\nIf Google controls the volume automatically, It's no mean to handle our volume setting without owner's setting. It's troublesome for us. Also, I don't want to be asked by a message to control the volume by Google. \n\nI've been having problems when I use Google cloud services and products. Also after feedback, I will get strange issues and that a one of them is mentioned above. \n\nIf Google give us a choice for controlling our Android by ourself, We will be happy more. Especially when we listen to the AUDIBLE BOOK and face the matter, What we will get from the matter into the brain? It will kill our concentration at least. \n\nThere is no pattern. But, It will occur again within several days.\n\nKindly give me advice to fix the matter. I cannot wait for fixing the issue by Google.",
