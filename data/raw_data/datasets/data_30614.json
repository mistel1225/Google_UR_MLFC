    "content": "Hello, this is a very specific question I'm hoping someone can answer. \n\nI want to buy a Pixel 3a XL, however I will be in Spain for the next eight weeks. If I buy the phone in Spain, will it work to switch it to the FI network when I get back to the US? I noticed that if I am buying the phone from the US site it provides you with the option to purchase a phone that is \"Optimized for the Fi Network,\" but the Spain site doesn't provide that option. Just hoping to be able to buy a new phone in Spain and then be able to use it on the Fi network when I get back.\n\nThanks, \nCD",
