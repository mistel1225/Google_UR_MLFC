    "title": "How to bmgr restore from Google Drive after factory reset.",
    "content": "I was trying to fix the fatal camera error bug with my phone and tried all the various solutions, the last being the factory reset.  During this I ran into the scheduling issue for backing up my phone data to google drive. (The \"waiting for backup\" message persisting for 24+ hours).  After realizing it wasn't going to work that way, I backed up using the android debug bridge (Command: sudo adb shell bmgr backupnow --all).  That was successful and I see my backup on google drive.  However,  after factory resetting the phone it cannot find the backup on google drive.  All the solutions online say this is a android version issue.  This makes no sense in my situation because it is the same phone and I had tried updating before anything else.  \n\nI have been trying the \"bmgr restore\"  command but I don't have the restore token because it was factory reset.  Due to this the the \"dumpsys backup\"  command shows no current or ancestral restore tokens.  (Information on  the bmgr restore command https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/data/testingbackup.html#TestingRestore)\n\nI am also aware that you can restore directly from a backup file.  This is problematic because google drive will not let me download the backup file.  How the heck can I either get the file or the restore token from google drive?\n\nSummary: The issue I need to solve at the moment is getting my phone restored from a google drive backup even though the phone won't recognize the backup, and my android versions are the same.\n\nAlso, I am on a pixel 2, and the factory reset didn't help the camera issue. Thanks a bunch for the help!",
