    "content": "I have airtel prepaid pack 84days with1.5 GB data per day. My pack is valid for another month.From Feb 1st my phone is not opening any videos,either whatsapp or YouTube etc. My phone shows a message that I have used up 28gb. Mine is daily 1.5 gb. I think this data limit is set hy this device and not by airtel. How to solve this problem? Need help please.",
