    "title": "Files I want to keep are getting deleted",
    "content": "I've got about 1 GB of files I've copied to a local folder on my Pixel2. It seems that every week or two these get deleted. I don't see them backed up to a cloud drive by some process. I can replace them when I go to access them, but it takes a while to transfer over and over. I'm not getting any prompts to clear this directory or clean up space or backup somewhere. I don't know what app or process is doing this, but I'd like it to stop. Is there any way to create a log of what's added or deleted from a directory? or any way to mark these files as read-only or do-not-delete? I haven't been able to figure out any kind of pattern other than it seems to take less than two weeks before these files all disappear into thin air.",
