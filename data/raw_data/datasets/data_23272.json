    "title": "\"Bluetooth keeps stopping\" Error Message since Android 10 update. Does anyone have a solution?",
    "content": "The error message pops up every 3-5 seconds, making using the phone totally impossible. Often the wifi and reception also stop working so the phone is essentially a brick. I have tried everything. Factory reset, restarting multiple times, reinstalling all apps... Nothing has solved the problem. I have spoken to multiple Google Fi support reps and nobody can help me. From looking online, this is a known problem that is caused by Android updates, yet Google is refusing to take responsibility. I have been a hardcore Google phone user since the first Nexus, but after I finish paying off this phone, I am going to be switching away from Android and Google as the Google support has been appalling, and they do not stand behind their products.",
