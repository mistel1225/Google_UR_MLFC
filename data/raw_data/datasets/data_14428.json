    "content": "I have a small dent in my 3a XL's ear speaker grill that I got like 4 months ago, happened out of no where, I set my phone face down and left for 5 minutes, came back and it was dented. Just wondering what y'all would recommend for hiding it/fixing it, I was thinking maybe I could make a custom dbrand skin that fits in there to hide it, but idk how reliable that would be. I don't want to get it completely replaced because it's functioning just fine and sounds good and UBreakIFix would make me factory reset to perform anything on the phone. First world problem but it gets really annoying having the dent in my face especially when the rest of the body is almost flawless and the phone is barley a year old.",
