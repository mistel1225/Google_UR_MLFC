    "title": "Accidentally answering calls when retrieving phone from pocket",
    "content": "When I receive a call (or text) on my Pixel 3a while in my pocket, the screen activates and responds screen interaction, while still in my pocket.  The problem I have with this is when I receive the call and I reach in my pocket to pull out my phone, often my finger will touch the screen and send input, which has caused unintended actions, such as accidentally answering a call before I even get my phone out, accidentally using the screen call feature, or accidentally denying the call.\n\nI believe the Pixel 3a must have a sensor on the front of it, so I think it should be able to use this to determine if it's in a pocket, or face down on something, etc, like for the do not disturb feature.\n\nThe solution that I'm looking for is to receive the call or text, but the phone not respond to any screen interaction as long as the sensor believes the phone is in my pocket, then when I retrieve the phone from my pocket, I can then interact with the screen.\n\nI am not interested in any third party apps to solve this issue, as I do not trust apps.  That is correct, I use smartphones and I've only ever used probably less than 10 apps from specific developers that I trust.\n\nThanks in advance for any help provided!",
