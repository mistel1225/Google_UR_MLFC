    "content": "So, I'm about to have a multi day trip in a van to move from one end of the US to the other with two little girls that would love to watch downloaded disney+ movies to keep them entertained on our van's uconnect theater which has HDMI and direct streaming features. Pretty cool! My wife and I both have the Pixel 3 XL which we loved up until this point. Bought a USB3 to HDMI adapter. Didn't work. It was apparently disabled to require chromecast instead. Tried to direct stream using miracast which every android phone supports but that was also disabled because...chromecast. Guess what, Google? I can't use chromecast unless I'm on a WiFi network which is not possible here.  Because of Google's greed, our phones are the least useful android phones for portable entertainment in this situation.  Does anyone know of a possible workaround?",
