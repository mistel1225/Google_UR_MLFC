    "title": "Android 11 google Assistant getting stuck on the bottom of the screen.",
    "content": "I don't even use google assistant and have setting disabled for \"squeeze\" for google assistant feature, but ever since the \"google play system update\" that came out earlier this week the google assistant pre-launch animation keeps getting stuck on the bottom of my screen. It's just a bunch of colored frozen animation that eats up the bottom 20 percent of the screen so I can't access the keyboard at all. The only way I've found to get rid of it is a restart of the phone. Android 11 as a whole has seemed extremely buggy since release and this is now the 4th issue I've had since updating.",
