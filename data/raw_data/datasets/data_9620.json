    "title": "Pixel 4A touch screen partially unresponsive and not working",
    "content": "The lower portion of my Pixel 4a touchscreen is not responding to clicks. The phone was purchased in October, so it is only two months old. \n\nI took a screenshot of the phone (from a random YouTube video) and highlighted the specific in red area that is not functioning. As you see in the picture, I cannot click the 'checkmark' to complete entering my pin - which means I could not unlock and access my phone.\n\nI booted up my phone in Safe Mode, but the problem persisted.\n\nI most recently did a Factory Reset, but the problem persisted. My phone is completely unusable now, since I am facing a similar issue of completing my phone set-up since I can not click checkmarks to progress to the next stages of the set-up process.\n\nAny advice on what to do next? I am traveling aboard currently so this is an major hassle and any recommendations is appreciated.",
