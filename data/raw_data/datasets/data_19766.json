    "title": "Pixel 4XL shutting down after June 5 2020 Update",
    "content": "My phone installed the June 5 2020 security update and immediately had problems. The phone keeps shutting down when locked/asleep and you don't know it until you try to wake/unlock it. I've tried a factory data reset and restarting in safe mode and problem persists. \n\nThe phone is definitely shut down because I've tried calling it and it won't wake up and it has to power up and reboot Android. \n\nIt seems to do okay when plugged in with a screen saver on. However, thought the day I would estimate having to power it back on around 15 times a day and I miss calls/texts. \n\nThis has hindered my job as a paramedic where I get important patient and mapping information via text.\n\nPLEASE find the bug with the June 5 2020 update, fix it, and push another update out ASAP!",
