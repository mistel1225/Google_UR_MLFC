    "content": "I have an Unlocked Pixel 4a 5g device and have obtained a Verizon 5G SIM card.  Upon provisioning the device, I am unable to get sub-6 5G.  I can only get LTE.  When I use Google Fi (T-mobile's network), I am able to get 5g just fine using an eSIM.  Does anyone know if the Unlocked version of the Pixel 4a 5g is supposed to get 5g with Verizon on sub-6 as of today?  Or is this a future update for this model?",
