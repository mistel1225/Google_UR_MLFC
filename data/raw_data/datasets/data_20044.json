    "title": "Pixel 4 xl battery stuck on 50% plus my Pixel shuts down when in my pocket",
    "content": "I purchased the Pixel 4xl  128 GB after Christmas this year, all was fine until after a recent update, My battery stays on 50%, also every time I put the Pixel in my pocket, it turns off.  After several Google searches, It has become clear to me that this is a common occurrence. I truly love this phone, however not knowing the true battery percentage is quite problematic as is shutting off every time I put it in my pocket. Has anyone discovered a solution to these problems?",
