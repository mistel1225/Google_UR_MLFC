    "content": "My always on display didn't work correctly since day one, it only works with double tap, if I always keep it on, it takes a yellowish tone, however i thought it will get fixed with a patch.\n\nUSB-C port, it failed about 6 months ago, i tried to clean it and still doesn't work.\n\nProblem when turning on, if my phone turns off, or I reset it, I can only turn it on by connecting a cable, even if it still has battery, for example I can have 100% battery and turn it off manually, however if i want to turn it on, the power button wont work until y connect a cable to the phone.\n\nFinally my last problem is the back camera, it doesn't focus, I need to get like 2-3 inches close to something to get an acceptable photo, if not the image is all blurry, I already forced stop the app, cleaned the cache, and used other apps.\n\nAlso I tried to contact with warranty however I can't find the way.",
