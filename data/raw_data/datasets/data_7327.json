    "content": "When im on a call, I cannot use speakerphone or the other person cannot hear me. I have to basically yell right next to the microphone for them to tell me they can finally hear me but it is muffled. The phone is brand new and there are no clarity issues when not on a call normally, only when using speakerphone.",
