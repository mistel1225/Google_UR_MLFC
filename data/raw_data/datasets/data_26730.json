Let us know if it solves your battery drains.\n\nUPDATE 9/23: Google added another build today as QP1A.190711.020.C3. They didnâ€™t say who the build is for or if it fixes something critical, but that build is available for the Pixel 3a and 3a XL, as well as the Pixel 3 and 3 XL.\n\nhttps://www.droid-life.com/2019/09/23/android-10-updates-pixel-phone-google/",
