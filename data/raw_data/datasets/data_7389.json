    "content": "I upgraded to Android 11 in the System settings (OTA) since then I have massive battery issues. My phone lasts around 4h without use after charged to 100%. The phone feels constantly warm.\n\nSystem settings don't show any suspicious app. I rebooted twice already. \n\nAny idea what I could do to fix the issue? \n\nThanks for your help!",
