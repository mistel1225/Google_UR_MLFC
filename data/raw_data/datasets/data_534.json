    "content": "Hi all, my 4a 5g works well, apart from the location - I can see with GPS test that it's getting a strong signal, but the location on maps is slightly out - around 10m. When I try and use maps for navigation, it often thinks its alongside the road rather than on it - this causes trouble when it thinks it's crossing another road, it \"locks on\" to the wrong road. It's very annoying that I can't use the navigation. I've tried everything online that's been suggested short of a factory reset, which seems an extreme thing to try!, I have tried turning wifi/bluetooth location aid on and off and calibrating the compass. The 4a is running Android 11.",
