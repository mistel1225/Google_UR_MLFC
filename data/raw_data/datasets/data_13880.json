    "content": "Defective screen, raised around the edge, had small gap. I thought was design. But judging by the money posts online, it is a defect. \n\nEffected integrity of the screen. So shattered after drop from pocket (1m). This isn't what I'd expect from gorilla glass 6, as supposed to be the toughest yet. My last 3 phones survived a few drops without a scratch. \n\nContacted support, although, is almost impossible to speak with anyone. Was told I would get an email on what to do. No reply, still waiting.",
