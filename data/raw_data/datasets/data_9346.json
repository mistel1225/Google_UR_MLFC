    "content": "As of 2 days ago my Pixel 3 battery percentage has stayed the same - 59%. It was working fine for nearly 16 months.  I went through ALL options including 3 chat assistants. No resolution and/or fix.\n\nLet me help others so you don't waste your time.  This is a \"baked in\" issue that is in ALL Pixel phones.  It's like a time bomb.  When you research this issue nothing works as a fix...short or long term and Google has said it will send out a fix at some point for the 5.  Well...for those of us with earlier models that tells you all you need to know. Again...this is a persistent, fundamental flaw.\n\nOf course...Google will lean on the warranty but, if this is a baked in issue, it was there across builds from the start.  They'll then say...\"buy an upgraded model\".  Well...when researched...the issue will still be in any upgrade as well.\n\nI can't say this enough...avoid the Pixel.  What's frustrating is this is a well documented issue across the years.  Its a 50/50 shot it will probably hit your phone post warranty...so.. you're spending a LOT of money for an already flawed phone that will at some point have this issue.   There will be no recourse on the back end unless you're in warranty AND your replacement will still be flawed.\n\nI'm just sayin'!",
