    "title": "Pixel 4 XL will not save voice recognition. Assistant is grayed out and will not turn on.",
    "content": "I have tried all of the official \"fixes\" in https://goo.gle/2H5hF5N. I then tried turning back the Google update. On restart, the Google app would not work until I re-installed the update. Assistant still does not work at all, either with voice or text. Before the latest update, it worked randomly and would frequently turn itself off. Now, the phone will not save voice recognition. It just hangs on the final screen and the only option is to cancel.",
