    "content": "Good afternoon, after six months of using the Google Pixel 4a 5G smartphone, there was a problem with fast charging. That is, if earlier the phone on fast charging took an average of 1 hour 15 minutes, now it takes 2 hours 30 minutes. Google Store from Russia, Moscow. Unfortunately, here the masters do not want to take on such a thing. I am responsible for all shipping costs. Can you please tell me how this can be done?\nMaria",
