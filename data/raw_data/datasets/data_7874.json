    "content": "Whenever I install a blue light filter app, the phone vibrates throughout the night (even when it is on do not disturb).\nIt is vibrating due to a system notification advising that the blue light filter app is displaying over other apps.\nThese notification types are set to silent with no vibration, however there is a bug in the system causing them to vibrate. It keeps me awake all night.\n\nSee below a screenshot of the notification setting.\n\nNote there is no option to disable the notification.",
