    "content": "Trying to figure out why my phone randomly plays a notification song that isn't in the library of alarms and when there is no alarm set, and no notification, and no activity on the phone.\n\nTwice now, several weeks apart, not necessarily at the same time each occasion, and most recently at 5:23pm today, my phone randomly and loudly started playing what sounds like an alarm sound/song-- a repeating musical tone \"dum, dum, da da da..dum, dum, da da da....dum dum da da da... It goes on for about a minute and then stops- nothing is happening, no notifications appear, the notification record shows only things like maps updates on traffic, and I have no alarms set.  \n\nTotally puzzled and lost. I'm not technology illterate, but this pixel 3 is my first Android phone and this mysterious and unexplanable behavior is annoying and worrisome.",
