    "content": "An app purchased from Google store last year had been working. Recently it closes as soon as I open it.\nMy Android system is updated and fine. Attempted to update the app, but it is no longer listed in app store. Strangely the list of apps on the phone now omits it, but icon remains. Presumably some of source code still here as it opens momentarily. What;s going on & what can be done ? App is iChess pro. I've contacted them but no reply yet.",
