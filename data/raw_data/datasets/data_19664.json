    "content": "Why is Google Play system update is slow and what is the purpose of it. Google didn't plann the exact release like, when it should release monthly wise or 90 days whereas security patch will release monthly basis but Google Play system update is not releasing properly and we don't know when it's releasing. If it is being released there is no notification pops up we have to check manually and update. It's quite irritating that every time we have to check whether update is released or not. \nNow currently Google Play system update is running May 1 patch.",
