    "content": "So the problem started 3 weeks ago; my phone wasn't charging with the USB C to C Official charger, but using my oneplus charger, charged the Pixel.\n\nI contacted Google Support, and they shipped me a new Google Charger, and this did charge my phone. Until yesterday, the phone was charging, it suddenly switched off and the charger stopped working.\n\nNow; whats the fix for this issue? It's getting really annoying, as the other 3rd party chargers do not \"fast\" charge.",
