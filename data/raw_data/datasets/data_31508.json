    "title": "I've lost some camera functions since, I assume, an update. Lost fish eye lens and block panorama.",
    "content": "As above, I used to have different camera functions which disappeared some time ago. I used to love the function that enabled you to take a 'panorama' in blocks so an image would actually consist of a square of 4 shots in one. I took some amazing photos this way. I don't remember what that function was called. There also used to be a fish eye lens and I think others too. I can't find them anywhere.",
