    "title": "Getting RCS with Google Messages to work on an older phone",
    "content": "Myself and another family member have Google Pixel 3 phones and I can tell within Google Messages that our text messages are being sent via RCS however my wife has an old Droid Turbo.  I installed Google Messages on her phone and read that she needed Carrier Services installed as well.  Both apps are now installed and her phone has been restarted however when I send her a text from my phone it's still showing that the message will be sent via SMS not RCS.  What needs to happen so our messages to each other are all sent via RCS?  Note that all phones are Verizon.",
