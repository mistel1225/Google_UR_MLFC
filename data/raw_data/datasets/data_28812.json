    "content": "I have a pixel XL that has a boot loop problem. Google support told me I had to figure it out with the seller I bought it from since I did not buy it from the google store. That being said, it may be easier to get a new phone. However, looking online, it seems the boot loop problem is common in pixel phones. Are there any pixel models that do not have this as a common problem? Thanks in advance!",
