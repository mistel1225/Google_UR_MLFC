    "content": "First of all, let me just say that I still use my Pixel XL.  Why?  Because I refuse to spend good money on another cell phone when this one works just fine.  Having said that, yesterday morning, 06/24/20, my Gmail app refused to work.  It would crash and I finally went on here tonight to figure out what to do.  Turns out, Google did an update on all its apps a couple of days ago, at nighttime when I schedule this things, causing my problem.  I took the advice of someone here who posted a response to someone who upgraded to Android 10 on their Pixel 3 or some other similar, newer Pixel last year.  They suggested uninstalling the last update without resetting the device to factory settings.  I uninstalled the updates to my Gmail, and, lo and behold, it worked.  Mind you, I have the older version of Gmail but I really don't care.  As long as I can access my default mail app, I am satisfied.  Thank you to the Gmail community for asking similar questions, enabling me to resolve my issue.  (Original poster had issue w/ Android 10 upgrade, my problem was issue w/ Gmail update.  Similar, not same, but close enough.)",
