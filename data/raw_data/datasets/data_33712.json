    "content": "During phone calls, it keeps going in and out of signal and people cannot hear you or you hear them. This is terrible for a Â£1000 phone almost. I've tried turning off 4g advanced settings, I've rebooted and even checked that I have current software. Also looking online, this phone has the same issue world wide. Is there anything that could be done for me.  Kind regards kieron",
