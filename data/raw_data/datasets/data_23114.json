    "content": "My Pixel 4XL is turned on but it's not charging. I have about 5% left so contacting support from within the phone would be pointless. How else do I contact support to file a warranty claim?\n\nCurrently running Android 10 with the latest February security update.\n\nEdit: To discard some  possibilities, the phone has never received any impact and it's never gotten wet. Already tried 3 different USB-C chargers and even connected it directly a USB-C port on a laptop. Haven't tested wireless charger since I don't have any.",
