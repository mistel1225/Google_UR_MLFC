    "title": "Pixel 3A XL keeps restarting when a SIM card is inserted or Mobile Data is turned on",
    "content": "It started yesterday (on 11/05). I went out from subway and when my phone reestablished LTE connection this issue begins.\nIt happens in Safe mode also.\nReboots not occurring only when the SIM slot is empty or Airplane mode is on (or Mobile data is off). The SIM works fine on my old Nexus 6.\n\nSometimes it allows me to use LTE for 1-5 mins.\n\nOn that day I got November security patch and also my Carrier services app was updated nearly the time of first reboot.",
