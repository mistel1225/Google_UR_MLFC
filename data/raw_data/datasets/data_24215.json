    "content": "So I know this has been mentioned here a few times already but the answers were never very helpful except to say you can't. I would like it if someone could work with me to find a proper solution for my problem.\n\nMy work is still living in the past and due to the nature of our work it makes sense. Security is very high on our networks. We don't have WiFi in any of the buildings, our firewall blocks everything that is entertaining (Netflix, YouTube, Twitter), and we are unable to connect any other device to the network without the security guys coming down and screaming at us. Just one TV in the break room with a DVD player, no cable. We also work 12 hour shifts and I can't look at the news sites any longer to pass the time.\n\nI would like to download movies or shows to my phone or use the download for offline feature that many apps offer like Netflix and YouTube. Or even use my data when I can. I want to connect my phone to a TV or projector over HDMI so I can enjoy them on the big screen.\n\nI know Google dosn't add the OTG feature to their lineup anymore in favour of the wireless cast feature. BUT COMMON!!! There has to be a way that I can use the USB-C port with some sort of hub to get HDMI. I am sure Google can implement this with a software update.\n\nCan someone help me on this. Is it possible to cast to a chromecast with absolutly no internet/data over WiFi direct? (is that still here, thought I heard it was going to be removed soon)\n\nThanks,\nBen",
