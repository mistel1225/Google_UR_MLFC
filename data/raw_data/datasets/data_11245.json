    "title": "Live Caption on my Pixel 5 lags behind audio after the first few minutes of captioning.",
    "content": "When watching media or on a phone call, if I am using Live Caption, after the first few minutes the captions start lagging behind the audio. This gets worse and worse, and then all of a sudden the captions will speed way up and blow through several minutes and catch back up to real time. This cycle repeats as long as the call or media is going. This gets really frustrating because I lose track of the speaker / media because the captions get slower and slower. Need some help to understand why this is happening and what to do?",
