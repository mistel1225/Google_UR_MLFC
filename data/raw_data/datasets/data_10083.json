    "content": "I have the Sound Search widget on my 1st generation Pixel that works great. I just got the Pixel 4a and tried \"Now Playing\" but there is no comparison. On my old phone I can just click the Sound Search icon and identify any song that is playing. Now Playing on the other hand doesn't seem to have that on demand functionality and hasn't identified many songs.\n\nDoes Google have something on the 4a that works like \"Sound Search\" on the 1st generation?\n\nHere is a picture of the widget I am talking about",
