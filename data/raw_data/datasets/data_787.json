    "content": "I bought this in California & was using it there. I came to India for vacation & was using this phone on a normal day here at 31degree Celsius & suddenly my phone turned off stating excessive heat ! Seriously ?? Is this made to work only in non tropical countries. I was showing of the picture quality etc to my friends back home when it happened & they told our phones may not take that great pics but atleast they won't turn off complaining its a hot humid day !! I was embarrassed. When the phone turn on after 10-15 mins I took the screenshots. Please fix the google pixel if you are expecting this to work in all habitable climates ! I am disappointed here with this performance flaw.",
