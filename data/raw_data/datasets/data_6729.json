    "title": "Google lost my phone. There is no update from support staff. What do I do?",
    "content": "I sent my phone to google on January 1st because the battery died and it was still under the manufacture warranty. They claimed my screen was cracked and tried to charge me $129 for a replacement phone, which is ridiculous. I opted to have the phone sent back, in order to prove that the phones screen wasn't cracked. They informed me on the 5th that my phone would be shipped back within 2-3 business days. Its now been 10 days, and I have no tracking number or any idea of where my phone is. Google support staff has told me that my case has been elevated and they now have a \"tier 3\" person on it. They keep on telling me \"thank you for your patience\" and that they \"will update you when we get an update\". \nSo basically google voided the manufacture warranty, failed to fix my phone, and then lost it. I cant seem to find anyone in the google support staff that has half of a brain or is able to do anything to help me resolve this. I have spent too much time with google support over chat, phone and email but I don't seem to be getting anywhere. Any suggestions?",
