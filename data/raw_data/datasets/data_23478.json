    "content": "Hey guys,\n\nGot a brand new pixel 3xl. Everything's working fine, except the twist gesture to flip the camera to selfie and back.\n\nWent through all the steps with support, including a factory reset - nothing helped.\n\nI checked the gyroscope using other apps - it's working fine. Other similar gestures, like \"flip to shh\" is working fine too.\n\nI even tried opting into the Android Q beta, but the feature's still not working there.\n\nAt this point it's either go through the entire return process (a lot of hassle) or live with the problem. I'm ok with the latter if this issue is not signifying any underlying hardware problem.\n\nAny idea what it could be? Should I be going through the return process?\n\nThanks!",
