    "content": "I ejected the SIM tray when I got the device with the included SIM ejection tool. The tray is now slightly warped. I bought a case so I can't feel the imperfection now. I worry it ruins the water proof.\n\nGoogle support said device damage is now warranty void. I don't feel it was my fault. \n\nThe screen also scratches easily I have never had a problem with any of these devices.\n\nI have had all the Nexus and pixels and never had these problems.",
