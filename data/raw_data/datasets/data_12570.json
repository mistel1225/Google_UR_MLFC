    "title": "Pixel 5 - Voice Typing no longer working on Google Pixel 5",
    "content": "Currently the issue on only when attempting to get voice typing to output text into Gboard. Google assistant still works, although it seems slower than it did before.\n\nIf I attempt to press the gboard mic button in a facebook messenger bubble, the bubble closes. If I do it in any kind of app, the microphone seems to hear me, but never adds any text and just turns off.\n\nI've changed all of the \"faster voice typing\" settings. Updated my phone to the November security update, turned it off and back on a hundred times, disable and re-enabled voice typing. Reinstalled Gboard, cleared app cache and storage, uninstalled and reinstalled languages and offline languages packs.\n\nThis is the primary way I use my device, literally all day long and it's basically useless without it. I'm completely stuck.\n\nI've had the device for about a week now and have been using voice typing (ie. \"talk to text\") for that entire time.",
