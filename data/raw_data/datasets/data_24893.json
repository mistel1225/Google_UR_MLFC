    "title": "Bluetooth audio max volume is low",
    "content": "My audio is very low when connected to any Bluetooth device compared to other smartphones I've used in the past. I have tried everything from disabling absolute volume in Bluetooth settings, to forgetting all my bluetooth devices and reconnecting. I have even restored factory settings but there was still no difference.\n\nThe volume isn't so low that it is unusable, but it is frustrating when trying to turn my audio up just a little bit louder and it won't get any louder. I know that it can get louder as when I use wired headphones with the adaptor, there is a noticeable difference in the max volumes.  \n\nMy maximum Bluetooth volume is about the equivalent of 3/4 volume with wired headphones.\n\nAny help would be appreciated! :)",
