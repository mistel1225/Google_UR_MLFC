    "content": "I've had my Pixel 2 XL for about a year, and it has been awesome. About a week ago, the fingerprint sensor has stopped working. Each time I try to unlock it, I don't get the confirmation vibration and instead it says \"Couldn't process fingerprint. Please try again.\" \n\nWhen this first happened, if restarted the phone it would work once or twice (after I initially used the pin to log in) but then go back to not processing the fingerprint. It now won't even do that.\n\nI booted it into safe mode, but it didn't work in safe mode either. \n\nAny recommendations?",
