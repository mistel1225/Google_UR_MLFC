    "content": "Two weeks ago my phone prompted me to try the new \"extreme battery save\" (EBS) mode on my Pixel 4 XL. I enabled it and it worked fine. When I got home, I charged my phone to 100% EBS never disabled. I tried a standard reset, tried safe mode, checked \"never\" in the EBS setting under battery. Nothing has worked and its been this way for 2 weeks. \n\nI think that it has also affected my ability to make calls. I cant hear or be heard once a call is connected. I have no issues calling over whatapp though (note: I had to unpause the Whatsapp app to use it in EBS).",
