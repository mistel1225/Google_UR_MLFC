    "content": "I just purchased a new pixel 3 128gb last week, and I am noticing bad battery drain. I full charged phone at 1:30, and left the phone on standby without ambient display. By 9am the battery has dropped 77%.\n\nSo far I have had to always charge the phone every 12 hours, so I am wondering if I should return the phone or if there's a fix I can do myself to improve battery life. Also worth noting out of the box, my Pixel 3 hasn't been changed in 316 days.",
