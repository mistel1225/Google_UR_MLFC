    "content": "Last night I was on YouTube when I realized that I could only turn the volume up and not down.\nI checked for any software update, thinking it might because I had not updated my phone for a while.\nBut when it started updating, not only could I not use the volume down button, but the volume up and power buttons stopped working as well.\nNow my phone has everything updated but none of the physical buttons work so it is quite annoying (I can unlock it with my fingerprints but still)\nI have no idea whether it is a software or hardware issue, but I really need help.\nThank you for your time",
