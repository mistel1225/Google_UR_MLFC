    "content": "Hello, I keep my phone to charge at 11:00pm and it displays it's charging adaptively and will be full by my alarm time which is 8:00am. But the problem is it gets charged way early. When I woke up at 4:30am the phone was already charged. Please fix this issue at the earliest as it affects the battery negatively.",
