    "content": "I have disinstalled and reinstalled Skype app, unpaired and re-paired car bluetooth. Phone is new, only got it in June. It worked fine until about 2 weeks ago, when it stopped working in the middle of a conversation  I was using my headset for. Skype representatives were no help. Thank you.",
