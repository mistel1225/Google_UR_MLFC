    "content": "I am trying to make a landscape selfie / vlog video using a selfie stick with a click button. When I have the phone plugged into the selfie stick there is no sound. I can't talk to google assistant - it can't hear me - and when I make a vid it doesn't record sound. how can I turn the sound on? It is set to internal mic on. I can change it to external mic, but that makes no sense as I don't have an external mic. Also if I mount the selfie stick in a vice beyond arms reach I want to voice-activate the video rather than using the selfie stick button - is this possible?",
