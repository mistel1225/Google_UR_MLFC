    "title": "After Android 11 update, Maps navigation through Android Auto won't work.",
    "content": "After the last update, Android Auto crashes on my AVIC-8200NEX unit. It starts to navigate when it connects, but it stops navigating and only shows the map. I have updated the Android Auto app and the Maps app, but it doesn't work. I also have issues with connecting phone calls sometimes too now, but I only care about fixing the navigation. I have also tried turning off Bluetooth, but it didn't help. Any suggestions? Thank you!",
