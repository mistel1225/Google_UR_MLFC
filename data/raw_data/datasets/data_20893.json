    "title": "HELP ME - Cannot get a return shipping label sent to new email address!!!",
    "content": "I purchased my phone and the warranty protection plan with an old work email address which no longer exists. When I put in a claim with Assurant I noted the change in emails and asked them to send all communication, including the return shipping label, to my new email address.  This did not happen.  I chatted with Google Support for over there hours and have emailed back and forth with support nearly a dozen times and they are somehow unable to re-associate my account with a new email address and send me a return shipping label.  Now Assurant is threatening to charge me \"up to $2,000\" for an unreturned equipment fee.  \n\nGoogle Support points me back to Assurant to get a shipping label, and Assurant then tells me that they can only come from Google, and back and forth and I'm completely stuck.  This is insane.\n\nWhy is Google unable to get a return shipping label to me to a new email address?  Am I the first person in the history of Google to change emails?  I don't understand why nobody will help me.",
