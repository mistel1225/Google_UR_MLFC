    "content": "Having issues unlocking my phone.  Phone does not wake up when i pick it up or take out of my pocket.  Says I should clean top of screen including black bar.  I have done that several times.  I have restarted my phone several times.  I restarted in safe mode several times.  Problem persists.  Not a 3rd party app since problem persists in safe mode.  Reddit users say a factory reset does nothing.  It seems to have resulted from a update in May.  Recent June updates did not include a fix.  Only way to unlock it is to drag finger from bottom of phone all the way to the top and enter passcode.  Also related problem is that phone screen does not go dark when talking on the phone.  so I end up pressing all kinds of buttons with my face (mute, flashlight, etc..)  Please help!!!!\n\nAdvice from a Pixel expert would be great.  Others have posted same problem on Reddit.",
