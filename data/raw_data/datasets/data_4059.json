    "content": "I sent someone a link a few days ago and they never got it. I kept trying and they wouldnt get it. Today someone texted me asking if I had any feedback on the link they sent a few days ago. after troubleshooting I realized if I send a link to someone with an iphone they wont get them and vice versa. Things I learned while troubleshooting, if I use a share feature from youtube, those work fine, from a browser fails, from tiktok fails, typed directly into the text also fails. any suggestions to fix this?",
