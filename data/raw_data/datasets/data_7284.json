    "content": "The camera constantly crashes on me and does 't work. I took a picture Sunday morning, tried to take another picture 8 hours later and that's when it stopped working entirely. So February 8th.\n\nIve done a factory reset, I've tried it in safe mode, I've gone into the camera app itself and uninstalled updates. I've tried just using the front facing camera. Nothing works.\n\nI have a 9 month old daughter, my first kid. This phone is my only source of a camera and Video recorder. She just started crawling and is pulling herself up to walk. I'm not able to capture any of this.\n\nBeyond annoyed at this, especially after reading everything here with people complaining with no solution.",
