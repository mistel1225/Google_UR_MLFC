    "title": "Pixel 4 sees l5 GPS but accuracy is still low",
    "content": "After December 2019 my pixel 4 XL sees both L5 GPS and E5a Galileo signals. However positioning accuracy is still pretty low (see screenshot). After a lot of hype about sub metre positioning with L5, is this as good as pixel 4xl will get? \n\nI've tested positioning on a permanent survey mark- results verified the GPStest figures below.\n\nI really hope some better processing is coming, in the meantime happy to hear if there's just an option I need to set somewhere..",
