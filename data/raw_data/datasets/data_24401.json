    "content": "Hi Pixel Community,  \n\nI am facing a problem regarding the low volume of the phone when it's connected to wired earphones. I am using Apple earphones 3.5 mm with a USB type C connector. The volume is pretty low even on high system volume.  It seems to work fine when connected via Bluetooth. I have airpods that are working perfectly. \n\nThanks",
