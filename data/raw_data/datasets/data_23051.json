    "content": "I connected to my home WiFi in setup but after that, the phone would load endlessly. In response, I skipped all the setup including transfer of data from my old phone, which I would now like to do. I thought what I did would circumvent the problem as I reached the home page and settings, but when I go back to settings to 'finish setup' it again gets stuck 'preparing for setup.' It's my first day with it. What can I do?",
