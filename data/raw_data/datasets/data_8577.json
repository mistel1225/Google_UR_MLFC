    "content": "I've connected to some airpods dozens of times but each time I turn on Bluetooth the same three Bluetooth pairings are listed and I've only connected to those maybe once or twice. Shouldn't the top three items for 'previously connected devices'  be things I've paired to the most or most recently? Seems like poor coding or a bug.",
