    "content": "I get a blank screen when I open the app, and can't send or receive text messages. Often, but not always, I will have a notification saying \"Messages is working in the background\" while this happens. I've cleared cache and cleared data, and tried restarting my phone.  I've tried uninstalling updates. All give me 10-15 minutes of respite before problem starts again.",
