    "content": "1. Most of the time phone calls don't have audio. \n\n2. my phone won't put out audio all together\n\n3. The battery dies even though my phone claims to be at 25-45%\n\n\nTo fix #1 and #2 I would turn my phone off and then as I turn it back on while holding all of the buttons until the screen turned off but that doesn't work anymore\n\nThe battery part could be because I bought it refurbished  but #1and #2 I've fixed without moving my phone.\n\nI HAVE HAD THESE ISSUES EVEN AFTER FACTORY RESETTING AND NOT RESTORING A BACKUP OR EVEN INSTALLING ANY APPS",
