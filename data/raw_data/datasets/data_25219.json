    "content": "I've tried to contact Google by chat, no answer. Don't know what else to do. Thought it was me, but discovered it is a very common problem for many people! No matter how many times I set the volume to ring as high as I can I can't hear it ring....ever! I'm missing doctor calls, calls from vets, important stuff! Why can't Google fix this? Or is it that they won't! Was talked into this phone and will never, ever buy anything from Google again!!!!!!!!?!",
