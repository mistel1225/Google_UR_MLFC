    "content": "When updating to the Jan. security patch 9n my Pixel 4, I got this message:\n\n\"Hi Trusted Testers! This update fixes critical bugs and improves the performance and stability of your device. Cheers!\"\n\nI searched around a bit and found Google has several \"Trusted Tester\" programs. Is this a normal \"update text\", or did I somehow get into a trusted tester program? (I haven't gotten any notifications/emails/texts about it)\n\nThanks!",
