    "title": "Pixel 3 kills background apps while charging",
    "content": "Since a few months now, my Pixel 3 kills any app that is not running in the foreground when charging.\n\nThis is especially annoying when driving. Android Auto is basically unusable since it requires the phone to be plugged in (and therefore charging) and it will kill everything (waze, spotify, android auto itself) after a few seconds of use. I have noticed the phone will not kill an app that is running in the foreground so I could keep Android Auto alive but other apps will still get killed, rendering Auto useless.\n\nI am therefore forced to drain the battery and connect to the car via bluetooth for music and navigation. But when my battery has drained too much (inevitable on longer drives), I have to choose a single app that I want to run on my phone and keep the screen on at all times to keep it alive (e.g. if I need Waze on for navigation and alerts, I have a choice between the radio or silence for entertainment).\n\nThere are a couple other issues linked to charging like the phone getting laggy, sometimes to the extreme, when plugged in to charge (with the official charger or otherwise) or the phone charging very slowly (10-15% over 2 hours) on the official Pixel stand; but, if these are unrelated, then the issue described above is for me the most pressing.\n\nThank  you",
