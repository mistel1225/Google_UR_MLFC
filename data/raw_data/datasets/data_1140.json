    "content": "Google pixel xl 3a was working fine while watching youtube but then the screen suddenly froze. I turned the phone off and then on again, and the screen was completely black. The screen won't respond at all, but I know the phone is on because it vibrates and I can feel the phone unlock with the fingerprint scan. There are other posts where people are asking the same question and having the same issue with their phone, but google keeps locking the threads.\n\nTried all the suggestions listed in this video:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJpiabgRQ8I\n\nIt would be helpful if we could discuss this without the threads being locked, since so many people keep having the exact same issue with google phones.",
