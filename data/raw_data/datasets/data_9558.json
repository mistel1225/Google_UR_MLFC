    "content": "The microphone stops working when I put the phone in speakerphone mode. I've tried factory data resetting the phone and that hasn't fixed the issue.  I can't believe Google puts out such a terrible product. I paid $800 for this phone and am extremely disappointed by the lack of quality! I've been a long time google user and supporter but the recent missteps by google is making me seriously consider moving to the iphone ecosystem. I had a different hardware quality issue with my Pixel 3XL phone and I had to get that replaced by Google as well. I hope there is a software fix for this issue. If Google asks me to RMA this phone, I want my money back and I am just going to switch to iPhone. Seriously! this is bad!",
