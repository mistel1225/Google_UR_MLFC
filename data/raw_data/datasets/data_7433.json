    "title": "Too many watts for pixel 4a?",
    "content": "Will my pixel 4a be able to tolerate a 60w (or more) charge pack. I am wanting to use 10ft usb-c cable, which requires higher voltage. Would like to buy a usb-c 3.0 (3.1), but not sure if that will be too many watts (or volts, or amps?).   Google forum says usb-c 2.0 but seems that does not have enough power for more than 6ft cable. \n\nIf your electronic smarts are powerful, ...what I really would like is to use 2 8ft cables for total of 16ft. Can usb-c 3.0(3.1) push through that length? I have seen some 3A 20v 60 watt OR 4A 20v 80 watt that should be enough power for 12ft or 16ft usb-c cable length. \n\nPlease and thank you for sharing your knowledge, (and your time). \n\nI believe hardware/software of phone means NO faster charging than 9v 2A 18watt because that is maximum phone will allow. Which means phone should be safe, but my need is for longer cable, which means 60-100 watts.",
