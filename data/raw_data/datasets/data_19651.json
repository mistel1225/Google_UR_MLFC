    "content": "I reached out to Google Support and they have directed me to the community and to request assistance from a specialist. My question is; sometimes when I am making an outgoing call a grey arrow will appear pointing towards the contact name which I am dialing. What does this arrow represent? It shows up repeatedly when dialing specific numbers and it typically goes to their voicemail. Does this mean they have me on call forwarding? Am I blocked by this contact?",
