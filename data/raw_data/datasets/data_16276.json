    "content": " I accidentally fell in the tide pool and dropped my phone ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ I snatched my phone for less than 5 secs. Everything works perfectly but except for my microphone doesn't work anymore whenever I try to record a video. It shounds mumbling. So much for a waterproof phone   Also when someone is talking to me over the phone, they can't hear me or they just hear mumblings as well. Please help. Thanks in advance!",
