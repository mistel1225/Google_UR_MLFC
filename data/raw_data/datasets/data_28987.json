    "content": "Hi All,\nIs there a way to get the text message notification sound to play through the main device speakers when blutooth headphones are connected? The ringtone will sound through the main speakers when a call is coming in, but not the text message sound.\nI use  my headphones at work and they are in and out of my ears all shift depending on what I am doing, and I have missed a text message because my earbuds where out when it came through. It's not practical to keep pulling out my phone to check for texts.\n\nThanks, for your help.",
