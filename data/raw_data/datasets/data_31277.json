    "content": "The top speaker on my Pixel 2xl has started to crackle so loudly, that I cannot make phone calls or use the speakers at all. If I cover the top speaker the sound quality improves as only the bottom one is audible, but this is not a realistic fix. Bought in April 2018.\nEdit: followed another users advice and cleaned the grill with 99.9% alcohol on a cotton bud. And it worked! Top speaker sounds fine now.",
