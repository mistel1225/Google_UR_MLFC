    "content": "I have a Pixel 3 XL, that I purchased directly from the Google Store, and have only ever used solely on Google Fi.  I performed a factory reset today, and now I have two apps that I didn't have before:  T-Mobile and T-Mobile Device Unlock.  Where did these come from?  Why are they on my phone?  What are they for?  And, can I safely remove them?",
