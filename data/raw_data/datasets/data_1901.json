    "content": "When I lock my screen on my Pixel 4 the screen get totally black and the phone get stuck like that for a while. No matter what I do the screen stays black. The phone vibrates so I know it's on and I still get messages and calls, but I have no way to answer. Clicking the power button creates a small vibration but nothing else happens.\nAfter a while the phone suddenly start working again (sometimes it looks like it was restarted - widgets are loading, etc. - but sometimes its just going back to normal as if nothing happened).\nI tried everything I thought of to solve it - my OS is updated, restarting and shutting down didn't help, it happened also in safe mode so an app is not the cause. \nWould really appreciate any help to understand the cause and how to solve this üôè",
