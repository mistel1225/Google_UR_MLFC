    "content": "I've been using the Pixel 4a 5g for a while now and the device will not charge when connected to the socket 90% of the time. This is extremely annoying and it dies out everytime I need it. Worst part is, It only charges when it switches off. \n\nClearly a software issue. Google. Please fix this crap or take this piece of junk back. Worst mobile phone investment ever!",
