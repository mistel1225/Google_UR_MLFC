    "content": "Hi guys. So I bought my Pixel 3a via Amazon international direct from Google. (Cause you still can't buy it here in Norway... Seriously Google? Why?) A couple of days ago I slipped and fell on some stairs and got my baby all cracked (screen totally cracked. Off course it happens the same day my case for it arrives ðŸ™„) Now I have tried just about anything I can to find a place where I can get my precious baby all fixed up again. (Did I mention this is my first Pixel device?) And when you try to get help from the Google pages you just get sent around in never-ending circles. So pleeeeeeese .... Anybody? Help me find a way to get my baby back (without it costing as much as the device itself) Thanx ðŸ¥°",
