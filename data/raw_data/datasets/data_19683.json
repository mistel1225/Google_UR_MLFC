    "content": "My phone regularly shuts down with 35+% battery life - when the weather is cold.  This has always been the case for this phone.  I have trouble taking photos when skiing.  If I warm my phone up  next to skin I can take 2-3 more before shutdown.  Last night I got out of warm car to take sunset photos at the cold beach and  I took 3 before shutdown.  I was unable to get it going again to capture moon rising.   When I hopped back in the car and plugged in phone to charge it had 38%. The battery life under normal circumstances is fine.  It particularly affects photo taking.",
