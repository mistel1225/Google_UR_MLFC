    "content": "Start of last week I left my Pixel 3a XL uncharged for 2 days and when I came to charge it, it would not charge.\n\nI have tried the recommended Google troubleshooting and several different chargers but nothing will bring it back to life!\n\nI have been trying to log a RMA on the UK website since last Thursday but it never opens even during normal UK office hours.\n\nI have been in conversation on twitter with @madebygoogle for the last 3 days but they are just sending me around in circles (I guess just hoping I will go away).\n\nI have warranty coverage till July this year.\n\nCan anyone else recommend another way to escalate this please I would be very grateful ?\n\nIts been so long now that I have had to buy a new phone just when I can least afford it and I can tell you its NOT made by google.\n\nI am really shocked on how poor and shoddy the service is from such a big technology company.\n\nDoes anyone from Google monitor this forum ?\n\nSimon",
