    "content": "I am the proud owner of a Pixel 5 now. I am using the Double SIM function as well. So I was wondering if there was a way to set my phone app to always use one specific SIM Card if I want to call a contact from one specific Google Account.\n\nFor example: I set SIM Card \"1\" for my \"Business\" Google Account and \"2\" for my \"Private\" Account. If I call Lily, who is saved into my Business Account, the app automatically uses SIM Card \"1\". If I call Boris instead, who is saved to my Private Account, the app automatically uses SIM Card \"2\".\n\nIs there some way to realize this? I couldn't find anything.",
