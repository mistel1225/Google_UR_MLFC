    "content": "I turned my Pixel off for a flight and when I came to turn it back on, nothing happened. I stepped through all the trouble shooter steps here (https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/7167687?hl=en) and it buzzed after holding down the Vol Down and Power buttons for 30 seconds. But nothing on screen at all. I looked at https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/6010316?hl=en for screen tips, but none of it applies as it's the whole screen that is unresponsive to the power button, fingerprint sensor and touch screen.\n\nI can hear notifications (but of course cannot access them), but trying to call it gives an error ('the number you have dialled cannot be reached at the moment').\n\nIt has a case, but no screen protector or similar. Removing the case makes no difference to the unresponsiveness of the screen. The screen is not chipped, cracked or visibly damaged. \n\nI'm one day into a two week business trip to Uganda and desperately need a working phone. Google support (via Twitter) tells me that because I am not in the country of purchase (UK) they cannot help me.\n\nReally grateful for any help!",
