    "title": "1 month old pixel bricks and now I'm getting a refurbished one?",
    "content": "I bought my pixel 3 one month ago and it just bricked. It's 15 days outside of Google's 15 day window for refunds and the reps are telling me they can only send me a refurb. On top of that the first rep lied to me saying they would be sending me a new phone. The supervisor I requested to talk confirmed this was a lie.\n\nUnder the Exclusive Remedy section of the warranty, it says google can (in its discretion) give you a new phone or a refund up to 1 year after the purchase date, however, this language seems to be facetious as in actuality the only option I am told I have is to be sent a refurbished model.\n\nIf a brand new phone bricking after 30 days doesn't fall under the exclusive remedy section for a new phone or a refund then what exactly does?\n\nSpending money on a brand new phone and ending up with a refurbished one a month later is about as frustrating experience as you can ask for. Feels like a bait and switch especially when it's so blatantly a hardware failure.\n\nI had just purchased pixels for parents and will be returning them.\n\nVery disappointed.",
