    "content": "I do not want Google Assistant to vocally respond when I give an instruction like dimming my bedroom lights. This had been working fine without issue for months. Part of my before sleep routine involves adjusting lights and adjusting volume of music I'm listening to. Tonight, when I'm winding down for bed, I ask the assistant to set lights at 20% and it YELLS back at me. I can reduce the volume, but now the assistant is vocally responding to my commands. I was pretty sure I'd changed a setting back in the beginning to mute the assistant, but I couldn't remember. I did some searching and found that I should set speech output to hands free only - but it already was. I've tried changing this back and forth a restarting the phone but with no luck. I have no idea what changed but it's incredibly frustrating!",
