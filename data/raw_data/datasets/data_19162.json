    "title": "Why are you replacing my brand new phone with a refurbished phone?",
    "content": "I purchased a brand new Pixel 3. Exactly one month later it was determined by Google tech support that it had a hardware issue and must be replaced. I am now receiving a refurbished phone. So I paid for a brand new phone that ended up having hardware defects from the manufacturer, and they are now replacing it with a used refurbished device? How does that work? Should I not get a refund for the difference between a brand new phone and a used refurbished phone if you're not going to replace the device with what I originally purchased...a brand new non-refurbished phone?",
