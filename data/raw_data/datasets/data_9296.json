    "content": "Ok, like question says.. I one day woke up, battery was only at 50% for some reason (more on this later) and once I unplugged phone from charger it like died instantly. It takes like an hour to start up after I plug it.. it stays permanently at 50%, it dies automatically if I unplug it.. uh.. pretty much people said they had phones act like this but only when the phone gets dropped into water or sand . That's the thing...I didn't drop it in either one. Unless humidity...MAYBE? Can do something? Idk. Maybe it messed up my phone? Idk. I'm in Mexico and this is where its happening. Never had problems with my phone whatsoever, legit just randomly started.",
