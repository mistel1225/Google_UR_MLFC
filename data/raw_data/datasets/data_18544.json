    "content": "The phone is deader than a doornail, and last night I found hundreds of people on this site saying the same thing. Now, I can't find those comments, and my phone is still dead. I mean really really dead and not turning on or charging. Last night's comments seemed to indicate that this all happened after the last software update. HELP?",
