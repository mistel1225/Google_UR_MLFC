    "content": "Everything I could find. The Pixel 2XL's clock used to show when I picked up the phone, but the screen didn't actually unlock. Now, I pick up the phone, it unlocks completely. I shut it off and have to repeatedly keep shutting the screen off as long as I'm holding the phone. I want to see the clock, but I don't want my phone to keep waking up as though I've touched the power button. NO I DO NOT have a lock/password/fingerprint/passcode of any type, and I never have! Nor do I want to set a password. This started happening with Android 10. There are other bugs that annoy me but this is the worst!",
