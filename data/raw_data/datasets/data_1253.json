    "content": "I regret to state that I’ve support Google phone since Nexus One for almost ten years but unfortunately I found great trouble with the new Pixel 5. I usually travel over the world due to business, how come all Pixel phones still didn’t allow to enable VOLTE and even 5G on other regions that providing services? It is frustrated & unacceptable! Imagine if 3G network shutdown, how can I make voice call at those countries (especially HK) out of my hometown? To resolve the problem I would like Google to guarantee to provide OTA patch to allow VOLTE and 5G usage in other countries or at least have estimated timeline.\nI look forward to hearing from you as soon as possible to resolve the problem",
