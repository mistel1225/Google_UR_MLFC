    "content": "Is there an actual gallery on the Pixel 4? Or are my only options for looking through my photos to go to Files>Images, or Google photos? It would be nice to be able to  easily organize, access, and view my photos on my phone. I don't want to have to rely on internet access constantly, but just keeping things lumped in Files isn't ideal either. I've also found 3rd party apps (at least some) don't save motion pictures.",
