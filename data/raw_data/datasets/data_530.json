    "content": "So I love this phone. Everything about it is great except for one thing. After turning the phone on, playing media like music is great, the max volume on the speakers or via aux is pretty loud. The problem starts after a few minutes of the phone being on, the max volume just suddenly gets quieter and when I try to adjust it, the max isn't as loud as it was before. This makes using my phone for listening to music infuriating. If someone could enlighten me on why it does this, or gives me insight on what I can do to fix it then by all means, help me. My last phone was the Samsung Galaxy 10e and I did not have this problem.",
