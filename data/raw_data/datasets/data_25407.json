    "content": "I'm trying to make calls using Duo, but the calls won't connect. The screen says \"loading video,\" and it just spins and spins, but does not connect. I've Force Stopped the App and reopened and I've restarted the phone. Nothing seems to work. I used Duo on my Samsung J7 with no problem, but I haven't had any luck with the Pixel.",
