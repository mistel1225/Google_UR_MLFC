    "content": "Hi I recently lost my Google Pixel which had many photos which I dont know if I can retrieve back. Because google accounts can only hold certain amount of photos in each account I had to create multiple accounts just to be able to keep taking photos and having it stored on phone. So long story short what information or advice can be given to me to be able to retrieve them back. Thanks.",
