    "content": "I listen to the Google Podcasts app. The playback bar in the notifications has disappeared and I think it's because I swiped it away too many times and must have said I didn't want notifications from the app. How can I get this back so that I can play/pause the podcast from my lock or home screen without having to go into the app?",
