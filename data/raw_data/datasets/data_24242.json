    "content": "I late October my Pixel 2 XL stopped responding on the screen.  The power and volume buttons continued to work, but I could not do anything.  I called into Google Support and they agreed to replace my phone, but they needed an exception since the warranty expired a few days before this issue occurred. \n\nI was leaving the country 4 days after I called, and I was hoping to have the replaced before then, but I had a backup phone, so if not, I would make it work.  50+ days later I AM STILL WAITING, and every subsequent call I have made I have been put on hold for over 60 minutes, and after 90 minutes I hang up, because no one is checking in to see if I am still there, and I believe this is a tactic to make me hangup.\n\nSo here I am almost 2 months later, on the phone with support right now being told they can't help me...  I am just at a loss, and I can firmly say I will no longer be purchasing google hardware...",
