    "content": "I can't hear any sound during voice or video calls from any app. I have tried multiple apps including but not limited to google hangouts, facebook messenger, kakao, etc. \n\nWhen in a video call, but with it minimized, I can not hear any sound from video playing on my phone. \n\nBut, I can hear the video call sound if I plus in USB-C headphones. I can also hear videos and other audio files fine if I am not in a voice call. \n\nThis very suddenly started happening... Literally while I was on a call. \n\nI have restarted the phone, restarted it in safe mode, uninstalled and reinstalled all of the apps mentioned above, tried calls with the bluetooth on and off, with wifi on and off and all of the combos of each of those, and still no sound.",
