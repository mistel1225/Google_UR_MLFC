    "content": "Often, when I am doing something else on my phone (mostly whilst watching videos on youtube), the phone app opens to my missed calls screen.\n\nNo idea why it is doing this. I've exited the app several times and it still opens. Curious to know if it's a bug in the latest software? It hasn't always done this.",
