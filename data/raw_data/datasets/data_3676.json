    "content": "My network bar shows a cross when the data is turned off. Is it normal? It didn't happen on my previous phone so I don't if it is. And does the notification bar at top shows VoLTE written when active? My old phone did so. And my VoLTE shade is on by default. I'm able to make all calls but not on the numbers that are publically available, say, on Google maps. ",
