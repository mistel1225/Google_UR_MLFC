    "title": "A prompt appeared in the stock phone app, just as I clicked the dialer. What did I just activate?",
    "content": "The prompt appeared across the bottom of the screen and covered the button that brings up the dial pad.  Because of the timing, it was up for only a fraction of a second before I dismissed it (by trying to click said button).  The phone is not infected with any malware or adware, and nothing places popups over other applications.  I have a stock, unlocked phone with a T-Mobile sim card.\nDoes anyone know of any current campaigns that would cause such a popup?  What are the chances I activated whatever feature it was offering?  Perhaps most importantly, might that have been a paid feature?",
