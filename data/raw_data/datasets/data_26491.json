    "content": "Hello, I’m using Google Pixel 3 (white) and I have a problem with the camera.  I can’t fix the stabilization.  she constantly focuses and takes very bad pictures.  I tried to reset the phone to factory settings, and also deleted the update through safe mode.  what should I do ?  I have such a problem.  help me please!!!  I did not drop the phone and used it very carefully.  I'm a fan of your products and I have a Google Pixel 2 XL and it doesn’t have such problems.  I am waiting for an answer with respect Nikita.",
