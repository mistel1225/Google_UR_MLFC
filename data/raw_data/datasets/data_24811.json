    "content": "I'm excited about the new Recorder app from Google and am hoping to migrate my existing voice recordings over to it, so I can have them all in one place and hopefully get transcripts for some of my older recordings. Is there a way to do this? The storage folders for the app aren't easy to find (the actual files just go to the Download folder), so it not a matter of just clicking and dragging... Would be a great feature if possible! Does anybody know a solution or a work-around?",
