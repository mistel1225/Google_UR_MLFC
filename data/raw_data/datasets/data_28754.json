    "content": "My Google Pixel 2 XL is having issues with the front camera as the images are blurry. My phone is still in warranty. Everything else is fine. But when I submitted my phone to the Google service center BTX, they gave me a quote of 16500 INR for repair. They are saying while the front camera replacement would cost only around INR 900, they will change my phone's screen as well just because the phone was opened by somebody. They want me to change the screen even though there is no problem with the screen. This is cheating and most pathetic customer service from Google.",
