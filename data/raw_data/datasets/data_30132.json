    "title": "Pixel 3 XL WiFi issues post March Update",
    "content": "Since the March update my WiFi connection has become unreliable. Sometimes it stays connected and sometimes it's disconnected. Currently my WiFi is On and the icon shows there is no internet connection but Reddit, Facebook apps work as expected but Google search/ Chrome/Youtube is not working. Very odd.\n\nI started noticing this after the March update - specifically when connecting to my 5 Ghz office wifi. At home I have dual band and this wifi issue pops up occasionally. I have reset my network settings but that didn't resolve the issue. Please help.",
