    "content": "I'm persistently having issues with the the active edge feature. It sometimes refuses to open the popup. The colourful stroke animation still appears as I proceed to squeeze the phone but nothing happens after that. It usually happens when in apps, on lock screen and almost always when the screen is locked. Randomly. And then all of a sudden is starts working again, usually after the GA was triggered by voice or swipe from the corner gesture. Super annoying as it's unexplainable and inconsistent.",
