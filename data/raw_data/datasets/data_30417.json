    "content": "Hi, so yesterday I bought this phone, and the sensor was working perfectly. After some hours, it didn't work at all, and I updated the software until the newest version. Then, it was saying the fingerprint sensor is dirty whenever i would try to add a new imprint and I couldn't use that at all. Then, I factory reset the phone. It was working amazing, with no problems. Today I woke up, and the same dirty thing is up again.\nIt succesfully scans 1 imprint, but it won't scan the next 7. No matter how clean my hands are or the sensor, it says my finger is dirty or that the imprint can't be processed.\nSometimes, only sometimes when I test it it's going to work perfectly. But shortly after that it breaks again.\nAbout 1/5 times I can't unlock my phone cause it says my imprint can't be processed. Is it a hardware issue, should I get a replacement? Or is it something else? I just don't get it.",
