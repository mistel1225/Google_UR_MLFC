There is no such update that takes that long for previous major update of Android.\nAny solution or explanation from Android team ?\n\nhttps://photos.app.goo.gl/jf3iFY2Abrbi1iez9\n\nUpdate: after waiting for 140 minutes (2 hours and 40 minutes), I am giving out, and rebooted several times to get back to Android Pie.\nThis is the WORST update I ever encountered, after owning Nexus 4, Nexus 6P, Pixel 2 XL and Pixel 3 XL.\nWaiting for Google Android team explanation and fix this shit soon.",
