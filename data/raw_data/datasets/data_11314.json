    "content": "Pixel 4 xl, android 10 last build.\nWi fi share doesn't work. \nYesterday I couldn't connect to my wifi hotspot on my PC (win10) either it said 'cant connect' or very rarely \"connected, no internet\" i thought it was something with windows so I tried some troubleshooting there with no success. But I could still connect to hotspot with my laptop. \nNow today my laptop also have similar symptoms :/ as my PC so I'm pretty sure it's either due to android 10 or due to pixel.\n(I will mention here that if I connect my phone to pc via cable and enable usb thethering then everything works fine, can't check if it also works this way on laptop since I have only usb-c usb-c cable and only my PC have type-c slot on the motherboard)\n\nI've tried using safe mode, 2.4,5ghz, with or without password but that didn't helped.\n\nUpdate to android 11 is not an option here as well as factory reset.\n\n[Edit] my other android phone could connect but says \"no internet\"",
