    "content": "I tried to test my Google assistant's ability to take photos tonight, and the only thing it will do is open the camera app. \n\nWon work with a request to take a photo in x seconds, won't take a selfie, nothing. I made sure assistant had access to the camera and device storage, but it didn't help. \n\nAny ideas outside of the standard \"try a factory reset\"?",
