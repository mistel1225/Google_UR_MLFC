    "title": "Pixel 3a XL 'No SIM Card' and no connection to my carrier (Verizon)",
    "content": "My phone has lost the ability to connect with my provider, often giving a 'No SIM Card' message in the top left lock screen and a unconnected x where there would be bars. When trying to make a call it tells me to disable airplane mode, but airplane mode isn't on. As a result I cannot make calls/text nor access mobile data. In the *#*#4636#*# menu 'Mobile Radio Power' can be turned on, but turns itself off.\n\nI've tried the troubleshooting steps, safe mode, different SIM, resetting the network, factory reset etc. to no avail.",
