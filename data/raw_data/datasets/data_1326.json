    "content": "I have updated my pixel 3 phone to android 12 beta. As it was not stable and crashing, installed android 11 and restarted the phone. Now my phone is not getting past the \"checking info\" page. After checking updates and checking info page, its asking me to verify the unlock pattern as the phone was reset to factory settings. After entering the pattern, it again goes back to starking page of setup. Any help to finish the phone setup is appreciated. ",
