    "title": "My Pixel 2 XL hasn't received February 2019 security updates yet (today's Feb. 19th) -- why?",
    "content": "I've had a Google Pixel 2 XL for a few months and around the 5th of each month I've been getting automated notices about it installing the latest monthly Android Pie security updates.  However, this month (February 2019) I've still not received anything beyond the January 5, 2019 security updates (at this writing today is February 19, 2019).  I go to System, then Advanced, then System Update, click on \"Check for update\" and it then just displays \"Your system is up to date:  Android Version 9, Security patch level January 5, 2019.  Last successful check at 9:51am.\"  I would like to know why this is happening (anyone else experiencing this?), and what is the fix for this?  Thank you.",
