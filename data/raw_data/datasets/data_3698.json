    "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nMy Pixel 4 XL doesn't produce any sound when I switch to speakerphone mode. It's fine if I just use the default phone mode, but once I switch to speaker, I can't hear anything anymore. This also applies to calls in apps like Discord. The bottom speakers are fine because I still hear audio if I'm playing a video or music. \n\nI've tried reinstalling apps and restarting my phone. My volume is up, too.",
