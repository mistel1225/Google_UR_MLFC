    "content": "So I recently upgraded from a galaxy note 5 to a Google Pixel 3 and connected my Gear fit 2 to the pixel 3 seemingly with no issue.\nHowever when I get notifications on my pixel 3 the Gear fit 2 does not display them despite both the phone and the gear fit 2 having \"show notifications\" turned on. How do I fix this so that my gear fit 2 isn't Just a glorified watch?? \nAll advice is appreciated. Thanks.",
