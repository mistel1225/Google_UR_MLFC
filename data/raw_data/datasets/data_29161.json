    "title": "Pixel turning off before battery hits 0%",
    "content": "My Pixel has been turning off before the battery hits 0% for a few months now. Usually it turns off between 15% and 30% but it turns off even sooner when the data transfer tool is being used to copy data to my new Pixel 3 (up to 71% in one instance).\n\nMy initial suspicions were a battery issue but I have noticed that the Pixel does feel a bit warm when it shuts off so I'm also suspecting that it's a heat sensor being tripped.\n\nAny advice on what's going on here?",
