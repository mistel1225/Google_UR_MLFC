    "content": "After uploading a photo to google photo and clearing the device’s memory, such photos still take up storage space.  If you look at the screenshot in the attachment, you can see that photo occupy 103 GB, while viewing details, all the photos on the device take about 500 MB.  I synchronize the photo in Google photo every day and with the help of Google photo I clean up the place on the smartphone.  Perhaps the problem is at the launcher level.  In any case, the Google photo community were recommended to contact this community.\nI use Pixel XL.\nThank you for your answers!",
