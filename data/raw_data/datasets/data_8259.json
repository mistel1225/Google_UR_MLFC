    "title": "Battery Level Indicator Frozen after Updated to Android 11. Where's Google? Thousands suffering same",
    "content": "Updated my Pixel 3 to Android 11 a week ago.\nBattery level indicator frozen at 49% since. \nI see MANY PEOPLE on many threads have been suffering the same fault for MONTHS!...with no resolution, and I have posted on another thread. \nGoogle: please respond and fix this! It makes the phone relatively useless, or at least jeopardy/Russian roulette whenever taking my phone out, as I don't know what the charge is! \n(Any solution that involves a \"factory reset\" won't be happening as I'm not wiping my phone, and I see other owners that have tried that says it doesn't make a difference)\nFrustrated, disappointed. Won't be buying Pixel/Android again if this doesn't get resolved soon.",
