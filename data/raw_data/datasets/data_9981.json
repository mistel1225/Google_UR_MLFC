Now have noticed mouse still works but do NOT see it on the screen. I can click mouse button and action happens but I do NOT see the mouse.\n   Return screen to vertical orientation and mouse there.\n   Also, plugged in the MS-USB cable adapter and it works great on older Pixel XL.\n   Any thoughts ??\nI also increased-decreased text size thinking maybe had something to do with problem...no luck\nTKS\nPixel 3a xl, just got update to Android 11 before this happened.\nPixel xl , no updating, works fine in PORTRAIT and LANDSCAPE use of SUB wireless mouse.",
