    "content": "I will be in the middle of a phone call and the phone will just restart. It can be at any point during a phone call and can sometimes not happen at all during a phone call. I have exchanged my pixel 4a (5g) twice. All 3 phones have had the exact same issue with different levels of severity. I have done with all 3 phones the troubleshooting steps that google support tells you to go through such as safe mode and factory reset.",
