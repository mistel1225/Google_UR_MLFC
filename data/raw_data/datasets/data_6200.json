    "title": "Google pixel 3 touchscreen phantom touch issues - known issue? Unresolved from soft and master reset",
    "content": "I’ve read of the known pixel 4a touchscreen issues but we’re are seeing the same on my pixel 3 for a number of months. Have ensured software up to date, completed a hard and soft reset with no resolution. Before I arrange a return of device for fix to mobile provider, can anyone confirm another solution or potential known fault awaiting a fix. \n\nThanks",
