    "title": "After update and reboot, touch stopped working on Pixel 3a",
    "content": "My Pixel 3a is less than a month old. It has been working fine. This morning, when I logged into my phone, there was a notification that I needed to restart my phone to complete the System WebView update. I did so. Touch no longer works. Using a mouse, I rebooted in safe mode, uninstalled and reinstalled the few apps updated in the past day (WebView, Chrome). Charged the phone to 100% (it was already at 98%.) I did a factory reset. Nothing has worked.",
