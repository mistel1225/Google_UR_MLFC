    "content": "I have two user accounts, my main and a secondary account for guests.\n\nVoice match is enabled on my account, disabled on the secondary one. When I switch from primary to secondary and then back, voice match doesn't work any more.\n\nThe slider turns itself off in the voice match settings, until I restart the phone. Then it either works, or asks me to setup voice match. Changing to the secondary account and back breaks it again.",
