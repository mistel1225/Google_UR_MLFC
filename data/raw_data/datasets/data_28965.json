    "content": "Trying to subscribe to my son's hockey team's live calendar feed, which allows for changes to the schedule to be automatically updated to my own calendar. Other parents (iPhone users, and other Android phones) seem to be able to sync their phones - I can't figure out how to do so. Any help would be greatly appreciated.",
