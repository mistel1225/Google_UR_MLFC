    "content": "I have been using the scheduled mode for my phone to be on night mode during the night and vice versa since the feature was made available on my Pixel 3a xl. Since updating to April 2020 my phone hasn't been switching automatically to dark mode when sunset arrives and back to light mode during sunrise. Now I have to manually toggle the modes instead of the system working automatically. I'm not sure if anyone else is having this issue but it seems like a bug was introduced.",
