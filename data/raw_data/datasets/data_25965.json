    "content": "I am currently living in Thailand, conveniently a place in the world where google does not sell pixels.... My pixel 3XL randomly decided to break and crash everytime I tried charging. I sent back to google for repair in the UK, and in the meantime purchased a seconhand Pixel 2. After a week of using it, it has f ing died on me, black screen, won't even budge or do anything, tried holding down power button for 203u9246298363 hours and all of that crap. I am SICK of google, I swear to god. Other than take this phone apart and poke the insides hoping something happens, what else can I do? It's been dead for 12 hours now, and yes i've tried charging it, i've tried holding down the power button so please don't give me the obvious answers. Like I said, officially sick of google phones.",
