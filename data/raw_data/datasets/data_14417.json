    "content": "I've been having touchscreen issues with my phone ever since I first received the device. When I am playing shooting/action games requiring movement from both hands, sometimes when I place my second thumb on the screen, the phone doesn't register my other thumb that was already on the screen. In addition, when scrolling through web pages, I sometimes stop my thumb in the middle of the screen to read wats there, and then when I start to move my thumb to scroll again, nothing happens. It also sometimes will detect me tapping something when I'm not. Lastly, when I am typing it doesn't always register me tapping the screen and I have to type certain letters twice. There are no cracks or other damage to my screen and I have restarted my phone as well as factory reset it.",
