    "content": "Google Camera has been broken for many months for many Pixel owners.  This applies to all models, including V4.  It is not a hardware issue.  It is a software issue.  This is clear from the hundreds, if not thousands, of recent one star reviews.  Google needs to acknowledge this fact, as it is clearly responsible for breaking the standout best feature of the Pixel range, and clarify when this issue will be resolved.\n\nI certainly wouldn't have bought my Pixel 2 XL based on the identified issues at launch, particularly relating to the quality of the screen, without it being acknowledged that the camera is outstanding, which personally for me it is.\n\n Hey Google, over to you.",
