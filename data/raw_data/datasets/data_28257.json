    "content": " I noticed that in theast 4 days all the time when i am at work, my phone became very hot, on the screen and back of the phone, and is draining my battery very fast. After what i am keaving from work, my phone is okay, is cooling down and is not draining my battery anymore. My shop is in the basement of the building. I tried to reset the phone for many times, to check for bags, and everything looks good with the phone.Today when i get at work i decided to turn OFF my WI-FI on the phone and in the next 10 minutes my phone cool down and didn' drain the battery anymore. What can be the problem? I have a Pixel 2XL for almost one year and untill now i didn't had any issue with the phone doesn't matter if i was at work or somewhere else.",
