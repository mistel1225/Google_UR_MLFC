    "content": "Additionally Pixel is requiring me to change major apps such as message app to something Pixel deems necessary.\nIn the past 3+ weeks I have spent a total of 41/2 hours with tech assistance trying to resolve and change home screen to Pixel liking. Techs even have trouble helping (We have Verizon all equipment contract with tech help.)\n At 75+ years old without experiential background in computer working I am at a loss again today.\nHelp!!!  BTW the 4 times home screen changed tech figured it out 3x. The fourth I luckily deleted something and my home screen came back to the way wanted.",
