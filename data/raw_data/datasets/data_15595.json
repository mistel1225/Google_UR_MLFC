    "content": "I just regret that I chose to buy a Google phone!\nI can't contact with anyone physically, like call somewhere and talk about the problem I faced with my pixel 2 XL.\nAfter the latest update to Android 11, the rear camera stopped working and I had to pay to replace it!\nI still can't believe that a company like Google is so bad and it would make me pay money to replace a camera on my phone, just because they released a new software update!!\nI feel like they just robbed me!\nI won't recommend it again to anyone and definitely my next phone will be everything else EXCEPT GOOGLE!!!",
