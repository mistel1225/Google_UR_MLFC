    "content": "I have lift to wake and double to tap to wake enabled. The feature works, but most of the time I'm having to lift the phone and put it down again before the screen wakes. Is this normal behavior?\nOccasionally it does wake as soon as I lift if up, but usually I have to keep changing the angle again before it works.",
