    "content": "I decided to factory reset my phone this morning but after I did the whole backup restore process it didn't restore my wallpaper(s), I have a different ringtone, none of my apps are where I used to have them, basically it's like I have a new phone but with my old apps and contacts. Also I've noticed that for some reason the keyboard looks different and I no longer have the option to pull up to view open apps(don't know exactly how that is called). Before the factory reset I didn't have the square shaped button in the bottom right and now I do. Before the factory reset I had the September 1st update, and I checked and there are no new updates available.",
