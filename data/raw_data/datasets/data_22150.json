    "content": "It’s been more than 3 weeks that I‘m waiting to receive my replacement phone that I’ve sent March 11th. I’ve sent email and spoke to google representatives but nothing seems to be solved. I’ve contacted UPS and they confirmed to me that the phone was nowhere to be found. I’m stuck now with no phone and no response from google and I’m still paying my phone for a service that I’m not receiving. I need someone to contact me as soon as possible because I’m not not happy at all.",
