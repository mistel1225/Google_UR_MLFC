    "content": "There is no microphone icon on the keyboard of my Messages app.  How can I add one so that I can use voice to compose texts?  \n\nMy 4 XL is new; I'm exploring set-up, options, ... wanting to configure in the simplest way and then add features as I need them.  I have the number row showing on the keyboard and it's set to show large.  Yes, there's a microphone showing on the Messages+ keyboard and I can switch.\n\nAlso, is there an alternate text app that shows a few lines of the message?\n\nI'm liking the phone a lot so far, especially the large size - easier for me to hold.\n\nSylvia",
