    "content": "I'm trying to organize my Pixel 3A home screen.\nSo I'm meging all my photography icons. But when I move, say, Instragam, I wind up with 2 icons, one merged plus the original unmerged. \nHow do I get rid of the original icon while keeping the merged icon?\n\nAlong that line, I tried to find out how to delete an icon and found that I must 'right click it'.  However I couldnt find out how to do a 'right click on an icon'.  Please help.\nJ",
