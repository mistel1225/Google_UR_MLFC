    "content": "I know there is an iottie wireless 2 but that's costs too much to import from US. Had one recommended from a review site but was still only getting 600mah max with the ampere app.   Tried different cable..different power adapter...ideally want a response simply from someone who has a pixel 4 with a wireless car charger that they know for a fact that is charging..don't want someone to just point me to a review or product that ticks the boxes of what should work.",
