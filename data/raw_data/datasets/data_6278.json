    "content": "My wife claims that somehow by jostling her Pixel phone around in her purse the phone is enabling the \"DO NOT DISTURB\" function on her phone and she's missed phone calls and text messages.  My guess is that she's turning it on by pulling down the screen from the top and then enabling it by accident.  She claims that she doesn't need that DND functionality on her phone and was wondering if there's a way to disable to the option completely?  The only functionality I can find is prompt the user to confirm that the they want to turn if on.  Any way to set this so it just can't be enabled?",
