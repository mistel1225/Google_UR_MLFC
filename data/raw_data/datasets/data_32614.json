    "content": "I have an issue with animations in low frame rate. Factory reset hasn't worked for me, there's only 2 options remaining, if it's hardware issue - RMA. If it's software, I need to sideload a fresh factory image. But I had an idea, which would involve having some fun on the side. If I opt in for Android Q beta, install it, then go back to Android P, would it give me a fresh factory image, or does it leave the existing in the phone to roll back to?",
