    "title": "Updated to Android 11, App Keeps Crashing",
    "content": "I have a Google Pixel 3, and it just updated about two days ago. Besides removing the screenshot feature from holding down the power button, which was a horrible idea by the way, one of my apps won't open when I tap it. \n\nMy screen turns white like it is about to open, then it just crashes and no bug report options appear. I've tried restarting my phone, uninstalling and redownloading the app, clearing the cache and whatever else and still nothing, which is why I'm assuming it's a problem with the phone's update and not the app.\n\nI suppose It could always be a problem with the app (although it was working fine literally hours before the update) but I would still like to know if there might be any other solutions, or maybe an easy way to revert this update? Also, I would like for this problem to be reported, and to see if other users are having similar issues.",
