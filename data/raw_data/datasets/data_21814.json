    "content": "I have a pixel 4 purchased over thanksgiving, started using around christmas, \n\nlate january, my car (BMW428) infotainment system goes into reboot mode continuously,\ni realized it was my phone causing the problem\nupon few seconds bluetooth connection, the system will just just keep rebooting, connect, crash, repeat\n\ni have contacted google, all they ask me to do is reset my wireless settings, which didn't resolve the problem\nI have tried connecting with several other phones, Galaxy S8, iphone 8, iphone X, Pixel 2, Pixel 3\nthey all work just fine\ngoogle has actually sent me a refurbished phone as replacement, within the minute it connected, it started crashing the system again.\n\nthis is been frustrating as google cannot resolve my issue, and as i research online, this happens to multiple users, and also posted in this community, but it has been disabled for comments\n\nAnyone else experience the same problem? any resolution?\n\nI am wondering who is experiencing the same problem",
