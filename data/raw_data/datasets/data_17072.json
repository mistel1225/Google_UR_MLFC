    "content": "I can't seem to set up my new Pixel 4a (bought new, directly from Google). Here's what I did.\n\nTurned on the device for the first time.\nRealized I should probably put in my SIM card, so I turned the device off.\nInserted the SIM card.\nTurned the device on.\nIt asks me to insert a PIN. I tried the PIN I used from my previous device (Pixel 3a), but it didn't work.\n\nNow I'm stuck since I don't know what PIN I'm supposed to input.\n\nAny help is appreciated. Thanks!",
