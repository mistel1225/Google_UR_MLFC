    "content": "Hi all,\n\nI just factory reset my Pixel 3, and I think the level of my phone is off. The Camera app shows a \"hint\" that I am 6 degrees off-axis when taking a seemingly level photo, and any protractor apps that I download are approximately 6 degrees off until I recalibrate them. Any tips on fixing my phone's gyroscope?\n\nThanks!",
