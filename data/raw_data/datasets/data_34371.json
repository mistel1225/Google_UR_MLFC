    "content": "I've been on Google Fi for about a year and a half. I just switched from a Moto x4 to a Pixel 3xl. I was just in a text group with 2 friends (both iPhone users, and I think both on at&t) and I realized that I'm getting their texts out of order. I've seen other threads recommend that I check advanced settings to make sure that \"auto download mms\" is on, and it is. These other threads seem to be locked with no resolutions. \n\nIs there a fix for this? Or am I stuck hoping that it'll be fixed? Because it seems like this probably goes back at least a couple years.",
