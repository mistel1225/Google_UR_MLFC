    "content": "I just noticed that when I Bluetooth my pixel buds to my Google Pixel phone that notification sounds stopped working. It's pretty frustrating because even though I have the buds in I am not hearing any notification sounds through the phone or headphones. After an hour I'll look at my phone and find a list of things I've missed.",
