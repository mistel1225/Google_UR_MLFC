    "content": "Hi folks,\n\nI am trying to use Google Pixel 4a with bluetooth keyboard Logitech K375. My problem is that I can't change the typing layout from English US to Bulgarian. I added both layouts on the physical keyboard settings, but when I try to type on text field, can't switch the layout. I tried shortcuts as Control+Space, Shift+Space, Control+Shift, Alt+Shift and so on. I also installed Microsoft swift keyboard, but result is the same. When the virtual keyboard is showing, when I press the shortcut for layout change, it switches only on the screen. But on the physical keyboard it remains english US. What can i do?\nThanks in advance.",
