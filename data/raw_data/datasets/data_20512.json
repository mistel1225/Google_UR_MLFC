    "content": "I'm consistently having issues with my Google pixel 4 XL. I've spoken to two Representatives today one of them just canceled our chat and the second one just stopped responding. I've taken my Google pixel 4 to a repair shop called un break it which was recommended by the first assistant that I spoke to almost two weeks ago. My phone after they had it and was working on it for a whole day came out with only my battery issue fixed but my microphone and freezing issue got even worse. I've had my pixel 4 XL for less than a year and still paying money on it through Verizon and so far after 4 pixel Representatives and taking it to a repair shop my phone is still freezing still people cannot hear me over phone conversations because of my microphone and now I cannot get another representative on chat because the last representative that I spoke to still has a open chat window and has not canceled it but he is not responding when I message him. The last representative also recommended that I factory reset my phone which I did and now I can't even restore it to the way it was because I don't know how. I am beyond frustrated with Google right now someone please help",
