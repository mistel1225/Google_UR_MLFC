    "content": "Since updating to Android 11 I cannot view the screen during phonecalls meaning I cannot change any settings/end the call. It's as though the proximity sensor has been affected. \n\nThis is also an issue I believe to be linked with the face unlock feature which also does not work since the update. The screen does not automatically wake and when trying to use face unlock it tells me to clean the screen including the black bar at the top. \n\nI have cleaned it thoroughly on several occasions but still not working. \n\nPlease fix.",
