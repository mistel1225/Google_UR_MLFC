    "content": "Last week my Google Pixel XL (first generation) went into an infinite bootloop.  I have tried the following\n\n1. I tried to factory reset through the boot launcher - to no avail\n2. I took the phone to Ubreak -Ifix and their conclusion was that the device motherboard is damaged. \n\nMy phone is justa a little over 2 years old, and has no physical or other damage to it. And I am a little disappointed as to why the mother board is damaged in two years time.\n\nI understand it is out of warranty, but am disappointed that it only lasted two years. \n\nIs there something Google can help me with? Can I ship the phone to google and get some feedback on what might have gone wrong? I enjoyed using the device while I had it. And look forward to a new one. But the motherboard being defective is concerning.",
