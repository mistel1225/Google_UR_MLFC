    "title": "How to use an external microphone with audio recording apps without overcompression?",
    "content": "Whenever I use an external microphone to record audio, all voice memo apps (native and 3rd party) apply so much compression on the audio that it distorts and clips. This does not happen when using an external microphone for video. How can we record just high-quality audio without it being rendered useless by compression?",
