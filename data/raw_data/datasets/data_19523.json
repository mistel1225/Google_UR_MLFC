    "content": "According to Google my phone is 39 days outside of warranty and 1 year old. \nThis is my 6th personal Google phone dating back to the Nexus ONE in 2010 and I've NEVER had a phone stop working. 8 phones if you include the Google phones I bought my family as presents. Google is refusing to help because my phone is 39 days outside of warranty and the only option is to send my phone in for \"repair\" for $411 in which they will replace my one year old phone with a refurbished phone of likely lesser quality for the price of a BRAND NEW PHONE. Support offered no other solutions other then basically telling me it's my problem as per their policy. \n\nWhen my Chromecast broke for no reason I didn't not even contact Google as I knew it was years old and lived a healthy used life and things break so I went and bought a new one. But, 1 year and 39 days on a $500+ phone and I'm told to go F myself? Very sad Google, you live high now and think you don't need customers but you keep treating people like this and see how fast fortunes change.\n\nNow, given their lack of care, I will never buy another Google device, recommend a Google device, and tell all how they do not support their products.",
