    "content": "The Whatsapp notifications on the lock screen of my pixel 3a are overlapping and only partly showing. This only happens when the display size is set to small. Upon swiping over the notifications they will expand and the text will be shown. Is there any way to 'un'-overlap the notifications whilst still having a small display size.\n\nCheers",
