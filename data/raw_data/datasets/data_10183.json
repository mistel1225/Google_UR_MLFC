    "title": "Android Nearby Share not working from Google Photos App",
    "content": "When I try to share a photo from the Google Photos App, the option to share with nearby share does not appear in the share menu. It's neither up top next the copy button like when you share a clipboard, nor down in the app options. It's just not there. I tried restarting the phone but it did not fix the issue. Nearby share is turned on and I can share files from my files app (nearby share button up top appears).",
