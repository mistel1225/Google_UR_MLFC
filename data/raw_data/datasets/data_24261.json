    "content": "I have service, wifi sending is on and it still random messages just do not send. When I eventually notice and tap to try again it always sends instantly. I can't even find a way to turn on notifications that my message didn't send, so I often don't know my message didn't send. I am using the default message app. Is there a fix or at least a way to turn on message not sending notifications?",
