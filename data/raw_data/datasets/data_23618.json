    "content": "Please enable the settings (make them visible) for Pixel phones running on carriers in Romania, for VoLTE and WifiCalling. Three networks in our country support both VoLTE and WifiCalling and yet, we cannot use these features because the Pixel phone \"does not know about these networks' features being available\" and is not showing the options in settings.\nOrange Romania, Digi Romania and now Vodafone as well, have VoLTE and WifiCalling available for customers as long as the phones have those settings Visible in the phone's menu.\nYes, with root I would be able to bring those settings in the menu and enable them, but I am not interested in rooting my phone.",
