    "content": "I have a Pixel 3 and it keeps going to \"no sim card\". It does not allow me to connect to wifi or bluetooth either and I have no cell data service. Happens quite a bit where I have to restart my phone and reset the network settings. \n\nHappened for the first time 2 weeks ago and it was fine for a week. Did the network reset and restart and the phone lasted for a day. Did it again, and it lasted for 2 days.\n\nI've tried to troubleshoot by resetting all network settings, rebooting into safe mode, and even factory reset my phone, but the issue is still there. Tried the sim on another phone and seems to work fine. I think it's the phone itself. \n\nAny other solutions?",
