    "content": "This morning my phone shutted down after my alarm rang (I had 14% and it’s normal for my Pixel 2 to turn down below 20%). When I plugged it again, I noticed that the Imprint was not working even though I tried to configure it again. I also realized that I lost my WiFi’s saved passwords and I can’t enable the hotspot, because “Tethering settings are not available for this user”. I have not ever used the multi account feature, so the Owner Account must be the Admin Account.\nRight now, I’m backuping my personal data because I’m going to make a factory reset. I’m scared that my phone was hijacked or has some kind of malware. Has anyone experienced something like this? Do you have some alternatives?",
