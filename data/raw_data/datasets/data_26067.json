    "content": "You offered the Pixel 4 at the same price as I just paid for the Pixel 3. I've been a loyal customer for years. I have a pixelbook, pixel buds, and almost every Pixel phone including the original Nexus'. I feel like it's a slap in my face to sell this Pixel 4 at the same price and drop the Pixel 3 by another 200 dollars. I am strongly considering never investing in another Pixel device.",
