    "content": "New Pixel 5 stuck \"Completing Setup ... Installed 127 out of 129 apps (1 failed)\"\n\nRebooted several times.  Powered down overnight.  Went away after that, but now back after a half hour powered on.  Possibly relevant is my home has been without power for four days now (ice storm).  So, transfered old device (Pixel 2) to new, but no Wi-Fi.  Used T-Mo 5G.  All seemed to go well except this.  Phone working great.  I love it; just want annoying message gone.  TIA!",
