    "content": "This is my second pixel 4 xl, first one was dead straight out of the box. This one I've had since Nov 2019 working fine untill recently. Battery stuck on 50% won't change even when charge or discharge. Today it randomly crashed/shutdown, would turn back on untill I plugged it into a charger. Then had a battery symbol with a ?. Which was the same symbol the first pixel 4xl had. The phone eventually turned on, I've tried turning off location, rebooting still having issues",
