    "title": "Pixel 4a dead pixels. Trying to get a replacement for weeks now with Pixel support team",
    "content": "The Pixel 4a display turned black for no apparent reason. The display slowly started gaining more dead pixels everyday and now the screen is completely black. I have been been in contact with the Pixel support team pretty much everyday for the last 2 weeks to try and get a replacement. They just keep escalating the issue to their supervisors and get nothing done afterwards. Anyone else has a similar issue with Pixel support? I tried getting the display replaced at UBREAKIFIX, but they were out of stock for parts in their distribution centers. This is something that should take only a few hours to be resolved. Extremely disappointed with their customer service.",
