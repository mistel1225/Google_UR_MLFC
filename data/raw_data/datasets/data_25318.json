    "content": "My phone had a problem with the speaker shortly after purchasing it new from Google Store. I went through all the troubleshooting steps suggested by the Google customer service rep Vivian and the issue was not resolved. She says it is covered under warranty and gives me an RMA so I can send the defective phone in to them for repair using a Google Store provided label and packaging. So I did. This was 2 months ago. After I mailed the phone, I checked in 2 weeks later regarding the status of the repair as I had not heard anything from the rep I was dealing with. She said the phone was received and being fixed, then subsequently said the order was cancelled. I told her it was not cancelled and provided the RMA, tracking number and photos of delivery confirmation with receiver signature. She then asked for a proof of delivery with the Sender and Receiver addresses, which I obtained from FedEx and sent to her. From the very beginning, she has said the same thing over and over again, regardless of the proof I provide: that the warehouse doesn’t have a receipt of the phone, with no other resolution offered. Please help. I have talked to other overseas customer service reps who have said to be patient as there is an internal investigation underway to find the lost phone, and that the only person I can talk to for next steps is Vivian. Vivian, however, doesn’t seem to care, and refuses to take responsibility.",
