    "title": "Question about contacts re syncing and birthdays",
    "content": "So I just switched from iPhone 7 to the Pixel 3, and when I imported my contacts, they all came with the labels of either Adriana's iPhone or copied from ios.  Without individually going through and changing each contact, can I change the labels for all of them so they are just in google?  \nAlso, I was able to see birthdays on my google calendar on my iPhone, but never on my google calendar on my desktop, and now not on my new phone either. I'm looking at the calendar on my old phone and the birthdays come up because it's the iPhone contacts and not google.  Is there any way to transfer them?  I have tried syncing contacts birthdays in the calendar app, and I can't seem to find anywhere to do it on the desktop.  They are still showing up on my old phone.  My contacts on my new phone have the birthdays in them, I've checked.  Any help would be great, thanks!!",
