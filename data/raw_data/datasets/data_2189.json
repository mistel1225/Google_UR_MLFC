    "content": "I have followed all the recommendations - tested both microphones using recorder and camera and sound is fine. Turned off blue tooth and WiFi and closed all apps and it made no difference. Removed the phone case despite it being the proper Google phone case, still no difference. Reset the phone. Still no difference. I have never got the phone wet, not has it had any more than usual bumps or knocks. I can't talk to my own Father on the phone because he already has problems with his hearing and just can't understand me. Occasionally apparently the sound is clear - but then goes again when I haven't even moved. I have also tried with various headphone/earphones and no difference (I thought it might be where I was holding the phone to my mouth). I am desperate as can't afford to change my phone and have another 12 months on the contract but can't use it to chat with friends like I desperately want to do. It's my first smart-phone and I'm beginning to wish I'd stuck with my old Nokia brick which was as clear as a bell. What am I missing?",
