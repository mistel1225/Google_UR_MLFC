    "content": "Is there anything comprable to the Pixel 3 USB-C that comes with the phone? I was very unhappy to find that these are too big for my ears. I have to wear the smallest size when it comes to the silicone ear pieces, so this was a joke trying to get these in my ears. I wants something that will work like these Google buds do, but I didn't see anything at all.",
