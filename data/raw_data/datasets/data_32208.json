    "content": "I have Spanish as one of my languages,  yet when I ask ok Google in Spanish to say my name, she just writes it out. This happens no matter how I ask her to say it when I'm speaking in Spanish. She says all her other responses to my Spanish outloud except for when I ask her about my name. If I ask her in English about my name, she says it wrong because it is with an \"American English\" accent. How do I fix this?",
