    "content": "It's the 17th of December, I am curious if I should have received the December Security update already.  I had the November update by the 5th of the month so I'm curious if I should have it already.  Also trying to understand the Pixel Feature Drop.  Is that something that is suppose to happen as a system update or is it just through the play store?\n\nHow do I check to see if my Pixel 3 received the Feature drop?\n\nFinal question; Is the Pixel 3 camera suppose to have astrophotography?  I don't see it as an option.\n\nThanks,\nBrian\n\nPixel 3\nUnlocked on T-Mobile\nBuild number: QP1A.191105.003",
