    "content": "I sent in my old Pixel 2 XL to get a replacement back, and it arrived today.  I opened the box to see that it had a massive crack on the screen.  Also, I've been charging this phone for about an hour and a half, and it still won't turn on.  I have many, many questions.\n- Is this really a replacement or just a different used phone?  The one I sent in was in better condition than the one I got back, even with its problems.\n- What do I do next?  Do I ask for a repair?  How am I supposed to get the IMEI of the new phone without being able to turn it on?",
