    "content": "Hello, my camera recently started to vibrate. I read up a little and last year there was a problem where it would shake, but mine is different, it is a physical vibration. It even makes a noise. I have tried restarting my phone and that didn't work, so I came here. Is anyone else having this issue, or just me?",
