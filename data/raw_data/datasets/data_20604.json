    "content": "Hello,\n\nI recently have acquired my first on-call job responsibility. I also enjoy a good nights sleep. So here is my debacle. I would like to turn the phone on silent mode at night, but allow only my on call application to make sounds. I feel like this should be a thing, but I can't find anything to explain how to do it. \n\nI should add my phone is on a bring your own device program at work, so there is a work profile extension added on my phone. I just found the option to override Do not disturb but that option is not available on the work profile.\n\nThanks in advance.",
