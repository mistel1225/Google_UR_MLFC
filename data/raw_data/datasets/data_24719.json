    "content": "I send my pixel 2 for repair. After waiting for over a month, I was promised a refund instead. The refund is also taking over a month now. What can I do to expedite the process?\n\nSome background: my issue with the pixel 2 was covered by warranty. EU regulations state that 15 business days is a reasonable amount of time for repair and that the customer is otherwise entitled to a refund. I was given the promise of a refund by google support in writing. \n\nIt appears that google wants to back out of this promise. They fail to keep any agreements on timeline, callback appointments and follow up actions. What can I do?",
