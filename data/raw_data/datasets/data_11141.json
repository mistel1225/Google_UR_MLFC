    "title": "Is anybody seeing increased videochat (Whatsapp, Messenger & Signal) battery use since Android 11?",
    "content": "While overall battery consumption 'seems' to have improved with Android 11, the 3 videochat apps I use have at least doubled in consumption, at nearly 1% per hour. When looking at the battery use graph after a call the drop in the line is nearly vertical!\nSince Google wants us to: (1) use their apps, and (2) buy new phones, I wonder if they are following Apple's lead in bugging the update to move us to either use their videochat app(s) or get a new phone.",
