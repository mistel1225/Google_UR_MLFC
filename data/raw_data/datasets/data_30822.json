    "content": "Hi,\n\nI have the following issue with my recently purchased Google Pixel smartphone. The other day I was trying to update to the Android Q Beta, but in the middle of the process the phone turned off.\nAll I have now is a phone with a locked bootloader. I cannot neither unlock the bootloader nor sideload any OTA (when I try doing so I get a \"no devices/emulators found\" message). I tried unlock the bootloader with the Unified Anroid Toolkit, but no go because of the same message.",
