    "content": "Hello all,\n\nMy name is Marcos and Im coming to this forum to see if any of you know how I can ask Google help on a request.\nMy self and my GF, we are going to travel around the world in the begging of 2020. As many people that try to do this we are sayving as much money as possivel to be able to do this trip but one of the things that we would like to have to are nice pictures and videos.\n\nTo buy a device like a Pixel for each of us would be more that 1600 euros and this is a lot of money that we would prefer to use for housing and food during the trip.\n\nDo you guys know if is possible to ask google help on getting one device or maybe even 2. We are not youtubers or Vlogers but we we would like to start something since it will be one way to keep our memories available online and we will be able to promote the phone and the advantages of it.\n\nIf any of you know how I can reach them I would appreciate your help. I understand that this is a silly request but for us may be the only way so we dont spend money that is focus for food and housing\n\nThank you all\n\nMarcos",
