    "content": "I was using the phone regularly yesterday when I noticed a bit of a delayed/ jerky response in the system UI. I tried rebooting the phone using the power button, but the phone never turned back on. It just showed a battery icon with a question mark. I charged it overnight, but that didnt help. It just stayed a black screen with the question mark battery icon. When charging (wired or wirelessly with the Pixel stand) the icon stays for longer. I tried holding on to the power button for a long time. It just flashes to the same icon. Also, when holding the power button with the lower volume button. \n\nI bought the phone in Singapore 3 months ago, but am using it in India. Due to the current situation, I cant send the phone anywhere either. What can I do? \n\nThanks\nArun",
