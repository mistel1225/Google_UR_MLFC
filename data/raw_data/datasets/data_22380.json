    "title": "\"Can't find valid operating system\" on bootup, bootloader is locked so I can't flash factory image",
    "content": "I was locking my bootloader because I didn't want to have my phone rooted anymore. So, I factory reset it, set it up, and then went into the bootloader and typed \"fastboot flashing lock\". I selected yes to confirm the locking of my bootloader and then my phone rebooted. But now my phone says \"Can't find valid operating system\" and I can't boot into Android. I can't even flash a stock image, because I locked the bootloader. I can't unlock the bootloader, since I can't go into the OS and turn OEM Unlock on. Am I screwed?\n\nThanks!",
