    "content": "Functionality on phone is lost when connected to car via BT. I cannot use skype, wayz, spotify or anything. The only thing I can do is use my car's handfree system to make a call. As soon as connection is made my screen shows \"no sim\" and the data is blocked.  This is very frustrating. I have tried to change rules in driving mode, I have disabled Android auto, When I am a passenger in the same car - I cannot do anything if I am connected to bt. I suppose this has to do with \"do not disturb\" or \"digital wellbeing\" but for crying out loud let me make my own decisions. Anyone else have this frustration???",
