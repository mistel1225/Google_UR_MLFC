    "content": "It is set to use network date/time but it's not reflecting daylight savings time. I manually set it yesterday then after a few hours it showed daylight savings using the time I entered (so it was off by an additional hour). I switched it back to network time and it was fine until this morning, when it reverted back to pre daylight savings time.",
