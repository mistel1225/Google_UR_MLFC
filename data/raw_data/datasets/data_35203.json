    "title": "Pixel 3 Bluetooth headset connects ok, but audio garbled on calls before dropping out completely.",
    "content": "I just picked up my Pixel 3 a couple of days ago (moved from a Galaxy S7) and have been exoe problems with Bluetooth. I connected up my Platronics headset and discovered that when on a call the audio is garbled. I tried a set of Bluetooth earphones but same problem. Both devices worked flawlessly with my Galaxy S7.\n\nI have 12 days left where I can return the phone for a refund or exchange etc but I don't want to have to do that as I do like the Pixel, but in 2019 for a Flagship device to have a problem with Bluetooth right out of the box is unacceptable.\n\nAny advice would appreciated.\n\nMany thanks",
