    "content": "After upgrading to Android 11, I received a Phone Not Available for Voice notification and did not allow me to make any calls. I am on the O2 network in the UK. After removing the sim card and restarting the phone, I seem to now be able to make calls. Is this a known issue with Android 11? I never had this issue on Android 10.",
