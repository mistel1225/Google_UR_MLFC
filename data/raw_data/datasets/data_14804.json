    "content": "I cannot believe the experience I've had with Google and Android 11 the past few weeks. For a multi billion dollar company like Google, I expected a bit more. \n\nAfter a soft reboot, a factory reset, testing safe mode, installing the October security update, and speaking to Google reps that told me to just try another factory reset and said there was nothing they could do, my Pixel 3 XL continues to reboot on its own several times per day and screen flicker when I press the power button. Sometimes I can't even get through a Spotify song or I'll be on a phone call while it decides to reboot. It seems no one has any solution for this problem and the update has just broken my phone. I had no issues prior to Android 11. \n\nRidiculous. I've had this Pixel 3 for barely half a year. Guess I've learned my lesson and I'll keep it as a brick for a nice camera? Time to revert to my old phone or buy a new one. I'm done with this battle.",
