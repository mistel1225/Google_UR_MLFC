    "title": "PIXEL 3a HANGS UP ON CALLS",
    "content": "I bought my pixel 3a one month ago and everything was working great, but 10 days ago the phone started hanging up on calls. I can make calls, I have no issue with that but when someone calls me, I accept the call and it automatically hangs up (i don't even get a chance to say hi), it's so frustrating. I already tried restarting the phone but nothing changes. The software is up to date so i don't get what could be the reason. Nothing changed 10 days ago... i do answer correctly the calls.",
