    "content": "Hi everyone, how is it going?\n\nI simply felt obliged to post a follow-up after rambling extensively here:\nhttps://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/70863623?hl=en&msgid=70863623\nI'm happy to report that for at least 2 months now, all in all, android 11 is a delight. I'm consistently getting 5+ hours SOT on my almost two years old pixel 3. The UI is being polished continuously, removing glitches and bugs with every update.\n\nIn addition to the praise, I would like to point out:\n\n- wake screen when notification arrives is too short. Either make it slightly longer by default, or add an option to tweak it in settings;\n- wake screen when notification arrives while screen is in the pocket or face down should be altered to wake screen only when removed/flipped;\n- please, please make them both speakers fire upon incoming calls, or add an option to the settings, this request has been around for quite a while.\n\nThanks for all your work!",
