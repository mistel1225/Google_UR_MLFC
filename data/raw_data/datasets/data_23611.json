    "title": "Original Pixel Battery Life less than an hour?!",
    "content": "Ever since Android 9, my original pixel has been dying in about an hour at 20%. The phone was fine before the update, but since then I've had to carry around a portable battery pack, just to get through the day. I've already had to get the phone replaced, for the speaker issue, but now it can't hold a charge. It's totally unacceptable for a $1000.00 phone to be inoperable in less than two years from the release date. This phone in particular is only a little over a year old and it's the battery? Yeah right.",
