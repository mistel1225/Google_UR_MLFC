    "content": "I am currently in the beta program and when I updated to the most recent security patch, my phone no longer boots properly after restarting. I get stuck at the Google logo with a loading bar just continuously loading... Its been over an hour now and I've followed every possible solution to try and fix it. Hard restarts, plugging in, safe mode, etc.\n\nHow do I contact Google about my phone and getting it fixed? This is a little upsetting.",
