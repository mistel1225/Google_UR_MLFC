    "content": "In setting up my new Pixel 4a phone, I picked a pattern to unlock it. Then I was asked to enter my fingerprint by touching the back of the phone, in doing so I must have touched something because all of a sudden I was a few screens back. The phone asked me for my pattern and when entering it it refused to recognize it. I tried many times. I am now completely locked out and can't continue setting up the phone nor use it at all!",
