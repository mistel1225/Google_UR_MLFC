    "content": "Dear All, hello and hope you can assist me this time too!\n\nGot a new Pixel 3a XL today and found out the volume button to be a bit loose (in the direction of front/back) and even produce different \"click\" sound from time to time. The button is fully functional though but I'm wondering whether it's a common issue (since I discovered I'm not the only one with such \"issue\" and even not only on phones from Google) and can be safely ignored.\n\nThank you in advance!",
