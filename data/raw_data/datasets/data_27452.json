    "content": "Up until yesterday I was having no Bluetooth problems. Now my Pixel 3 XL can't see either my fitbit or my bluetooth scale. It can see and connect to my car and my computer. My computer can see and connect to both the fitbit and the scale.  I've rebooted my phone, turned bluetooth on and off again, rebooted my device, removed my bluetooth connection and attempted to reconnect (this worked after multiple attempts, but then stopped working as soon as my phone wanders out of range of my devices). What is going on?",
