    "content": "my comany has begun using a new secure portal app:Imprivata ID and tho I have loaded it to my pixel 3a and it appears I have all the settings correct, the company portal cannot receive info to allow me to register. I am the only one in my company with this problem. We did a test with my daughter's pixel on my work computer and it worked. But I need to have my own as need to enter a different security code every day. Anyone know what might be hanging things up? i have reinstalled the app, all notifications appear to be on,  but there might be something I'm not seeing.",
