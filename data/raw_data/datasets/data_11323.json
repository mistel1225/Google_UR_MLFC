    "content": "When I took the phone out of the box, it slipped from my hand  and dropped on my dinning table. It's only about 5 inches high and the screen cracked at one corner. \nWhen I contacted pixel support, I was only told where I should bring the phone to get fixed. I asked if google was interested in investigating any potential quality issue in my case. The answer they gave me was no because it is not in their policy. Their conclusion was that customers have to live with any physical damage situations. \nIf they hope that I will consider their phones in the future, the answer definitely is no.",
