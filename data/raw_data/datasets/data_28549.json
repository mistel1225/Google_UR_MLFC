    "content": "I have been having major battery issues for the last few weeks and have been in talks with Google help over chat and email. They have escalated my case but I haven't heard much from them as my battery has continued to become more volatile and now my phone appears to be swelling and the back is beginning to come off. I was trying to put in a warranty claim but the last chat I had with a Google associate I was told that I would have to wait until someone contacted me. I'm wondering if anyone has suggestions on how to deal with this issue or escalate it so I can actually get some results. ",
