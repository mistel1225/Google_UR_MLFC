    "content": "I recently upgraded to the Pixel 5 and while reviewing the battery usage (which is quite amazing, I must say), I noticed the battery icon under Settings > Battery always remains full, regardless of the percentage or battery icon status in the top right corner.  I've tried rebooting the phone and some other troubleshooting, without any change to the behavior.  I recall on my Pixel 3, it would correspond with the battery percentage and respond the same as the icon in the top right corner.  Any details on how to fix this or is it intended?",
