    "content": "when ever i do anything, use apps, texting, closing other apps it stops what im doing, the screen goes black for a second and goes back as if i wasnt doing anything. like if i was googling something or texting someone when it goes black and then comes back whatever i typed is gone. i have restarted my phone shut it off, closed all the apps i had open, which was hard because it kept doing that. \n\nnot sure what else I can do so ill take any ideas at this point because its getting hard to use my phone",
