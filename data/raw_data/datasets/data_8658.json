    "content": "On pixel's chrome app, when you download a docx file, it stores it into the download folder by default. There is a link to open it presented in chrome, but it never works. The link does not open Google docs app and it gives a storage permission error. I have noticed that if Google docs is already running in background, chrome gives the error then makes Google docs active on the display. Still, you have to go open the file manually. In contrast, if you open the file in the files app, it immediately recognizes the default app is Google docs and opens the document in that app. Help me fix chrome or configure it properly.",
