    "content": "Hi all.\n\nI've been told repeatedly that Android 11 is rolling out to my Pixel 3a over the 2 weeks after launch. I have had this confirmed when asking in support that this means September 22 (As Android 11 launched on September 8). When I asked what I'd need to do if I didn't get Android 11 by that date, I was told that I definitely would and I should stop worrying.\n\nWell, September 22 has come and gone and I haven't received the update. I have ruined my setup by performing a factory reset, and after being referred to a specialist in Support chat, I was told to wait. \n\nWhy was I given a 2-week timeframe which has now not been met? And is anyone else not getting the Android 11 update yet?\n\n(UK based, just before people come in with the delays in India).",
