    "content": "If I send a text to someone, I have to rotate my screen to landscape to actually send it because the right side of my touch screen doesn't work anymore (an old pixel 3a problem I am living with)...I hit send and when I rotate back, the text I just wrote is automatically pasted into the next message bubble. This is super annoying because now I have to erase every single text I send. Help.",
