    "title": "Google Doodle in feed screen",
    "content": "I live in the UK and have a Pixel 2 running the latest version of Android (May 2019 update of Android Pie).  My wife has exactly the same phone as me, running the same version.  We have the same version of the Google app installed, and the same settings (including long-press on the search bar, \"Preferences\", \"Searchbox effects\".)  \n\nThe thing is, whenever there is a Google doodle, if she swipes right on the home screen to see her feed, the doodle appears there for her too, and sometimes animated doodles appear in the search bar, but they don't appear on my phone at all.  I know some people want to turn this sort of thing on, but I'd actually like to see it on mine!\n\nThings I've tried...\n* Reboot phone (I actually switch it off every night anyway.)\n* Clear cache & data from Google app\n* Uninstall Google app & reinstall\n* Turn searchbox effects off and on again\n\nNothing seems to make the doodles appear for me though!\n\nAll help gratefully received!",
