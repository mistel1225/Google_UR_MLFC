    "content": "Just got brand new Pixel 4a 5G, it's not able to see any of my Tiles.  For example, the one on my keyring.  The pixel 3 that I replaced with 4a can see all my Tiles just fine.  I have both 3 and 4a at moment, have not returned pixel 3 yet.  The 3 can see my Tiles fine and discover them, showing me current location.\n\nThe 4a can not see any of the Tiles.  I marked my Tiles as lost and walk near a neighbor who own a Tile and I get a message that the community has found my \"lost\" Tiles.  So obviously my Tiles is working fine (I checked the battery on them, pressing the Tiles and they make the musical sound).\n\nAnyone experienced similar issues?   Should I return this Pixel4a?  Is bluetooth broken?\n\nFYI, for those not familiar with what a Tile is.\nhttps://www.thetileapp.com/en-us/\n\nIt's not just the Tiles, but also other bluetooth devices.  It's hit-or-miss which one work with the 4a.  My earbuds work, but the 4a can not see nor pair with my HP Chromebook (the pixel3, Samsung GS20, other phones can pair with the chromebook fine).\n\nI am beginning to think the 4a bluetooth hw is bad.  I'll give it another week before returning the phone.",
