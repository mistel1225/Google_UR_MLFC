    "content": "My Pixel was stuck in a bootloop so I performed a factory reset, but I'm still unable to turn it on. This implies that the issue is a hardware problem and should be fixable under warranty protection, but I don't know how to access the warranty center to check whether my device is covered and how to access that coverage - all the warranty links on various Pixel help pages go to a general refund page. What can I do?",
