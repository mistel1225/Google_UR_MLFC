    "content": "So according to the map, I should have 5g but my pixel 4a 5g isn't showing any 5g connection.  I'm using the G025E which is compatible with the TMobile sub 6 network.  Mint Mobile states it allows 5g... so why am I not seeing the 5g indicator no matter where I go in Bellevue Washington.",
