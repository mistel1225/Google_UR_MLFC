    "title": "USB Port Message \" USB Port detects moisture or debris\" message. USB port charger disabled.",
    "content": "I had the above mentioned message come across the screen of my phone a week ago. As a result of which I'm only able to use the phone when it's on the charger and plugged in. As soon as I unplug it the phone goes off. I'm assuming because the USB port has been disabled. The phone never got wet. Twice over the past week I received another message which stated that there was no longer moisture or debris detected in the USB port and it could now be used. However, as soon as I take it off the charger it goes off. Please advise",
