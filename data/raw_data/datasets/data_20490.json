    "content": "Whenever I am listening to music via bluetooth headphones and I try to unlock my phone (either manually or face unlock), my headphones automatically mute (music continues to play while muted). Afterwards I have to un-mute my headphones.\n\nNever had this problem before until recently when I decided to use my bluetooth headphones again.\n\nAny thoughts?",
