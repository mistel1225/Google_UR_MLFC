    "title": "Damaged after \"OK to use USB port\"",
    "content": "My Pixel 4a fell into the toilet and I took it out immediately. Except for a message \"liquid or debris in USB port\",  the mobile phone was operating normally.\n\nBut, after I get a message \"OK to use USB port, no longer detect liquid or debris\", the phone is completely unusable.\n\nI inserted paper into the USB port and took it out, and found that the paper became wet. Obviously, my Pixel 4a did not accurately detect the presence or not of liquid. Damage to the phone caused by re-enabling the USB port while the liquid is still present.\n\nIf the phone cannot accurately detect the liquid, it should let the user shut down phone as soon as possible and seek the help of mobile phone repairers, rather than waiting for the re-enabling of the USB port.",
