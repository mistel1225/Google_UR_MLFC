    "content": "Hi, I have a Pixel 2 phone and several Google home minis around my house. When I say \"Okay Google, call Bob\", the Google mini tries to place the call instead of my phone. How do I stop this from happening? I would like to disable the calling feature entirely on the speakers. Is this possible? Or can I prioritize which device makes calls?\n\nThanks!",
