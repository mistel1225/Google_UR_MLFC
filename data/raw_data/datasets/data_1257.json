    "title": "Pixel 5 battery drain and huge drop in remaining percentage after reboot",
    "content": "My Google Pixel 5 battery percentage sometimes drops suddenly from wherever it is at to a much lower value after reboot, or earlier today, even while using the phone. I have already tried things like turning off the \"mobile data always active,\" and have tried changing the settings for items like \"adaptive battery\" and \"adaptive charging\" to on and off but it appears to make no difference. Some of the threads seem to suggest that turning off 5G makes it better, but my phone is usually on Wifi at home, and yet it still happens.\n\nThis is totally ridiculous because I have had this phone for only a couple of months now, and cannot trust this device to last: the only reason I bought it was that Google wouldn't provide any more security updates on my Pixel 2XL, which still performs like a champ, otherwise.\n\nGoogle engineers: some of the responses in related threads seem to suggest that a fix was out in December/January, but I am on the latest, May 5, 2021 patch and am still seeing this. Any suggestions would be helpful but an actual fix that addresses the issue would be ideal!",
