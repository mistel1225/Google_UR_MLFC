    "content": "Hello,\nI'm a Pixel 3a XL owner and I really miss the possibility to shot portrait mode picture without any zoom in. I am an amauter photographer and when using a reflex camera I like to shot full size portrait, including more than the subject into the scene.\nPlease consider it, I've switched to Pixel mainly for its great camera, but i really miss the full portrait mode.\nThanks in advance.",
