    "content": "I have tried clicking on the notification 'data transfer, available or in progress'.  It was unable to do anything to shut down the data transfer to all.  This worries me something is churning away behind the scenes that shouldn't be.  I don't want to transfer any data I just want it to stop and the message to go away.  I did try to transfer data from my old Samsung using the cable but the screen has died (which is why I need a new phone)  and I couldn't get it to work. Now the data transfer tool seems to still be working. How do I get it to turn off?",
