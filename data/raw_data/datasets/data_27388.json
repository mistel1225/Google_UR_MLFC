    "content": "Recently I saw a post that talked about selling an old phone. The answer mentioned there are \"certain steps\" to take to un-enroll the phone from Google.\n\nWhen I sell or donate an old phone, I encrypt they phone's memory and then perform a factory reset â€“ hoping that that this will clear my data and bring the phone back to a like-new state.\n\nIs this sufficient to clear my data and make the phone ready if there is a next user?",
