    "content": "So here's what happend I got a RMA replacement from gsupport and when I unboxed it, I noticed that the vibration and haptic feedback was low and it was set to high, so I got another replacement because I contacted google support and I recieved that replacement today, but the replacement had the same problem that the first replacement had, you can't even feel that you got a notification or a call because the vibration was so low.",
