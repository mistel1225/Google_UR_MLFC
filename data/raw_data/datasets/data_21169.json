    "content": "Firstly the photo makes the light much brighter but in person it is still noticeable throughout the day especially at night. I got this phone just under 4 weeks ago and there was no line.\nHowever yesterday I noticed it, I tried restarting my phone but it still was there. \nMy settings are all at default, the only thing that I have done is then of the always on feature that shows the clock.\nWhen adjusting the brightness it is more visible when the screen is brighter.\nI have tried searching this forum but have not found a similar problem. The closest I could find was people talking about a vertical line through the middle of the phone. Is this the same problem? And can it be fixed or will I need to return it .\n\nMany thanks",
