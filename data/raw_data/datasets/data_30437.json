    "title": "No icons shown on lock screen",
    "content": "I just got my new Pixel 3 and cannot manage to see that I have a whatsapp/viber message on the lock screen.\n\nI have the Ambient display on for 'New notifications' and it does light up (for viber, not so for Whatsapp), but it doesn't provide me with any info on what app made it light up, as no icons are shown.\n\nAfter the screen has gone black again, when I double tap only the clock shows. If I double tap again, it lights up but it doesn't show the Whatsapp or Viber icons or any thing about them on the screen. If I unlock it shows the icon on the top (please see attached screenshot). \n\nWhat I find strange is that clearly other apps work (please see screenshot of notification from System and Photos re. my previous screenshot), which leads me to believe it may be specific to messaging apps?\n\nTo clarify, I am aware that I can have a 'pop up' message, but that's not what I want: I just want to wake up the phone without unlocking it and see if I have new messages.\n\nDoes anyone have any idea of what I may be doing wrong?\n\nThank you for your help.",
