    "content": "I recently bought a brand new Pixel 3. When using Facebook Messenger, I cannot record sound. I have done the following: cleared data, cleared cache, reinstalled and restarted, checked to make sure my permissions were set to include microphone. Voice can be recorded on other apps like Snapchat, so this is only with FB Messsenger. Is anyone else having this issue or know of something else I can try?",
