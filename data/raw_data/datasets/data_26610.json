    "content": "When I use my Pixel 3, it often makes this strange noise a bit like a short deeper trill. It doesn't appear to be associated with any particular app and I can't find what's causing it. It's beginning to get on my nerves. When the screen is unlocked, it sounds every few minutes or so. At first I thought perhaps it was to do with battery running out but it happens when fully charged. I've been unable to locate any settings that would stop it. Any idea what could be causing it?",
