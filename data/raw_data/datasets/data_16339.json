    "content": "Pixel XL started boot looping, after a factory reset the phone starts ok and there are no problems until connecting it to WiFi and installing app updates, at which point it starts boot looping again. The phone can stay in non-updated state for a long time without boot loop problems. Are there any apps I should avoid installing or updating?",
