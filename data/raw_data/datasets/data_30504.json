    "title": "Poor and degrading battery life on original Google Pixel.",
    "content": "First off, the battery used to be great. But over the past few months, the battery has degraded rather quickly and now won't last more than a few hours. The battery will last for about 2 hours of screen time, and around 4 if it is asleep. \n\nI have tried clearing app caches, uninstalling unused apps, and restarting my phone. All of these have not worked. My pixel is on the latest Android version, and there are no new updates available at this time. \n\nWhen my pixel was new, it had much longer battery life, at least 6-8 hours. I've been using an external battery lately so I can continue to use my phone throughout the day, and I end up charging my pixel 4-5 times per day, not including me charging it at night. My father has the same phone, and it does not have this issue whatsoever. \n\nPlease let me know if there's anything what we can do to fix this battery problem.",
