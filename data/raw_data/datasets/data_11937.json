    "title": "Pixel 4a speaker sounds bad",
    "content": "Audio sounds blown, bad on speaker when I listen to Spotify and YouTube, particularly pianos. Even at low volumes, the sound is very bad with some music, such as meditation, which is very gentle. I switched back and forth with my Samsung, which was very clean in sound. I'm hoping this is not the actual way the speaker works on this phone. Love the phone but the speaker sounds noticeably bad. Even asked my girlfriend to listen side by side to ensure it wasn't just me. \nFurther, I have gone around in circles unable to find a way to contact Google to discuss. I get to the call or chat and follow the steps and never see any options on my phone (via settings, support) or online to get help. Around in circles online for 30 minutes. This is my 1st Google phone and I'm really frustrated by difficulty with support for brand new phone. I finally just posted here...  Why is it so difficult to talk or chat to anyone?",
