    "content": "I had Google Assistant on Redmi Note 8T and it worked well. I was seeing the \"Hi, how can I help\" message every time I said \"Ok, Google\"\nNow I bought Pixel 4 and Assistant is just using the Google search for every command or question I ask. It is not telling the jokes, not playing games etc. All is going to Google search.\nPlease advise what can I do with that.",
