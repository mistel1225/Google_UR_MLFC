    "content": "I have a pixel 3 and the earpiece has stopped working. This is the third replacement phone I have had. It is also the first refurbished phone I have had. Why does this issue keep happening?\n\nIt is literally the speaker. YouTube only plays out of one speaker now, as well as music. I have to talk through speakerphone. \n\nHow come no one is talking about this?",
