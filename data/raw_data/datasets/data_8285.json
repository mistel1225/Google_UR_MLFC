    "content": "The notification screen on my Pixel for a randomly drops down even when I'm not touching the phone. initially I thought it was an issue with a screen protector or the bumper of my OtterBox protective case. Even after removing the screen protector and the case it still happens. On some occasions it takes a few minutes for the screen to react to my touch, well at other times I have to reboot the phone to be able to access the screen.",
