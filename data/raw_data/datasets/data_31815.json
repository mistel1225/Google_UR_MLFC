    "content": "I am developing an app and part of it is responsive web.  Multiple pages have a dropdown on them and all works fine except, once an item is chosen and the drop down closes, talkback reads the name of the web controller again.  I am trying to get it to stop.  I have tried changing the name of the controller, setting it to a blank value, a different value and none of those work.  It continues to read the old value.",
