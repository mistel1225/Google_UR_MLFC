    "content": "I don't know how long it's been like this and I've only noticed this in the last day or so. The screen that displays on my phone is only displayed on a smaller portion of my screen. It doesn't display all the way to the edges of the screen like normal. Everything is still visible so it's not dead pixels or some kind of physical damage. It's like looking at a 4:3 display on a 16:9 screen. This situation isn't that extreme but I didn't know how else to describe what I'm looking at. Does anyone know how to fix this?",
