    "content": "Is there a way to enable auto-answering of calls when your Google Pixel 4a is connected to a Bluetooth headset? Just so we're clear here, I am not talking about when you are driving. I work in a call center and I route my calls from my softphone to my cell phone specifically for this capability. Unfortunately, our softphone client cannot do this. In every other device I've owned, I've have been able to enable this functionality, but I cannot for the life of me figure out how to do that on this phone. On my old Samsung, I could either go to settings within the phone app or take the scenic route and enable it under Accessibilities.",
