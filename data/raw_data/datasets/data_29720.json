    "content": "I had plugged the phone into the same charger I've been using for moths and about 30 minutes later noticed the amount of charge had not increased despite hearing the charging tone when I plugged it in and seeing the lightning bolt symbol at the top of the display.  I checked the battery setting page and it said it was not charging at this time.  I attempted to restart the phone, but it did not power back on.  I even plugged it back into the original charger and cord and it will still not power on at all.  I have attempted several times to power it on using the power button, but it will not power back on.  What if anything can I do at this point to recover my phone?",
