    "content": "The sound on my Pixel one have stop working. The only sound I can hear is the sound coming from the bluetooth speaker.\n\nThe headjack don't work either.\n\nI have tried changing all volumes in any possible way i can think of... \n- mute/unmute\n- slide the volume ranges on all areas.\n- toggle disturbe mode\n- booted into safe-mode\n- turned off bluetooth\n\n(The volume buttons works but it dose not fix the problems.)\n\nI then tried factory reset (twice) it did work for a moment, i could restart the phone after running some updates but once the battery run out while while playing a game with working sound, then the sound stop working all together after that\n\n----\n\nIt have gotten much worse since i did my first factory reset.\nBefore i did the first factory reset i had some issue answering the phone, i could not hear anything so i was always forced to hangup, restart my phone and call back",
