    "content": "My phone won't connect via cell even with my sim card in. The phone is definitely seeing the sim card since my phone number is displayed in settings, but on the lock screen it says \"No Sim Card\" in the top left. The card worked just fine when I plugged it into a different phone. Honestly no clue what's going on.",
