    "content": "I've been having problems with Google pay since returning to Singapore from Australia. in Australia, everything worked splendidly - transport, store payments and app payments. when I got to Singapore, initially, the car service app wouldn't process payments, which I'd checked with the car service provider and my bank before checking with Google pay help support on chat. Now the app doesn't work for in store payments, with no error messages. I've been back and forth with help support for a week now but no solution to get it working again has come through. I really enjoyed the convenience and I've since seen other users using other devices paying with Gpay in stores, so I'm starting to think it's my device (pixel 3 xl). how it worked so well in Australia but can't in Singapore remains a mystery. any ideas on how I can get it up and running again? I've done the usual uninstall/reinstall/remove and add card thing so anything beyond that would be great.",
