    "content": "Hello, \n\nmy phone does not recognise the charger and the earphones that came with it when I bought it.\nBoth the charger and the earphones work on my girlfriend phone (a Samsung).\n\nThe original charger does not work even when the phone is turned off. I tried cleaning the port, using the phone in safe mode, activating USB debugging but the same problems appear. \n\nI can charge the phone with a Usb a to c cable.\n\nAny idea on what could be wrong? They both stopped working this afternoon.",
