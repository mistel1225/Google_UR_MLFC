    "content": "Have charged my pixel 3xl with a macbook charger before with no issues. Today, I left it on the charger for about 15 minutes. After I removed the phone from the charger, it had no signal. Wifi was not working and it did not recognize my sim card. I restarted the phone and after the logo was done loading like during a regular boot, instead of taking me to the lock screen, the phone turned off. When pressing the power buttton to wake the screen, there is a 5 second delay to do so, with the touchscreen not responding to touch either. I tried safe mode and the same problems persisted. Delay on the power button, unresponsive touch screen, and even a vibrating, but non functional fingerprint senor. I managed to into my  phone just once and none of the radios were working, wifi could not turn on, sim wasnt recognized, and even bluetooth would not stay on. The radios would just shut off. I have no Idea what to do.",
