    "title": "Where can I find second copy of sounds I added?",
    "content": "I have my favorite ringtones, alarms, and notifications I move to my new phone each time I get one.  I did so on my new Pixel 4a before I did a data transfer (using AT&T Mobile Transfer tool) so I could set it up before transferring my SIM and data to starting to actually use it, and the transfer apparently also copied the sounds (I thought it was only going to transfer my sound preferences, which it did not copy at all).  I now see each one listed twice when I go to select a sound, where i did not before the sync, and a couple I added after the sync show up only once.  But for the life of me, I can't find where the second copy is.  The ones I put in manually are in Internal Storage/Alarms, Ringtones. etc.  That's also where they were on the old phone, so i don't know where else it would copy them.  Where can I look to find the other copy?  It has to be somewhere that selecting My Sounds from the sound selection tool looks.  BTW, I've looked via my computer connected via USB and using Total Commander on the phone itself, and they must be buried in a directory I just haven't thought to look in.",
