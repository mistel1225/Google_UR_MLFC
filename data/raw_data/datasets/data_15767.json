    "content": "My Pixel 2 has yet to receive the Android 11 update. I've tried multiple things including clearing the Google Play Services cache, restarting the phone, making sure I'm connected to WiFi with full battery, etc.\n\nI check for an update multiple times a day but it says I'm fully up to date on Android 10. Last update was the security update on August 5th.\n\nIs there anything else I should be doing?",
