    "content": "Just updated my pixel 3 xl to android 10 and faced an issue with touch calibration. \n\nOn homescreen, the bottom row icons aren't very responsive to touch. If i touch any of these icons, it doesn't work. I have to touch a little bit above the icons to make it work.\n\nI have made a video . Please watch and solve the issue:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/reOq33yTDNw",
