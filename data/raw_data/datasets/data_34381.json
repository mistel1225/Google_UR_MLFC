    "title": "Pixel battery drain after battery replacement",
    "content": "I had the battery on my Pixel replaced last week by Puls. I seemed to have a new lease on life for this phone with good performance (only down to 30% after a full day of use). But then the Android 9 Feb 9th update was pushed to my device and now the battery drain problem is back, draining by 25% in about two hours of normal use (browsing and email). Hoping I can get some form of support from Google as I just spent cash on a repair that was thwarted by a software update.",
