    "content": "When I select a song that my phone has reported as \"now playing\" (great feature, by the way!) I am given a list of options, one of which is YouTube Music (my default music provider). When I tap on it, the phone opens YouTube Music but does not go to the song itself. Is this normal?\n\nAlso, when I tapped on \"add to liked songs\", it seemingly does not get added. I checked this by searching for the song in YouTube Music afterwards to check, and it had not added as a liked song.",
