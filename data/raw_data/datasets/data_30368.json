(It was yellow at the first I opened the box and turn it on)\nI have checked every option in this phone(night mode or color option..) but none of these functions could make my display white.\nI also installed lots of display option applications but they only can manage RGB level individually, not make the whole balance.\nI think it is not about SW but HW issue.\nCould you please tell me what should I do?",
