    "title": "Pixel 3a XL black screen, returned for repair and came back worse. What can I do?",
    "content": "My phone suffered the black screen, where the phone received calls and texts but screen would never wake. Called Google and it was (and is) under warranty. I sent the phone in and received an email saying that the screen was broken and it would cost $140 to fix it. I balked, since the screen was not broken when I sent it in, and the cost seemed excessive for a warranty repair. Google sent it back, unrepaired. Now that I have unpacked it, it appears significantly more damaged than when I sent it in. There are scratches around the edge of the screen, scratches under the screen (they must have taken the screen off) and of course the screen is cracked in several places. It really doesn't even look like my phone. Is there anything I can do about this? I feel like I've been treated unfairly and the return process was a disaster. At this point, I'm thinking of replacing the screen myself but the damage to the case is irreparable.",
