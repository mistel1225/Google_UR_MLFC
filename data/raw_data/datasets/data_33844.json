    "content": "I've tried connecting my Sony WH-H900N via Bluetooth to my Pixel 3 XL several times and it never shows up in the list of possible units to pair with. Other units around me do appear, but not the headphones. I've tried various trouble shooting but with no success. Does anybody else share this problem?",
