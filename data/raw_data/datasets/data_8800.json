    "title": "Restore Bezel to Hide Hole Punch",
    "content": "Does the Pixel 4A have an option to create the appearance of a forehead bezel and then hide the hole punch? That's an option in Samsung devices and will affect my decision about whether to buy a Pixel 4A or 5 (as I don't like the hole punch or the long-thin aspect ratio of the image on these phones).\n\nThanks in advance.",
