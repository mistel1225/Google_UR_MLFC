    "title": "Spotify alarm set once, but cannot replace it with another one",
    "content": "I was trying to replace one Spotify wake-up alarm with another one and it indicated it had been selected with a blue checkmark inside of a circle, but then when I went to the ringtone the old alarm was still selected.\n\nSomehow I waited for a few minutes before returning, though, and it selected it. Maybe lag? Anyway it works now but it wasn't for a while, so I thought I should still share. Point is, I don't know what I did to make it work.",
