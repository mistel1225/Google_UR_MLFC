    "title": "Google Maps Dark Mode Full Screen Sometimes Has Hard To Read Dark Status Bar Text",
    "content": "You can see above it's dark text and too difficult to read, especially when mounted on a auto dashboard.  This happens sometimes.  Other times it's light color text.  Seems to be random when it's dark or light text.  Only setting I changed was to pick the option in maps to make it always dark mode.  Phone is updated but still this issue happens sometimes.",
