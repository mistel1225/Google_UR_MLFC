    "content": "I changed service providers and have a new number for my new pixel 4a. I needed to change the number on record in my google account, but so far have been unable to do so. Two lengthy chat sessions have not solved the problem. I am not receiving text verification codes from google; I am told I should not need them, since two-step verification is turned off on my phone. I can receive texts from other senders. In addition, I am not receiving incoming phone calls to my new number. Two major problems.",
