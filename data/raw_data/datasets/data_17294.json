    "content": "I've recently been having an issue when using my headset microphone with the OEM USB-C to headphone jack adapter where the audio would come in just fine, but the microphone won't work. I tested multiple headsets just to make sure it wasn't just an issue with one of my headsets. The OEM USB-C earbud microphone works just fine along with Bluetooth microphones and the phone's microphone.",
