    "content": "Camera app started crashing after update to 11.  Worked fine in 10 and earlier.  I'm seeing lots of complaints about it online.  Cleared camera cache and data, deleted .nomedia files wherever they existed, did a factory reset with no success.  I have noticed a blue dot to the right of Night Sight that wasn't there before, and \"Save location is on\" pops up briefly before it exits.",
