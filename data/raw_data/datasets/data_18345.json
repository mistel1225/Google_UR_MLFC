    "content": "As shown below, the Dark Theme is set to Off, but it is actually On. (This menu is displayed in dark mode on the screen, but not the screenshot). If I toggle it On, the menu displays with it Off, but when I leave the menu, it is back On. OS is up to date. Rebooting does not help. I don't want to do a factory reset if I can avoid it.",
