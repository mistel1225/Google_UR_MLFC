    "content": "My back camera does not focus anymore. Just out of nowhere. Yesterday 21:00pm I made a last picture. This morning, de camera was broken. No new apps or updates were installed. The front camera does work properly. I already did some steps to try to fix the problem (restarting/remove cache memory/update phone), but nothing works.",
