    "content": "Install the new screen on a Google pixel XL purchased from Amazon. The digitizer has frozen multiple times and requires a hard reboot with the side buttons. This last reboot took 10 attempts for the digitizer came back to life. I am thinking it's either a bad connection inside or a faulty screen digitizer? \nI fear opening it again or I will break the screen, (That's what happened when I was trying to open it to check the connection because half of the screen went gray).",
