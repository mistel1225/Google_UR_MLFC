    "content": "Hey, guys, I currently own a Pixel OG and really like it.  However in the winter, I frequently pull out my phone to take a picture and it will just shutdown.  I just want a Google phone so I don't care about which pixel it is.  \n\nSo what Pixel tolerate the cold best?\n\nMy experience so far with my Pixel OG:\nThe phone battery drop 30% when I am outdoor and the phone is \"warm\" in my winter coat.  The phone temperature is usually around 10C (50-60f).  When the phone is in my outside pocket it is usually around -10C (20f) it will just shutdown when I turn the screen on.\n\nMy old Motorola will be okay at -20c (close to 0F) so I still use it for winter runs and mountaineering.  Is there a Pixel that can do this?\n\nThanks in advance guys,\n\nThanh",
