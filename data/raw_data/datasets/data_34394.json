    "content": "I've gone to the contacts, phone, etc apps in search of help; nothing seems to address this issue.  I apparently chose a default for some of my \"favorites\" contacts.  The affected contacts' icons all show a tiny gray-color phone handset image.  My favorites icons without the tiny gray handset image all perform the way I want them all; that is, I touch the icon & then am offered the menu of how to communicate--NO IMMEDIATE phone call.  How can I get rid of the tiny gray icon & the action it seems to invoke?",
