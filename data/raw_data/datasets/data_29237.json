    "content": "Hi everyone. I've done a search and can't find the answer so hopefully someone can help. I have a Series 7 Hisense Smart TV (50N7) which I previously cast to from my old Samsung phone. It worked great, and was simple to set up, no apps needed. Since upgrading to the Pixel 3XL I have not been able to connect. I follow the same steps as on my old phone but my device refuse to 'discover' my TV. I don't believe it to be an issue with my TV or my network as I can still use YouTube from my Pixel to my TV, and my old phone still connects fine. I've tried several different casting apps but the issue always comes back to my phone not being able to find my TV. I'm worried that the answer is going to be that I have to have a Chromecast which seems absurd to me. Anyone know the solution?",
