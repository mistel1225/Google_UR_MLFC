    "title": "app auto update doesn't work",
    "content": "App auto update feature works only ~2% of the time. Other 98% of time requires me to clear cache, clear data, and restart phone to get app updates - and even then, that only works about 50% of the time. I understand this is a known and widespread issue but that Google hasn't acknowledged it nor provided any solutions (at least not yet). Hoping somebody knows an end-around way to fix this.... or confirm that my device is defective.",
