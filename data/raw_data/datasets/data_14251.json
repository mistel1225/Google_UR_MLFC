    "content": "Camera comes on and then shuts off in 5 sec. There never is a picture to take. Screen is black  I have tried two separate factory resets, two removing .nomedia files, downloaded a camera fixer app, took aagnet to see if my lens was stuck, turned various settings on and off. My camera still does not work. My phone and the camera app worked great until Android 11. Very dissatisfied with google at this moment. Are there any other solutions to fix camera app?  If not I am switching to the new  iPhone",
