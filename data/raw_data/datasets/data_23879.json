    "content": "I'm pretty sure its just due to the design of the bottom speakers vs. the front facing speakers on the 3 XL, however... The sound quality is TERRIBLE compared to the 3XL. I just played music side by side, and the 3 XL just sounds a lot better. \n\nHowever, are there additional sound settings, or an EQ for the 4 XL? I can't find one anywhere in the sound settings. Not sure if a bass boost or something would help, but as it stands out of the box the sound quality went really backwards here. Is it just me?",
