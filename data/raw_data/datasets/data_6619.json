    "content": "Pixel 4a 5g on Verizon Prepaid\n\nThis started after latest update a few days ago. Anytime I click on a website link, I get this message saying Carrier Services keeps stopping. Then after that a few times, it doesn't do anything. Just fails to deliver link. Same thing happens with the news feed to left of home page, or trying to open a link in an email.\n\nI tried both uninstalling the Carrier app, and uninstalling latest version. Neither helped.\n\nPlease help!!!!\n\nThanks!",
