    "title": "Why is my Spotify music alarm playing music at random times in between alarms?",
    "content": "For the past two mornings I have my alarms set for 5:00am, 5:05am, 5:10am, etc. For each alarm I have it connected to my Spotify account to play one of my playlists.\n\nThis was always working fine up until yesterday morning (Feb 4th) when I would dismiss the alarm at 5:00am, then at 5:03am the music would start playing when I wasn't even touching my phone. \n\nThe same this is happening currently as I write this. At 5:20am my alarm goes off, I dismiss, and at 5:24am the music starts playing yet again.\n\nIt is odd because whenever the music starts playing in between the alarms, the music sounds glitchy. The song skips and doesn't flow.\n\nI'm also writing a post in Spotify but I wasn't sure if Google had any help they could give me.\n\nThank you.",
