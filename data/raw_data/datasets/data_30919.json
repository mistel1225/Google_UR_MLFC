    "content": "I have a pixel 1st generation, battery last less than 6 hours and every time battery saver switch on (when battery level is 20%) if i am using some apps, they close or if i use chorme, it reloads the current page. I am thinking that there are 2 problems, one is the battery that is at the end of its lifespan (my mobile is 3 years old) and maybe the hw that controls the battery have some issue. I would like to know what to do (full reset doesn't resolve it).",
