    "title": "Pixel Stand no longer charging - Constant Orange light",
    "content": "I am having the orange error light issue which a lot of other people on these forums are having....\nInitially, unplugging the stand, and plugging it back in fixed the issue. Now it's just constantly showing the orange light.\nThe Stand is just over 2 Months old, and has been plugged into my Pixel 5 charger since day one.\nFrom what I have read in the community forums, it seems to be a hardware issue which should be covered under warranty (Bought online from google store). \nThe only problem is, I can not find anywhere to get in contact to make a claim! It's just an endless loop of \"Help Centres\" and \"Info Pages\", where can I find an email address or a live chat to finally sort this out?!\n\nThanks in advance!",
