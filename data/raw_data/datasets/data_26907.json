    "content": "I have been trying to post a small batch of photos to Facebook and almost immediately when I try the post fails to upload. \n\nI have cleared the cache of Facebook and Google Play store. The photos are also for sure in my internal storage and I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app. Does anyone have any other suggestions?!  The photos also appear to be blurry and not all of them are showing.\n\n( The phone is also completely up to date)",
