    "content": "It's a brand new phone. So I don't have to empty out the cache. I restarted it bunch of times. It'll work for one or two phone calls. Then I have to do it again cause people can't hear me. I also can't hear if the call is going through. Unless I switch it to speaker then I can hear the ringing but I can't talk to them. Thinking about sending this phone back to the person who sold it to me. This is getting ridiculous having to power off and on my phone just to make a phone call. Is there a fix for this? Is it a software or firmware problem?",
