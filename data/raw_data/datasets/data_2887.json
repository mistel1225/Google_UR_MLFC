    "content": "Hi\nI replaced the screen on my pixel 4 along with the whole body of the phone. So I had to move all components from the phone with the broken screen to the new one. After I did that the phone cannot secure a connection to wifi. I made sure I follow all the right steps to reassemble the phone. I reset the phone ran it in safe mode and reset router and tried all the troubleshooting steps but did not fix the problem. I am out of options and wanted to see if anyone here have any suggestions to fix this problem. It also connects to my other phone when I use the other phone as a WiFi hotspot. And other devices at my home connects to the wifi just fine.\n\nThank you",
