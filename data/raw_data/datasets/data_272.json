    "content": "[There are many posts about this issue on various phones, but they've all been locked so I'm starting a new one.]\n\nThe At-A-Glance temperature on my Pixel 4a Home screen keeps disappearing. It comes back after a reboot but then will disappear again. This happened when the phone was on Android 10, and now on Android 11.\n\nThis also happened regularly on my Nokia 6.1, an Android One phone running Android 10.\n\nHow on earth does this keep happening? A weather widget is such a basic feature, but this problem is now years old and is still happening on Google's own Pixel phones running Android 11.",
