    "content": "Constantly getting a \"liquid or debris in charging port. Cannot charge\"\n\nMessage despite trying multiple cables, cleaning phone etc. \n\nHappening since 2 weeks now and only able to charge phone when it is switching off. \n\nThis is quite annoying and none of my phones before did this. Looks like over solutioning.",
