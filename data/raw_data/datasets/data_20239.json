    "content": "About 6 weeks after I go my new phone I suddenly could not hear calls without earphones.  People often couldn't hear me.  I cannot hear media sounds, such as music, video clips and music on apps and games.  The alarm rings.  I occasionally get a sound if the phone has been called.  I have gently cleaned the area around the speakers.  I checked if there are apps running that shouldn't be.  I have completed a factory reset.  I still get no sound.  Am I able to get a replacement or repair under warranty?  If so, how do I arrange this?",
