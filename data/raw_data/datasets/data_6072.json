    "content": "Updated software to Android 11.\nRestarted phone multiple times but Bluetooth still drops out in calls regardless of what peripheral used. Phone speaker crackles in calls to point where I can't hear the person. Google lens can't focus and flashes like there is a glitch when scanning a QR.\nDon't know what to do anymore.",
