    "content": "My touchscreen is not properly responding to my fingers after upgrading to Android 11. The response is spotty at best, often opening apps as I'm scrolling through the list or it simply stops responding to my finger's gestures.\n\nIt's pretty much unusable at the moment because I can't even navigate my phone.\n\nMy phone was perfect in Android 10. What's going on here?",
