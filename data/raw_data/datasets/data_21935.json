    "content": "Please help.\n\nWhen I connect my samsung s10e to BT devices, my voice sounds terrible and people can barely understand what I say.\nI have this issue using wireless headphones (Galaxy buds and sony wf-1000xm3), in my car when I get calls while connected to the audio system and now I have the issue that the voice is also terrible when I record videos while I'm connected to my DJI OSMO MOBILE 3 Gimbal.\n\nI have no Issues on videos w/o gimble and on regular calls.\n\nIts really frustrating. Please advice.\n\nThank you!",
