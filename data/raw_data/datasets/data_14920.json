    "title": "Android 11 Update: is there any way to go back to the old notification sorting method?",
    "content": "In Android 11, notifications are sorted by \"Conversations\", \"Notifications\", and \"Silent Notifications\". But the method for deciding whether a notification goes in Conversations or Notifications isn't clear and doesn't make sense; I have notifications for Discord, some of which are in Conversations and some of which are in Notifications despite all being conversations/messages from different channels or groups. Is there any way to get rid of the Conversations/Notifications sorting thing?",
