    "content": "I bought a Pixel 4a over from someone that is from Germany. Unfortunately Google doesn't sell them in the Netherlands. As soon as I started using the device I found out the camera did not work. I drove all the way to the shop were the device was from this was 1,5 hours from here. They decided the phone needed to go in for repair even though it was from a sealed box.\n\nI got it back after about 2 weeks, a new phone with the plastic cover on it but in the box that I turned in before. \n\nWhen I got home the troubles began, this device is constantly crashing and rebooting itself.  I tried a factory reset a couple of times, safe mode and I tried using the repair tool. It sait it needed to update the device but it gives errors as well.... I feel really bumped and afraid I ended up with a useless brick.",
