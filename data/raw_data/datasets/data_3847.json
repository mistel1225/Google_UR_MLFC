    "title": "Pixel 5 Camera app is only working on selfie mode (rear camera showing black).",
    "content": "On March 28, 2021 Camera app suddenly stopped working for rear camera, only selfie camera works but app is crashing/freezing after few seconds anyway. IÂ´ve tried:\n- uninstalling updates on Camera, Chrome and Android system WebView\n- many restart and booting into safe mode\n- restore phone\n\nNone of the above is working. Pixel 5 phone is brand new and camera was working just fine 2 days ago. This looks like software issue. Can you please look into this?",
