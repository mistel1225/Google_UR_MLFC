    "title": "Phone keeps crashing several times a day - apps/UX stops responding, even with updated/empty phone",
    "content": "I have emptied my phone regularly, I don't have an apps I don't regularly use (even so, it is a handful at best). I do not game. Primarily used for messaging, photos and WhatsApp which are emptied and backed up regularly. My phone is always updated to the newest OS. Crashed have been occuring since I received the phone, although more sporadically - but currently happens 2-3 times daily now and renders the phone unresponsive. The phone is from the end of August, so is recent.",
