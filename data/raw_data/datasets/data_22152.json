    "title": "Pixel 2: Netflix and Starz playing corrupted video and audio, possible security issue going on?",
    "content": "I noticed this on Netflix but it wasn't so bad and didn't bother me too much; the left side of the screen would pixelate every so often. Sometimes it would go away if I rewinded, but usually it stayed. On Starz, it completely flips out, glitching the entire screen with streaks of broken pixels and the audio emits this horrible static screech and the effect stays on rewind. Nothing I do to troubleshoot it in the apps works (clearing cache, uninstalling and reinstalling, changing wifi network, restarting my device). I couldn't possibly have built up a huge cache in Starz anyway because it was the second time I ever opened it after installing and the first time I ever watched something. I'm beginning to think it's an issue with my phone.\n\nI haven't tried with other streaming services like Hulu or Disney+ but I do know that YouTube is not affected by whatever is going on. It plays normally.\n\n(I'd share screenshots but the apps prevent that)\n\nEdit: I have contacted Starz. I only mentioned that it might be a security issue or a problem with the device because my dad, who's a software engineer, said it could possibly be, since it was affecting more than one app.",
