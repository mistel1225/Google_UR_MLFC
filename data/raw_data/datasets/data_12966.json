    "content": "I really don't understand why we are still stuck on the scripted: reset camera app, reset your phone into safe mode, factory reset.\n\nI balk at the factory reset step. It'll take me a whole bloody day to recover the phone for a bloody debugging step? When there's literally dozens of examples where people did all that and the problem is the hardware? The camera is clicking when it focuses. How much more do you need?\n\nThis is my 3rd android device that failed one way or another in 2 years. Enough! Apple's getting my business now.",
