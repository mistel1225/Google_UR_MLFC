    "content": "I am trying to back up my photos to the cloud. For the last 3 days it says backing up 7 items. But the spinning circle has not progressed any further than a quarter. When I go to my google cloud account it looks like all my photos are already there. So I don't know what it is trying to upload. I have tried closing the photos app and relaunching. The spinning circle jumps straight up to a quarter and then hangs there. I have tried restarting the phone same thing happens. I have also turned off sync and then exited and relaunched the app. Same thing. I have even tried changing networks to get faster internet seems to make no difference.",
