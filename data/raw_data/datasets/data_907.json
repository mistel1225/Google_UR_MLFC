    "title": "Why can't we update both our Fi Pixel 3 XL phones to June 2021?",
    "content": "Since updates were released two days ago (e.g., as posted on several sites), we keep seeing \"Your system is up to date\" as of May 5, 2021?  We bought Fi Pixel 3 XL phones with the understanding that we would be getting updates ASAP, at least through October 2021?  We have always checked the Play store for updates daily, and they are working fine otherwise.",
