    "title": "Pixel 4a - Amazing Phone but Bad seller/sales platform = One Plus Nord wins the Race",
    "content": "Google might have struck a perfect balance between a mobile with good specs & performance and a good price range for India after a long time but the its decision to sell it through Flipkart has ruined all that.\n\nHeard a story of Hare and Tortoise story, this is it. The performance of Pixel 4a had many people loving the get their hands on the mobile, even when One plus Nord was lesser priced but the \"NOT DELIVERED\" \"COMING SOON\" page of flipkart has made people lose patience and go for One Plus Nord. Three of us were planning to buy the mobile as soon as it was launched and now 2 of my friends had already changed their mind, am left alone (am still waiting) to look like a fool now. Slowly am also losing my patience for mobile.\n\nNot sure if Google will see this, but they see, kindly take a note.",
