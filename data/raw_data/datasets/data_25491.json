    "content": "The rest of the phone seems to work fine, and I have no trouble receiving text messages. It even looks like the ones I'm sending are getting sent you, but they are either stuck on \"SENDING\" or it says \"NOT SENT. Tap to Try again\". \n\nAgain the messages ARE being sent, it's just a weird error. Tried restarting device, updating Messages. no luck. I don't want to clear the CACHE because I'm worried about losing all my messages",
