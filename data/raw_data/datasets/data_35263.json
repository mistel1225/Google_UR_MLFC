    "title": "Pixel 2 XL can’t get past lock screen, keeps rebooting - how to fix?",
    "content": "My phone has never had any issues - until today. Tonight I opened an app on my phone that crashed. I got the usual “___ app isn’t responding. Close?” Which I chose to close. Suddenly my phone froze, then rebooted on its own. I haven’t been able to pass the lock screen since. \n\nHere’s a video of the phone being stuck: https://imgur.com/a/zF0kiiW.\n\nIf I punch in my PIN before it recognizes my SIM card, I get the “Pixel is starting...” message with the loading bar. But after a second or two I get rebooted back to the lock screen. \n\nI tried booting the phone to Safe Mode but the same issue happens again, so I’m starting to worry this has something to do with the operating system. \n\nHas anyone experienced this? Can anyone please offer some help? \n\nA bit of background: This is a replacement phone sent from Verizon (first phone had microphone issues); I never had an issue with the phone freezing on me until last night (froze for 5 minutes). Today phone worked fine until present issue happened. Phone is unusable - phone calls can reach me, but I can’t see my contact names (only the phone number).",
