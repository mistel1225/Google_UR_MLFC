    "content": "Hello.\nWhen setting up multiple languages for Assistant I've noticed  below notification:\n\"latest variant of Assistant isn't available on this device in the languages you've selected\"\n\nwhich is I believe confusing since both Swedish and English are supported. \nI can use \"Ok Google\" and speaking to my Pixel in both languages works but why this notification? See also screenshot attached.\n\nDo I need to do anything to get the \"latest\" version for Google Assistant? I thought Google Assistant is part of Android system (I run Android 10) not an app and anyway all updates are done.\n\nBR\nAdrian",
