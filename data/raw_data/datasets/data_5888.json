    "content": "Hi Google / Community mods,\n\nCan you confirm when 5G will be enabled on Pixel 5 for carrier \"Free Mobile\" in France?\n\n5G works just fine if I root my device and modify the carrier policy in EFI but I don't want to use my device rooted on a daily basis.\n\nSo please let us know when Google will update Pixel 5 to enable 5G for \"Free Mobile\" ?\n\nMany thanks,\nMat",
