    "content": "I have been on two delta flights with my new pixel 4 and both times, I have clicked on the wifi to connect and it says\nConnecting...\nAnd after that says\nSaved\nBut does not connect to the network. \nHow come this is happening? Other people with older pixel models were able to connect but not me. Why?",
