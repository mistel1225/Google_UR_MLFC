    "content": "I was looking for something in a dark room and used the Torch as I had done many times before and it seemed to be quite dim.\n\nMy brother has a Pixel 3 and I checked against his. His phone seems extremely bright with both the camera flash and flashlight, whereas mine seems very dim.\n\nIs this due to an update or a possible hardware issue?",
