    "title": "2 Pixel XLs broken at 2 year mark - crappy product!",
    "content": "My husband and I each bought a Pixel XL through Verizon in July 2017 - his bricked in early July 2019 and mine just failed this week (3 week July 2019). It's crazy that we paid $900+ for each of these phones and they don't last past 2 years. How's that for reliability? Definitely would not buy this product again. We are going back to Samsung, which btw our old Samsung phones are STILL working, and they are 3-5 years old. Google you have MUCH work to do! Extremely disappointed in such a terrible product.\n\nFor those that are curious - his phone restarted while he was playing a game. Once restarted he started the game again to play and was playing for 10 minutes when it bricked - completely dead.\nMine, began boot looping one morning after I woke and picked it up from all night charging. I continued to boot loop when used, but when not being used, would remain powered on. It also kept prompting for battery saver (at 77%!). At times the display would be partially scrambled.  I took it to UBREAKIFIX and they replaced the battery. Thought it was good, restarted it when I came to pick it up and it went back to boot looping. They wanted to call google engineers for advice. That's all I know at the moment. I'd be shocked if they managed to fix it. Not hopeful.",
