    "content": "Apps are not loading. Trying to open notifications either to an app or a web link, don't load either. Certain words don't open at all. Slow & lagging all the time. There's no snap to the UI anymore. Very disappointed. I'm on Android 11 stable. Didn't hang these issues before the update.",
