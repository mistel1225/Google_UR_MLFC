    "content": "My phone won't charge.   I have tried various chargers, including the original and others.  The phone suddently does not accept a charge, nor does it show any indication that it recognizes the charger when it is plugged in.\nI have tried the fixes shown online, I cleaned out the port, I plugged it into the computer, etc.  nothing seems to be working.\nCan anyone suggest what else to do?",
