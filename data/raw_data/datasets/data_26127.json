    "content": "Microphone Issue on Pixel 2 with preferred care. Called them two weeks ago, spent two hours going through diagnostics and speaking with Manager Chris. He told me that he would process request for a new phone to be sent. I asked him to stay on the line until I got the email, he said it was generated by another system. Two weeks later 7 phone calls, I was hung up on once, 15 emails, 1 chat, if I get a response I'm told escalations is on it or that Chris will call me back in 24-48 hours(from whatever time I am calling).\nGoogle is breaking the terms of the Preferred care agreement as of today.\n\nIs there a way I can get someone to help me with this, someone not on the Google Store team? This has been a frustrating process. I just want the Preferred Care I bought to be honored. \n\nDoes anyone know of a Google customer service complaint department? \n\nThank You,",
