    "content": "Hello,\n\nI'm a Pixel 3XL user! Purchased it one and half years ago IN NOVEMBER 2018 & I'm constantly facing problems. Previously, even before the device completed one year of purchase, the device showed a display pixelation issue along with a battery issue. This issue was before even one year of purchase. I sent the device to Mumbai(B2X; google authorized service). They repaired it, replaced the battery and display and sent the device back. Within another 3 days of repair, the display pixelation issue started again, not as intense as the previous issue, but slightly. I contacted the customer service people again, and I didnt get a prompt response from them. Note that this was within a few days of repair. \n\nAnd now, it has not even been one year after repair and replacement of the battery, the battery has started BULGING! Ive been facing constant problems after purchasing this phone.  I am facing the headache of always contacting the customer care and always facing some issue or the other. The device truly has some issue. The customer support is truly useless, with no proper support. How can I escalate this issue to higher authorities and how can I get this done. How can I even approach for a replacement of the device since I faced problems often. Please help.\n\nThank You\nHarris",
