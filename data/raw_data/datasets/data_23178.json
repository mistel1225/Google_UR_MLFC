    "content": "I update my  pixel 3xl to android 10 lat night and now the google search bar on the home screen seems to have the wrong font color.\n\nto replicate:\n   1. enable dark mode\n   2. navigate home\n   3. use the google search bar at the bottom of the screen\n          -  the history will be unreadable since its on black font on dark background\n          -  if you start typing you will only see what you have typed, the search prediction  will not be visible because of the same problem\n\nwould this be a pixel launcher bug or an android 10 bug or something else?\n\nFrom a developers view this seems like a quick fix, I don't know how fast these developers are, how long would they take to fix this?",
