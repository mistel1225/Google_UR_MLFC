    "content": "If the phone is in a voice call (not video call) the screen turn off (black) immediately and it is not possible to turn it on again (unlock it with the right-up lateral  physical button) during the voice call. Only after the call is finished I am able to turn on or unlock the screen. So if I need to select some options during the call (for instance: press number 1) it is impossible because the screen is locked!",
