    "content": "Hi\n\nI have recently acquired a Google Pixel 2 and so far I love it but I can't seem to get the LED blink light to work when I get notifications.  I have Blink Light on and have gone through all my apps and they all individually have blink light on but it still isn't showing.  The phone is fully up to date.\n\nAny help would be really appreciated. Thanks:)",
