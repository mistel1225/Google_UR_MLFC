    "title": "Pixel 4XL Screen randomly keeps having the edges (all 4corners) stop responding. Anyone else??",
    "content": "The screen keeps suddenly becoming unresponsive in the 4 corners while I'm using the phone no matter what I'm doing (playing a game or using an app like email or Facebook etc)... The only thing that seems to help it is by me turning auto-rotate screen on and flipping the phone around... Then it will work fine again for about 2mins, until it starts doing the same thing again! I've done all troubleshooting etc nothing is changing. I haven't dropped it, there's no marks in screen, I have a case on it, and once I restart the phone it seems to work normally again for another hour or 2 then it starts all over again. Does anyone else have any experience with this? Seems like a glitch in the phone itself seeing as it's hasn't been damaged at all.",
