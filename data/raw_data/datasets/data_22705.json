    "content": "So I am a Sprint user and I just landed in Argentina. According to Sprint my phone would work seemlessly down here... As in I would turn it on as soon as I got off the plane and it would connect, however that has not happened. I've tried to select one of the networks they have partnered with but my phone says it can't connect to it. I've tried to connect to Claro Argentina as that is the only one I've seen so far. The other two I can connect to are Telefonica Argentina and Telecom Personal. I've tried turning my phone on and off, selecting the network, letting the phone automatically select the network, I don't know what to do and it would be a bummer if I couldn't use my phone down here. Any help is appreciated! I'm running Android 10 if that helps.",
