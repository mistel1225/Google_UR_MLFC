    "content": "Last night my phone began crashing suddenly. The screen would turn white and I'd have to perform a soft reset (holding the power for a few seconds). This happened a few times and now my phone won't turn on at all. I charged it overnight and tried again with no luck this morning. I've been reading other troubleshooting tutorials and have tried multiple ways to restart the device, but it's responded to none of them.",
