    "content": "The problem is this: during use, the phone suddenly braked and turned off. Then he constantly tried to turn on, but things didnâ€™t go further than the Google inscription. The Android system menu is opened, but I do not understand it. Now I turned off the phone, because it constantly turns on and off by itself.\nWhat could be the problem? Thanks in advance.",
