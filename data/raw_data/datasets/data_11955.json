    "content": "I have two Pixel 5 and the battery percentage is not a reliable indicator, sometimes it's stuck at certain percentage but after a reset it shows it's actually much lower. It also works the other way round it shows lower percentage but after some time or reset it turns out it's much higher. It's been affecting both phones. Quick glance at the forum and it looks like people have issues with older pixels as well. I upgraded from Pixel 1 which had 0 issues whatsoever.\n\nGoogle please take a notice of this and fix it not a good start for a flagship device.",
