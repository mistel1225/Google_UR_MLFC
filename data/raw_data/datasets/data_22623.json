    "content": "When I plug my 3 XL in to charge, it doesn't do anything. I have to restart my phone with it plugged in for it to start charging. \nI've tried 2 different charges (both Google) & a separate cable I have at work. My wife's 3 XL charges fine.\nIt's also started draining battery, losing over 30% overnight.\nAny ideas? I'm tempted to restore to factory settings but want to ensure all my contacts will come back",
