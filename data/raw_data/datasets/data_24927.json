    "content": "It is a real pity that despite being a highly developed country with strong alliances with North America, (and hence the Google LLC Headquarters), that Australia does not yet have a Google Pixel Trade-In Program! \n\nI have the original Google Pixel XL that I would dearly love to trade in for the newest Google Pixel 3a XL. I am most comfortable buying this product direct from the Google Store, as I know I can 100% rely on them for great customer support and warranty/maintenance support, without having to go through a 3rd Party Supplier. \n\nI feel that the Google Pixel Trade-In Program could be implemented fairly easily here in Australia, at the very least within the major cities. I'm certain that this will also increase Google's customer base in Australia exponentially, and truly help foster more positive relations between Google and it's customers on the whole. \n\nIn a world as intensely globalised as we are, and continue to further become, Google LLC should really solidify its position as a multinational corporation here. I believe they can properly instil themselves as a 100% business competitor and 1st Party Service Provider by adopting the Trade-In Program here in Australia.",
