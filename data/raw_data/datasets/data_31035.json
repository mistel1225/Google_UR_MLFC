    "content": "I can't close my tabs or return to my previous activity on my cell since my black bar at the bottom (which is use to go back or close tab) isn't responsive. I have to restart my cellphone each time I want to change app or even to quit the app which is very annoying. Anyone can help please? I did reboot it and the problem is still there.",
