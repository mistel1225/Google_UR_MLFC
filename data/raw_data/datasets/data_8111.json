    "content": "Almost a year ago the screen of my Google Pixel 2XL shattered to pieces after having been chewed on by my dog for the night. Some important data was still on there. I have ordered and installed a new screen now and decided to also replace the usb-c port which did not work with the dongle anymore. Unfortunately I not forgot the PIN code I used back then. Entering the password 5 times does not let me enter my google account. When I try to enter into recovery mode, it boots up into safe mode or enters a bootloop. Any idea how to solve this issue? Could I send it somewhere to have someone take a look at it? I would really like to have the data back or if anything be able to use the phone again.",
