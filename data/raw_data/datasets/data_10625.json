    "content": "Just updated my pixel 4a to the most recent Android 11 update, and now when I use bluetooth in my car, the bluetooth display that usually shows the artist and song only says No artist, when it was working just fine before the update. I have a Hyundai Elantra 2013, and I made sure all the proper settings were set in the car; this was literally working yesterday before the update, and now nothing is being displayed; Spotify, Youtube, any audio that would normally always show does not show on the display screen.",
