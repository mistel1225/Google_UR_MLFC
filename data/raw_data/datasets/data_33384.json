    "content": "Yesterday I run battery historian , took a bugreport and saw that WiFi was in state completed instead of disconnected. Is that normal ? \nObviously I wasn't connected to WiFi nor did I have anything related to WiFi running. \n\nAnyway I can fix by my self, already tried factory reset.\n\nThanks",
