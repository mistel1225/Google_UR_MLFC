    "content": "Device is approximately ~20% slower than pixel 5 on average antutu scores. Supposedly they are almost identical, almost. I can actually confirm older phones with SD 835 are smoother for gaming. Finally when i surpass the 500 applications threshold, google play store freezes for 2-3 seconds and asks me if i want to close it or wait to respond when loading beta tab or scanning with play protect. Phone seriously needs some love and many optimizations. It is confirmed by various reviews and i am an IT specialist. Thanks for reading my issues, a big fix would be much appreciated. I love this phone and i would like a pixel 6. :)",
