    "title": "Where is flash notification on Pixel4a Android 11? Deaf person using Live Captions need visual aid",
    "content": "Have searched google for help and gone through all settings on the phone and searched settings for flash notification. We purchased the phone for a deaf person due to the wonderful live captions on a phone call. Since she cannot hear it ring, she needs to see it flash. This is easy to set up on my Galaxy 8+ Android 9 but seems to be missing in action on the Pixel. Not a good time to lose this important feature when deaf people are finally being taken care of with the Live Captions",
