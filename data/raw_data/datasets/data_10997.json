    "content": "I've just upgraded from the Pixel 3 XL to Pixel 5 and realised the in-app or system sounds on the Pixel 5 are just way too loud.\n\nThese sounds include dial tones (see this video which compares P3XL - left with P5 - right), screenshot, Facebook like button, WhatsApp voice chats, etc.\n\nAdjusting any of the volume settings do not solve this issue. Also, I'm on the 5 Nov 2020 update.\n\nIs there anything I can do to solve this? Thanks!",
