    "title": "Google Pixel 2 phone screen black (hardware issue), how to download Smart Switch?",
    "content": "I dropped a heavy object on the phone screen and now the screen is black, which is fine since I've got a replacement phone. The easiest way to transfer information from one phone to the other is to use an interconnected USB-C cable and the Smart Switch app as the new phone instructs. However, I'm running my phone completely blind and don't know what to input to both access the Play Store and download Smart Switch. I can estimate where to press on the screen to type things correctly if I have an image reference to go off, but I don't think I could find any up-to-date examples. Is it possible to have a bunch of reference screenshots or what commands I could tell the Google Assistant to download Smart Switch?",
