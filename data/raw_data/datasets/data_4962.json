    "content": "I keep getting an overwhelming notification to update the operating system on my google pixel XL android.\nThis update will take well over a GB of data and likely drain the battery and will just have different problems then the old problems. I WANT TO DELETE THIS CONSTANT ANNOYING REQUEST FOR ME TO UPDATE THE SYSTEM. IT SEEMS TO BE ROOTED RIGHT IN THE PROCESSOR. \nCAN ANYONE HELP ME TO GET RID OF THIS ONGOING NOTIFICATION THAT HAPPENS TO BLOCK MY HOME SCREEN.\nI AM NEVER GOING TO UPDATE THIS PIXEL. I WILL BY SOMETHING ELSE FIRST.",
