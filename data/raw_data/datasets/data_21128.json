The microphone works for assistant and other tasks no problem, support has not been much help but what I have done is below.\n\nClearing phone app cache\nUninstalling phone app updates\nTurning off Bluetooth\nMaking a call with Bluetooth\nRunning in safe mode\nCalling on and off WiFi\nFactory resetting my phone.\n\nThe interesting thing is this started last week when the new patch dropped, and when I factory reset my phone, before updating to the new patch it worked perfectly.
