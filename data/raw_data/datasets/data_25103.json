    "content": "How do I turn on notifications that my Pixel phone is ready to be updated.  My understanding is that the OTA update will happen automatically.  However, the update is incomplete until the phone is restarted.  I don't seem to be notified that  the phone needs to be restarted.  This was happening on my Pixel 2 and is continuing to happen on my Pixel 4.  Is it expected that I should be restarting my phone on a periodic basis?  Do I have to keep checking the System Update in settings to determine if my phone needs to be restarted?",
