    "content": "Hi,\n\nI tried to scan a QR code in many ways and it's never working. I'm reading QR code from my laptop and twitched the luminosity without result. \nI have a Pixel 4a, Android 11 and all last software updates possible.\nI try to scan a QR code from Google Lens: nothing !  If I choose the search option it recognise the image it's a QR code and shows me other QR code ! Also Lens recognise text above and below the QR code and highlight it.\nI also dl a QR code scanner app and nothing too. \nI tried to scan the QR code from Whatsapp web, or other web site and nothing. \nI don't know it it's worked before with my Pixel 4a, but it has with my Pixel 3a. Don't remember if it was from a QR code scanner app, from camera or Lens, but I could like whatsapp or messages or use the QR code ro open a web page. It was fine; \n\nAny clue or tips to fix that ?\n\nThanks for your help",
