    "content": "I have seen similar issues in the community but nothing exactly like this.  My ring and notification sounds are only playing through my ear speaker and not through the speaker phone speaker.  So while I can hear the sounds, they are very low and the phone has to be in my hand or very close to me for me to hear them.  While listening to music, podcasts, YouTube, etc... the sound is perfectly fine and comes in loud and clear through the external speakers, but my ringer and all notification sounds only play on the internal ear speaker.\n\n1.  Yes I have made sure my volume bar is turned up all the way.\n2.  Yes I have connected a Bluetooth headset and all sounds work just fine.\n3.  Yes I have made sure nothing is connected to Bluetooth, and have also turned off Bluetooth completely.\n4.  Yes I have plugged in regular headphones and determined all sounds also work fine, but when I disconnect the headphones the issue persists.\n5.  Yes, I have restarted 3 times while troubleshooting.\n6.  No I haven't performed a factory reset.  I am trying to avoid this until it is the last resort.",
