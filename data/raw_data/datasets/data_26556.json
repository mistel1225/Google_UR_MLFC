    "content": "I've just received a dead Pixel 4. It's brand new but out of the box it won't power on and won't charge. I've already tried all the troubleshooting steps from the Pixel Phone support pages.\nBut I do remember the box feeling a bit warm when I opened it. Not a lot, just a bit, which I initially thought was due to the heat from the vehicle it was transported in. Now I'm suspecting the unit may have accidentally turned on while in transit. Is that possible? Can a phone be unrecoverable/damaged if that happens?\nThe box appears to have no damage, and only a small/minor dent visible in one corner. The box seals were intact before I opened it. There is no visible damage on the ph5. one itself.\nI've already tried:\n1. Testing the charger and cable on other phones\n2. Charging for at least 30 mins\n3. Connecting to a laptop 30mins, unplug-plugin to phone, charge 1hr\n4. Holding power button with volume down button\n5. When I plug it in to my power bank, the power bank's LED's would light up briefly then turn off.",
