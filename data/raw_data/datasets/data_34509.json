    "content": "I have read through the advice columns and have had no luck resolving the problem. My Pixel (purchased Sept 2016) does not stay on and consistently crashes. I thought it was a battery issue but even plugged in the phone will not turn on. Thanks to another column, I held the start button for 30 seconds and the phone turns on. Shortly after, the phone crashes and turns off again. I have 18% free space on my phone and have the latest version of Android 9.",
