    "content": "Hey all, my pixel 4xl takes great photos but when I send them in messages they turn grainy and crap quality? Now you could blame using the MMS network saying that it can't transmit high quality photos but my friends and family that have iPhones can send me a photo without the quality going to crap?\n\nHopefully someone has a solution!\n\nTodd",
