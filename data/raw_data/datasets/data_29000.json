    "content": "I simply cannot keep my new Pixel 3 unlocked. It is set up with \"Smart Lock\" to be open : \"on body\",  \"trusted place\" , and I tried \"trusted device\" but gave up on that option. No matter - I use the phone - set it down for maybe 10 seconds and I need to swipe my fingerprint to start using again - no matter where I am - even in my trusted place, on my body, near my device - one or all!\n\nMaddening - especially as this is a brand new device.\n\nYes, I have reported to Google but doesn't change the frustration with this phone. Am I missing a not so obvious correction? Thank you.",
