    "content": "Ever since upgrading to Android 11, my Pixel 3 XL bluetooth distance has been much much worse. I use Airpods Pros (which worked AWESOME on Android 10) with my phone, and I used to be able to walk 10-20 feet away from my phone with no issues. Now I have to be within like 3 feet of my phone, and even then ANY sort of physical interference (body, wall, whatever.) causes it to break up.\n\nI've already tried a factory reset, and I've booted into safe mode, and talked through this all with google support to no avail...\n\nAnyone else experiencing this?",
