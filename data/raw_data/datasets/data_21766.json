    "title": "Pixel 4 XL not charging, only works/turns on when plugged in, and battery constantly stays at 58%",
    "content": "About a week ago the phone turned off randomly and when powered back on it said it was at 50% despite turning off around 35%. Then it was fine for a while. Then when I restarted my phone to finish an update yesterday (April 16th), again displayed it at 50% despite me having just taken it off the charger at 100%. Now since last night my phone has been saying it has a 58% charge, not only that the thing lasts about 30 seconds after taking it off the charger. I can only use the phone while it's plugged in. I got the Google pixel 4 XL for Christmas just 4-5 months ago.\n\nToday I tried factory resetting, deleting new/un-used apps, changing a few settings to help battery life. Nothing worked so far. Any tips?\n\nEDIT: and on top of all that I've noticed my phone has been super choppy and slow when scrolling through messages, Snapchat, and other apps/pages where you can scroll up and down",
