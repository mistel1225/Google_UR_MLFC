    "title": "Unable to power on mobile when not connected to charger",
    "content": "My mobile(pixel 1st gen) got switched-off suddenly. I had to put my mobile on charge for sometime and with charger connected I am able to use mobile with no issues and battery percentage will be more than 80%. But once I disconnect from charger it is getting switched off within 10 seconds. I have sent it to pixel support center and I was told that there is motherboard issue and also stated that battery to be replaced as draining fast. Is it really motherboard issue as I am able to use it when connected to charger?\nTried by replacing my battery with some third party one whose model is same as that of supported one but when inserted and powered-on it is getting stuck in a loop of turning on. Will my problem gets resolved by just replacing proper battery?",
