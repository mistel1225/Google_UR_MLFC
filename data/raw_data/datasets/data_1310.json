    "content": "Hi. My play store system update is stuck on the January patch on my Pixel 4 XL. \n\nI was on android 12 beta 1 and and then i reverted back to android 11 and now can't update to the latest security patch in the Google play system update. \n\nIt's stuck on January patch. I've hit the check for update a couple of times and nothing happens. Just tells me my device is up to date?\n\nAny fix for this?\n\nThanks",
