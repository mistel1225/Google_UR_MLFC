    "content": "I recently reset my Google pixel 2 xl. On this device I took lots of photos that were stored fully on Google photos and did not count against storage limit as part of pixel 2 promotions. After resetting the device, the pics taken before the reset now are counting against storage, putting me 32gb in the negative and no longer allowing me to upload to my gdrive.",
