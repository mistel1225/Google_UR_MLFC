    "content": "While playing games, usually i play PUBG and 8 ball pool. When I am try to rotate my screen from one position to other then most of the time it doesn't rotate while I am in the game.\nOther issue is that while I am playing game, in landscape mode there are some part in the bottom of the screen where touch doesn't work. But that thing won't happen if I'm using my phone normally means not playing games.\n\nPlease suggest solution for this.\n\nThanks",
