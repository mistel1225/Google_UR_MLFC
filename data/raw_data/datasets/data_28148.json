    "content": "My wife's Pixel XL microphone for speaking into the phone without speaker does not work anymore. It started sporadically 4 months ago and I thought it was just a glitch, but now it just does not work at all and she has to use the speaker option all the time. Has a for sure fix been made? I have factory reset it, switched wi-fi off and entered safe-mode to no avail. This really stinks since the phone has been pretty great up til now. Please help.",
