    "content": "So, I noticed that my pixel 3XL became thicker and realized the battery swollen.  I contacted google customer service representative (Salman) who didn't willing to offer help but asking me to pay the repair cost because of the out-of-warranty status. Defects like Battery swollen are very dangerous and should be handled immediately by professionals.   Salman not only didn't offer any help but claiming that this did not manufacture defect.  Then, it's so weird that Google pixel can only be used for a little more than 1 year before its battery failure and any potential risk occurs. \n\nI would expect Google to give some explanations and offer any available help for this awkward situation",
