    "content": "My Google Pixel 3 will not charge. The charger that came with it won't charge and my wireless charger won't charge. I've had problems like this in the past, but I was able to rely on my wireless charger for the time being. I fixed it then by cleaning the port. Now I am experiencing a similar issue, but my phone will not charge at all. Sometimes I can get it to charge for a few minutes, but besides that, I can't do anything.",
