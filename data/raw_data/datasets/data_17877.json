    "title": "Touch Screen not working consistently",
    "content": "My touch capabilities are inconsistent, mostly nonexistent. The phone will work normally and then the touch wont register or return for a random amount of time After a three day diagnostic from the certified Google Repair \"UBreakIFix\", they attempted water damage treatment and replaced the screen but did not solve the issue and \"don't know what is wrong\". No water damage was found and the phone never got wet (also kept in an OtterBox). Any solutions? I am hoping Google honors this lack of competency by the certified repair and in the product and will either repair or replace, as I am a student incapable of replacing myself. The phone is less than a year old.\n\nI also attempted a factory reset, safe mode, and other forms of software debugging.",
