    "content": "The Pixel's headphone jack does not output audio, and the headphones cannot be used.\n\nAfter my Pixel updated Android 9, there were some problems, including the sometimes unusable headphones.\n\nI need to restart the phone to temporarily solve this problem, but the same problem will occur soon.\n\nSometimes when I use headphones to listen to music, there is suddenly no sound, but the screen shows that the music is still playing. When I pull the headphones out, the speakers don't work anymore.\n\nSometimes when I want to use the headset, after inserting the headset into the earphone hole, the phone does not recognize the headset and still uses the speaker to play the sound.\n\nAll of the above problems can be solved temporarily by restarting, but problems will occur soon.\n\nI went to some forums to search for this problem and found that it wasn't just that I had this problem alone, basically it happened after the system was updated.\n\nEnglish is not my native language. The above content is translated by Google. It may be embarrassing.ðŸ˜‚",
