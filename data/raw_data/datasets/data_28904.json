    "content": "Is it recommended to use HDR+ enhanced with moving objects like birds and planes, or is HDR+ Auto better? One of my friends told me not to use HDR+ enhanced when taking pictures of things like birds, but the phone can automatically adjust the shutter speed. Also, When taking pictures of birds, how many frames does the camera use in HDR+ and HDR+ enhanced?",
