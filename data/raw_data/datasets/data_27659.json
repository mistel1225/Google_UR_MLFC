    "content": "Google providing the worst service ever...\nwhy ?\n\nMy phone not charging properly anymore... when I plug the usb charger the phone reboot.. or sometimes become super hot and the phone shutdown.. or no any reaction.\nok.. we tried everything .. factory reset.. other charger .. bla bla\nAnd I know this problem is very common on pixel phones.. (I saw it on a lot of posts..)\n\n1 Month ago I contacted Google for a replacement.. UNTIL NOW they sent me maybe 50 emails.. just to say.. our engineers work on the problem.. bla bla bla.. like a automatic messages.\n\nI will never but never buy a google phone again.. use google to search somethings on the web.. but don't purchase their products because THEY DON'T PROVIDE any warranty !!!\n\nit's just disgusting...\nThere's no any excuse .. is not acceptable\nYou can't hold your client more then 1 month just for nothing..\n\nIf you are not able to keep your client happy... please stop to selling smart phones.. continue with your search engine and thats all.. \n\nYou can search on \"Google !\" = why google service is worst !! and you will find a lot of nice experiences...\nI'm not the only one..",
