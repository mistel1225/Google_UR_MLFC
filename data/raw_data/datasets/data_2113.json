    "title": "Bluetooth issue after April OS 11 update",
    "content": "After the April OS 11 update my Bluetooth is not working as it should.  What I mean by this is my devices are connecting and are showing in the connected devices under the system settings.  However I cannot use them to make or receive calls.  For instance my pixel buds are connected, I dial a number I can hear the numbers being pushed through the buds.  When I go to make the call, the call is through my Pixel 5 not the ear buds.  Now when I do have the option to play on headset, speaker, or buds.  The headset and speaker work just fine.  When I select the buds, nothing...  Same thing is happening with my head unit in my car for hands free calling.  I was really hoping the May update would fix this, but it has not.\n\nI have tried clearing the cache for my Bluetooth devices, that seemed to work the first time that I did it but has not sense.  I have also tried to reset my Wi-Fi, mobile & Bluetooth.  That worked at first but now I am right back to square one.\n\nPLEASE DO NOT CLOSE THIS AND MERGE WITH AN ISSUE THAT IS 4 YEARS OLD AND ALREADY SOLVED!!  THIS IS MY SECOND POST ABOUT THIS.\n\nThanks in advance.",
