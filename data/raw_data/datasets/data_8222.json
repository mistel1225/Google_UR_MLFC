    "title": "Is the Pixel 4a QI wireless charging enabled?",
    "content": "I had the pixel 3xl which was capable of wireless charging and I have upgraded to the pixel 4a but it wouldn't charge on my 3rd party charger wirelessly. I purchased the Google charging stand but it doesn't work on this either.\nI have checked and the stand details state it charges pixel 3,4&5. Also I was told when I upgraded it was capable of wireless charging.\nI have tried it upright and on its side, with case on and case off, tried 4 different sockets to make sure it wasn't a dead socket fault. Also tried 2 different cables (the one that came with the stand and the one that came with the phone).\nDon't get me wrong I can charge via wire but I like the ease of just plonking my phone on the stand when I go to bed.\n\nThanks",
