    "content": "My mom is a low-vision (legally blind) senior. I would like to set up something like Big Launcher or similar type of app that changes the default android launcher. However, I also want this to be compatible with Google Assistant, as that will be the primary way she interacts with the phone. Are any of these type apps compatible with Google Assistant? Any advice is appreciated.",
