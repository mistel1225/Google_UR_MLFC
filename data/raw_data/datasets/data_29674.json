    "title": "Clock, Pixel 2 Verizon- YouTube Music Volume No Longer Tied to Alarm Volume",
    "content": "The volume stopped working correctly for alarms in the Clock App (version 6.1.1). When I'm choosing a song, the song volume is tied to the alarm volume. When the alarm goes off,  it uses the system volume for the music alarm. I do not think it was doing this when the updated Clock that supported YT Music was released. I usually keep the system sound volume very low to silent, so I missed some alarms before I realized it. The vibration usually wakes me up, I chose songs with gently increasing volume, & hit snooze or turn the alarm off pretty quick. My phone is a Pixel 2 on Verizon. I think it started right before the last system update.",
