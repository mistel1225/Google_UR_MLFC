    "title": "My screen has just become less responsive",
    "content": "Until yesterday, my screen would respond to the lightest of touches, now some buttons, even swiping this text message here, seems to stop resounding to contact unless a certain amount of force is used.\n\nSome buttons seem to not work until enough pressure has been pressed.\n\nThis happens during games and general operation. Even swiping notifications from the home screen needs a lot of pressure now it else nothing happens.\n\nNo screen protector is in use and I don't have a case. Was working fantastic literally until yesterday. \n\nI added a PWA to my home screen via Google Chrome, Add to desktop link and then it started at around that time.\n\nI've since removed the link, followed the pixel screen help sections (rebooted into safe mode, checked operations, it continues there as well), etc.\n\nI loved how light I could be with the screen but now it's frustratingly hard to operate even the basics.\n\nAny help would be appreciated.",
