    "content": "Since I updated my Pixel 2 to android 10 the battery is draining fast and the full charge last around half the time before the update.\nBefore in a normal day it lasted around 20 hours now hardly reaches 10 hours.\nI tried the troubleshooting steps but it didn't help and the issue appeared exactly after the update.\nI can also see many other users reporting the same issue on the support community and on reddit.\n\nHas anyone reached a solution for this? \n\nThanks",
