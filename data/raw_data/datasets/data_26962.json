    "content": "I have two major problems with this new phone.\n\nFirst, I can't receive some messages, like confirmation messages from banks or government etc. Some personal numbers maybe work(but I got way less messages than used to be). I downloaded a third party message app, funny when I set it to default sms app, it pops out some new messages. No more new ones for couple of hours  then I need to set the original app to be default, it pops some more. It is really annoying keep doing this. \n\nSecond, it sometimes radomly shut down by itself, usual condition is when not in use + not charging. It happens maybe 1 or 2 hours, it likely shuts down by itself.",
