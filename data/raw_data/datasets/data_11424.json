    "content": "Howdy! I just got a Pixel 4a (5G) with 128GB and would like to save my google photos library locally on my pixel instead of just in the cloud. I have about 10,000 pictures saved in the cloud on Google Photos that I would like to download to my Pixel (I like to look at my pictures when I don't have service). Is there a reverse option for \"free up storage\"?",
