    "content": "I have followed the instructions on the other thread boards, and saved my mp3 sound that I plan to use as a ringtone, in the ringtone folder in my files app. I copied it from the download section in the files app and moved it to internal storage, ringtones folder per the instructions I found. At this point in the instructions (now that my mp3 is showing in the ringtones folder under internal storage) I go to my settings, sound, phone ringtone, and then open \"my sounds\". From all the instructions I found, at this point my mp3 sound file should show but it still shows nothing.",
