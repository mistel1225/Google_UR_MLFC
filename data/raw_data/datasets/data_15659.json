    "content": "I've tried rebooting, looking for further updates, and updating my apps.  I can leave the phone on a table or whatever for any length of time, but a quick trip from my car inside my home while in my pocket somehow turns it off.  This hasn't been an issue before yesterday, and I upgraded to Android 11 just prior to that.",
