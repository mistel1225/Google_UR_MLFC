    "content": "I just got my Pixel 5 and the reception with it is terrible. I had a Pixel 3 - still do, haven't received the trade-in kit yet - and I never had an issue. Now, I barely get signal anywhere. I never am able to send or receive texts in my apartment. When I'm driving around or am out, I never get data good enough to stream Spotify. Again, never had that issue with my 3. I live in San Jose, so cell reception is not an issue anywhere here. I don't really want to go back to my 3, but this phone is useless as of now and a rip-off.",
