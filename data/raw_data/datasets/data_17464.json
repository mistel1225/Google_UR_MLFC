    "content": "When I get a text (or go to create one), it takes a looooong time to load the screen so I can read or type (20 seconds!). I've cleared the cache. I thought it was a problem with my old Pixel 2a, but I just got the Pixel 4 two days ago and the problem is happening on the new phone as well. I think it must be a Messages app problem. Any assistance is appreciated.",
