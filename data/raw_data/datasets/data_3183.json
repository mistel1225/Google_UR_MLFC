    "content": "Does anyone know if the Google Pixel 4a5g is supported by tracfone? I know the 4a is. I don't much care if the5g ever works right now - I like the better camera,  better battery and more powerful processor in the 4a5g vs the 4a.\nI am in a Verizon wireless network area - very rural mountain area too. But Verizon charges $70/mo plus fees and taxes, while tracfone costs me 14.78/mo. I obviously don't want to switch carriers.",
