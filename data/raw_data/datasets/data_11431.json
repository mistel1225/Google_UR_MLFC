    "content": "My husband and I just both got new Pixel 4 A's. We were liking the phones a lot, but my husband had a klutzy moment and dropped his. The screen cracked, which is a bummer, but we have our phone insured with asurion. I called to find out if I could get the screen repaired and they said that it should cost $29 to get repaired. However, for some reason they could only replace it, in our area, and it was going to cost us $99 instead. since we don't have a lot of extra money right now, I ended up calling around to the places that asurion uses for the repairs to find out what was going on. They said that Google hasn't released the repair screens for the Google Pixel 4A yet, so they were unable to get the screens to fix our phone. however, I'm seeing online, different posts and videos about how to replace screens on a Pixel 4A. Which is correct? Has Google not released the repair screens yet, or are they out there, and just more difficult to find? \n\nAlso, my husband had a pretty decent case on his phone that should have protected it and it fell a very short distance and broke. does the pixel have the standard kind of gorilla glass, that a lot of smartphones have now?",
