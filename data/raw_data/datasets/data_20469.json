    "title": "My Pixel 2 dying quickly, battery usage lists apps etc for 50% of drain, the rest is unaccounted for",
    "content": "Pixel 2 is dying really quickly, the phone says all apps are working fine and doesn't detect anything when I scan for battery issues, and I've changed any setting I can find for battery optimization.\n\nStrangely,  the full phone battery usage doesn't show the same percent as is actually gone. Its consistently showing only 15% battery left (or whatever amount its on) with apps/screen/ device using significantly less than 85% and a big chunk gone with no explanation. Why would that be?? And can I fix it?\nAlso the predicted remaining time is never correct, it died immediately after taking these pictures, wasn't even sure that they saved.",
