    "content": "All settings and permissions are turned on. I can still use my voice, but I have to physically bring Google assistant instead of just saying \"hey google\". It's incredibly frustrating because it was working just fine minutes ago. I've restarted, updated all apps, and turned all the setting off and on again. Please help.",
