    "content": "I accidentally jump in a lake with my pixel 3a xl in my pocket, I put it in rice for well over two months and it's not working, I tried charging it and it's still not working. So I end up getting my Aunt's pixel a week later. And a couple days ago, the battery decided to completely die on me to the point where it won't charge and I don't have the tools to take the battery out of both of them. So can somebody please help me because I don't know what I'm espouse to do. And I'm about to buy a new phone and I don't feel like spending my money right now.",
