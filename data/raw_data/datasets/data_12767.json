    "title": "Pixel 3: when using Microsoft Teams for calls my voice is robotic during the start of the call",
    "content": "The issue does not occur during phone calls - only with microsoft teams calls.\nThis occurs both with and without a cord headset.\nTurning off wifi seems to reduce the problem.\n\nI have restarted the phone, reinstalled teams and updated the phone, but the issue with poor audio quality the first 10-20 seconds of Teams meetings remains. My voice breaks up and becomes robotic. I can hear my meeting participants fine.",
