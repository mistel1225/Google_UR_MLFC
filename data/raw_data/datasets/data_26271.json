    "content": "I currently own a first generation pixel phone. Recently it's battery has started having issues draining quickly and dying prematurely. I've been looking into buying a pixel 3 with the current Black Friday deals but I've seen news articles saying that pixel 3's have had similar battery issues after only a year. I'd like to know if it's worth it to buy a pixel 3? How widespread are these issues? Can it be fixed with software updates? Has this just been happening with the 3 or with the 3xl as well?",
