    "title": "Top speaker occasionally not working for some media audio?",
    "content": "Sometimes when I try to watch videos on some media platforms (Instagram, Facebook, snapchat) or play games, the audio will only play out of the bottom speaker. In order to correct it, I can just play something from Spotify or YouTube, and it will play audio from the top speaker again. I have no idea what is causing this, it seems very random.",
