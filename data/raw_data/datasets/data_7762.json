    "content": "After the new December pixel feature drop, I turned on adaptive charging to have the phone charge gradually overnight until the alarm I set in the Google clock app goes off. For instance I put my phone on charge last night and this morning my alarm was set for 10am. However I woke up at about 6:30am to see that the phone was already at 100%. I'm not sure if I'm doing something wrong to get the feature to work",
