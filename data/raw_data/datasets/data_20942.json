    "content": "When I connect the device to the PC, only charging is in progress. There is no notification of switching the method of exchanging data with a PC. From the PC itself, no reaction. I tried to switch in the development options, it does not help. There is no point in cleaning the connector because the phone is new. Also when I connect a 3.5mm adapter,\nthen just at that moment a notification about switching pops up, and accordingly the adapter does not work. When will they fix it?",
