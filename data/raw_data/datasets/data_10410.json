    "title": "Pixel 3 screen freezes and then doesn't load. Issue occurs in safe mode",
    "content": "My pixel 3 is freezing and very slow to respond to touch some times. Then it freezes and when I lock the phone and unlock it the screen is blank. The lock screen is visible with the time and battery percentage. Touch still works and I'm able to restart the phone. The problem persists in safe mode\n\nI have a screen crack in the top left near the sensors. Putting the phone with silica gel in a container solves the issue temporarily.\nI think it is due to moisture as there is a lot of humidity in my location recently due to rains.\nI'm not completely sure of this and feel it might be a software issue also. But I have started the phone in safe mode and the problem persists and I've done a factory reset also and that is not helping.\nNot sure if this is a motherboard issue also.\nIf anyone faces a similar issue or if you could help in any way, I'd really appreciate it. Thank you.",
