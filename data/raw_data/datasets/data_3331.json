    "title": "Why does Google not care about customer service when replacing their broken devices?",
    "content": "I have owned both a Google Pixel 2 XL and now a 4 XL for the last three years, but in that time frame Google has replaced my phone 13 times. I have been waiting for the latest replacement for the last two weeks now. \nOver a week ago when the replacement was mailed I noticed it wasn't expedited like promised and instead was sent through UPS standard delivery. I called to point this out and the agent decided it was best to contact UPS and have my device pulled from the truck and held at the distribution warehouse. Numerous calls later I finally ended up on a tier 2 person's desk and they have been telling me all week to just wait. Well at this point the device is increasingly late, and UPS has told me not to expect the delivery until atleast next week. \n\nHow can I speed up this process?\nHow do I get a hold of anyone that can actually help me?\nHow do I get retribution for them delaying the package themself?\nHow do I get actual Pixel support and receive a new phone instead of the spree of broken ones I've received? The last phone I received was cracked upon receipt.\nHow do I get a hold of someone from Google in North America, preferably Canada?",
