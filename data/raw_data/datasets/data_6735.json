    "content": "My Pixel 3 Top speaker just working for calls, that too in earpiece. Not working when on speaker phone.\n\nAlso it's not working for any media, notification, ringtone.\nI tried different apps also booted in safe mode still doesn't work.\n\nI don't remember exactly for how long I've has this issue. Has anyone else also faced similar problem? Is it something to do with February 2021 update?\n\nAny help would be much appreciated.\nThanks",
