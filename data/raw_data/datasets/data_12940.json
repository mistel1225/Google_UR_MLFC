    "content": "I noticed while watching videos that the display on the pixel 5G is very dim and I have to put the brightness way up (75%-85%) to see it better. I have been using an S9 for the last 2 years and it's brightness was great and videos were good at 30% brightness. Wondering if anyone else noticed this?",
