    "content": "Hi\n\nMy pixel 3 only charges with the USB c connected one way up but not the other.  This problem seems to only have happened recently. I've tested the charger on my wife's pixel 2 and it works so it is not an issue with the charging cable itself.  I've tried restarting the phone and also safe mode but no luck.  I have also tried cleaning out the usb port on the phone.  Has anyone else had this issue and know a fix?  Sounds like it's a hardware problem to me.",
