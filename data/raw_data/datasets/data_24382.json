    "title": "North American Pixel 3a in Japan. No Japanese Regulatory Label and can't sign contract",
    "content": "I currently live in Japan and own a North American Pixel 3a. The bands are correct, but there is no native regulatory label for Japan in my device. NTT Docomo stated that in order to create a contract around my phone they require this mark to be present in the regulatory information. The mark represents that the device is safe for use. The 'Japan' section of the product manual also doesn't show this mark.\nIn the store I had the opportunity to search through a Japanese model 3a and the Japanese regulatory label had this mark present. Am I out of luck since the North American model lacks the Japanese regulatory label?  Will I be unable to create a contract using the North American model in Japan?\n\nThank you for your time",
