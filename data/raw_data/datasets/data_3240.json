    "content": "My google pixel 4 XL has been stuck at 2% for a few months now. No matter how long I leave it on the charge it will not move above 2%, although it lasts for many hours even with it displaying 2%. I didn't think much of it at first because my battery life was still long enough for me to get through the day, and it was just a minor inconvenience at most. Now though I realize I can't update my phone ever, because it doesn't let you update at \"low battery\", and so certain apps no longer work correctly because my phone is out of date. I've tried factory reset but it didn't help, it's still 2%. Does anyone know what to do or what could be causing this? Really appreciate any answers.",
