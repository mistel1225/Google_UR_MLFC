    "content": "I checked my notification settings.  All are on.  Keep in mind that I just changed over from an LG G6 and had all of these apps installed there.  With no changes in configuration, these notifications worked fine.  Something is different about the Pixel OS.  Also, my wife has a Pixel 3 and Powerschool notifications do not work for her either.",
