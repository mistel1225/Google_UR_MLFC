    "content": "I've seen people on YouTube and Twitter who say they are getting 8 to 10 hours of screen on time with their pixel 5. I'm not getting anything near that. On average I'm getting around 6-6.5 hours of screen on time. I don't use anything heavy just mostly social media. Theirs nothing that's draining it in the background either. I've been using the phone for  about a week and I thought it would be much better. I also feel like I lose like 5% overnight and the phone slowly drains even when I'm not using it. I mean the battery is still good but I thought it would be even better. Let me know what you guys think and what your experience has been like.",
