    "content": "This has just been happening recently. I have a Google Pixel 2 XL. I'm not sure if an app is causing the issue or if it's software.\n\nIf I've been on my phone already it doesn't happen but if it's been sitting for a bit ill pick it up and unlock from the fingerprint and the phone unlocks but only shows the background, if I push the home button or recent apps button, nothing. Weird thing is if I pull down the notifications and try to open something nothing happens, so I'll push the power button to turn the screen off and then back on to unlock the phone and the app that I tried to open from the notifications is the app that is running when I turn the phone on. Android stopped the option to clear the ram a few updates ago so that's not an option. I was only thinking this because I was thinking my phone was just being slow. I have recently factory reset my phone, probably within a month or so, to start over because these phone has the tendency to slow down over time. The only thing I can think of is an app causing the problem because I've never had this sort an issue and this is my second Pixel 2.",
