    "title": "Pixel 5 - No Sound from Speakers Nor BLE Headphone",
    "content": "This issue started today (24/02/21) - I hear no sound what so ever from the phone:\nNo media, notifications, call, phone ring etc.\nI tried both using the speaker and via BLE headphones and it behaves the same (this rules out speaker HW issue).\n\nWhen using \"Sound Amplifier\" app using the headphone I do hear the surrounding so that's surly not HW issue. Volume is back to normal after restart but might occur again after a few min/hours making the phone useless! Any thoughts?",
