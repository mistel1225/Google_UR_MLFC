    "title": "Is anyone intermittently losing LTE coverage on Google Pixel 3XL after leaving Wifi Coverage?",
    "content": "There are situations where I leave public wifi (gym, Starbucks, etc) where after I walk away and lose connectivity to the wifi, I lose LTE coverage as well.   The LTE coverage does not come back if I re-connect to the wifi router, or toggle LTE . I need to force a reset to get the coverage back.\n\nThis has been occurring a lot throughout the lifetime of my Pixel 3 XL, and I'm wondering if anyone else has encountered this.\n\nIf so, are there any fixes?",
