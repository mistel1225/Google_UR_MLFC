    "title": "How can I stop repeated \"high mobile data usage\" warnings on the Pixel 5?",
    "content": "When I use more data than usual even for a brief time (such as when I give a hot spot to my laptop for a few hours), android starts to give me warnings over and over again about \"high mobile data usage\" and these warnings continue for days after the high usage event! This is despite me not being anywhere near my monthly limit, or near the data warning limits I have specified. I can't seem to find anything in settings for stopping this behaviour without turning off other notifications at the same time. Can anyone meet stop these warnings?",
