    "title": "Pixel 4: Front Facing Camera Distortion",
    "content": "The front facing camera, both on the device as well as on the third party apps shows major distortion. When you flip to the front facing camera your face actually distorts after a second and even the areas around you seem to be represented at a weird angle. \n\nThis is my second Pixel 4 (sent the first back for the same issue), but I get the feeling this isn't a bug, it's the device/ camera itself. \n\nI have done all the troubleshooting you can do - factory reset, upgrades, deleting third party camera apps. \n\nIs anyone else having this issue? If so, how have you solved it? Any workarounds?",
