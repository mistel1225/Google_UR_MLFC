    "content": "I'm not sure if this is something to do with my Pixel 3 XL, Android 10, or the Play Store.  But, about 10 minutes ago, I got a notification saying the \"Google Play Store\" is \"Checking Device Security.\"  It just sits there.  Going to the Play Store app, the app scanner thing at the top of the \"My Apps and Games\" Updates tab is just sitting there saying \"No problems found\" (and not running).  If I run it, it completes seconds later without issue.  Anyone have any idea what this \"Checking Device Security\" notification thing is about and why it's been sitting there for so long?",
