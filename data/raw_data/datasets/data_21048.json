    "content": "My son's google pixel 3a on Sprint Network sends images via MMS fine when connected to the network.  However, we live in a weak/dead zone and rely on wifi for connectivity.  He previously had not trouble sending and receiving MMS over wifi, but now he cannot do so.  We have tried sprint support, but they have offered no solutions -- just had us turning on or off different settings related to network/wifi connectivity.  This is an issue among many Sprint users as well as other carriers and seems to be related to the Andriod 10 update -- the only connectivity issue is with sending an image via MMS when the network is unavailable.",
