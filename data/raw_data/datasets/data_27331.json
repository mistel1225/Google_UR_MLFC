    "content": "Hi Google,\nI am planning to buy a Pixel 3 Xl phone in US(from google store). I have asked one of my friends to bring it to India.\nMy only concern is regarding warranty.\nWhen I have read the warranty information, it seems to be confusing.\nIt says\"This Limited Warranty is only valid and enforceable in locations the Phone is sold and will apply only if you purchased your Phone from Google or its authorized resellers.\"\n\nPixel3 xl is sold in India and USA. So, the line:'enforceable in locations the Phone is sold', meant warranty can be claimed in India as well?\nPlease clear out the confusion.",
