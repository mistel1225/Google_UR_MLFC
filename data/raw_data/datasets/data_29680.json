    "content": "The phone kept crashing. Then on restart it got stuck in a loop during the google logo start up screen. I tried the volume down and power button to enter recovery mode. Then this did not work so I used power button and volume up button to do factory reset. Even after factory reset the phone gets stuck in the start up screen. \n\nAny help will be much appreciated",
