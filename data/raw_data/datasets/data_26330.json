    "content": "Starting today, when I plug in wired earphones/headphones, my phone either restarts (immediately) or thinks that the earphones are a USB connection (it lets me select data transfer / charging etc.)\n\nThis happens with all the headphones I tested, not just one.\nI am using auxiliary headphones with the official google USB-C dongle.\nThe contacts on either devices look fine so it might be a software thing.\nRestarted my device multiple times, but this does not help.\n\nThanks in advance for assistance",
