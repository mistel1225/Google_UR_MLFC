    "title": "Navigation buttons too hard to reach",
    "content": "The Pixel 5 screen goes to the bottom of the phone & the navigation bar (3 buttons) is too low for my hand to reach. I have arthritis and a lot of hand pain so stretching whenever I want to use the nav bar is untenable. I can't operate the phone one handed which is how I prefer to use my phone. The gesture/swipe navigation option is a no-go as it requires the same amount of finger reaching and more muscle effort to swipe than to simply tapp a button. This is why I love my Pixel 2 - its \"chin\" placed the nav bar at an easy to reach height. \n\nHow can I move the 3 buttons up? There are apps in the Google Play store that can do this, but they all require accessibility services permissions, and I don't trust 3rd party apps with the ability to see anything I do on my phone (including passwords, credit card numbers, etc). \n\nThis is an accessibility issue. Please help me use this phone... or just enable security updates for Pixel 2, which I would prefer to keep using if I wasn't forced to buy a new phone just to get security updates.",
