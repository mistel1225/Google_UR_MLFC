    "content": "I got a new Pixel 3 two weeks ago and it was pretty good, but for some reason, it is impossible to turn the wifi on. I flip the switch and it will either say that it is turning on then switching off or it will do nothing. Before you tell me to reset network settings, factory reset, turn off router, or so on, that doesn't work because god knows I've been trying over and over. Please help me with my brand new phone",
