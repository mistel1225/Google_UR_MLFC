    "title": "Google Discover feed still accessible from Pixel Launcher when Google App paused with Focus Mode",
    "content": "Since upgrading to Android 10, I have found myself increasingly using Focus Mode to pause distracting apps. I've already been using the Digital Wellbeing App Timer to pause apps that I've used too much in the past, but that has caused me to turn to get my fix from the Google Discover feed in the Pixel Launcher.\n\nWhen I try to pause the Google App, the Google Discover feed is still accessible left of the home screen. I thought that it would behave the same way as a widget when you pause it's associated app where it wouldn't display. Unfortunately, that does not seem to be the case.",
