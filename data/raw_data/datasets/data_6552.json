    "content": "I have 3 contacts that I text often that suddenly have this notice: At your request, android is blocking this category of notifications from appearing on this device. I do not get notified at all when these contacts text me. I do not know how this got \"turned on\" and I don't know how to fix it and no one at Google is helping. Please does anyone know how to fix this??",
