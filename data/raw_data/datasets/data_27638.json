    "content": "I was recently on holiday and unfortunately my phone was exposed to some salt water. This caused the phone to immediately shut down and i've only been able to get a power screen once when plugged in. I understand that the phone may not be able to be repaired but I would like to know if there is any way to recover the photographs taken on it? They haven't been backed up to google drive.\nWould appreciate any ideas! Thanks!",
