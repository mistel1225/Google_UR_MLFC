    "title": "Pixel 5: Certain notification tones don't follow system sounds",
    "content": "Certain notification tones do not follow the sound settings. For example, when sending a message, the tone it plays is at a volume that does not match the set volume for ring and notification. Another example, scanning an NFC tag/device. I scan my Yubikey on my device and it's almost twice as loud as my ringtone. If I turn the ringtone volume down, it's still louder than my ringtone itself. The ringtone is custom, however it is a direct mp3 from an artist I've purchased from.",
