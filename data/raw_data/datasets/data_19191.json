    "content": "Whenever I try to play any audio from my phone through my cars speakers via aux cable, no sound comes out. I can change the volume as much as I want, but it still stays silent. I know it isn't the adapter OR the aux cable OR the radio system, because I can use headphones through the adapter just fine, and other people's phones can play through my aux cable and radio just fine. I have also tried playing audio in safe mode with the same outcome, as well as multiple different apps. I have also attempted to clean out the adapter port with no results. Anyone know how to fix this? It was working just fine until a few months ago.",
