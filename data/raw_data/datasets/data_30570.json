    "content": "I've had my Pixel 3 for several months and it just recently started to have this half-line appear across the screen at random times. It is a distorted, discolored, horizontal line that runs from the left edge towards the middle of the screen. It happens when scrolling and sometimes when the screen is not being moved or pressed.\n\nI tried rebooting the device, turning off Apps, Safe Mode, and testing the screen, but the line still pops up.\n\nThe problem is the same from this post but I do not know what the resolution was. \nhttps://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/621872?hl=fr",
