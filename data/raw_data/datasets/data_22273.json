    "content": "Ive been using a Pixel 3XL on Fi and have been trying to leave Fi to go to Mint Mobile.  I’m on my THIRD try of getting Mint to work on the Pixel 3XL.  My number ports successfully but if i go to Settings/Mobile Network, there is no option to add a network and no network appears.  It just says insert your SIM, which I did.  I was told to factory reset my phone, which I did and still same thing.  We’ve tried 3 different MINT SIM cards over 2 months and same things happen all the time.  My MINT number is live; I just cant access it on my PIxel 3xl.  I’m at my wit’s end.  No one can help me.",
