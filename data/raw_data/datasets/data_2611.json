    "title": "Dual Sim / Networking Handling is Abysmal.",
    "content": "Why is the dual sim handling such a horrid mess? Even with single sim it is barely acceptable.... Why no separate ringtones for each line? Why isn't a VoLTE switch in the device whether single or dual sim?  Second sim doesn't have  a preferred network type?  No separate notification tone for each sim...\n\nFor a billion dollar company I expected way more and way better in terms of software and handling. Even my $200 Umidigi S5 pro device has a better layout and handling.\n\nThe WiFi roaming is set entirely too high before switching to a new connection as well. My device has yet to switch to the different routers in my house, yet I've only ever had this issue with a Oneplus and that was fixed through an update.\n\nThis is my first Google device since the Nexus, and I have to say over all with the software I'm not all that impressed.  So many corners were cut for no  apparent reason, it's a convoluted mess of just throwing things here and there, and a lot of bugs. I don't get it......",
