    "title": "LAN printer not connecting",
    "content": "Used to print all the time from Pixel 2xl (although Android updates would often kill it temporarily), but have had no luck connecting either Canon or Brother to 4 XL. Printer is listed in cloud print (which I know is being dropped by Google next year), but I send a document from phone and it goes nowhere. No error message unless I look on cloud print website, where queue shows 'error' or 'queued'. Printers work fine from laptop (wirelessly) and desktop. Main printer has wireless function but is also connected via Ethernet to router, and phone is connected to same network. Very frustrating to lose functionality going from Pixel 2 to 4.",
