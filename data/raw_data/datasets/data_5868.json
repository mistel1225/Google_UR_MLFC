    "content": "I've just updated my phone to newest software version from February 5th.\nI did this as there were issues with the classic lower return button.\nHowever, if I want to change the language now the phone restarts every time. Doesn't matter what move I make it re-starts. \nWhat could be this problem and how to solve it? \nAlready re-started in safe mode but also doesn't change anything",
