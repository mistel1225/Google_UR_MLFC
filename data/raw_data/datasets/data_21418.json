    "content": "On my Pixel 4 xl - search results for \"supported animals\" doesn't show the «View in 3D» option.\nTested with several animals (Eg. Tiger, hedgehog, shark, etc).\nTested both from Google app, and Chrome. \n\nBoth phone, AR Core, Google and Chrome is updated from play. \nI have Beta version of Google app, but have also tested the stable version (both from the play store).\n\nWhen searching from Incognito mode - the 3D option appears - but to view in AR - you have to exit Incognito mode - and I get the following error message (picture attached) \n\nReboot, force close, clear cache tested for both Google app and Chrome. (also updated the phone to April update (OTA)) ",
