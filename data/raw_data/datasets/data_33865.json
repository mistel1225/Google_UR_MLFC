    "content": "Several apps allow you to log in using fingerprint authentication. I've recently changed my password on several accounts, and now some apps fall to log in using the fingerprint.  They state that my username or password are incorrect.  I can log in successfully if I type in my username and new password.\n\nTurning fingerprint support off and back on in-app doesn't help. How can I clear the credentials attached to my fingerprint for any particular Android app?",
