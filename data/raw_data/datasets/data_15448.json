    "content": "I have a Pixel 4XL.  My husband and I share an exchange calendar - when I add this calendar to my gmail calendar all of the contacts he has under that email address sync to my phone.  I've tried turning off sync but they don't go away.  I tried another suggestion to remove the account, add it back but then quickly turn on airplane mode, then turn off sych of email & contacts and turn off airplane mode, but then the sync doesn't work.  \n\nI want ONLY the calendar to show on my device.  This is extremely frustrating (seems like I'm not the only one) but surely there HAS to be a way around this.  Just like how I only want contacts with phone numbers to show in my message + app and the phone app.  Can someone help?  I love the phone other than how stupid these two items are.",
