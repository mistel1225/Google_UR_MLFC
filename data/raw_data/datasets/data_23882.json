    "content": "Android 10 has destroyed my pixel phone. DO NOT UPGRADE!!!!!! I no longer have the ability to download anything!! Google Play store is not working! The Camera and Photos app have not been working. There has been slow reaction times for switching within apps. That is going on with my phone. Luckily I am one of the few that did not get the sensor error from this update. Again DO NOT UPDATE to Android 10. I wish there was a way to go back to Android 9. ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ I have done everything.",
