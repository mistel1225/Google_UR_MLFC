    "title": "I got a pixel 3 XL in late summer 2018, and the USBC audio adapter isn't recognized at all anymore..",
    "content": "I've tried cleaning both the adapter and the port on my phone, I've tried restarting and resetting the phone. But Everytime I plug in the adapter the phone just refuses to use it and instead plays audio through the phone speakers as if nothing is plugged in. Charging works fine as well",
