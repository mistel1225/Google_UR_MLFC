    "content": "I did something to turn off my notifications for messaging and now I cannot figure out how to turn them back on. I have already tried going into settings for the phone and for messages to make sure that it's turned on and I checked to make sure that there is a default sound set so it's not on silent. I have restarted my phone After changing the settings. I have checked the settings in sounds and vibration and those look right. Do not disturb is not on.",
