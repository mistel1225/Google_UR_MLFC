    "content": "Battery life on Android 10 is terrible but I have noticed that it's getting worse since the last big update.\nFull charge now lasts less than 12 hours and the battery use app doesn't seem to work.\nWhen battery reached 27%, usage of all apps only added up to 36%, which doesn't make sense, or is suggesting that system is eating battery.\n\nI had several issues recently with the system so the system is already restarted, hence I don't want to be doing this again \"just in case\".\nThe \"try in safe mode\" silver bullet is not something I want to try as it will not show what is draining the system.",
