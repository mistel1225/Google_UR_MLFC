But...on my Pixel 2 running Android, when I go to Settings -> Google, \"Chromebook\" used to be there as an option, but now it's disappeared. Restarting my Pixel 2 didn't help. Please can you release a newer version of Google Play Services to bring back the \"Chromebook\" option found in Settings -> Google?",
