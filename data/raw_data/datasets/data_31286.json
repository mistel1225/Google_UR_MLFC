    "content": "I bought two google pixel handsets. Suddenly speaker and mic of my phone stopped working. First it was the mic and then speaker went non functional. The issue arised when both handsets auto updated to android 9.0.\nI gave it to the service centre in pune india which was then sent to mumbai. They returned one handset to me after a month but the problem still persists and also phone app and UI is not responding while making or receiving a call or running any application. Kindly help.",
