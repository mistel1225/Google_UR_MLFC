    "title": "Google Pixel 2 sound app won't work. Phone rings even on vibrate. Tried safe mode.",
    "content": "I have gone into settings. I have clicked on sound. I have a completely circular experience where it just pops me right back into settings. I have attempted to put my phone on vibrate. Turn sound off completely. it just keeps ringing no matter what I do. And I cannot adjust the ringtone either. All this happened after I plugged in headphones. I have put the phone into safe mode. I cannot find a third party app to take off in case that is the problem. Completely at my wit's end.",
