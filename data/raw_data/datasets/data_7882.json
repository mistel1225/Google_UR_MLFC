    "content": "Touch screen isn't working properly. Difficult to type messages. Unable to answer calls because need to attempt literally 20 times. Took me a while to type this. Kept pushing the wrong keys. Phone has been acting up like this for the past two days. Before that it was working fine. I've had it for nearly three months now.",
