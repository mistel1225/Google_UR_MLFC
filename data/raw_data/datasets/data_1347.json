    "content": "I put my phone into vibrate mode - and then at some point later in the day it is no longer in vibrate mode.  I feel like it either has something to do with my Jabra Bluetooth headphones and when I disconnect them, or watching video and adjusting sound (without my headphones connected).  I have not been able to reproduce yet - but I am actively trying to figure out what triggers it to go out of vibrate mode.  I've had the phone for about a month now and it consistently goes out of vibrate mode on a daily basis.\nI never want sounds on, if there is a way to put it into vibrate mode for good, that would great!",
