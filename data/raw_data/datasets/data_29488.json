    "content": "Hello, i have a question regarding the \"always on display\" on my new pixel 3a, could you please specify does it work like active at night when do not disturbed mode is activated or it still displays the time and notifications? I am asking because have noticed that at night without activated \"do not disturbed\" option it is still showing all info like usual. Will the display be black at night with \"do not disturbed\" option turned on?",
