    "content": "I woke and i found my pixel 3 frozen on black screen and wouldn't restart with long press for minutes and plugging-in didn't work, i thought it was totally dead. later that day i tried one more time and it worked but it was constantly rebooting on it own randomly so i made a factory reset but the problem wasn't fixed i tried factory wipe from recovery mode. Now, it still restarts randomly but less frequent but i also noticed when i am plugging the device in the wall charger it keeps blinking the wireless charging animation even when the phone is switched off. I didn't find similar case to this and I am not sure if this occurred to anyone before.\nNeed help! if anyone know a solution for this issue or should i send the phone to google to fix",
