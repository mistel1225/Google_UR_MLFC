    "content": "My Laptop detect the hotspot on my phone and connect to it but it say connectivity is Limited. So, I can not go to any websites. I transferred my line from T-Mobile to Google Fi.\nIs it related to firewall setting?\nIs it related to frequency setting such as 2.4 Mhz vs 5 Mhz (I tried both but did not work)?\nWindow diagnostic test say, DNS server is not responding.\nI called google technical support but they could not fix it either. They are still investigating.\nAre there anyone who made hotspot work on their Pixel 3a XL?\nPlease help if you had similar problems and solved it.\nThanks\nVeli",
