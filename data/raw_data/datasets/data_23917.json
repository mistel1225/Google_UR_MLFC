    "content": "Hello\nI bought my phone in Jan 2019.\nPanorama mode worked fine, but a few months ago it seemed to be replaced by VR Mode.\nEven though the option in the More section says \"Panorama\", it actually creates a VR image.\nI don't know what a VR image is, and Photoshop can't work it out, and it looks terrible.\nGoogle's support advised removing Camera app updates, but I think this has been an Update within the Android OS.\nHas anyone else had this, or noticed this?\nI could do it within Photoshop, of course, but it was nice to have the Panorama option before.\nAnd annoying to have the function still named on the phone, but it actually do something different.",
