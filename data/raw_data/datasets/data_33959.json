    "content": "I can connect my phone to my car's audio blue tooth system (Landrover Discovery sport 2016) fine, however when I also connect for phone, the device constantly disconnects entirely from the vehicle, every 30 seconds or so. I have tried all of the solutions listed on this site and others to no avail. I have also had my vehicle software updated but that makes no difference either.",
