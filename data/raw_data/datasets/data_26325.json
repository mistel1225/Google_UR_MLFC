    "content": "I have been experiencing this issue with WhatsApp and my Pixel 3 XL device ever since I got it.\nWhen my phone is connected to my car's Bluetooth, and music is playing (from either google play music app or other music apps on my phone) and I want to listen to a voicenote (VN) or video in WhatsApp, when I tap play on the VN, it reduces the volume of the music and plays the VN alongside the music, but I usually can't hear the VN clearly, so I go ahead and pause the music (it makes no difference whether I pause the music from the phone directly or from the car's display) and then go back to WhatsApp and try play the VN again, but a second later it starts playing the music again together with the VN. Back to square one; I can't hear the VN over the music. This keeps happening; I pause the music, restart the VN, but the music starts again too. Even if I force close the whole music app, it often reloads it automatically and starts playing music again, just by tapping play on the VN. This is really annoying and not practical to do, especially when driving (my phone is mounted, I can easily hit the play button on a VN when it comes in without getting distracted from the road, but the go through the whole ordeal just to listen to a VN is not practical while driving).\nHow can we get the music to automatically pause when a VN or video is played in WhatsApp? or at the very least, if I have to manually pause the music, how can we get it to stop automatically playing again when the VN is played?",
