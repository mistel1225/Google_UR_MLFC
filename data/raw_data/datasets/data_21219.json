    "title": "All apps and system UI randomly crashes.",
    "content": "All my apps including the system in-built apps crash randomly. The phone keeps restarting and has factory reset 8-9 times on it's own. Certain times an individual app won't even open and will keep crashing, currently it's the 'phone' app, hence I can't make or receive calls, I am using truecaller to currently call people. Things get better if the phone factory resets on it's own or I do it, but in a day or two it's some other app that's crashing. Please help me out, and yes, I updated to the latest android version. Still nothing. Oh btw, I've dropped my phone a couple of times.",
