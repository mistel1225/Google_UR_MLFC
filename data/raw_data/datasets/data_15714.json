    "content": "everytime there's a chat bubble that pops up and when the charging port is on my right hands the chat bubble opens but I can't see the messages or reply or type on it, but if it is on my left hands I can reply and chat. so basically I need to exit my YouTube or Netflix just to reply. and I can't keep switching it because it is so INCONVENIENT...
