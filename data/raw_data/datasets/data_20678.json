    "content": "I have a Pixel 4XL running Android 10. Starting today when I search for a phone number or business within the Google App, the application with crash when select 'call' or a phone number. It used to simply open my phone dialer and place the number there to call but now does nothing and will crash the application. Is anyone else experiencing this or have a fix without having to completely factory reset the phone?",
