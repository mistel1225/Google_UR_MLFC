    "content": "With Covid here, all the places to eat are having the QR codes for menus. I just switched to a refurbished Pixel 4Xl from a Pixel 2Xl. With the pixel 2 I was able to open my camera, scan the code and have the link pop up. With the 4, it doesnt do anything. I tried using the lens option but still no links or anything comes up.",
