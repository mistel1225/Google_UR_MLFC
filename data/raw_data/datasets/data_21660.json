    "content": "So I have the pixel 3 xl and pixel stand and everything is up to date nothing is running in the background but yet my phone is saying charging but its actually dropping in battery I use the power cord and everything that came with the stand why is this happening? Everything is updated. Also sorry about the pics I had to take them with a crappy back up phone I had. Case is also not interfering with it I put it on the charger at 7:04 at 30% and at 7:25 it's 29%",
