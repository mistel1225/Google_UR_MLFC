    "content": "I have had my phone for about a year and a half. Just today my phone has started to freeze and turn off randomly. It is freezing while in use, but only for a short time. It has also been turning off at random times. I have followed the steps of checking my storage. I have over 20% still left. I have also turned off and let rest for a period of time and disconnected from WiFi and Bluetooth. The only thing left is a factory reset, which I do not want to do. \nIs this a common problem? How else can I fix the problem?",
