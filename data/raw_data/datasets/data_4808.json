    "content": "I restarted my Pixel 3a earlier today and now apps won't stay open.   Any ideas?\n\nI have tried deleted files and have device storage below 70%\nI tried clearing cache and data on a few apps.\nI even uninstalled one app and reinstalled - that app worked until i closed it and tried to re-open.\n\nWhen I open an app it flashes open and then disappears.   It shows open but wont' actually load and stay on screen.\n\nIt seemed like initially after the restart only apps i had used today were affected but now any app I open does the same thing.\n\nI have also check for and applied all available device and app updates.\n\nHelp please.",
