    "content": "Does Google Plan on producing a solar battery charger, \"enhanced charging station\" like the LIT for the iphone in the image below? Or is the LIT compatible with Google Products? It reminds me of the technology we have had for electric charging stations for toothbrushes! I've had an electric tooth for 16 years, & didn't put much thought in to the \"non contact\" charging until recently! \n\nThe solar computer panel even has a light, so it would serve as an emergency back up light & charging station for mobile computer phone!  \n\nMy inner child wants changing colors &  a projector!  If you had 100 people with one of these charging stations, you could created some really cool designs in First Person, then fly a drone above the design!  It would be like an enhanced version of SOS on the beach with whatever you decide to sell! \n\nMy dog wants one a solar powered ball, \"based off this technology\" that rolls by itself & changes colors!",
