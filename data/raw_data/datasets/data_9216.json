    "content": "Hello all!\n\nI know this question has been asked for the pixel 2 but I'll give it a try for the pixel 4a. \n\nI have only used this device for a month and unfortunately the screen had a little crack, turned black and stopped working (odd!). Now I am hesitant to replace the screen because I know that google repair factory resets your device and I am in need of the data on my pixel (I hope there's another way about it).  \n\nSo the question is, how can I command the device or at least transfer photos from the device with a black pixel 4a screen.\n\nThank you all in advance!",
