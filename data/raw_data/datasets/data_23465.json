    "content": "Hello,\n\nI live in Denmark and one of the reasons why i bought the pixel 4 was call screening because i keep getting marketing calls even after i signed up to a \"robinson list\" (A list where they can't call you) All i have to do is mention im in it and then they hang up but they still call me.\n\nI have my system language and google account set to English US. I have the december update and the phone app is fully updated. I'm just straight up missing features because the Duo update didn't give me the blur options or the follow face option aswell :/\n\nDoes someone now a workaround or maybe why after updating i don't get the update material?",
