    "content": "Dear support people,\nI am super frustrated with my new Pixel 4a 5G. It is my company phone and seems to be totally untamable.\n\n1) Google Calendar app is constantly sound notifying me even thought I have switched off all sound notifications in its settings\n - a few minutes ago I was notified with an event which was deleted hours ago and which even does not show up in this terrible app.\n - it is not possible to uninstall the app nor kill it. get rid of it. I really do not want to use the worst product you have created so far. the app gets weirdly synchronised with my work outlook account. I hope this can be switched off somewhere.\n\n2) RESOLVED (was actually an issue of the Beng Olufsen Beoplay 2P speaker): when playing music over bluetooth the (yt music, Spotify) the playback stops randomly. incredible. this was reported by users over a year ago and still happens. \n\n3) Keep (Notes)\n this bloody app does not synch with my Google account. New notes created in the app got DELETED. I still do not understand how this is happening in the 21. century.\n\n\nOVERALL RATING: WORST PHONE I HAVE EVER HAD BY FAR\n(and I had about 10 so far). Switched from Apple just get into the Pixel NIGHTMARE.",
