    "content": "My pixel 3 is about 1 year old. From 100% charge to about 70% it drains at an expected speed for a phone as old as it is. However, after 70% it starts draining about one percent per second until completely shutting down. Upon plugging it into the original pixel charger it now charges back to 100% faster than ever, but that doesn't make up for how quickly it drains. I'm getting less than an hour of battery life after a full charge and considering Google has boasted about the extended battery life on it's devices this is disappointing. I've also recently experienced multiple instances of my phone restarting over and over again until it's put on the charger even when it's charged to about 80%. \nSince encountering these issues I have gone through all the troubleshooting tips on the Google support forums including only using the original charging products, checking and deleting problem apps, restarting in safe mode, and even factory resetting my device. Nothing has changed after all these after these attempts.\nI'm assuming this is becoming a more common issue among pixel users as it doesn't take much for me to search for possible solutions. Google needs to put out a statement recognizing this issue and work to put a stop to it.",
