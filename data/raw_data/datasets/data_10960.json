    "content": "Recently, 3rd party apps on my Pixel 5 stopped seeing my Photo Gallery photos. This is particularly a problem with social media apps, including FB Messenger. Sometimes there's an option to choose from my Camera folder but it shows about 5 recent images. Other times, choosing from any other folder isn't even an option. It's just \"Gallery\" and the same 5 images. However, the reverse works-- in a picture I'll hit the Share icon and I can share that way. Also, I've found that if I use the web version of an app (www.facebook.com for example) I can see all my photos. I have cleared cache for everything and checked permissions a thousand times. HELP!!",
