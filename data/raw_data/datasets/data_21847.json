    "title": "Phone stops ringing after one ring. I miss a lot of calls",
    "content": "Frequently, my phone will ring once and then end the call on my end. It is still ringing for the person who is calling me. I miss so many calls this way. Happens often, but not all the time. And it's not just certain callers either. My husband can call me one day and it will work, but then try and call me the next day and it won't.",
