    "content": "Since the last android update, when making a answering a call, my Pixel 2XL freeze and display System.ui has stopped working. Sometime, it says phone has stopped working instead\n\nI can't make anymore call. My phone is pretty much useless now.\n\nI tried to cleared storage of the phone app, disable digital wellbeing, reboot in safe mode and factory reset.\n\nMy wife has the same phone and has the same problem. That's why I don't think it is an hardware problem and more a software problem.\n\nWhat more can I do?",
