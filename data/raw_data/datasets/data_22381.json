    "content": "I want to create a shortcut of a doc in Google Drive to my home page. When I open my doc and click on the 3 dots in the upper right-hand corner I get many options, e.g. 'move', 'share and export', 'star', etc. \n\nAccording to websites the option of 'Save to home screen' should also be there. But it isn't. I haven't been able to find it anywhere on the phone.\n\nTIA.",
