    "content": "Ive seen a few posts about this issue, they are all locked with no solution given.  I use a Bluetooth headset all day but I don't have it in all the time.  So Facebook notifications, email, text only go through the headset audio.  Is there any work around to make my phone ding when a text comes through?  I saw someone suggested a program that reads your messages aloud, I don't want that.",
