    "content": "Hello,\nI had a Pixel 3XL but the motherboard bit the dust and the phone is incapable of being fixed/turned on. Though I had the phone being backed up to Google Drive so I have the data, but plan on switching to an iPhone 12. What is the process of getting the data/back up of the Pixel from Google Drive to transfer to iPhone 12?",
