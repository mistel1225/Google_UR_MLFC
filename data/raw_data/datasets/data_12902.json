    "content": "When my Pixel 3A XL is locked, I can turn the screen on by pressing power button and swipe down from top to access and change the quick settings. This is not really secure, correct?\nAnyone can take an unattended phone and switch off or on the wifi, hotspot, etc., when it should not be done.\nHopefully this is fixed. Any settings change should be possible after unlocking the device by the device owner.",
