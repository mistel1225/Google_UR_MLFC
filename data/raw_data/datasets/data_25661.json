    "content": "So when you use the Screen Call feature it shows you a transcript of what the caller is saying, but I read that you can also *hear* the caller if you either listen on the phone like you would on a regular call, or raise the volume to put on speaker\n\nI can't do any of that, I can only read the transcript\n\nHad anyone else had issues or have you had success?",
