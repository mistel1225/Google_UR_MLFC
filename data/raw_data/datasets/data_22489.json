    "title": "Bluetooth connection to Volvo radio causes car radio reboot",
    "content": "I frequently use Bluetooth from my Pixel 3 to connect to my 2015 Volvo S80. I've never had any problems,  at least until yesterday, March 10th 2020. Streaming YouTube to my car radio will cause the car radio software to crash and reboot pretty reliably after about 30 seconds or so (I haven't timed it yet). Streaming other apps, such as VLC, over Bluetooth causes the same thing to happen. Simply having Bluetooth connected and using the car's radio did not cause reboots, however I did hear the radio drop out completely and return several times. I did apply the most recent Android update this morning, but that has had no effect.\n\nThis is absolutely a critical issue - this will cause me to move away from Android in the next couple of weeks if it isn't resolved.",
