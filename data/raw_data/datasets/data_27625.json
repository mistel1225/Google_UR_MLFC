    "content": "My Pixel XL has all the latest OS updates. My camera app and all camera related apps crash when I try to launch them. Snapchat, Facebook, Instagram and of course the camera app itself. All these apps have worked normally, and until yesterday I could restart my phone and they'd work. Now I can take no pictures in any format. I have force stopped the camera app and cleared cache and followed all the instructions I have found on forums. I have opened in safe mode and camera apps still do not work.  Please advise.",
