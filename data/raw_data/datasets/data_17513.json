    "content": "I recently lost my Google Pixel 4 and it is not connected to google account nor does it has any sim card yet, so I can't track or call it. I have some important photos on it. Is it possible to get the photos through Google Photos website? When I take a photo on Pixel 4, does the image get automatically uploaded to the Google Photos account? I opened my Google Photos on my macbook and it only shows photos from my old phone that I upload/sync manually. \n\nAny advice on recovering the photos/tracking the phone is greatly appreciated. Thank you!",
