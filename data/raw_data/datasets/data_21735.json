    "content": "Hello! Against a better lapse of my judgement, I left my phone out in my car seat in the sun, and it seems my Pixel 2 has stopped loading past the G Bootup screen! This is really unfortunate, because I have some files I really, really need that aren't backed up, so factory reset isn't an option. Is there an explanation for what happened to my phone? Is there a way to recover my data in any way? I do not care about the phone itself at all, just if there is a way I can take my files off my phone. Thank you!",
