    "content": "I have a Pixel 2 for a year now and recently started trying VR. It is just unbearable to do anything in VR as the center drifts to the left at a fast pace. Tried all the troubleshooting steps you can find on the internet but no luck. Decided to get in touch with Google support. They said they cannot help. When I said I needed for work they hang up on me. Strange as we can clearly see that the issue is very common.",
