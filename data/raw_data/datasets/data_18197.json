    "content": "Is it just me, or is Google not as good as it used to be. I am/was a pixel devotee, and before that, Nexus. But my latest pixel (4) is nowhere near as good as it should be. Sure, the camera is great, but that's it. And losing the unlimited photo storage is a deal breaker. Now, to add insult to injury, they're shutting down Google Play music. As if you tube music is even comparable. Everything is now about shoving you into monthly subscriptions. My wife just bought the latest Galaxy, and what an amazing phone, with an SD card slot. And exactly the same deal for photo storage. So what is Google offering anymore, why do they expect us to stay with them? Are they trying to be the iPhone of the Android world? Guess what Google, most of us came to Nexus and Pixel because it used to be the opposite of iPhone, where you were locked into their app store, their music service, etc. Looks like Google is just trying to copy Apple.",
