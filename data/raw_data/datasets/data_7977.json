    "content": "When swiping right through my pages of apps, if I go too far like I'm going to go past any pages that have apps, my screen will show my blank wallpaper and I cannot get it to go back to anything, home or swiping up does not work. The only thing that I found that works is powering off the phone and powering it back on. Why does this happen?",
