    "content": "I'm a UK customer of Three, and have just moved to a house with no indoor mobile reception.  I'm considering upgrading my Google Pixel phone to a Pixel 4, but only if I can use Wifi calling.  I know this is available on some networks and with some versions of the handset: if I buy an unlocked Pixel 4 from Google, will it work for me on Three in the UK?  Anything I need to look out for?",
