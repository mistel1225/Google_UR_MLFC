    "title": "Pixel not turning on; black screen",
    "content": "I was charging my PIxel and it had just about reached 100% when the screen turned off. A white light was blinking but the screen refused to light up. I held in the power button to turn it off and turn it back on and the phone stayed on the Google screen for ages so I tried rebooting it, only for it to remain off indefinitely. \n\nThe only response I've got out of it at this state is plugging it into a Windows computer with a USB cable. The computer recognises the Pixel but under the following: Qualcomm HS-USB QDLoader 9008. I'm assuming that whatever this is it's some type of firmware that suggests a hard brick.\n\nI've tried all the troubleshooting steps, charging overnight, but nothing will make it wake up. I've had it for less than 2 years and never had any battery issues before so I'm not sure if it's a hardware or software issue. Would be grateful for any tips because repair centres these days don't carry replacement parts for the original Pixel, and @MadeByGoogle isn't helpful either as support agents aren't responding during the pandemic. I really hope there's a way to solve this as all my important info is in this phone and I'm not able to log into my bank etc. Thanks!",
