    "content": "I forward my calls from a landline to my Pixel  Running Android 9 build PQ2A.190405.003 . The call screening tool used to see the number that is calling and forwarded by my landline; however, today it started just showing my landline number and when I tap screen the call the caller almost always hangs up, but I don't have the opportunity to block the number since the number shown is my land line.\n\nAs I said this just started today.\n\nThoughts?",
