    "content": "Often despite a big bright wifi symbol in my pixel 4a 5g notification bar apps will not load or complain of no internet connection.  Turning wifi off and immediately back on always fixes the problem. But I do not want to have to fix this several times a day. \nIs there a setting to make or avoid? Is there an app known to help?\nMy home uses eero mesh network.",
