    "content": "My Pixel 3 has charging issues- It will only charge if you  first plug the cable in and then restart it. I have tried safe mode, different chargers and a factory reset. The device is only 4 months old.  \nRecuse of this I've requested a call back but no one has been touch. I live in Taiwan and the phone was purchased directly from the google store . Does anyone know how long a callback takes? Or is able to offer advice on a fix?\nThanks!",
