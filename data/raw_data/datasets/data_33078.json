    "content": "The device screen stopped responding on its own all of a sudden. I was trying to snooze alarm when i reallized that screen is not working. I tried switching off but power off button also was not responding. so i gave hard restart multiple times but still the screen is not responding. When calls are coming it is displaying the calls as expected but since touch screen doesn't respond i am not able to pick up the calls. I had removed the tempered glass screen protector also but still it is not responding",
