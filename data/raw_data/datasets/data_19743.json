    "content": "To reduce the eye strain on my Pixel 2XL, I have tried to install an app that always keeps 100 % and through the app filter, brightness is controlled, so that the screen refresh rate is best for eyes at all times. But even after using this I still feel lot of eye strain and also I always use my phone in night mode, so that's also something that I have already tried.\n\nPlease try too resolve this issue as I can't use the phone for more than 30min at a stretch which is quite disappointing..\n\nMy device is under warranty",
