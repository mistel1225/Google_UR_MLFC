    "title": "brand new Pixel 3a XL restarted itself many times today",
    "content": "Just got a brand new Google Pixel 3a XL two days ago. Worked fine till today - it restarted 5 times by itself.\nBattery was >80%. Android OS updated to latest. All apps are up to date.\nI followed some online suggestions - e.g., tried Safe mode - it didn't reboot in safe mode but guess I didn't test it long enough.\n\nThis never happened in my old Pixel (1st gen).I'm wondering if it's a defective unit (hardware)?\n\nTIA",
