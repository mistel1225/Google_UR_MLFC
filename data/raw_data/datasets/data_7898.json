    "content": "After I switch from wifi to mobile data most of the apps can't use internet until I turn data off/on using the app I need to connect to internet (chrome/mail/etc)\nOnly messengers work normal without this move.\nI have turned off data saver or other limitations and don't use battery save mode. \nI'm sure there should be some way to change it in settings but I still can't find it)\nThanks and sorry for my English, I'm not a native speaker",
