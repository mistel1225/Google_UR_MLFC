    "content": "Hi,\n\nI see I'm not the only one having this issue but did not quite see an answer.\n\nI got my Pixel 2 XL directly from Google at the time.\n\nI am now \"recycling\" for professional use and need to install a custom recovery. But to do that, I need to enable the OWEM unlock which is grayed out.\n\nI already called T-Mobile but they say they have nothing to do with that.\nDid Google put the OEM lock in place? And is so, 1) Why? and 2) How can I enable it?\n\nThanks",
