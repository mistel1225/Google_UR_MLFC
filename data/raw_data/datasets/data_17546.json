    "content": "We all know Pixel team, Android team and Material design team already took a lots of effort to make our user experience better than ever before.\nThat being said, to enioy the best experience in android only when the language is set to English.\nThe reason why is the font weight.\nThe good typography can let people to understand the contents faster and more importantly the beauty.\nUsing bold weight as headline, using medium weight as button, using normal weight as body is a important rule of the material design but not in every case. For example Japanese, Korean,Simplified Chinese,Traditional Chinese those are only have one weight of font and that means when apps need bold weight font, the system will calculate a fake bold weight for that and some times even no fake bold for that but use normal weight.\nThe fake one is not reading-friendly and beautiful at all.\nSo l hope you guys can make full weight font come true.\nHere comes compares.\nThe fake bold one is shoot on Pixel 4 and the true bold one is shoot on Htc 10 which using magisk module to make it come true.",
