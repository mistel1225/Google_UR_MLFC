    "title": "Pixel 3 XL battery drain 1% every second after 25-30% charge left on the phone",
    "content": "I purchased a new pixel 3 XL around 10 months back. When the battery has around 25% to 30% charge remaining on it, it starts draining battery at the rate of 1% per second. You can literally see it decreasing in front of you like a countdown timer. Here are the things that I have tried so far but I see the same issue everywhere\n1. Rebooted in safe mode to narrow down if its tied to any rouge app, but that is _not_ the problem. The battery continues to drain even in safe mode.\n2. Did a factory reset erasing all the data and the same problem persists. \n\nI suspect this might be a hardware problem. Curiously, this does not happen when the charge on the battery is more than 30%. Any one can assist or has faced any similar issues ?",
