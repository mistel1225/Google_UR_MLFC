    "content": "My Pixel 4a just started turning purple from the bottom left corner.  I had not dropped it or gotten any liquid on it.  I actually had been driving in the car for about 3 hours in the mount before it stated happening.  It started out very small about the size of a pea and within 2 hours had grown to 1/3 of the screen and most of it has now turned black.  The phone was bought new from the Google store about 9 months ago.  Really bad warranty by Google not to cover this.  I get I declined the protection care package, but geez I thought any company would stand by their product for any reason for at least a year.  I will get the screen replaced on my dime, but doubt I'd buy a Google product again.  It worked fine until today.  Actually, until this point, I really liked the phone.",
