    "content": "Hi I'm visually impaired and require bold text to help me navigate the phone. Can't seem to find the option anywhere. High contrast doesn't work that well with the keyboard being to thin for me to see. Does anyone know where I can find it. Moved from iOS and kind of regret it at the moment. Found that on iOS bold text was easy to find as an option and worked in pretty much everything.",
