    "content": "Hi, I cannot pair my Google Pixel to a new pair of headphones via Bluetooth. I tried several troubleshoot and it did not work. I also tried to pair my headphones to my laptop and it worked perfectly. Then I tried to connect my phone via Bluetooth to an old speaker which was previously connecting fine. The phone said the device was connected but no music was coming out of the speaker, despite the fact the speaker was charged and the volume was up. Thanks",
