    "content": "I have recently noticed the 'upwards arrow' icon below (next to the time), which appears whenever I try to send a photo (e.g. via Snap Chat). I have never noticed this icon before.\n\nIt looks like an upside down 'downloading' icon. It disappears when the photo has been sent.\n\nAny ideas what it is, why it appears and what it's for?\n\nThanks very much!",
