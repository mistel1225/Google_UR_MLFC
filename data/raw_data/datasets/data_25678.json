    "content": "My fault, but I dropped my brand new Pixel 4 in the parking lot at work yesterday.  It was the first time I dropped it, but I knew I would drop it eventually as the official google pixel 4 case that I bought to go with it is slippery.  It fell only three feet but since the lower corners of that case are recessed, my screen shattered.  Of course Iâ€™m very upset about dropping my phone, but I am also of the opinion that the official pixel 4 case provides zero protection and I am wondering about the build quality of the phone if it cannot survive a three foot drop.  At this point my plan is to repair the phone and acquire a third party case.  I have bought every model of the Pixel as soon as it was available, and have never liked any of the official cases...fabric...way too slippery!",
