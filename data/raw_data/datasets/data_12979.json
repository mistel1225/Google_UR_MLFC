    "content": "Videos taken on my Pixel 3A have an incorrect time stamp - four hours ahead of when they were actually taken. For example, I took a video on 2020-09-17 at 12:00:07 but the time stamp on the video file is 2020-09-17 - 16:00:07 with a file name of PXL_20200917_160007814.mp4.\n\nI have \"Use network-provided time\" set to On. I have \"Use network-provided time zone\" set to On. I have \"Use 24-hour format\" set to On.",
