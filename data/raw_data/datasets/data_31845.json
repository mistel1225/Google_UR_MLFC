    "content": "When I click on the temperature on my home screen, it used to automatically open up the weather app. For the last three days when I click on the weather, it keeps taking me to a Google search page and the weather information there. But in that view, I can't click on tomorrow's weather or 10 day forecast. And I can't scroll down to look at other weather information. Anyone else having this issue?\n\nScreenshot attached.",
