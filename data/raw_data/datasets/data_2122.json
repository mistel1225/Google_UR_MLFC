    "content": "Hi\n\nI've just started using a new Pixel 4 whilst my previous one is being fixed by Google.\n\nI've followed the process for setting up my new phone and uploading my settings etc. from a back-up but it seems to have gone wrong. All the events in my Google Calendar prior to mid-last year have disappeared, and all the screenshots I took on my phone and all the WhatsApp gifs and pictures I received from that same point in time onwards have saved into my calendar as the date of the back-up rather than their own actual dates.\n\nI hope that makes sense. Does anyone know how I can get the calendar history back and all pics to the correct dates? It's all for sentimental reasons that I'd like them fixed.\n\nMany thanks\n\nSteve",
