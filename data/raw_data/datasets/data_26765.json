    "title": "Why won't my Pixel 3a XL charge properly via USB?",
    "content": "I got my Pixel 3a XL yesterday and the only cable that will charge it is the one that came in the box. \n\nI have third-party fast chargers at home and even other Google cables (like the one that came with my old-model Pixel) but the phone recognizes it as a charger, then doesn't charge at all.  No lightning bolt icon, no power transfer.\n\nNo chargers, even the one that came in the box, seem to initiate fast charging.  Last night, it took 3 hours to go from 70 to 100%\n\nIf I'm in my car, there's no way to charge my phone because Google doesn't seem to sell a USB adapter to go from USB A to USB C.\n\nIs this a defect with my phone or are others having this issue?",
