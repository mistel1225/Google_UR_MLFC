    "content": "I can't get to anything. I can't even pull up the app drawer. No bottom launcher icons like phone messages browser. The most I can do is pull up the multitask button and click on an app that was open before everything disappeared. Just that one app and I have to do it quickly before the phone tries to make it go too. I could only get to this by pulling down the bar to go to the settings in Help. Idk what's going on.",
