    "content": "I'm just trying to figure out if anyone else has this issue. I'll just be scrolling through my phone or sometimes I notice it when I have Waze up in the car, but my screen will just like flash a blue tint (like it just 100%s the blue portion of the pixels) and then fades back to normal. It happens so scarcely and at random times I cant track a pattern behind it. Has anyone else experienced this or am I just going crazy?",
