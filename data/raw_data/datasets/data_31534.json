    "content": "I could not get my Pixel 3 XL to connect while visiting in Myrtle Beach, SC early this week. My wife's Pixel 2 worked fine. I spent about an hour Monday evening, April 29 chatting with Google tech support. Tech support said he would excalate to next level. I have not heard from anyone. When I returned home it started working again. A few of my friends said they have gotten a \"number has been disconnected\" trying to call. They end up calling my wife's phone. I need to find out who they have phone service with.",
