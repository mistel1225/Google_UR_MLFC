    "content": "Pixel 3xl. Upgraded to android 11. \nIt's seems like almost every app by default is restricted from being screenshot-ed. Even ones that worked fine on android 10 not an hour ago. Only a couple are allowing it. \n\nIs this a bug? Do non android 11 optimized apps by default go restricted? I can't take any screenshots of most apps",
