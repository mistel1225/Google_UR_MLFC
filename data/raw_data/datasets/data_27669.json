    "content": "The newest massive battery draining bug that everyone is encountering on the Pixel is making my phone unreliable and pretty much useless. The new features or security of Android 10 are not worth me not being able to use my phone when I really need it. \n\nKeep in mind this is not the beta I want to opt out of like in other threads. I want to downgrade an already installed Android 10.\n\nPlease tell me there is a way to do this? Thanks.",
