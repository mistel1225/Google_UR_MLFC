    "content": "I have checked to ensure account is the same as on my PC. \nI have removed the account and re-installed\nI checked my tablet and the detail looks the same and it is working fine as far as syncing.\n\nStill does not sync? Is this a flaw with Android 10 or is there something I am missing. Was thinking of a factory reset and starting all over again but would rather not take that route.\n\nAny help out there?  Thanking you in advance.",
