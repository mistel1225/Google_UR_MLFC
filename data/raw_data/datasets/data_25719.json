    "content": "My Pixel 3 back cover is \"unstuck\".  I receive my Pixel 4 yesterday.  I had to remove my Pixel 3 from his cover to get my SIM card.  When I did that, I found out that the back of my Pixel 3 started to \"unstuck/unglue\".  I think the only thing that hold that together was the cover.  My Pixel 3 was always in his cover since day 1 (I ordered it with the Pixel 3 and the stand).  I never drop the phone (look new)\n\nI chatted with the Consumer Service and they told me at first that it's not cover by the warranty.  I'm waiting to that feedback from the second level of the Consumer Service.  Here the picture that I took.\n\nIf it's not cover by the warranty, I'll return my Pixel 4 because I don't want that to happen to the new phone too.  (I bought the cover in Google store too and use the same stand... )",
