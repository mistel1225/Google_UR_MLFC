    "content": "I use blue mail and type app for my hotmail email accounts. More often than not, emails get stuck in my outbox. Sometimes they do get sent automatically. But most of the time, I have to go to the app section of my phone and do a force stop. Then when I go back to the mail app, the email sends successfully. \n\nOther than this, everything is syncing properly. There seems to be no relation to where I am in my house, it just happens randomly, and more often than not. This did not happen on my old phone, only on my new phone which is a pixel 4a. Any suggestions for how to fix this problem?",
