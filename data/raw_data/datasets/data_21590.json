    "content": "Hi! I dropped my Pixel 2 and totalled the screen - the phone still turns on and responds to my fingerprint, squeezing etc but only when plugged into power. The screen is completely black.\n\nI don't care about repairing the phone as I bought it second-hand and was having a lot of issues with it, but there are 900 photos from a family holiday that inexplicably didn't back up to Google photos and I really want them back as they have a lot of emotional value.\n\nI can't get anything off the phone as USB data transfer wasn't enabled on the phone's end when the screen died, and I tried plugging a monitor, keyboard and mouse into the phone using a USB-C hub so I could theoretically unlock it and access everything/set the photos to upload on G photos but as the phone only seems to work at all when plugged into power it just doesn't respond to any of these accessories. \n\nIs there any safe software that allows you to enable USB data transfer from the computer's end rather than the phone's end? Or that allows you to mirror your phone's display elsewhere? I'm on Mac. Have been searching but have come up short and it seems like a massive oversight if this doesn't exist!\n\nThanks,\n\nLex",
