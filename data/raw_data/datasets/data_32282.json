    "content": "Hi ,\n\nAbout two hours ago, my 2 pixel suddenly froze in the middle of use of some news application that I usually use. I pressed the power button for 20-30 seconds and the phone turned off. Now it doesn't turn on, I tried all the options, pressing the power button+volume down.... and the device just didn't respond",
