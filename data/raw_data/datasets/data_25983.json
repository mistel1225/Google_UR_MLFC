    "content": "I play music from Pixel 2 XL to speakers Edifier S3000 Pro with AptXHD codec. Every 15-30 minutes white noise appears instead of music with duration around 1 minute. I tried to pause and continue playing, switch songs, but still I heard white noise instead of a song. In this case, the volume of white noise was controlled by the volume keys. With my second phone, Xiaomi Mi max 3 everything worked perfectly, I think this is a Pixel 2 XL problem. PS: I tried to restart the phone, repair the speakers.",
