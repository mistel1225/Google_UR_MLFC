    "content": "I bought my 3a about a month ago, it works great but last week my phone dosen't get any cell signal, in the notification bar it has no signal with a x on the icon. I can't receive or make calls or use my data. Once the phone connects to wifi the cell signal comes back and I can make and receive calls. I've restarted the phone many times, switched from LTE to 3G to 2G, reseated the sim card and still nothing. The sim works in my old phone as well.\n\nIs there a setting I'm missing? Or is my device faulty?",
