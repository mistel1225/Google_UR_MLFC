    "title": "My Pixel 3XL Suddenly Cannot Recognize the Usual SIM Card",
    "content": "Hello..\nI am the user of Google Pixel 3XL using Indonesian networking provider called XL since December 2019. Everything operated well during this three months. Suddenly on 22 March 2020, when I turned on my Pixel, its screen kept on and no response at all whenever I tried to press it. Then, I took off the SIM card from the tray and restarting the phone.\n\nSince that time, although I have already inserted my XL SIM Card to the tray as usual, my phone display always says \"No SIM Card, Emergency Calls Only\". On the SIM Status, it is said Not Available. I tried to insert the other SIM Card from the other Indonesian networking provider called Telkomsel, but the result is still the same, the SIM Status is Not Available. I reported to my carrier (XL Center). They replaced the old SIM card to the new one. I tried again and the result is still same.\n\nI inserted both of the SIM Card (XL and Telkomsel) to another phones and they work well. Why it cannot operate on my Google Pixel 3XL?\n\nPlease help me with the solution.\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\nThanks.\n\n\nRegards\n\nFeli",
