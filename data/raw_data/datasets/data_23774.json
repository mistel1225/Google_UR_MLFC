    "content": "I got pixel 3 about a year ago but just started using it recently. My phone was working fine, had everything transferred from iPhone perfectly. But, today my pixel phone suddenly started having this green flash at the bottom of my screen, it appears when I turn on and off my phone. I restarted my phone but the problem still there. I did some research and someone point out it might be the ambient display that's causing this issue, I turn it off and so far my phone is working ok, but I'm afraid the problem will reappear soon, I  would like to know how to resolve this problem completely?\n\nThank you",
