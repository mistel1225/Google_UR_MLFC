    "content": "I am unable to connect Android auto to my car. There is an error that says unable to read USB.\n\nI was able to use Android auto on the screen in the car when I first bought it in 2017 then some time after that it stopped working. I thought maybe it was something to do with the car but then my husband bought a pixel 3 has no issue connecting. \n\nFrom what I've read online there was an update to pixel 2 at some point and since then users have complained it hasn't worked. I've tried numerous suggestions in different forums but none have worked. \n\nHow do I fix the USB issue? I'd really like to use the map function while I'm driving.",
