    "title": "Pixel 3 XL shut off randomly and is now in a boot loop with no progress in restarting.",
    "content": "I was using my phone and randomly it just shut off and began rebooting. During the reboot process it wont make it past the boot screen with the Google logo.\n\nI've tried to put it in safe boot mode (power + volume down) and it is automatically in fast boot mode. I've tried to change it using the volume buttons but as soon as I press one the screen goes black and restarts the boot process.\n\nI've also pressed the power and volume up button (I don't remember the name for this mode) and it says \"no command\" with no other options on screen. The screen then will go black and begin the reboot process.\n\nOutside of using a third party app to interface with the phone via usb (which I want as a last resort), I don't know what to do. Any help will be greatly appreciated.\n\nI bought the phone through the Google Store and use Project Fi. So Google is my only return/repair option.\n\nEdit 1: I've seen the steps indicated here in the support but these steps are not applicable to my case as I cannot get out of the boot process.\n\nEdit 2: Someone had a similar issue to mine (link) and from what I've seen is that they requested a replacement as the issue was not fixed.",
