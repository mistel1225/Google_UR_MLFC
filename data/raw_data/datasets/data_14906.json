    "content": "A couple of days ago my Pixel2 XL (running Android 11) started to take up to several minutes to open 3rd party apps that previously would open in only a few seconds. E.g. wunderground.\n\nI have tried clearing the cache of the apps, re-installing the apps including doing several factory resets but to no avail. \n\nDoes anyone have any ideas what might cause this? I currently have a freshly reset device and the only 3rd party app is Wunderground and that on its own still takes 2 minutes plus to open.\n\nIs my phone going the way of the dodo, or some weird setting that persists through resets that I may have missed?\n\nThanks",
