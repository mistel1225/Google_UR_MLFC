    "content": "Battery drops when I leave the phone unattended in a closet. Doesn't matter how much battery I leave it with, it always ends up at around 7% in battery saving mode. What's strange is that the battery doesn't appear to lose power anymore, so it's almost like the battery itself ia fine but the level reported is wrong.",
