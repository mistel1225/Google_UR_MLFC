    "content": "I am connecting my Xbox one controller to pixel 4 through wired option. Once connected, All buttons work perfectly except the trigger buttons LT and RT. \n\nThe same controller when connected to Xbox works perfectly. \n\nIt's just that the trigger buttons do not work when connected to pixel4.\n\nDoes anyone else face this ? Any workaround or solution to this is greatly appreciated.",
