    "content": "Here we are again, a few months ago my phone was left in the car on a particular warm day. The phone went into cool down mode. No big deal. Just a little warm for a few minutes. I then realized my Face unlock would not work. So I deleted the saved face and was unable to add a new one.said \"Enrollment not successful\". So I did a factory reset and nothing. Contacted Google. They suggested a repair or a replacement. However I use my phone for work so I cannot just send it off without a replacement in hand. Also if I choose to replace it, I would get a refurbished one with no warranty. Really disappointed. I'm mad actually. I spend a good portion of my money for a reliable phone and it's proven to be u reliable and customer service is horrible to deal with. After a few months another update came out and it suddenly started working again. Great! Except it only last for a couple of days. Then a day later, nothing worked. Did a factory reset and installed updates and it started working again up until now. Suddenly stopped working again. I refuse to get a refurbished phone. I believe that is unfair since I paid full price for a new one. Pre-ordered in October. I'm just tired of the issues. And don't want to deal with Google again. Any suggestions on what to do? I know there was some issues earlier in the year with a update, but no other post have been made since then.",
