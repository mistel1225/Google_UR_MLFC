    "content": "Tried: Clearing cache data, full factory reset, updating app, updating phone, updating security, entering phone in safe mode (camera app still does not work I'm safe mode), uninstalling app and reinstalling, installing different camera app, using camera feature through other apps such as snap chat, Instagram and Facebook, forward facing camera works most of the time but normal camera will not (just shows black screen with camera control interface). Other people seem to be having the same problem but not getting anywhere with the troubleshooting unfortunately. ",
