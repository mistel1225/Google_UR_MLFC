    "content": "When I set up my Pixel 5 and connected it to my old HTC 10, it never asked for my Google acct. Somehow it found my recovery email address on the old phone and synced everything to that old email. Now on the Pixel 5 email, even though I have added the G-Suite account that I use for EVERYTHING it still keeps defaulting to the old recovery email account that I don't use for anything. How do I fix this?",
