    "content": "Hi, my pixel 4XL battery started getting stuck at 50%. Google replaced it with a refurbished device. However that kept on turning off when in my pocket, the battery drained really fast, and the battery meter was all over the place. Google have just replaced it with another refurbished device, which has been fine for a week or so, until it started turning off when in my pocket again. I've seen several posts describing the same problem, but not many say what worked as a fix. It seems unusual that I've had two replacements, both with the same problem. Some people have said that twisting the phone results in it turning off - I can't replicate that, although it's possible I'm just too scared to twist it enough. Do I need to go back to google again, for a third refurb? Have other people with this problem had refurbs that were free of the issue?",
