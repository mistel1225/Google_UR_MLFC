    "content": "I lost my phone a few days ago and remotely locked it with Find My Device.\nMy phone was returned by a kind stranger today. I unlock it with my fingerprint and PIN, then after a few second the \"Locked by Find My Device\" screen returns and I can't do anything.\nSurely my fingerprint and PIN should tell the device it's back with it's rightful owner. I cannot figure out how to fix this.\nAny advice appreciated please.",
