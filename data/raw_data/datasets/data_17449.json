    "content": "Need a few more clarifications - \n1. As device support (online\\chat) of google pixel 2 XL will going to end means you are not going to provide support for pixel 2 xl devices\nSo in case of any service need, where should I contact or who will repair the phone  ?\n\n2.  Also for example if the phone is completely in dead condition, so how to chat\\contact customer care or from where to raise a ticket or service request ?\n\nKindly clear some doubt as i fear of service availability of pixel 2 xl after few months as per your official page you will be ending support",
