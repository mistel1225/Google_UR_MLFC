    "content": "Whenever my phone goes to sleep, it does not want to wake up. The fingerprint scanner does not even vibrate when touched, and pushing the power button will sometimes get it to wake up about 10 seconds later. \nI have tried restarting in safe mode, and have done a full reset with no success at fixing the issue.\nAny calls or texts I get while the phone is asleep never reach my phone.",
