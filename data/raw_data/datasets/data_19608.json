    "content": "My notifications are ear piercingly loud. I have had no issues with this in the past. Yesterday I went into some of my apps and customized the notification sounds (Instagram, Whatsapp, Outlook). Since then, my volume has been at max. I have tried the side button (which has always worked fine before). I have gone into settings. I've restarted several times. I've restarted in safe mode. And I still can't turn the notification sounds down. Please help!",
