    "title": "Nike Running Club app does not play guided runs when wireless earphones are connected",
    "content": "Nike running app's guided runs do not play when my pixel 3 is connected to my wireless earphones. Other apps work fine, but when I try use the guided runs on the Nike running app, I just hear a repetitive small 'click click' noise. Yet the audio for the controls like 'resume workout' and 'workout stopped' still work. I have tried installing and reinstalling the app, clearing the cache, ensured that the app and phone is up to date. \n\nI've seen on other threads and forums that other pixel 3 users have had the same problems but while using different wireless earphones. I use the Audio Technica ATH-SPORT7TW and I've seen people using the Bose 700's have the same problem too.",
