    "content": "This started 1Â½ months ago, no damage or \"over use\" of phone. Battery was running low and I plugged in the charger and it got steam heat. Tried again, same result - both phone and charger got really hot whitin seconds.\n\nTried different chargers and found one that worked. After a few days I tried the original charger again, it worked!\n\nSame issue now but this time it seems like no charger is working. Original charger and the charger that helped me out last time does nothing, fast charger gets steam heat.\n\nSo right now battery 0% Any suggestions? (Buy a new phone perhaps?) Grateful for your help.",
