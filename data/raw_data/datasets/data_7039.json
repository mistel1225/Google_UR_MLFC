    "content": "My pixel 4a randomly started to restart around christmas 2020.  I called verizon and they sent me a refurbished 4a but it is doing the same thing, plus the battery wont last more than 12 hours.  I have factory reset it with no apps, I have ran through all the trouble shooting, I have received a completely different phone.  Nothing is working.  I do not really want to deal with pixel anymore if this is how it will be.",
