    "content": "Hello in Greece all people has a problem with 5g and volte, in setting I use 5g connection but the Phone works only with LTE, I spoke legally with my mobile network provider (Cosmote) and these support 5G network, and the problem they told me is my mobile company support Phone (Google phones pixel5). It's unfortunately to sell a device without supporting the capabilities of the device, when there are much cheaper device on other device with full 5g support. I hope I have a serious answer and it's resolved with some upgrade.",
