    "content": "The phone keeps shutting down. I'll hold the power button on to turn it on and it will shut off the moment I lift my finger off my power button, or after 30ish second it will just shut off itself \n\nI have followed all troubleshoot and help support supplied and the phone still won't stay on. \n\nThis issue is very common with other pixel 4 users too. A common occurrence between the phones that happened with mine too is that the phone would display a constant 50% battery all day.",
