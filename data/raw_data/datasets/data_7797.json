    "title": "Unacceptable Customer Service - Swollen Battery on my Pixel 3 XL",
    "content": "So the battery on my Google Pixel 3 XL has now swollen over the past two days to the point of looking like it’s ready to explode. I tried to contact customer support and found the only option available is a web chat service, where someone reads/types from a preset script.  After spending hours typing back and forth, I’m told to reset the phone back to factory original specs and send it to them.  They then might return me back a reconditioned phone in about two or three weeks from when they receive the phone.\n\nThis is completely unacceptable.  First of all, why can’t I actually speak with a customer service agent.  Requiring me to speak with customer support agents via a web chat app is ridiculous.  What would have taken five minutes to resolve via phone call, took hours and in the end you now have a very frustrated customer. \n\nSecond, being told I’m supposed to go without a cell phone for upwards of a month, in hopes of getting back a reconditioned phone is unacceptable.  Since this is a manufacturing defect, I should have been directed back to the store where the phone was purchased (Verizon) so I could exchange the phone for a credit toward a brand new phone.  This poor quality customer service makes me reluctant to ever buy a Google phone again.",
