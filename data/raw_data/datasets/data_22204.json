    "content": "I recently had a Google Pixel 1, which I had since before Android 10 came out. After I installed Android 10, I immediately turned on dark mode, and after that, the boot screen of my phone always used dark mode too (when the screen turns on with the Google logo). But now I upgraded to a Pixel 2 XL which I bought refurbished and it, while being at the setup screen, was already running Android 10 when I got it. I do have dark mode enabled but yet, it still has the blinding white boot screen when I turn it on. I have tried turning off and on dark mode between restarts and that did nothing. I also have not rooted my phone or anything like that (Actually locked to the Verizon bootloader anyway). Is there some way short of a factory reset that I can get the boot screen to use dark mode?",
