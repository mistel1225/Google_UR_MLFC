    "content": "It's been 1 year and 6 months with my Pixel 2 and I had no issues, until now. After the May's update, I noticed exponential battery drain. I thought a factory reset would fixed the issue, and it did it for few days... and then again the same behavior. \nI charge it at 100%,  turn on airplane mode during the night, and in the morning is at 81%. It lasts until noon, but the other issue is that around 30%-40% device does random reboots! Moreover,  it sometimes reboots if I open the camera. \nI am frustrated and I have no idea what else I can try to fix it.\n\nSince I know what kind of questions will follow...\n1. Besides the google apps, the rest of my apps in the phone are: Facebook, Messenger, Instagram, Whatsapp, Airbnb, Amazon, Spotify, and some microsoft apps (onedrive, outlook). All of them are well-known, well tested apps and if any of them would have any kind of issue, you will find it out quite easy... But so far there is absolutely nothing.\n2. No useless battery or task managers and so on.\n3. In the battery usage I see nothing abnormal.\n4. Bluetooth/WiFi scanning off. Wellbeing off. NFC, bluetooth OFF.\n5. Location always on, Mobile data always on, but most of times connected to WiFi hotspots.",
