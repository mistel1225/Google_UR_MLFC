    "content": "I thought when turning on \"double tap\" feature that it would wake the screen. Now that has seemingly disappeared on my Google Pixel 3 XL via Android 11. That was pretty handy to have. It works when the Ambient Always On Display is seen on the screen, but then again my AOD doesn't last past 10-15 min & then it goes full sleep mode. Google please remedy this situation as it was helpful to have.",
