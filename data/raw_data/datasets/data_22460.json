    "content": "Like i stated, my dongle isn't working on my Pixel 2 XL, and I can't buy anything, I've also tried everything! I tried cleaning stuff, I've went into developer options, nothing. I don't know the brand of the dongle either. I've read some things that said if the dongle doesn't have a Realtek chip, then u can root your phone and get it to work. Does anyone have any advice?",
