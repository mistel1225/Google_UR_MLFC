    "content": "Two days ago, part of my left touchscreen stopped responding. I need to press quite hard and in a very precise spot for the screen to react. I have performed a complete hard reset but no lock. The problem is still there.  I haven't dropped the phone and the screen is not damaged whatsoever! Any ideas how to fix it?",
