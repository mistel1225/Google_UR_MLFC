    "content": "The speakerphone on my phone is working inconsistently on phone calls. It will typically work after reboot but if I've been using the phone for a while it often will not work. \n\nI've noticed that it may be working on a call when using Google Voice bit that when I switch to another app and switch back it stops working.",
