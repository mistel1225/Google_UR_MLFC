    "content": "Brand new phone, was working yesterday when I transferred all data & apps from old phone. Was working on and battery was getting low. I charged for hours and it apparently didn't recharge because it died. Tried different outlets. Tried holding power button for 30 seconds, while plugged in. Tried charging from computer and pressing button. Tried power button and volume down for 30 seconds. All I see on the screen is a battery symbol. I get no other activity and phone will not come on.",
