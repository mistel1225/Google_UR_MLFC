    "content": "How can I copy the full transcription of Live Transcribe? Copying the current transcription using \"select all\" only selects the text until the next timestamp divider. It says it stores all transcriptions for 3 days (when that option is enabled), so I guess it stores the text in some file. I was trying to find that file by connecting the smartphone to a PC, then searching in the phone's file system. No luck so far... Any hints?",
