    "content": "Whenever I take a screenshot with my brand new Pixel 4a, a pop up in the bottom left hand corner gets in the way. I either have to click on the little x to force it to go away as quickly as possible (and it's TINY. I usually end up accidentally opening the screenshot because it's too small.) or I have to wait for it to go. Both are obnoxious as absolute @#&%. I had a Pixel XL before this and it did not give me that pop up when I took screenshots.\n\nHow do I turn the pop-up off? It stays there even when I click on stuff in the background. I can scroll up and down internet pages with that stupid overlay in front of it.\n\nDo you see how it's still there even though I scrolled up and down the page? That is insanely obnoxious! How do I turn it off? Please.",
