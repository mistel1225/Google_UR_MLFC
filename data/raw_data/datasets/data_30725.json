    "content": "When playing an album in Google Play Music and looking a the album view with the list of tracks, I do not see the little dynamic bar chart to signify which track is being played.  I check on other devices and they are all displaying the little bar chart.  Is this something which has been removed for Pixel 3a phones?",
