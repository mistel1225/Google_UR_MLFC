    "title": "Why does my charging port smell like something is burning?",
    "content": "So my husband and I have the same phone. He got his in July 2019 and i got mine in march 2020. In the last month, I have a problem with my phone charging twice. It is not the cable, they work just fine with my husband's. It has been saying \"slow charging\" i would blow into the port and leave my phone off for a bit while charging then it works fine as if nothing happened. Yesterday, it was working just fine then i got a pop up notification saying  something was wrong with the charging port and to be careful removing since it may be hot. The charging port and charger smelt as if something was burning. but the chargers are working just fine for my husbands phone. do i have to replace the whole phone or just the battery, charging port? What should i do?",
