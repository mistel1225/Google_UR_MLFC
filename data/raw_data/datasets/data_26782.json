    "content": "I dropped my phone and broke the camera glass (both myself and repair specialist suspected it was the outermost glass). After waiting for the part to come in we got it replaced. Afterwords, we noticed there were two black opaque lines on the bottom left and upper right corners. We eliminated the possibility of a software issue by zooming in and finding the lines we not there anymore. I was able to work out a deal with the repair specialist in that if I were able to get a new camera module he would replace it.",
