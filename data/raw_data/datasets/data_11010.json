    "content": "When search for an app from home screen I can see what apps are found from those already installed. I cannot however add a shortcuts for those apps to home screen.\nWhen I tap and hold - home screen appears, but the icon freezes and stays frozen even when finger is released. Turn off/on screen (power button) unfreezes home screen, but icon is not placed.\nI can only add shortcuts from the app drawer if I select app manually (not from search).\nTried to clear Launcher data (lost all personalisation of icons and placement in home screen). Didn't help at all.\n\nI'm on build RP1A.201105.002",
