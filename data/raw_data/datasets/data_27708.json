    "content": "Well, those beautiful dark spots appeared on my screen; never dropped my phone or something like that, they just appeared a few weeks ago in the morning, and they are still there...\nMy only worry is if they are going to expand or if they are going to keep appearing; sadly I live in a country where I can't use the warranty of this device, so, I have no option to change it.\nAs you can see in the picture, the pixels are there, but with a very low brightness, the are not completely dead.\nI'm very sad about this because this phone is even more expensive in my country, and I never had this kind of problem with AMOLED displays before, this phone is amazing but this certainly doesn't makes me happy at all, I feel really disappointed with Google.",
