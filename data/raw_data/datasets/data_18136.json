    "content": "I bought my Pixel 3 in US 10 months ago and I'm in India now. I'm extremely frustrated due to this continuous reboot loop happening today all of a sudden. Sometimes when the phone switch on, I cannot able to do factory reset as well. Can't reach out to Google Help agent 24*7 due to COVID. Is there any way to claim warranty or any repair service available in India, preferably Coimbatore or Tiruppur?",
