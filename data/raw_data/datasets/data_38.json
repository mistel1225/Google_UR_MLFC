    "content": "Hi,\n\nI woke up this morning and saw a message on my screen \"your phone is corrupted\". Pressed the power button, saw the google logo for 2 seconds and then.. Nothing. Unable to turn on my phone, go into recovery etc. It's a black screen and it doesn't respond on anything.\n\nI've seen a lot of issues on this forum. What can we do?",
