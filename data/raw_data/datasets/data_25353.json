    "title": "Cannot set up face unlock",
    "content": "On my Pixel 4 I am unable to set up face unlock. When I originally got the phone I was able to set it up during the onboarding process and it worked fine until a day or two ago. I deleted my face from settings, updated the phone, and tried again. I get an error message during setup that face unlock cannot continue when I am at the point where I try and place my face in the oval. It seems that the phone doesn't recognize that my face is in that oval in order to continue setup. I've tried to set up in safe mode but no luck.",
