    "content": "I want to use a third party app as my keyboard app, the app is \"A Keyboard\" from Firsteapps. I use this app on my old phone, a Samsung Galaxy A5 and downloading language packs for \"A Keyboard\" is working without problems on that phone. But on my Pixel 4a I can´t download any language packs and the Pixel can´t get access to settings on the \"A Keyboard app\". \n\nWhen I click on a specific language to download within the A Keyboard app the download seems to begin but it never finishes. I've given the app permission to access my contacts and my phone. I´ve also cleared the cache for the A Keyboard app.\n\nAs I have the same version of the app on both my Samung and my Pixel phone something seems to be wrong within the Pixel as downloading languages for the app works without problems on my Samsung phone. \n\nAny tips on how to solve this issue?",
