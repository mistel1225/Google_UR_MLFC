    "content": "Hi, \nI need google pixel 4a as a review unit for my site. I saw in some questions that you do not give review units but how come the YouTube channel \"Singh In USA\" is getting free review units from google . So is there any requirements that channel with this much subscribers will only get google review units . Please clarify my doubt. \n\nRegards.",
