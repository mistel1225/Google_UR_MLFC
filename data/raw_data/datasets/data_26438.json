    "title": "Pixel 3 XL Titan Security Key not working",
    "content": "My Pixel 3 XL is not being recognized as an option for a phone security key however the device shows up as being an option with Google prompt. I also own a Pixel 3a and I am able to set that up as a Security Key but it is not my main device. \n\nI opened up a case with Google Support but they were unable to help so they suggested I come here. They had me clear my storage cache and data which did nothing. I'm not sure if they knew what they were doing as the person remotely logged into my phone and had me show them even though I told her you can't setup the Security Key through the device and it needed to be done on the webpage. The next day, I followed up with Google Support and they had me remove my Google Account and add them back from both of my Pixel devices to no avail.\n\nHas anyone else experienced this problem or does anyone know a fix?",
