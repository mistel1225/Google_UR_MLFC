    "content": "My Pixel 4 seems to be draining ridiculously quick. It was at 100% charge last night and when I woke up in the morning, the phone was very hot and the battery drained to 28%. This has never happened.\n\nI leave my phone on my nightstand while sleeping. It also happened at work on the same day. Put it in my locker with 85% and by lunch it was 35% with a hot phone.\n\nI've tried rebooting the phone but it's currently dropping about 2-3% as I type this.",
