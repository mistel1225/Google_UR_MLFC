    "content": "Here's what happened. Saw my phone had wifi but no internet connection.  But that didn't make sense as I was watching TV using my wifi connected Roku. Checked, and literally every single wifi device in the house was connected to the internet  via wifi except my Pixel 3 XL.   My fingbox said it was solid internet connectivity. I did reboot the router 4 or 5 times, I checked the IP address and made sure it was still static (it was), I rebooted the phone a ton of times.  I turned off programs or forced them close. Nothing worked.  Used all the tips on these guidelines and nothing fixed it. Dinner came, so I put it aside to call support after dinner.  It was in my pocket for 45 minutes - it went in with wifi connected, no internet and came out of my pocket connected.  Seriously?  Went from working perfectly fine, then for about 4 hours it's wifi connected, no internet and then it spontaneously fixes itself?  Especially given the  fact all other wifi connected devices had internet connectivity?  Is this a known issue? Is the phone defective?  I was steeling myself up for a factory rest and a days worth of bringing it back to how I like it so I'm not happy.",
