    "content": "I need help figuring out how to get the media player controls to show up on the top pulldown menu from my phone. Example: When I have pandora or youtube or anything else w audio playing in the background and need to change the song to next or back or pause etc, I used to be able to do this. On every android I've had it's a simple option, for my pixel 3a I feel like I've tried everything with no luck. Please help! Thanks :)",
