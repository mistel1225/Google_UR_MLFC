    "title": "Test if battery is at end of life?",
    "content": "My battery suddenly went from lasting over a day to lasting less than 8 hours. It's getting old (Pixel 2 XL, I've had it for 2 1/2 years after buying it discounted because the Pixel 3 had come out). \nI've checked the battery usage in Settings, including the advanced view, and I don't see any apps that could be causing the problem. \n\nMy guess is that the battery is nearing the end of its life, but I'd like to know if there's any way to test this before I send it off to the Pixel Repair shop and have a new battery put in.\nWith all the money crunch due to the pandemic, I don't want to get a new phone right now...the money is better spent elsewhere. \n\nDoes Google or a 3rd party have an app or anything I can use to make sure it's actually the battery and not something else I've overlooked?\n\nThanks everyone.",
