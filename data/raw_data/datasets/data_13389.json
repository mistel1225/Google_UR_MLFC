My phone is always noted as being an older version of Android but for whatever fix I'm seeking a newer version of Android is required Please check my Android version and update as necessary however obviously I am completely up to date using a Google Pixel 3 running Android 11 why is my device sometimes not even recognized as a mobile phone Rather it's recognized as a Chromebook or laptop running Windows which is insane can anyone explain this?",
