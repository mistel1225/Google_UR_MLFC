    "content": "Hi. I have recently bought a pixel 3, and just set it up with the included pixel buds. When it tells me I have a notification, it has a different voice than normal, and also has a Hungarian accent. I used to have all the Google settings in hungarian, but a few years ago I changed everything to English(uk). Can you help me getting rid of that accent please?",
