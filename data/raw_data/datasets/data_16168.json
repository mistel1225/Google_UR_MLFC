    "content": "For a long time I've had trouble with the Google Maps 'beam' not pointing in the direction I'm going or being at all reflective of the direction the phone is pointing in. I thought this was due to a problem with the phone or software but have figured out its actually because of the magnets incorporated into the closing latch on the case that I bought around the same time I got the phone. When I take the case off the phone, it works normally.\n\nCan anyone suggest a book style case (that closes over the screen) which doesn't have any magnets and that will allow Google Maps to work properly in this respect? I realise Google made their own case for the Pixel 3XL but I do want one that folds over and covers the screen and I don't want to use a screen protector.",
