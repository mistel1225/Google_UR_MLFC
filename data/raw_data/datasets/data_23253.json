    "content": "i made the switch from iPhone to Google Pixel. one of the things i found convenient about the iPhone was that i could listen to music on Spotify and the songs would appear on my lock screen for easy access to changing or pausing a song. However on the Pixel i have to continuously log into the phone to change or pause a song and its really tedious and annoying having to do so, on top of time consuming. Has anyone figured out how to have Spotify appear on the Pixel lock screen  without the inconvenience of logging in ?",
