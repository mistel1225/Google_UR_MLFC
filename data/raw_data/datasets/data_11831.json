    "content": "I have my pixel USB-C earbuds plugged into a laptop. Windows sees the earbuds as input and output audio. When I go to Google Chrome and do a Meeting, Chrome does not recognize the earbuds' microphone (unfortunately, Firefox does). Is there anything I can do so my earbuds work with the microphone in Google Chrome?",
