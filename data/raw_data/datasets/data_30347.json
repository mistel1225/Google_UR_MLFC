    "title": "Talkback/Text-to-Speech has very low distorted voice (compared to Google Assistant) on Pixel 3a",
    "content": "Voice feedback will sometimes come out in an extremely low and distorted voice, borderline demonic effect, for lack of a better description.\n\nGoogle Assistant usually sounds fine, but sometimes will use this voice. If I use Talkback or Text-to-speech, it will always use this distorted voice.\n\nI am in Australia so language settings is set to English AU.",
