    "content": "My Pixel 3 was connected to my rental and it was charging while I was driving and using maps to get to my destination.  I also had my music playing from my cell.  My cell ended up running out of battery and turned off.  It was still on the charger, but it will not turn on.  The screen turns white and the google G is loading, but it would never turn on.  I left it on the charger for 3 hours, but when I came back it's still stuck on that same screen.  I tried turning it off 4-5 times, and rebooting the phone by holding the power and down button, but the phone would still be stuck on the same G screen.  How do I turn on my phone?  Why is this happening?",
