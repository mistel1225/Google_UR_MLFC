    "content": "Hi I’m contacting you because I just got my Pixel 4 XL, I bought it a few minutes later after they announced it. I live in Mexico City and have been a huge fan of google products specially the pixels phones (this is my third one). Even though they don’t sell them here, I always find a way to bring them to Mexico. \n\nThe reason I’m reaching you is because I just realized that “motion sense” is disabled in Mexico, and that is a huge bummer. There is no law here that bans or prohibits the use of that type of technology. So what I was wondering is if Google is planning soon to enable motion sense here in Mexico or other countires, or if there is a way I can have it enable. \n\nIt such an amazing technology and for simple apps that I don’t see why it would be disable here in MX or other countries. If there is anything I can do I would love it because that is one of the thing I love about pixel phones, that it has technology that makes them different from the other phones and that makes them stand out, and in the case of pixel 4 it is one of the things that makes it stand out and one of the new futures this phone has.",
