    "content": "So this just started and at first, was just for a couple of seconds so I thought that it was nothing. I go to update my phone and then I have trouble accessing my apps like it wasn't responding to my touch really well, it would go to the wrong app or something. Then I don't use my phone till lunch and when I go to text someone, I COULDN'T TOUCH ANYTHING. I tried reseating it, at first I just kinda hit the back of it which worked once, I shout it off for a bit and turned it back on, I took my SIM card out, I didn't use it for a bit and then try again, and I even tried to factory reset it  but nothing has worked. \nI got the pixel about a year and a half ago so I don't know why or what happened to cause this.",
