    "title": "losing detail and bokeh effects in portrait shots after trying to adjust the blur/depth",
    "content": "After I take a portrait picture, if I want to adjust the bokeh and blur effect a little bit higher, all the nice software adjustments of the bokeh effect disappear, and even though the blur is higher, it doesn't even look as good as the \"original\" photo. For example, the blur lens effect of light is just gone if you try to adjust the blur effect, no matter if you lower it or turn it higher and sometimes the subject gets all blurry and odd looking.\nFor example, look at this video I made: https://youtu.be/Dn3wDoLOcTU\nAnd this one made by a r/GooglePixel user: https://youtu.be/Y_OyaBx70Wc\nPlease, try it yourself too, it is not just happening to me.",
