    "title": "Video artifacts and crash reboots",
    "content": "When watching a video through any app like Facebook or the built in photos app, artifacts will appear and destroy the whole video, like in the screenshot. It's not a problem with the videos because watching them on other devices doesn't cause the same issues. Rebooting into safe mode also doesn't solve it.\n\nSometimes, watching a video in the photos app also causes the phone to crash. It used to totally crash and reboot, but after a recent update only the photos app crashes now. ",
