    "content": "I was hiking on Saturday (10/5/2019) and pulled out my phone to take a picture and found it at the setup screen asking me to insert the SIM or to connect to wi-fi to download the eSIM. I hadn't done any kind of reset and it had been working as I was getting notification on my Versa earlier in the hike. I haven't installed any new apps since upgrading to Android 10.\nAnyone else have this issue or should I blame the security app with admin privileges I have to use for work apps and security?",
