    "content": "I keep getting this error whenever I try to click on the Google search bar or whenever I swipe over to the google news page. There are some other apps that aren't even Google apps that have stopped working and give me the same error. Not all the Google apps are broken as google maps and chrome seem to work fine. I don't know what to do to fix this. I already tried restarting my phone and emptying the cache on the Google app and still no luck. Please help me.",
