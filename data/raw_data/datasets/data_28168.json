    "content": "Post installing Android 10 on my Pixel 2 XL I have noticed my camera app isn't auto focussing on nearby objects. Irrespective of me touching the object the image is never getting clear. Tried in safe mode, deleting cache, uninstalling update etc. Only thing left is factory reset which I really don't want to do. Any other suggestions?",
