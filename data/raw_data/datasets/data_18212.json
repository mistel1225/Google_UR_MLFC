    "content": "So, this is the issue i guess most of us pixel2 users have already faced. Phone is working fine, it still rings an alarm daily plus i can sense all the vibrations , fingerprint ,on/off, but the screen wont show a single thing. I have tried all those pressing vol and power buttons combination with no luck. I dont think anything will happen even if i write it here but i am already pretty frustrated that pixel doesn't have ONE walk in service center in all over INDIA",
