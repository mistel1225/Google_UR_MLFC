    "content": "I have done all steps to \"fix\" my mom's old pixel. Other than bring it somewhere. But I figure this is something to do with wiring not the actual battery. As long as my phone is plugged in I can use it. I unplug it and it works but the minute I switch apps or watch a show it shuts down. I just want to know what's wrong so I can fix it.",
