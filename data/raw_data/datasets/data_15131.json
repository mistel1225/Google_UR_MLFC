    "content": "I sent my broken pixel 4XL device to be replaced on 9/14 and Fedex tracking shows it was received on 9/22. However, after several attempts to contact google, I'm still unable to find out when I will receive my replacement device. At this point I'm paying for a phone I don't have and customer support is unhelpful at all. Is there some way I can find out what is happening with my replacement?",
