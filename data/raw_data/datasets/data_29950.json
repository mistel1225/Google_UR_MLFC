    "content": "Help! I got a new pixel 3 in October 2018. In March 2019, the head phone jack stopped working. We called Google pixel folks and they said to send it back and they'd replace it with a refurbished phone. When we tried to take it out of its OTTERBOX CASE, it was stuck but after a lot of effort, it came unstuck. The phone looks like it has been run over by a MAC TRUCK. I NEVER DROPPED THIS PHONE. EVER. And I certainly did not run it over 10 times with my car. What the hell, Google? Pixel support will not help us. So now we are paying for a phone that has completely imploded. The case is fine, the screen is fine. Has this happened to anyone else???\nHey GOOGLE, why are you not standing behind your products? This is ridiculous!",
