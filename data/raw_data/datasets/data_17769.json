    "title": "Pixel 3A dropped mobile connection",
    "content": "After performing the August 2020 update my 3A lost all mobile connections.  Eventually a Google rep had me cycle the phone through safe mode and that restored the connection. Today I received a notification to update the Play store, after restarting, the mobile connection is gone again and the safe mode trick doesn't work now. The Sim card works fine in other phones, so it's definitely an issue with the phone.",
