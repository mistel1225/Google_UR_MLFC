    "content": "Google must mention on every pixel handset box that works with only JIO sim for VoLTE services.\nDon't make the customers fool.\nI got the information from Airtel technical support that they got a mail from Google device team that the Pixel users with Airtel connection are not able to use VoLTE service because MCC & MNC is missing at IMS end & Google device team is working on it to resolve the issue.\nBut Google is giving false excuse to pixel users that the problem is from carrier end & we must complaint airtel for this.\nDon't give wrong information.",
