    "content": "I'm trying to access assistant but either swiping from a corner or squeezing my device. I'm also having this issue when I just try to hit the microphone on the Google search bar. I get an error message that says assistant is not yet available or something for that effect. I have tried deleting the Google app entirely and reinstalling it I've cleared the cache and storage on the Google app my phone app and the pixel launcher app. I was unable to uninstall updates to the pixel launcher app as suggested by the last chat representative. The last chat representative had me restart my phone and now I can't get back into chat again. All I want my Google phone to do is search Google and it doesn't do that anymore. Help.",
