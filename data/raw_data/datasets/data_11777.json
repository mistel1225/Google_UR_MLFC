    "content": "Why pixel 4a is not available to every customer?\nIt's exclusively launched in flipkart on 16th, after couple of minutes in the midnight it got sold, so they notified as coming soon,\nOne day later we got notification as it's available, but for hlle sake it's not available to any pincodes including metro cities like Bangalore, Mumbai, Hyderabad, Delhi, Chennai and Cochin,\nBut Shipping is available for All Assam pincodes.\n\nWhy? How can a seller can sell a exclusively launched product in only one State?\nDo you think that only Assam people needs Google device?\nOr Other state people aren't capable to purchase the device?\n\nAnd they are shipping every other products to all over india, but not pixel 4a!\nIf they can't distribute or sell an exclusively launched product to all over india, then what's the point on launching a product in a country like india? That even a product that didn't even reached to the retailer market.\n\nFor more information, check #pixel4a hash tag on Twitter.\n\nGoogle, kindly fix this, we were waiting for pixel 4a from August itself, \nLet us enjoy the device soon.",
