    "content": "Under android 9, do not disturb used to turn on when driving automatically but at some point it stopped working on my pixel 2. I'm not sure when it stopped working but I'm now on Android 11 and in trying to fix the issue have deleted the rule for \"driving\" and I'm unable to recreate it. Has anyone else noticed this or been able to create auto rules that aren't just based on time or schedule?",
