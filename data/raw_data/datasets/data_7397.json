    "title": "Pixel 3a sensors stopped working after screen replacement",
    "content": "My phone fell down breaking it's screen. After that I ordered new screen and replaced it in the service. The new screen is working just fine, but all  of my sensors like proximity, light, gyroscope, squeeze doesn't work at all. I tried making factory reset, but it didn't work too. I wonder if it's screen problem or problem which appeared after the fell of device? And how is it possible that all device's sensors went down at 1 moment.",
