    "content": "My Pixel 3a is eating a HUGE amount of data.  For example, yesterday I was mostly in a wifi zone all day, and it ate over 100 meg.  There have been times when it eats over 500 meg in a day.  I don't watch videos or do anything that would use a lot of data.  I send a few emails and check WhatsApp - that's it.  Google Play Services shows as the culprit.  I have done the following to try to fix this, but to no avail:  Factory reset and reinstalled all apps, set every app to not use background data, turned off the backup, disabled the play store and turned auto update off, and turned auto sync off for all accounts.  If anyone has any ideas, I would really appreciate hearing them!  Thanks.",
