    "content": "I bought a Pixel 4a, after just a few weeks the camera stopped working. After extensive contact with Google (it's not easy to get in touch with you guys!), i got an RMA and sent it back. I was told to hear something within 5 working days and I would receive a replacement item within 5-10 working days. I don't really want a replacement device, I just want the working Pixel 4a like one would expect when buying a brand new phone.",
