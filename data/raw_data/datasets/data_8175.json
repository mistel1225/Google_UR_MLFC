    "content": "Our area just for an Amber Alert for a missing child.\nThe google voice read out the amber alert text that was displayed on/over the lock screen.\n\nAll the amber alert like settings on the phone, and official help pages on the web, seem to be about turning the alerts on or off. I don't see any setting about speech or voice or reading. Not sure what the right key word is in this case.\n\nI want to keep getting amber alerts. BUT I do not want my phone to read them out loud.\nAt least i want to choose.  I am usually in a quiet setting, working from home during Covid with 2 children schooling from home. A device deciding to read out loud is inappropriate.\n\nTY. Android 11, pixel 4a 5g phone.\n\nSolving this would be great. Similar issue that comes up much more often, the voice reads out the first google search result all the time, with no apparent way to turn that off. Make me use google search less to keep the room quiet.   My previous Android One phone did not do either of these things, as far as i can tell.",
