    "title": "I was surprised a magnetic car mount stuck to my new 4xl. Will that harm the Pixel?",
    "content": "As said in the question, I although the Pixel became firmly attached to the magnetic car mount when putting the back of the phone on the mount, I removed it immediately thinking it may damage it.  I will be using the Pixel Stand to charge and I don't want any problems however, if I can use the car mount as is that would be a BIG Bonus as I currently don't have a car mount solution other then the magnet. So, in less Words. Will a Strong Magnetic car mount harm the Pixel 4xl over time??\n\nThank, GB",
