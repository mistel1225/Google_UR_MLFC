    "content": "October 28th I sent my phone to google repair which I guess is cynergy us in Texas because of the back glass adhesive problem. They’re giving me the runaround on what’s going on, first answer was your phones been inspected and is due for replacement, the only issue is they are telling me the phone is out of stock. \n\nThey’ve apparently escalated my case but the email I got from the escalation was more of the same, “we’re looking into it and may ask for more information” after this is taken care of I’m done with google phones if this is the level of support they offer customers",
