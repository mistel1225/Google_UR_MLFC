    "content": "I can't make or receive calls. When I try to ring out the phone says \"dialling\" for about 10 seconds (excellent mobile reception) then suddenly it shows zero bars (little x in the reception icon up the top) and the call disconnects. I haven't been able to receive calls either.\n\nHowever the weird thing is I can send and receive texts (I've been getting texts saying that I've got new voicemail). \n\nAlso mobile data is working fine.\n\nI contacted my provider and they confirmed that my sim was working correctly. I have reset network settings, restarted my device in safe mode, updated, even signed up for beta android 11 (and updated OS). I also tried an alternative dialling app.\n\n...So I done a factory reset. Still no help.",
