    "content": "When I connect to charger that came with phone the battery turns back grey. l\nlet phone charge back up from the 80% charge to 94% and unplugged. The battery indicator turns red again. Reset the phone and also turned it off and both times the battery indicator came back red. The battery saver was set to turn on when phone reached 15% charge. So I disabled it and still getting red indicator. If the battery power was rapidly discharging, I would suspect a dying battery. But the battery was at 80% when I saw the red and that's about par for a regular day. Any thoughts on what's going on? Thanks!",
