    "content": "I have been using pixel 4a 5g. I wanted to stream my game (pubg) to fb and YT. I am using \"omlete arcade\" app for that. But there is a minor issue. When i switch on the mic in the game, my voice cannot be heard on the stream. Only when i off my in game mic, my voice is heard in the stream. So i think the problem is both \"omlete arcade\" and \"pubg\" are not able to access my microphone simultaneously. But i read on the internet, since android 10, two apps can access microphone simultaneously. Anybody has any idea abt this issue? \nP.S. - i use earphone with in built mic which also has a button.",
