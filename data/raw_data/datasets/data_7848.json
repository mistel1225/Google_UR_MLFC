    "content": "Phone was left alone, on a desk for at least 10min and when picked up there was a bright (white) line on the screen. It appears about 2cm from left edge and goes vertically from top down. Is about 3px wide. Is hard to see, but there is a pink line and followed by thicher bright line next to it. \n\nThe phone was working ok up to now, no crashes, never demaged, always in case. When it happened was charged and not tooany apps running. Tried to find if any app cause it, resetter the phone, charged it, left it off for some time & did a factory reset. Nothing helped. After factory reset I even had errors showing when trying to add Google accounts. It eventually worked after a reset. \n\nAfter googling I see that some people experienced the same and that is a hardware issue. What now?\n\nNote: attaching pic does not work from the form, so link to image here \n\nThanks!",
