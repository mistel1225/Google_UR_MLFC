    "content": "Like many others, I enjoyed RCS on the the Pixel 3 XL. However, until it's implemented on the 4XL, we are stuck with SMS. I do use the stock Google Messages app.  My 4XL has never been able to send SMS text when connected to WiFi. Anytime a text is sent and WiFi is connected, it will try to send and then just state the error that the message has not been sent. You can try to send it again, but it will not send. As soon as WiFi is turned off, the message will send. \n\nAnyways, I did some searching and didn't see much about it and was wondering if others had the same issue.",
