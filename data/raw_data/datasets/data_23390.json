    "content": "Hello, I have a Google pixel tablet c1502w, the display has stopped working on it. I am from Russia, I went to a phone and computer repair service, they told me there that they would not be able to repair such a tablet, because they do not have a motherboard circuit for such a device. Help me fix my tablet, who do I need to contact?\n\n\nTickmc\nIn our city there are no services that deal with such devices, I contacted one of them, they told me that they need a device motherboard circuit in order to fix it, where can I get this circuit?\nsending a tablet to another country will not be justified - costly, thank you",
