    "title": "Phone doesn't last through a full day, plus it shuts off and restarts. Yes I did recommended steps.",
    "content": "Have the phone stay on for at least a full day. Not have it restart randomly for no reason, which has only happened a handful of times since I've had the device, but it's super weird and unexpected, and by that I mean sketch. It's also incredibly insulting having no way to know when the device is going to shutdown before it actually does, and I'm not talking about the low battery warning and saver mode at ~ 15%, but if the device knows when it's been determined to shut itself off, there isn't any reason why it can't also alert of this, and offer custom settings or options around shutting down to make this even slightly less of disruption every day.",
