    "content": "A couple weeks ago, my work WiFi stopped allowing only Google Pixel phones to sign onto WiFi. All other device brands in the building are able to sign on with no problems - including Samsung and Apple phones. It seems to have affected ONLY Google Pixels (my device and another employee's Pixel 4). This is a large business with a large network, so \"reset the router\" is not an option. I manage social media for this organization and cell coverage in the building is terrible, so WiFi connectivity is absolutely vital for me.",
