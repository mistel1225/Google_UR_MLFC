    "content": "Dear reader, \n\nRecently (early Feb 21) I bought a pixel 4a in the netherlands. After the update to android 11, I experience that calls suddenly end. The time between the start of the call and the call suddenly ending can range from 2 minutes to half an hour. \n\nI tried restarting the phone.\nResetting cellular network settings. \nPlayed around with cellular settings. \nWifi on or off doesn't matter. \nI can not find a solution to the problem. Do you have any suggestions what to try to get the phone working properly again?\n\nPS network connection is good. I using the  T-Mobile NL network as a T mobile customer. \n\nRegards",
