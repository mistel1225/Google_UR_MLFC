    "content": "I've had my Pixel 3 since launch and 2 nights ago the screen started to flicker/flash constantly and the phone also seemed to be noticeably warm. I wasn't doing anything special at that time and no recent no apps, no case or screen protectors, etc.\nI saw a post that gave suggestions on how to fix screen issues so I :\nRestarted the phone. No improvement\nRestarted in safe mode. no improvement\nDid a factory reset.  No Improvement\nFrustrated, I then just powered it off and left it overnight planning on reverting to using my old Pixel 2\nThe next day, I powered the Pixel 3 back on just to see what happened and was surprised when it worked most of the day again but then in the evening rthe screen started having the same issues as the night before so I again powered it off and activated fi on my Pixel  2 instead.\n\nIs there something else I can try to resolve this, or how can I  go about getting this thing replaced? (assuming I can do that somehow under normal warrenty)\nThanks",
