    "content": "I've been using the music alarm feature of the Google clock app for several months now. It was great and would play whatever song I selected, plus continue with more music if it was an album or a single song selected. This was great as I would wake up in a better mood (mainly why I love the feature) and could wake up or keep resting with music if I didn't actually need to get up and do something productive that day or time. Recently it started switching after a few seconds from the song to the most annoying alarm sound. I'm on current software, the app is updated, I've cleared data on the app, uninstalled it, rebooted, reinstalled and the change still occurs. I've also tried switching back to sounds and then music again, changing the song, etc to no avail... If this is supposed to happen and it's working properly, the change is wack and leaves the option quite useless. Anybody else experiencing this or have any suggestions? Also for the record, I use YouTube music (with a subscription since the start of Google play music) which one would think would work near flawlessly with a well kept Google phone and current android software.",
