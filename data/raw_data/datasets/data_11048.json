    "content": "My Pixel 3 media volume stops/adjusts itself at random mid-use, and the volume controls popup randomly the right side of my screen, get \"stuck\", and block my apps. You have to close the app to clear it. This happens with or without headphones. Google support made it out like it was my issue and ran me through the motions. They had me take off my phone cover to make sure it wasn't that. We adjusted accessibility settings, Bluetooth, etc. Then we tried safe mode and the problem WORSENED in safe mode. It is definitely not a third party app. After I did my own search, I see similar volume issues are known problems with Pixels but is dismissed or ignored by Google. There are plenty of message boards with folks who say a factory reset or device replacement is pointless because the issue eventually recurs. For me, this all started after the last security update on 11/5. I never had problem before.This is clearly a Google software issue and I'm shocked to see years of complaints about this same issue or similar with no fix or acknowledgememt from Google. Extremely disappointing.",
