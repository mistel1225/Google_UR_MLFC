    "content": "To clarify, when you swipe up once on pixel 3a it brings up the google search bar and 5 random apps for me. When i swipe again it shows all my apps, but the top 5 are separated by a thin line going across. I would like to be able to pick which 5 apps i want there because i'd like to put in some frequently used apps there instead of what is randomly there. I tried holing the app, long press, etc. but can't seem to rearrange it. I think somehow i accidentally moved some there but no idea how. If anyone can help, i'd really appreciate it!  Thanks in advance.",
