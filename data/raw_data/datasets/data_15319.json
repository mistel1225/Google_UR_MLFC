    "content": "I have had my Google Pixel 4 XL replaced twice for dying out and it's not even a year old. \n\nThe phone is coming to its warranty end in December 2020 and I know this will happen a 3rd time as there are many reviews in person and online about how this phone constantly stops working and needs to be replaced.\nI want to change this model or get a refund as I refuse to be hookwinked and have this happen to me  3rd time but it not be under warranty then.\n\nThere is no way to contact any support at Google chat or phone. Everything seems to be shut down.",
