    "content": "I have had my Pixel 3a XL for nearly a month. From day one, it connected to my Bose SoundTouch 30 and I have been doing this every day, until yesterday. It will no longer connect via Bluetooth. My IPad connects fine, my old Samsung phone connects fine and my partners Samsung connects fine, but my Pixel no longer recognises the SoundTouch. I have cleared out the Bluetooth cache, but still no joy. When I go to Bluetooth and choose pair new device, it just shows ‘available devices’ with a spinning blue circle, but never finds the Bose SoundTouch, whereas on all my other divides, it finds the Bose Soundtouch straight away. Please can somebody out there help, as I am getting so frustrated. Thankyou.",
