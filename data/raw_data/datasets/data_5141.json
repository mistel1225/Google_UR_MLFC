    "content": "I'm missing the options to enable VoLTE and wifi calls in my setting. I already contacted my carrier to confirm that both services are enabled for my sim and I have also received confirmation messages. They said there are no restrictions related to phone model or manufacturer. Also I can enable both options when my sim card is inside Xiaomi phone.\nHow can I make the settings to be visible also on my Pixel 4 phone? (My network provider is T-Mobile Poland)",
