    "content": "With this new update I am no longer able to easily switch between my bluetooth headphones and my phone speaker when audio is playing on instagram or some other app like that. Just now I am trying to watch a video through I have on my google drive. My headphones are in the other room. Before I could just go into the sound menu and select my phone speaker. Now there is no option. There is no quick menu up top. Nothing. I can only switch my audio output when I have tidal open in the background.\nWhat gives? This is not convenient or useful.\nIs there anyway to switch my audio output without having to go through an app like spotify or tidals quick menu?\n\nThank you",
