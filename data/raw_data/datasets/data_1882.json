    "content": "So, i upgraded from android 11 to android 12 beta. Left to charge overnight and in the morning couldn't get past pin (i enter correct pin but it does nothing - goes back to asking pin). After that I went to recovery and did factory reset. Went to welcome screen, asked me pin again and when i entered correct pin it just goes back one step (asks me for copying my data from other phone), under the pin option there is use google account, and when i press that it just goes back one step again like with the pin. I tried using android flash tool and pixel repair tool. Android flash tool sees the pixel 5 but says connection error (OEM unlocking is disabled) so im guessing that's the problem, and pixel repair tool doesn't get past carrier selection (bought thru googlestore.de unlocked) I checked other as well as all carriers one by one. It says wrong carrier), e sim is activated inside from Croatian T Mobile. Don't know what else to try?",
