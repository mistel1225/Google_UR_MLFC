    "title": "Pixel 3a. Cannot see actual photo when transferring to PC. I only see the thumbnail in camera file?",
    "content": "I'm trying to move photos from my phone to pc. The photos are all transferring fine when I plug usb in then select pixel 3a, internal shared storage, DCIM, and camara. However on the camera screen where you can view all the photos on the camera roll it only shows the generic thumbnail. I can't actually see the photo. I contacted Microsoft Windows 10 customer support and they informed me that its a setting issue with my phone. My old motorola phone would display the actual photo image so I could then copy section of my camera roll and place them into folders without having to open up each individual photo to find out where I was in the camera roll. Can someone please assist me with this?",
