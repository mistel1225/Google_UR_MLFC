    "content": "Hello\nI accidentally dismissed immediately after activation the 3 months trial of Google one with additional sale for next 6 months after the trial period (something like 50 % off for the first 6 months).\n\nI couldn't find the option to directly contact support via chat/mail because I am currently using the device in other country where is The Pixel not officially sold.\n\nIs there some way to redeem the offer for the first activation (3 months free trial + sale 50 % off for next 6 months)?\n\nThank you very much for response.",
