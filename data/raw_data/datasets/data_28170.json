    "title": "The awful autonomy of the Google Pixel 3",
    "content": "I immediately upgraded my recently purchased smartphone to Android 10. As a result, 4 hours of screen time for me and my friends with Pixel 3. I think that it’s a complete disgrace to ask for “flagship” that works 4 hours in instant messengers for 500 or 800 dollars (and more) is unfair. I put it on charge THREE times per day. Please dont ask me to reset the device to factory settings, clear the application cache. I turned off all the unnecessary features, including the AOD and various autoloads and still get 4 hours of battery life. When I dont use my smartphone it discharges incredibly quickly - 34% in 15 hours.\n\n\n\nThis is one of the worst phones I've used.",
