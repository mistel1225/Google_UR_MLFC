    "content": "I've written Google twice about my Pixel 3 XL's which, according to both Canada Post's app and their website, have been \"processed\" in Montreal just before midnight, Feb 13th. Since Canada Post says only that the package has been processed, I hoped, having a little more clout as an important client, Google might put some pressure on someone to actually locate and deliver my order.  Today, I've  complained and asked for Google's help for the second time--they didn't bother to reply to my first request--and I'm guessing I'll need a lawyer to start some sort of action against Google for either the delivery of my phones or the refund of my money.  In short, the words customer  service are a bad joke where Google is concerned.\n\nI'd love to hear I'm wrong and if I just try (fill in the blanks) I'll get my phones or my $2200.",
