    "content": "I have spoken to EE support, they have no idea about issue. I have checked apps. When the alarm sounds there is no associated app, it just keeps going.. beep beep beep, very loud. Only way to stop the alarm is to power off and on again. \n\nAny ideas would be appreciated. I am currently using my daughter's old iPhone, that is how bad this issue has become.",
