    "content": "Whenever I am put on hold in a call I never have the option to start Hold for me. I'm in the US, on a Pixel 5, on Google Fi, with fully updated Android and phone app, and have hold for me enabled in the phone settings. Is there a second place the feature needs to be enabled, do I need to be on 5G and not on wifi, or is this just a bug?",
