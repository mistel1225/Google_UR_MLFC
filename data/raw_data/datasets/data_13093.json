    "content": "Custom wallpapers cannot be changed in Mi Band through Mi fit app. In mi fit app, when clicking the \"custom background\" and selecting any image,  error pops up and says \"Editing is not supported for this image\". It used to work on my old phone (non pixel) android 10. Even my friend has the same problem in his pixel 4a and mi band 5. I have mi band 4. I think the problem is Android 11.\nhttps://community.fitbit.com/t5/Android-App/quot-Editing-not-supported-for-this-photo-quot-error/td-p/4503810\nIn this post, these people have similar problems and all have a pixel device.",
