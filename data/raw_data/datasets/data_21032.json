    "content": "Hi, I am wondering if all apps on the Pixel 3 are supported on the pixel 3a? There is a particular health app I need to use which I know works on the the pixel 3 but it does not state itâ€™s compatible on the 3a. I would like to be sure before I purchase the 3a which I want to buy. Kind regards\nLiam",
