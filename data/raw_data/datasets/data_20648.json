    "title": "WARNING: Pixel 2 XL Not Charging/Reboot Loop NO GOOGLE SUPPORT",
    "content": "My Pixel 2 XL had no issues and no warning signs of charging problems when it suddenly would not charge. I suspected it was simply a dirty charging port so I gently cleaned out some lint with a plastic pick. That did not help and it still would not charge. The phone, now dead, only shows the battery with the lightning bolt when it is plugged in, followed by an empty battery. This loops continuously every 12 seconds when plugged in. I did a factory reset using some guidance from google support and when that did not work they told me they could not help me as the phone just passed 2 years from purchase. I am pretty disappointed considering Apple fixed my iPhone 6 when it had a hardware issue 4 years after its purchase. I will be switching back to Apple as Google support was no help for a phone that was very expensive, not abused, and barely over 2 years of use.",
