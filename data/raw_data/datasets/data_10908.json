    "content": "I'm looking for a way to adjust the time between ringtone playback.  On my Pixel 1 there was an approximately 1 sec delay between the playback of the ringtone files but on the new Pixel 5 there is no delay and it plays back the file immediately.  Yes I do know I can adjust the file in audacity or some other sound editing program to achieve the same result I was just looking for a more elegant solution.  Thanks!",
