    "content": "Two months ago I sent my phone in for repair because I had a black spot on the screen that was a manufacture issue and was under warranty as the phone was only a few months old. I asked for a new one. I was without a phone for two weeks. Then the factory sent me back a different refurbished phone. Now the focus on the rear-facing camera will not focus. I tried all the suggested solutions and nothing has made any difference. Now what? Pixel 3 is supposed to be known to have a great camera.",
