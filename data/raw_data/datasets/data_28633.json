    "content": "Hello,\n\nI wanted some really good mobile phone with dual SIMs, so I have decided to buy Pixel 3, becouse it has SIM + e-SIM. BUT. It doesn´t work together. I can use only SIM or only e-SIM. If I have turned on SIM I can accept recieving calls, but I can´t call them back from e-SIM number and also I dont reciveve SMS and can not send them. Why is that so?\n\nMy 5 years old huawei could do that and new phone for aprox. 850 dollars can not? Or I´m just stupid and can not figure out how to set settings. \n\nIs there any chance of apliacation or new upgrade of Android which will make working both SIM cards together?\n\nThank you.\nBest,\nVladislav",
