    "content": "Pixel 5, just received today.\nTouch/Tap feedback sound regularly fades to a muffled noise. After up to a dozen touches/taps the noise improves with each touch/tap until it sounds normal again. I don't feel a difference in haptic vibration strength or frequency, the problem seems confined to the sound feedback. Very annoying with a brand new phone. \nFix available? \nRequest warranty replacement?",
