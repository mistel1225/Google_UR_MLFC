    "content": "Tried factory reset, and update to Q, but nothing. The mic works sometimes partly, then again not. Clearly an issue with the device / software which is internal. Will try with Lineage OS to check if it is hardware issue.\n\nOh, safe mode ON and screen locks all the time and screen flickers, nice.\n\nWorst phone I have ever seen and will use Huawei or iPhone now on.\n\nHow can pure OS be so bad at handling stuff? WTF.",
