    "content": "Since updating the Android 11, my Pixel 4 has begun to regularly crash - the screen freezes in any and all apps, sometimes has a glitched effect across the screen - until I either hold down the power button to restart or it restarts itself. This has been happening more and more since the 11 update.",
