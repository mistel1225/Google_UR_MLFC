    "content": "I have followed the instructions about connecting my phone to my PC and selected File Transfer. My Win 10 PC recognises the phone as a Google Android device, but it will not show up in the File Manager, so I cannot transfer any files. My Win 10 is on version 2004 and my phone is using Android 10.\n\nThe cable I am using worked for transfer with my previous phone, a Moto G.\n\nAny advice?",
