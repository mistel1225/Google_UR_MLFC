    "content": "I was using a Pixel 3 and decided to perform a factory reset to give it to my son.  During the setup process after resetting, I am stuck on the PIN/Account verification.  My known good PIN isn't working so I use a google account instead.  I get through the 2FA, then am presented with another Email Account Verification screen.  This time, it just needs my email and PW, then I get an error page that says \"Something went wrong\" \"Sorry, something when wrong there.  Try again\".  Needless to say, I've tried again a number of times without success.\n\nI've also tried other google accounts that were previously on that phone.  I've also gone into my Google Account and signed out from that device.  \n\nShort of rooting it, how can I get in!?!?",
