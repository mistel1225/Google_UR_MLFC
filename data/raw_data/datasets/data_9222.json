    "content": "There is no way to copy photos to clipboard for posting multiple photos within one instagram story. I have watched tutorials for both android and iOS, works for samsung and iphone but no way to do this on pixel. It is not an instagram problem as many other responses have suggested it is a pixel problem that this functionality does not exist.",
