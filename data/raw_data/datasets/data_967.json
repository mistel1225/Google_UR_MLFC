    "content": "We have a pixel 3a with an odd problem. We can open the settings menu and view the list of categories but you can't scroll the list and you can't choose anything. Tap the screen and nothing happens. So we can't connect to wifi or bluetooth.  We also can't transfer files from the phone to the pc because the menu from which you have to choose the file transfer option refuses to respond to any screen tap.  The touch screen works fine with all apps. The problems seem to only occur with the operating system settings and options.\n\nIt acts as if the touch screen has been disabled.",
