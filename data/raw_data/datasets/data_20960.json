    "content": "I need google customer service email to deal with my battery issue on my pixel 3 phone.\nUnfortunately my Pixel 3 purchased on December 2018 can't remain on for more than 5 minutes which makes it impossible to get support by google assistant. \nAfter doing all troubleshooting and factory reset, it did not improve at all. I need to figure out next steps and discuss my warranty status.\nIt is really frustrating to have a very expense brick at my house at this moment and see that customer support does not acknowledge the fact that are lots of users experiencing the same problem.",
