    "content": "I have a high quality brand new usb-c cable for my car.  Using pixel 5.  I will plug in the phone, turn on android auto.  Within minutes it will say Phone disconnected, retry, disconnect, retry, in a constant loop. unplug the phone.  Plus it back in, android auto won't connect at all.  reboot phone plug back in runs for a few minutes jumps right back into reboot loop.  This happened to my pixel 3 xl about 2 months ago to the point it was unusuable.  I have changed usb c cables multiple times.  I cleaned the usb port.  I have tried reseting the head unit in my car.  Nothing works.  Its really frustrating.",
