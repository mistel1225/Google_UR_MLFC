    "content": "Any advice regarding this would be appreciated. I bought a pixel 2 xl phone off ebay. Uk Version. It was described as 'new' and I found the seal intact and it looks like a brand new device never used. \nMy issue is while I have been able to download and update all my apps. I was hoping the system would update to android 10 at least. But it's stuck at Android 8.0.0 with last security update Sept 5 2017. \nI know the regular updates have ended for the device but surely the device should update to the last supported update?. There is also no area to manually do a software check or update in the settings.\nGoogle support were no help unfortunately and directed me to updates page. Any advice would be appreciated.",
