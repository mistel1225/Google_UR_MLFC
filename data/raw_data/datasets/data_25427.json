    "content": "When I navigate to:\nDisplay, Advanced, Screen Saver, Clock, Digital/ Start Now\nand click \"Start Now\"\nI am shown a clock with a LARGE font.\n\nHowever when the screen saver activates on its own, the time is only a MEDIUM font.\nIf music is playing, the time on the screen saver is shown as a SMALL font.\n\nWhy is the size different in each case?\nIf Google wants to give people a choice of the clock size, then give us a choice and use that size consistently. But changing the size in different situations is confusing. I prefer the largest size shown with the \"start now\" option.",
