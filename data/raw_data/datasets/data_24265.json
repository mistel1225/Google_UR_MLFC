    "content": "The own unlock was greyed out by Verizon, after I got a replacement from the insurance company. Now I am pretty sure it's a Google device due to the ota image it takes being not the one that says Verizon under it. I have in put all kinds of code and messed with settings until now the toggle is no longer greyed out. But it still will not allow me to turn it on???",
