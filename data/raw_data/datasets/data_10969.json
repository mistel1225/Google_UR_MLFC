    "content": "Hi,\n\nPicked up a pixel 5 recently. I have been experiencing the same touchscreen sensitivity issues as others where the edges of the screen don't register inputs well. This is best observed when typing.\n\nAdditionally though, I find that most times I scroll down I get this ghost input going back up in the opposite direction. I attached a video below of it happening. This might be down to the way I position my fingers when scrolling but it seems like the display is picking up my finger just as I lift off the display as an additional scroll.\n\n\n\nI have never had these issue with another phone. Been using a pixel 2, iPhone SE, and pixel 3 before this.\n\nI'm wondering if anyone else has had this scroll issue. I haven't been able to find any other posts like this.",
