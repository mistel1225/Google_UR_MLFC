    "content": "Long press on increase volume with headset in triggers Google Assistant for notifications. I just want to hold the increase volume to. . . Increase volume. I don't have this issue with decrease volume. I've looked everywhere in terms of notifications settings and there isn't a place I can alter how I use the volume buttons. I don't necessarily want my assistant to be deactivated with headset in, but I also want to be able to hear what's being said without having to click the increase volume twenty times in my ear.",
