    "content": "When someone sends me a text longer than 160 characters it gets broken up into multiple messages. Normally they all come through (sometimes jumbled up) but now I am just getting parts of the message and not the complete message. I have restarted phone, I have tried downloading a different messages app, I have also gotten a new SIM card from AT&T. Any thoughts?",
