    "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nJust got a Google Pixel 3! When I go on my apps, the screen is completely inverted. I have this issue with pretty much all of them (FB, IG, whatsapp, etc..) Does that come from the apps or the phone? Did someone experience that before? Is there a way to fix it?\n\nThank you!",
