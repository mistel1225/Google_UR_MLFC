    "content": "Hi,\n\nI am writing to check on the available options for fixing a Google Pixel 5 that I have purchased from Amazon on December 2020.\n\nIssue: There is an approximately 1*0.2cm dead pixel region around the proximity sensor region of the phone.\n\nWhat I have attempted so far:\nFollowed the steps and attempted troubleshooting based on the instructions from this page: Fix a Pixel screen that doesn't work right\nContacted my local (Singapore) repair partner - CTDi. They have responded saying that they are currently unable to offer support for Pixel 5 and recommended that I contact Google Support for an alternative solution.\n\nQuestion: What are the available options available to me in resolving this issue?\n\nThank you!",
