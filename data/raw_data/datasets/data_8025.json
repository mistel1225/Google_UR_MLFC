    "content": "I've tried to reset my Bluetooth on Reset options and it does not reset. While resetting it says please wait a moment, but I've waited more than 10 min without my phone restarting by itself so did it myself. What I don't understand is that it does restart my Wi-fi setting (I need to put the password again) but not the bluetooth.",
