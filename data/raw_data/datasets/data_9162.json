    "content": "When I connect a Bluetooth headset to my Pixel 5, the phone continues to use its internal microphone rather than the mic on the headset. Tried three different headphones. Tried resetting \"Wi-Fi, mobile and Bluetooth\", but no change. Restarted phone. Phone software and all apps up to date.\n\nSuggestions?",
