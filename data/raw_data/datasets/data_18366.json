    "content": "My wife's Pixel 3 has terrible reception and calls are getting dropped after a min or two. Unrelated, i think, the date and time keeps on showing the incorrect information. i have reset it several times, but it keeps on showing the wrong information. I have the exact same phone, with none of these issues. our service provider is Verizon and this had been occurring for about a week. TIA",
