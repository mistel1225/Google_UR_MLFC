    "content": "I received my Pixel 5 yesterday and have been unable to establish network connectivity with at&t. I removed the SIM from my Pixel 2 when prompted and inserted it into my Pixel 5. After completing setup and still not seeing the network connect, I called at&t.\n\nThey updated the IMEI, transferred my SIM number to my Pixel 5 and also set me up on a new 5G plan. I'm wondering if I should perform a factory reset and reconfigure my Pixel 5? The reason I'm thinking this is now that all of the updates have been made on the at&t side maybe this will work?  I'm awaiting an update from the at&t support team currently.\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated. I've searched for others having this issue and haven't been able to find any other reports.",
