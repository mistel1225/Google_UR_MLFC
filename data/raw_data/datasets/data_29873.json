    "title": "my built-in-system phone app on android crashes every time.",
    "content": "Started about three weeks ago (assuming with a software update) \nPixel XL\nGoogle Fi Plan\n\nThe built-in-system \"phone\" app crashes every time I try to access it.  I can't go in and make calls, see recent calls, access voice mail, or use the dial out pad.  I can, however, receive calls and make calls from text message app or contacts list.  \n\nFor the first week or so, I could resolve it by \"Force Stop\", or \"Clear Cache\" or \"Clear Storage\" .. for the past two weeks, I can't resolve it even with the 'recommended' solutions on Google Fi Support. \n\nI cannot uninstall the app because it's a system app.\n\nHELP Please.",
