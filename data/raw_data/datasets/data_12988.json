    "content": "Hi Folks, \n\nMy brand new Beyerdynamic DT 990 Pro Headphones are not working with my Pixel 5. I recently bought these headphones after reading the Beyerdynamic DT 990 Pro Headphones review; however, I did not find any compatibility-related issues mentioned in the post. I cannot hear anything; there's absolutely no audio in my headphones. Is it a compatibility issue? I'm not happy with my new purchase at the moment.",
