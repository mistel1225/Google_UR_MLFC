    "content": "I have a lot of difficulty connecting to the Bluetooth on my Pixel 4A (5G) phone. It appears to forget previous successful connections  and to reconnect, I am forced to remove the previous connection, shut down my phone completely and set up a new connection and sometimes this does not work. \nI appear to have a particular problem when connecting to my Fitbit app and the Fitbit sense watch.\nI am sure I have tried all the recommended fixes but problem persists. \nIs there a problem wire the PixelA4â€™s Bluetooth?\nThanks in advance.",
