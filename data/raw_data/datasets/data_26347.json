    "content": "\"This has been a problem for many folks for many months.... vertical swipes to answer or reject are bad for pockets. But also, it should recognize when the call comes in that the proximity sensor is activated and NOT EVEN TURN ON THE SCREEN.   THere is a design flaw + bug here and it's shameful that it has not been addressed.  It's curious that you have put all of this effort into spam identification and yet I'm directly answering spam calls while trying to take the ringing phone out of my pants. Come on guys!\"\n I am reposting this from user \"CPngN\". He/she described exactly the problems in Answer phone call screen design. Please fix this in your new version of Android. I am really loving my Pixel but this is really frustrating.",
