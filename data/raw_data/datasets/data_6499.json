    "content": "Since the android 11 update I've had a problem with my phone not auto-locking. I watch YouTube to fall asleep and my phone used to lock after the video had ended, but after I updated to 11 it would intermittently not lock. This used to be a huge problem on my pixel 2 because the battery life was so bad I would sometimes wake up with my phone having died overnight. I thought this was a pixel 2 problem but a few weeks ago I upgraded to a pixel 5 and its started happening again, but now it's every night. I have restarted my phone, disabled and re-enabled all the lock settings, and made sure smart lock is off but it's still happening. I don't know how useful a factory reset would even be since this is a brand new phone that has already been factory reset once (I screwed up the pixel transfer and had to reset it).",
