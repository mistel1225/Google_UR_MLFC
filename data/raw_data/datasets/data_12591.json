    "title": "Pixel 4 XL shuts down a few seconds after I start it, battery stuck at 50%",
    "content": "1. I bought my Pixel 4 XL on November 9, 2019 on the German Google Store.\n2. Around September 2020, I noticed that the battery indicator sometimes got stuck at 50%.\n3. By October 2020, the phone started shutting down unexpectedly.\n4. Now, if I power on my Pixel 4 XL the Google logo appears but after a few seconds the phone dies.\n5. If I firmly hold the bottom left and right corners while powering on the phone, I can get it to stay on until I reach the home screen. I need to apply a significant amount of pressure for this method to work though.\n\nI would like to get my phone repaired under warranty. Unfortunately, it seems that you cannot request phone or chat support for the Pixel right now, see:\n- https://support.google.com/pixelphone?p=pixel_call&hl=de-DE\n- https://support.google.com/pixelphone?p=pixel_chat&hl=de-DE\n\nHow can I place a repair request?",
