    "content": "I was using it one day to google something, put it down while it loaded the google search and when I picked it up again the screen had gone black and it no longer reacted to button presses.\n\nIt won't boot to the fast boot menu or anything like that, if I drain the battery it will flash a red light after I press the power button and if I hold the power and volume down buttons it will flash the red light a few times after about 20 seconds.\n\nWhen I connect it to a computer it shows up as a Qualcomm device.\n\nIs there anything I can do? Is it repairable by a proper repair facility?\n\nThanks.",
