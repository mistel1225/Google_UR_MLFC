    "content": "If I'm talking to someone on the phone, and my call waiting comes through and someone is ringing through on my other line, my current phone call mutes and the caller can no longer hear me. This is extremely frustrating because I have to hang up, and call again, which is unprofessional especially when making work calls. Is there anything I Can do about this?",
