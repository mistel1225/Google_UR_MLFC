    "title": "Pixel 3 Ringer volume turns down by itself",
    "content": "I keep my ringer at almost the maximum level and switch it to vibrate or silent when needed, but I never turn down the ringer volume. Occasionally though, my ringer volume will be turned almost all the way down to the point that I can't hear it. The phone apparently does this by itself but I can't figure out what triggers it... Has anyone else has this issue or know of a way to fix it?",
