    "title": "Official Pixel 4XL case quality is beyond par",
    "content": "I've received my Pixel 4XL and for the first time I've ordered an official (and very expensive) Google Case in blue.\n\nIf I pay â‚¬ 45 for a case, I must admit I'm expecting top quality and this isn't the quality I was expecting for this very high price.\n\nThe fabric on the back is not straight, but goes to the right. It really does not look very well and I want it to be replaced. But I don't want to use my phone without case, so that is an issue.\n\nFurthermore, it is a pain to contact support. In the support section of my phone, there is no phone of chat button and I'm writing this during business hours. Via the Google Store it is also almost impossible to find a contact form or something like that.\n\nShould this be the premium quality of a premium phone? And the premium support for that phone? It is disappointing.\n\nIs there somebody that can help me out?\n\nTim",
