    "content": "although my battery was at 36%, while taking a short time lapse video with my pixel 2 the phone announced the battery was dead and shut down. The video, which was a one-time opportunity, never appeared. there is, however an mp4 file in the phone internal storage directory called .pending-......mp4. of 16 megs, which I think is it, maybe, stuck in the processing stage. Is there a way to recover a playable mp4 file from the .pending file?  thanks",
