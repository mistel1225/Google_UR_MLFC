    "content": "Hello,\n\nPretty self-explanatory - my battery is expanding and separating the front and the back of my phone around the power/volume buttons. I have a Pixel 3XL and I'm in the US.\n\nI have gone through the endless loop of explaining the issue and reaching the \"Contact Us\" section only to find that the supposedly 24 hour chat is closed and that my only option is the community. I've also seen people mentioning this problem here and being told to contact Google directly... Which there is no way to do.\n\n I have followed all the methods given through tips & support in my phone settings, through the every area advised to contact. Every link leads to the same thing: no chat, no phone.\n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.",
