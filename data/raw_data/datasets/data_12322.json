    "content": "So I updated to android 11 last night as I'm sure most of you already have. Noticed my battery was getting fairly low alot quicker than normal. I'd say I'm normally around 60-65% by this time of the day (going on the phone every so often in between calls at work). However checking the battery usage today I get the screen below... Surely this isn't right? Only thing I can think of that has changed is I updated the OS last night. Is this a known issue? \n\nCheers ",
