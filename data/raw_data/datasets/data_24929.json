    "title": "Not receiving nor sending texts and calls",
    "content": "I got my pixel 4 XL about a few weeks ago, I'm quite shocked and disappointed to find this device has problems with one of the most simple functions of a phone, I consistently cannot send texts no matter what I do, I also can't receive texts or calls until I restart my device and everything I missed starts flooding in (apparently the calls just go straight to voicemail Everytime). I very much hope this is a software problem that can be fixed and not a hardware problem, I am a college student and have a job that requires clients that stay in touch with me, I can't be a position where no one can get a hold of me this is a very significant problem",
