    "content": "After updating to the march (2019) security patch update my pixel phones mic stopped working so I restarted it and it got stuck in bootloop, i tried everything and finally sent it for repair (India) they told me that it would cost me Rs.21635 (around 300 usd) as the motherboard needs to be changed.\ninstead of accepting that they used faulty cheap motherboards in the flagship phone they saying they don,t have any responsibility they are charging so much much for repairing the motherboard and the worst thing is they are not even able to tell why their motherboard died in the first place. we at least deserve an answer.\nthis was not expected for a 900 usd phone. google man up and own your responsibilities of the products you make. worst experience ever. tell us properly how come so many motherboard are getting defected.",
