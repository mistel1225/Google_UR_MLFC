    "content": "My pixel 2 xl suddenly stopped charging using the original charger. I tried to charge the phone with another c-type charger of the nexus5x phone. Then it restarted and started charging. I tried the original charger again, but it's not charging so far. If I use the nexus charger, it repeats the same process- restarts and starts charging. What is the issue in here? Please do support. And I tried cleaning the USB C port but no luck. Moreover, the battery is draining fast as well. \n\nYes, I checked the possible online solution. Didn't work.",
