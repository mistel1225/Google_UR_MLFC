    "content": "Hi,\n\nMy Pixel 3's battery died while I was using it. I charged it using the original charger, in a wall socket, as I've done for the past couple years. I left it to charge for an hour or so but when I tried to switch it on, there was no response. I couldn't even boot it into fast mode.\nThe only way I could get it to switch on is to use a third-party charger but as soon as I remove the charger, the phone goes off.\nIf I power off the phone while this charger is in, it boots itself up again as if the power button is being held down. \nIf I use the original charger, the phone does not work; it'll flash the 'battery with a lightning bolt' symbol repeatedly and if I try to switch it on, the Google logo appears but then it crashes. \nIf no charger is in, there is absolutely no response from the phone. \nI tried booting the phone into safe mode but this the problem still persists. \n\nCurrently, the only why I can use my Pixel 3 is to have it on charge using the third-party charger. It works exactly as it used to but it's really taking the 'mobile' part out of mobile phone.\n\nAny idea how I can resolve this?",
