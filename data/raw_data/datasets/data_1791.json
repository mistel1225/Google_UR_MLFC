    "content": "My Google Pixel 2 randomly shut off and refuses to turn back on. it shows any kind of icon only when it is plugged in. It has been plugged in for 2 hours now, and nothing has changed. When plugged in, a red light appears and stays constant while the charging symbol comes on for 3 seconds then turns off for 5. When holding the power button, the google logo appears for 3 seconds then sort of glitches out and comes off. I've tried holding the power and volume down button for 30 seconds and when the android robot appears and I try to reset the phone it goes to black and continues with the solid red dot and the flashing charging symbol.",
