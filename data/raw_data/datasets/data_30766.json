    "content": "I have had Mobile Data turned off for months on my phone. My carrier is still detecting data usage (4-32 KB a month) and I am being charged for it. I even went through, app by app, and restricted background data. When I go to the mobile data usage screen in settings, it's reporting 0 bytes used, but my carrier is reporting me using some, as described above. \n\nIs there anything else I can do to ensure exactly 0 bytes of mobile data will be sent/received from my phone?",
