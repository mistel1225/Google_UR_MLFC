    "content": "My phone shuts down randomly and gets restarted repeatedly on it's own. I tried the factory reset option twice but still the problem persists. My device heats up fast when I use it for a while and gets shut down on it's own and restarts for about thrice or may be more times automatically. But when the device is connected to the charger there's no such problem.",
