    "content": "I sent my Pixel 4XL into the Google Repair Center for a warranty issue. As expected, I received the phone back within a week. I expected the phone to be repaired. \n\nInstead, the phone now has a deep scratch in the display AND is missing the sim card tray. Without the tray, it is unusable. \n\nI've been dealing with the support team for 4 days now. They keep telling me \"it is escalated,\" but they will not give me any eta or idea of when I will get my phone fixed. I have my phone with me still. \n\nGOOGLE NEEDS TO FIX THIS. I NEED A WORKING PHONE. It was GOOGLE'S repair center that messed up. This needs to be fixed.",
