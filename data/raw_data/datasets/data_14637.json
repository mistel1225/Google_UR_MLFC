    "content": "I have contacted customer service twice regarding an in warranty replacement...Case ID are 3-6195000030445 and 9-8143000030471. Each time I have been told after being on hold and in conversation each time for more that 30 to 40 min, that they cannot do an advanced exchange. We have to send the defective phone back and then they will send a replacement to us which can take up to 5 to 10 business day for the whole process. This is the only phone that we have and currently due to covid and working from home, its the only phone used for official business calls. My sister works for the VA and they are in constant contact with dr. offices to process claims for our VA. Not having this phone for 5 to 10 business day is not acceptable since that is her source of income. She is also disabled herself therefore I have been taking care of this issue for her. Expecting her to be without a phone is not only going to cost her job but in case of an emergency she will also not have any way to call 911. This is the worst customer service that I have ever experienced in my life. We will definitely never buy a google product again.",
