    "content": "Trying to do something very simple: download a file (such as a picture from an email, or the internet) and have it show up in \"Gallery Go\" (so that it can be uploaded to Instagram, etc.). The files go to a \"Downloads\" folder; this would be fine, except when using the Google Files app, there is no way to move or copy the files into the Images folder or any other folder on the phone besides Google Drive. Is there a fix for this?",
