    "content": "I have a Pixel 3 and just bought a Samsung Galaxy Watch Active 2. I wanted better performance than Wear OS, and I knew there might be a few things that wouldnâ€™t work well on a non-Samsung phone. I have been able to work around a few issues, but the two big remaining problems are email and messaging. Neither app is installed on the watch, but you are supposed to be able to see notifications for texts and emails on the watch and respond. I have intermittently received texts and emails, so I know it can work, but most texts and emails do not come through on the watch. If anyone has a Pixel and a Samsung watch and knows how to get these to work consistently I would appreciate some advice. Otherwise I will return the Active 2 and reluctantly get a Wear OS watch.",
