    "content": "I have reset the app settings, rebooted device, rebooted it to safe mode, updated it to the latest version, tried turning on and off various shh / do not disturb functions incase it triggered something. All haven't worked. I'm stumped on what to try next. Tried to do a Christmas call on WhatsApp tonight with my family in Australia and the speaker phone doesn't work where either. When I look at volumes settings it's weird as it does the music icon as off, then when I click on it, it mutes it then returns it back on. But still doesn't work. See screenshots.",
