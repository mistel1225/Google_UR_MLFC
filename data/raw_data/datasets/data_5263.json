    "title": "Cannot Enable WiFi Calling on Pixel 4XL",
    "content": "I recently switched my mobile service from Google Fi to Spectrum Mobile (Verizon) on my unlocked Google Pixel 4XL (purchased from Google Fi).  My phone is on Android 11 and fully up-to-date.\n\nMy new provider supports WiFi calling and according to their support person, my account should be setup to use it.  However, when I try to enable WiFi calling, I'm prompted with a message that says, \"This will take a few moments\" and eventually a pop-up says, \"Unable to activate Wi-Fi calling.  Please try again later.\"  I've tried later several times and it makes no difference.\n\nIs there anyway to troubleshoot this issue?  Could there by something on my home WiFi network that is blocking the activation (like my router)?",
