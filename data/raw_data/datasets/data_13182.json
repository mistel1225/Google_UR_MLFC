    "content": "SO I took my Pixel 2 XL with me on 4-day hiking trip with no signal and, well, 2020 happened.  After the trip, in my exhaustion, I accidentally left my phone on the roof of the car and as we drove off it fell and was lying in the road for a few minutes until I realized it was missing.  When we circled back, it had been run over, mostly smashed and pretty bad road rash.  I was pretty shocked, embarrassed and saddened by this mistake.\n\nWhen I found it, the motherboard and all main components were smashed, the battery and screen were gone.  However, per the hardware diagram, the flash storage chip on the mother board actually appear to be intact and good condition as well as the DRAM chip and some other components.\n\nI'm wondering if the flash storage chip could be removed and my data recovered through a chip reader or by placing into another device.\n\nI recorded A LOT of video and pictures I'd planned to document the journey on the BMT but since we were out of signal most of the time and to save battery I remained in airplane mode.  Because of this NONE of the hundreds of photos and videos were synced to the cloud.  \n\nI'm willing to try anything reasonable to recover this lost footage from a once in a lifetime trip.  I understand it is likely encrypted as well which will add to the complexity of recovery.\n\nEven still, are there any Google recommended recovery services for something like this?  I have seen some flash memory recovery services, but none specifically state anything about Pixel 2.\n\nLooking for any hope of a possible solution to saving this data.\n\nSincerely,\nJamie",
