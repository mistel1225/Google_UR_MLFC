    "content": "On Monday after installing the January 2020 update, my battery life went from over a full day on a charge to maybe 6 hours. The biggest culprit was the Google Play Music app. Things got way better when I disabled that app, but my battery consumption in all apps is still noticeably more than it was two days ago. Any advice on what to do about this?",
