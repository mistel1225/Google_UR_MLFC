    "content": "I have two original Pixels that use the Dormi app (in parent mode) without any issue at all.\n\nI have two Pixel 4 phones that both randomly shut themselves off when using the same app.\n\nI was hoping the Jan 2020 updates would fix the issue but they have not. I don't think there is much point to resetting the phone and such measures when I have two phones with exactly the same behavior.",
