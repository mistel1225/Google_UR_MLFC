    "content": "The front camera distorts selfies squishing the photo once it's processed. It's awful. I look like an even fatter cow in the processed picture. I've looked online and apparently this is a common issue among pixel 3 users. The front camera is basically useless and takes terrible photos. I really wanted to love this phone, but this issue makes me want to switch to a different phone  Please fix your software. Has anyone figured out how to fix this issue??",
