    "content": "I just figured out why none of my apps would record audio on my Pixel 5 running Android 11.\nSomehow I had muted the mic in the phone app and it had muted the mic for all the other apps?\nTook me forever to figure this out - thought I was going to have to return the phone...\nI only figure out when I went to phone someone to test the mic in the phone app and they couldn't hear me there either. I noticed the mic was muted, unmuted it, and it worked everywhere else again.",
