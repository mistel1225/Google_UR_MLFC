    "content": "Recently my 4XL has started splitting my response to a group text (sometimes 8-10 people) and instead of my phone now storing the response, it stores my response and 8-10 more responses of exactly the same and those I am chatting with think I sent only to them and not the group!  UGH!  This is defeating the purpose of a group text!  WHAT IS GOING ON? anyone know???????",
