    "content": "I started to have issues all of a sudden with my Pixel 2. I didn't drop it or anything.\n\nHere's a description of the symptoms that I'm seeing:\nThe phone is very unresponsive\nThere is a delay of more than 5s when I type\nApps are slow to open\nScrolling in apps also takes a lot of time\nOccasionally when I lock/unlock the screen, I'm seeing a static screen for a few seconds\n\nI have started the phone in safe mode and have done a factory reset as well, but that hasn't fixed the problems.\n\nIt's worth noting that I saw these issues in the morning, and then my phone seemed to work fine in the afternoon, but I then saw the issues again in the evening, so I'm not sure what's going on. At first I thought it could be related to how charged the battery is. That doesn't seem to be the case though, as I'm seeing these issues when the battery is fully charged as well as when it's half-charged.\n\nI tried contacting my carrier and they're trying to get me to upgrade, however this is is not something that I want to do. This was a premium phone at the time, and I think it should easily last 5-6 years if not longer for basic usage.\n\nIf somebody knows a solution that I can try myself, I'd appreciate it if you could share. If not, I would also appreciate it if you could advise me on how I should go about fixing this issue (i.e. should I take it to a local repair shop? Can Google help me with this?).",
