    "content": "My spouse and I both have Pixel 3A unlocked on Verizon.  We bought them about 4 months ago and WIFI calling worked great until about 2 to 3 weeks ago.  Mine is on Android 10 hers is on 9.  I thought the update was the issue not so as hers is also broke. Been reading through the forums and removed Verizon app, cleared storage in native phone app, safe mode, airplane mode, different wifi and still have the issue.  I would factory default but don't think it will fix it, any other ideas?",
