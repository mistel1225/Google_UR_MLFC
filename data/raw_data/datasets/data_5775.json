    "content": "T mobile says that the Google pixel 3xl cannot connect to it's TNX line of sim cards.  When I was in san Diego on the sprint network.  I would get speeds upwards of 50-60 MBPS.  Once T-Mobile took over I only get 7 mbps out here in north texas.  Can y'all cray a code or create an update so I can be on the T-Mobile TNX sim card upgrade?",
