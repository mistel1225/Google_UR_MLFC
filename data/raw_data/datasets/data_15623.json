    "content": "So I have sent back a refurbished pixel 3xl to google after it broke after three months ( the 2nd one now!)The volume buttons stopped working and the power button also stopped working. It been with google for 2 weeks now and they have told me that they donâ€™t have any more refurbished stock to send back to me. Customer support canâ€™t even give me an estimate to when I will get another phone!?\nHas anyone else been told the same thing?\nI think this might have swayed me to go to another manufacturer! ðŸ˜©",
