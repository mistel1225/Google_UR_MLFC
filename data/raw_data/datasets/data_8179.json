    "content": "I woke up this morning to no recent photos and videos on my phone. I have read other posts and it seems to be related with doing an update. In the update, the Google phone deletes all photos and videos that are not backed up on the cloud and on phone storage, which is stupid. Google has had this issue for over a year but customer rep said she did not know about it and was no help at all. \nDo you know what to do to recover photos and videos?",
