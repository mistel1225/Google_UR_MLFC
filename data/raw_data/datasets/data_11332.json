    "content": "Just like I've now typed through each of the help options, my pretty much brand new Pixel 4a won't stay connected to the BlueTooth on my care - a VW Golf.\n\nConnects just fine. \nPlays media just fine.\nDrops connection every 10 minutes or so.\n\nSurely!!!!\n\nLooks like this is related to the Android 11 problem, though I'm pretty sure it was pre-installed on my phone - build PR1a.201105.002.\n\nJust using BT to connect Audible and music. NOT Android Auto\n\nAny fixes?",
