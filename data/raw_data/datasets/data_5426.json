    "content": "I have a Samsung 6 Series 55 TV and the Google Pixel 4a. And I'm perfectly able to cast videos from the youtube app with no problems at all. But I want to cast my other apps to the TV through screen mirroring. But when I go to my settings to enable casting, my TV won't show up. But it still shows up through youtube. So how can I get around this? Is there something I'm overlooking? Or is there at least a mirroring app that get around it, preferably free or even a mod app? Or do I absolutely need to own one of those ChromeCasts? Thanks in advance guys!",
