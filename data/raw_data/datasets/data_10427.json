    "content": "Not sure if there is a suggestions section here, so apologies if this doesn't belong here.\n\nI  love the \"Now Playing\" feature. However, I wish it could be controlled a little.\n\nFor example:\nWhat I would like this feature to have is to allow the track+artist text to scroll at the bottom of the screen (ticker-tape stylee) as rarely there is text there that fits without having to cut it off short at the end. Would also be great to see the year the track was released too.\n\nBetter still would be a config screen to select which info you want to see get displayed, but now I'm being greedy! \n\nFor what it's worth, I've made the suggestion to Goggle (via Feedback in the About Phone screen)\nNot sure if this will get noticed at all, but if there is anyone on here who would also like to see this, then it may be worth sending some feedback too. Who knows?!! :)",
