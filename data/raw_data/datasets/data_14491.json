    "content": "There is no way to use fingerprints throughout the phone for things like financial apps but still require a PIN to unlock the phone. Once the fingerprints are enabled, the phone is unlockable with them. I want the extra security of only using a PIN to unlock but still want the convenience of using fingerprints to unlock my banking apps once the phone is unlocked. Samsung phones have this ability and it's a huge oversight for Google to not.",
