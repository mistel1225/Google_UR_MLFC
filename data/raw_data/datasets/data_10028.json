    "content": "Ever since Android 11, my phone can be sitting on the table with nothing around it and youtube music will just unpauses and continue playing whatever I had on before. It happens randomly while I'm using the phone as well. Really annoying and troublesome especially in public if I'm in a quiet place.",
