    "title": "Are old chargers ok to use?",
    "content": "I see the Google Store has chargers (18W and 45W) for purchasing extra chargers. I always wonder if I have ruined batteries on old phones by using random chargers/charging bricks.  \n\nIs it safe to use old chargers from other phones that are USB C still?  Is there a such thing as a \"USB C\" cable that shouldn't be used, or are all cables safe?  I know some can be .5A input / 3A output bricks, some are 1A input/3A output, etc.  What old chargers are safe to use without buying a new $65 dollar one from the Google Store?",
