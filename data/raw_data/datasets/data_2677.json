    "title": "Recently, my Pixel 4XL won't charge, and has historically had major issues with battery drain.",
    "content": "For the past 4-5 months, I have been having significant battery drain issues. But now the issue is far more serious. The supplied adapter is unable to charge my phone since last night. For now, connecting the phone to my laptop using a USB-C to USB-C 3.2 cable seems to work. However, for the past hour, I am facing intermittent issues with that as well. Additionally, system UI is crashing repeatedly, which wasn't an issue earlier.\n\nI purchased this phone while I was studying and working in the US. This year, in the midst of this pandemic, I decided to visit my parents in India, and I need my phone at all costs. These issues couldn't have cropped up at a worse time.",
