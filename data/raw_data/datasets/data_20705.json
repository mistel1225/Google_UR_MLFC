    "title": "Pixel 3a won't charge",
    "content": "My Google Pixel 3a (that I bought less than a year ago from T Mobile) turned off on it's own last night. I plugged in the charger that came with the device and tried to turn it back on, but it wouldn't. I left it to charge overnight and tried to restart, it still wouldn't. All I see is the \"low battery\" symbol that flashes when I long press the power button. I've tried all of the below: \nLong press power button for 30s to hard restart\nLong press power button + volume down button for 20s\nDouble checked that the charger works on a different device\nDouble checked that my wall port works with a different device (laptop) \nRemoved my phone case and accessories and removed any visible dust/ particles around the charging port. \nTo me, it looks like a charging issue with the battery because the phone was working fine until the moment it turned off on it's own.",
