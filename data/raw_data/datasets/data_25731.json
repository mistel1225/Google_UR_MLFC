    "content": "I do FB lives. After one of them, someone asked me how I got the captions on my LIVE - I had no idea! :) The Live before that and the one after that did not have captions. I have since researched hour after hour and cannot get it to work again. On the Pixel 3 and 4 I have read that you toggle the volume button and under the thing that comes up, there should be something about captions underneath. I don't see anything. I would love to have captions on all of the videos but I can't figure it out!",
