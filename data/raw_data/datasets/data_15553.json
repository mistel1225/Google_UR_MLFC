    "content": "Every time I restart during a chat with google support, I lose contact with the person I was chatting with and I have no way of returning to the chat.  I try submitting another support ticket but it says I already have a support case open and won't let me open chat.  Not in my most recently used apps, not in the active app \"cards\", nothing.",
