    "content": "Hi am using a new pixel 3a with a qi wireless receiver, cos my old phone had wireless charging built in so lots of wireless charger around my house. I note that when I place my phone on the stand. I get no \"charging tone\" and the battery icon doesn't indicate it's charging but the phone does change albeit quite slowly.\nTried two different usb c receivers and both the same but when I use a micro usb receiver and usb c adapter it works as it should i.e makes a noise and displays charging icon\n\nAny help would be appreciated",
