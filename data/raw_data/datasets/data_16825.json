    "content": "My phone has been randomly saying, \"hey\", or \"hey hey\" the past couple of days, and the assistant voice settings have been restored to factory default without me changing anything.\nAlso, the camera. I have been having videos I took yesterday and today first be unable to send on whatsapp (again, randomly), saying \"file type not supported\"; the videos are now in my album, but black with a lock symbol on them; I just took 5 or 6 pictures and at first, they didn't show up at all, now they've shown up (about 10 minutes later) but from left to right the pictures (there's only 2 showing up at all) is black for about 3/4 of the picture-- showing just a bit from top to bottom, a sliver on the right side of what I actually took a picture of.\nI was SO excited to get this phone, and now it is acting like a crazy ahole and I am so disappointed.\nAny suggestions?\nI shut down apps and restart my phone on a regular basis and all updates are installed.\n* I feel like I already typed this, but I don't see it anywhere: I have barely had the phone 60 days and it was brand new when I got it.",
