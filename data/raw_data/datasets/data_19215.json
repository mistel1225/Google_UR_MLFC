    "content": "Hi there! So I've got a new Pixel and currently use Giffgaff as my service provider. I've out the SIM in and the phone is showing 5 different networks (so assuming it's unlocked!) But it won't connect to Giffgaff via O2. I've tried both automatic network and choosing O2-uk neither have worked! Just wondering if there is something I'm missing or I'll need to take to someone to get it checked out? I bought it brand new and have never had this problem before with connecting my Giffgaff sim!",
