    "title": "Google Photos Keeps Backing up my Screenshots",
    "content": "So I've had this issue and I've looked all around but it doesn't seem to be happening to anyone but me. I have both Google Photos and Dropbox set up to backup and upload my photos, but I want only the photos taken by the camera to be uploaded meaning only photos in DCIM/Camera/. However, every time I take a screenshot it keeps getting uploaded to my Google Photos and Dropbox libraries.\nNow before someone jumps at me, I already disabled all folders under \"Back up device folders\" including the Screenshots folder. So I don't understand why it insists on backing up the screenshots.\nThe folder where the screenshots are stored is: /storage/emulated/0/Pictures/Screenshots\nWhich is the default screenshot folder for my Pixel 4 XL. I used to have a Pixel 2 XL and I had this problem too. So I don't really get it.",
