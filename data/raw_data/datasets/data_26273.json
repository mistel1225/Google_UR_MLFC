    "title": "Pixel 3 XL Ambient Notifications Not Working on Pixel Stand with Android 10",
    "content": "Since receiving Android 10 this week, ambient notifications are no longer working on my Pixel 3 XL while charging on my Pixel Stand.  I've confirmed that Pixel Stand is configured to display ambient notifications, and that it isn't configured to use do not disturb, and I also tried forgetting the device, and setting it up again, but the ambient notifications continue not to work.  In order to see if I have ambient notifications I now have to remove my Pixel 3 XL from my Pixel Stand.  How do I resolve this?",
