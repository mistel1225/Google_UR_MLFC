    "content": "My phone started updating yesterday and it has not stopped. The update seems to have been completed but the phone is no longer charging. It's cycling through the start-up screen (Google... powered by android) and cutting off. It's been doing that since yesterday. I've used different charging options including my charger, a wireless charging pad, but nothing is working. The phone is not charging.",
