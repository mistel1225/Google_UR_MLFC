    "title": "Wifi calling doesn't actually work",
    "content": "I have the Google Pixel 3a, and I am on the Google Fi phone plan. I have activated Wi-Fi calling through the app provided. I am unable to make Wi-Fi calls, because it says no mobile network is available. this happens consistently despite the fact that I have excellent Wi-Fi coverage in my home. I also live outside of cell range, the most we ever get is a bar for about 5 seconds before it drops again. If by chance I do actually get to make a call over Wi-Fi (it works about 15% of the time) it will drop the second it thinks it has service, despite Google's official page that says \"your device will use whichever network has the stronger connection, whether it is wifi or cellular\" which shows me, that it will prioritize cellular regardless of whichever is actually better at the time. I have missed several important calls, and been unable to return them as the Wi-Fi calling does not actually work, so my question is when can I expect it to work? I bought this phone, and switch to this phone plan because I was under the impression that Wi-Fi calling was a service that was offered. I wonder if the better question is if I shouldn't just switch back to Verizon and get myself a new Galaxy, as I know for a fact their Wi-Fi calling actually works.",
