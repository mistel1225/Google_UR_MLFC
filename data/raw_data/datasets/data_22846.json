    "content": "I bought my google pixel 2 by the internet and arrived in Saudi Arabia (a country where I'm a resident). My phone broke (the screen doesn't turn on and any led works although the \"vibrator\" system is still working, and are the alarms). I've been trying to send it for checking and repair but I haven't been able so far, Saudi Arabia doesn't have a number to call for google support and I can't find anything on this webpage. Is there a way I can either talk, chat or email with somebody that can lead me in the right direction? thanks.",
