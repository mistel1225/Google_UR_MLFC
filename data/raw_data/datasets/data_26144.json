    "content": "I am trying to play music in my car with my new Pixel 3a using an aux cord, but my phone doesn't even recognize the cord and instead plays through the built-in speakers. My car doesn't have Bluetooth, and I know that it's not an issue with the cable because I have used it before with a different phone and it has always worked. How do I fix this?",
