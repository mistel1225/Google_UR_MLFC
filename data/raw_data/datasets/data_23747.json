    "content": "My Pixel phone just stopped working. While the first time this happened (after an update) a factory reset fixed it this time the phone is completely broken. \n\nI reluctantly sent my phone for replacement after talking with support,  when I was promised or would take 5 -10 days to be replaced. Yesterday was day 8 and I finally got an update, only to say there are a shortage of replacements and they'd let me know when they have one in stock.  \n\nSo Google just left me phone-less with no resolution sight.  Very very disappointed, I've have every Nexus and Pixel apart from the LG nexus 4 up to this point, and I'm very dependent on my phone between my work and outdoor life..\n\nI was offered a measely â‚¬20 \"goodwill\" gesture, which I obviously won't accept. I want my phone back.\n\nHow long is this going to take, surely I'm entitled to a refund,  phones under warranty?",
