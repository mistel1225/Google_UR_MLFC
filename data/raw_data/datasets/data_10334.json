    "title": "Why is my Pixel 4a 5G only connecting Bluetooth audio, but not for Bluetooth phone calls?",
    "content": "After the normal pairing process, my phone will show as connected via Bluetooth. However only BT audio will work consistently. BT phone functionality will not work (incoming/outgoing phone calls will not go through Bluetooth). \n\nIf I go into the Bluetooth settings for the connected device profile, the Phone Calls toggle isn't even listed. \n\nI have deleted and re-paired multiple times, and it still won't work. I have tried on multiple cars with the same issue.",
