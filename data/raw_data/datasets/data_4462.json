    "content": "Google search on homescreen, Gmail & Outlook will not stay open. Closes intantly.\nHave tried force stop/disable/enable/clear cache/restart. Up to date with version also.\nNot working.\nAll other apps are ok, Google Chrome works ok also.\nStrange that both suddently stopped.\nWould prefer a solution as I'm not sure how to fix the Google problem without resetting the phone as there is no 'uninstall' option. Can uninstall and reinstall Outlook but prefer not to if there is a fix.",
