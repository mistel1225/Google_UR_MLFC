    "title": "[Advance Replacement] Pixel 4 XL RMA - Replacement device not yet ship after 3 weeks",
    "content": "I pre-ordered Google Pixel 4 XL from Google store Singapore.\n\nReceived it on 23rd October 2019.\n\nAfter which, I found out that there was an issue with the NFC. It was not reading NFC tags correctly. \n\nSo I contacted Google support to which they suggested me to do an advance replacement.\n\nI agreed and did the replacement order within the remorse period. \nEstimated delivery date for replacement device was 6-7th November 2019.\n\nNote that for RMA device, they have to be shipped back to Google within 21 days and for advance replacement, I would be getting my replacement device before I shipped out the defective device.\n\nI shipped out the defective device back to Google on 9th November 2019.\n\nFast forward 3 weeks and after a 2nd replacement order, my replacement device was still not ship out.\n\nGoogle has already confirmed that they have already received my original defective device at their warehouse.\n\nChat support and callbacks always leads to email response and Google support do not reply to my emails. \n\nI tried asking for refund because of the super long delay, but they said it's out of remorse period, therefore they are unable to process the refund. \n\nI'm at a lost of what to do.\nPlease advise / help!",
