    "content": "This post is just share my experience. I dont know if its common or just my unit. \n\nI ordered the pixel 3a XL last week. And over one week this is my view\nGood\n- Light weight\n- Quick android updates\n\nNot so good\n- Screen whiteness is slightly yellow/grey when watch straight. At an angle, it appear proper white. Didnt expect this on OLED. I had my doubts before buying as not a single unit in stores had a proper white screen. \n- I was expecting so much from the camera. But cloudy day shots were so dark and dull, that my 3 yrs old phone was taking better pictures. Even the low light shots from my old phone were comparable to pixel. \n\nAnd even when I sent a photo comparing pixel 3a xl Vs other phone screen whiteness, the response from pixel experts was \"oled screens are like that. may be the phone is not for you\"\n\nSo... I am returning it.",
