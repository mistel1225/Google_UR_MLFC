    "content": "Can someone please help me with an issue with Google Product support?  I have been without a phone now for 7 days.  My phone no longer wakes up without crashing (meaning I can't answer calls, etc.)  I've tried all troubleshooting given by Google support and now am in an endless loop with support.   They said they would send me a shipping label to return my defective phone, however daily I get the same questions back from them (which I promptly answer)...but no shipping label.  I know they are getting my emails by the context of their replies, but they've made no effort just to extract the information they are asking for from the previous emails.  \n\nI'm at my wits end with the poor customer service I've received from Sam, Sierra, Trish, and Adrien.  Each correspondence is a variant of a form letter and they never an act to help me.  Is there a real person at Google that can get me a shipping label so I can return my phone that stopped working properly before it was even 2 months old?",
