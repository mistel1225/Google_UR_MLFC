    "content": "UPDATE: My port was damaged and had to be replaced. It's fine now. \n\nLooked around to find someone with a similar problem, but no dice. My pixel 3a has stopped responding to chargers for the most part. I have about 5 different cords and cables and the only thing I have found that works is an Amazon brand USB-C to USB cord connected to a power bank. \n\nBUT even then it only works when the phone is off.....and even THEN it only works occassionally. Half the time when I plug it in while powered off, inserting the plug somehow restarts the phone, which stops the charging. When it's on it sometimes says \"Android System - Charging connected device via USB\" as if I'm using my phone to charge the power bank? I'm basically surviving by getting lucky that it decides not to turn on again after I plug it in. If I shut it down while plugged in, it also won't charge. \n\nI have done all the normal things including factory reset, but it almost seems to me that the issue is somehow both firmware AND the port? \n\nI don't know, but would appreciate any insight or ideas.",
