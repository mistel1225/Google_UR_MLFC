    "content": "Anyone experiencing screen flicker and Google unresponsive since the June 5 security patch? The screen becomes responsive or like yesterday I asked GA to turn up the volume and the entire screen started spasming out. It also won't pick up my Jabra 75t earbuds in Bluetooth.  It seems this patch totally ruined my phone! I backed up my phone and reset it twice to no avail. Any ideas?",
