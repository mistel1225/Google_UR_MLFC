    "content": "Pixel 3XL, rear camera will not focus after 20cm..tried safe mode, factory reset..no luck. Wife's Pixel 3 has same problem, hers is a refurb because last year her camera was jumping around, it was under warranty last year so they replaced it with refurb. Pretty ticked off after buying phones outright...I hear apixel 5 has issues as well...may have to leave the Pixel family",
