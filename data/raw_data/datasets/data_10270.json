    "content": "How do you get an answer from Google when they have your phone and have escalated your RMA twice and still won't provide an update? My phone was delivered by DHL to Poland for an RMA on the 19th November. It was signed for and I have been expecting a device back. I haven't got a refurb device or an update as to what's going on. Every time I contact chat or call they say it's been escalated...two levels now and in two business days I'll get an update. Then ....no update so I chat again....no update. Anyone any advice on my next steps and how to get a response?",
