    "content": "My phone stopped working last week out of nowhere and I was able to get it diagnosed to the issue being with the Google motherboard. I have been trying to get the situation fixed without being penalized but since this just so conveniently happened outside of the one-year warranty period their hands are tied and do not want to assist me with waived repair when the issue is not something that could have been caused by a user. Not sure if anyone has been able to get through the scripted answers and treated like a real person.",
