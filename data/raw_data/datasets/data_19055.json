    "content": "I woke up a couple of days ago and just happened to see a call was coming in but the phone was not ringing. So after I was done with a call I checked all of my settings in the volume was all the way up and I do not disturb was off. So I turned the phone off and back on with no luck. I removed a couple of apps that I thought that could be an issue, and I put the phone in safe mode. None of these attempts resolved the issue. So at last I did a factory reset which did not resolve the problem. Help because I'm out of ideas.",
