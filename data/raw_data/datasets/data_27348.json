    "content": "I am a big pixel fan. I have always been supporting google for pixel. But, I am disappointed. back, when apple released it's phone with a notch, google made fun of it and i was completely supporting google. But, then google had a notch on it's phone. Google, made fun of apple for killing the earphone jack and I supported google and laughed at apple, but google did it again, it killed of earphone jack too. I was angry but still not furious. But, now google also killed fingerprint scanner, and did what? installed a dot projector on it's phone just like apple. I an furious at google. But, I am sad to say that google is doing it's best to follow apple's path. Google is just not making fun of itself, google is also making fun of it's fans like me. I am really disappointed in Google. I was a true google fan but Google s ruining itself.",
