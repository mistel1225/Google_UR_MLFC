    "content": "Hi.\n\nSo since I update my Pixel to Android 10 from Android 9 my microphone has stopped working. I doesn't work in any app, only way I've been able to get it to respone is to do a reboot it in recovery mode. There it seems to work, so it shouldn't be completely broken.\n\nAnyone had a similair issue and have a solution to the problem? I've done a factory reset which didn't help at all.",
