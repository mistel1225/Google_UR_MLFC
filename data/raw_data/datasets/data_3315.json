    "content": "I used to have a Pixel 2 and just upgraded to the Pixel 5. My Pixel 2 had a back button along the bottom menu on the left (<) next to the home button and the square button to show all open apps.\nIs there a way to go 'back' on the Pixel 5 that I'm missing? \nI understand how to get home and how to see all apps, but there is not a simple back option that I can see.",
