    "content": "Hi, on my Pixel 2 I like to have different notification sounds for different apps, and I set most of them up this way. However, I don't seem to be able to have different sounds for Messages and Photos. They only seem to be able to use the default system notification or stay quiet. Am I missing something here? Every time Photos has a new stylised photo I think I have an important message from someone. :-(",
