    "content": "pixel 3 chimes with factory charger/cable - sometimes chiming randomly every few seconds - sometimes not at all during the entire charge cycle.   It can be really annoying when it is chiming.\n\nMost of the charging cycles it doesn't chime once\n\n  Is there a fix?\n\nThanks for your great support for both of my Pixel 3's - the other Pixel (my wife's) doesn't have this issue and both bought at the same time.\n\nI also have it on auto update so it always gets the latest software updates - I first noticed this after a system update about  2 months ago - and I just got the latest update (2 days ago) and it still chimes however I unplugged it and plugged it back in and the chiming stopped for a while (15 minutes or so) and started again\n\nI have had them for 6 months",
