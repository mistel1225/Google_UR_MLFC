    "content": "Hello,\nNormally, when I receive a phone call (on whatsapp or regular phone), a full screen would pop up and interrupt everything I am doing. Same with alarm clocks: a full-screen would pop up showing the alarm and asking me to \"snooze\" or \"dismiss\".\nHowever, since I switched to a new phone (from pixel 2 to 3a) I now only have a small notification pop up among all notifications, and I have to scroll through them to find the alarm clock and/or to respond to phone calls. It's super annoying.\n\nCould anyone help me please?\nThanks!",
