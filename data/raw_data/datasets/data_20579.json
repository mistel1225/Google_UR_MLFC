    "content": "Hi! I'm desperately looking for a place in Belgium or the Netherlands where I can have my broken screen AND the middle frame attached to it repaired, of my google Pixel 3a.\n Apparently this mid frame cannot be purchased any more by repair shops and parts from ebay are not reliable. golgle does not want to help me, the official repair shops in France or Germany don't answer.\nWonderful customer service!\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated, since my phone is still very new!\n\nThank you.\nTom",
