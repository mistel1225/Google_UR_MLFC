    "content": "Every time I try to copy any text in word editors or SMS, or whatever, the app crashes.  It happened after I downloaded one particular app (a teleprompter one). Not sure if it is just a coincidence, but the app is to do with text based stuff and happened as soon as I installed and used for first time. I deleted the app. Any thoughts??",
