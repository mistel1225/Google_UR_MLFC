    "content": "Since version 11 updated on my phone, when I connect my phone via bluetooth to my car I can't see the song details and I can't change up or down though the songs. This worked prior. \nI have reset my phone, I have downloaded and installed the apps which are not working, I have disconnected and reconnected via bluetooth my phone to my car. \nCan I uninstalled version 11 or can this be sorted? \nAlso does this happens to the google pixel 5? \n\nPlease could someone help",
