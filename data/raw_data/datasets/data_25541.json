    "content": "Whenever I take a picture in the camera, I can see the image take and it appears in the preview icon in the bottom right, but when I tap on the icon and it opens in the Photos app, I cannot find any traces of my images anywhere. However, if I go to Messages or Files, the images appear and I can open and send them.\n\nI have cleared my Camera and Photos app caches and restarted the phone. Any other suggestions?",
