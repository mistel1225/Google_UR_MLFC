    "content": "I was using my pixel 3 to take a video, but after 4-5 seconds, the screen just froze and the phone would not respond. I held down the power button for about 10 seconds, and I got a screen that said 'problem loading android, your memory may be corrupted'. It gave the option of 'try again' or 'restore factory settings'. I chose the option of try again, and it restarted with all my apps and data intact, but the device settings like themes, wallpaper, etc. had been reset to default. After a little while when I tried to use my phone again, it just won't switch on. I know it has enough charge. I even left it on charge overnight, but still no response. I've held the power button for more than 30 seconds, and even tried all the other options on the troubleshoot pages, but the phone just won't respond. I tried contacting google support for a call back, but no response yet. My case ID: 1-2330000031616. Could someone please help, as I need my phone to work asap because of my job.",
