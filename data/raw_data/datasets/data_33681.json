    "content": "This is not a case of \"daily wallpaper\" being turned on.  These images are not native to the wallpaper app.  Today's features a windows logo for example.  I uninstalled all potentially shady apps and am left with only big name, very common apps.  \n\nWhen I change the image it just will change again the next day to another random image, often times they have an anime theme.\n\nHelp!",
