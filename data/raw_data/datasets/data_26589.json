    "content": "Hi, I listen to music via headphones on my Google pixel 3XL, but with the ring volume set to mute - (I work in a quiet office). On my previous phone (an iPhone 6), even though the phone was on mute, I would still hear the ring tone via my headphones: on the Pixel 3XL, I don't hear the ring tone via headphones so often miss calls. Is there anyway to resolve this? Many thanks",
