    "title": "Change Left Side Back Gesture",
    "content": "With the Android 10 update; is there any way to remove the back function on the left side of the screen with the new gesture controls? I only need the back function on the right side.\n\nI'm not liking how difficult it is to open the Side Menus with the swipe. I know you can use two fingers or a diagonal swipe but with an XL device one handed use doesn't really allow for those gestures. And the hold then swipe is not accurate or consistent for daily use. I also have the back sensitivity on the lowest setting.\n\nI've forced myself to use the new controls and for the most part, I have got used to them but cannot get used to the left side back/opening side menu.\n\nGoing to have to revert back soon if this either doesn't have an option to turn it off or it gets fixed.",
