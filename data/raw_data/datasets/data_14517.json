    "content": "Just wondering if Google Assistant can play a wake up tone on my Pixel 4a after I say \"Okay/Hey Google\" so that I know it has heard me? I have just switched from an iPhone and Siri would play a little short tone after I said \"Hey Siri\" so I knew Siri was awake and ready to listen to my request. My Google Assistant doesn't always respond and I will often use it in the car when I can't see my phone to make calls, change music, set reminders etc... so it would be useful to know that it is responsive otherwise I just end up talking to myself... Can't seem to see this anywhere in settings or found an answer online. Any help would be appreciated, thanks!",
