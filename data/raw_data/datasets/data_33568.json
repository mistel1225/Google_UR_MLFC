    "title": "My Pixel 2 becomes unresponsive and requires a hard reboot",
    "content": "If my phone sleeps for about a minute, I am not able to wake it up. It will become frozen on the always on screen. I have to hold down the power button and do a hard reboot. I can avoid the phone from becoming unresponsive if I play audio or video in the background. So I have been playing music on mute to stop the phone from freezing. This is not ideal as it causes the battery to die faster.\nI have tried booting into safe mode and the problem still occurs in safe mode. I have removed apps. I have disabled the always on display. I have performed a factory reset. Other than this issue, the phone performs as usual.",
