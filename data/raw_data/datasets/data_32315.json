    "content": "I used to be able to tether my Google Pixel and transfer files from my computer under USB tethering.  Now when I do it (worked a few months ago) and I turn USB tethering on, it switches to on, then to off, then to back on again and my computer doesn't recognize my phone at all.   When I turn off USB I see the Pixel icon there, but when I click it, it's completely blank.  I've tried switching out USB cords and still the same thing.",
