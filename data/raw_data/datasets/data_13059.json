    "content": "I've just updated to the new Android 11 system upgrade and now I'm not getting the option to take a screenshot. I pressed the home â€“ to swipe up, the option for snapshot and share simply does not show. I've double checked my system to make sure the update was completed and it was. I have power cycled twice. I really need to have the snapshot option back. I hope someone can help me please!!!",
