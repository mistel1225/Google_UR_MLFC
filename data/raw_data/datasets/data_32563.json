    "content": "When I select the contacts application on my Pixel 2 I see the organized list of contacts that I created and prefer. However, when I select the icon to make a call, my contacts list is different, much longer, and full of contacts I do not want. I'd like to delete the entire list of contacts that I see when I select the call icon and replace it with the list from the contacts application. Any help appreciated.",
