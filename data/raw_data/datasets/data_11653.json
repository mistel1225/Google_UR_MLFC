    "content": "Lowest bluetooth volume setting is too loud & the gap between two volume increments are way too high. This started happening after upgrading to Android 11. I'm experiencing this on my Logitech Z337 when connected via bluetooth. Did a factory reset, but it didn't help. Anyone else experiencing this kind of an issue after the upgrade or has any idea into what's going on? To me it seems like a bug in Android 11.",
