    "content": "I have tried using the instructions listed on Google's help forum but it's not accurate. If I go to the users screen from the settings/advanced sections, if I click on \"guest\" to remove it, it signs me in as the user with no admin rights. If I click the settings wheel next to \"guest\" it just gives me the option to turn on phone calls for the guest. I can't delete the account. Someone has unauthorized access and is sending texts from my phone.",
