    "content": "Hi, I bought a 3 XL two weeks ago and it's a great phone\n\nSince last week I keep getting the error Bluetooth Keeps Stopping\n\nThe prompt keeps happening every 5 seconds and the phone is near unusable\n\nI've tried the following:\nMultiple restarts*\nSwitching off the phone overnight*\nReset network settings\nSwitching off Bluetooth Scanning and Location Services and restarting*\nFactory Reset*\n\nSolutions marked with a * would give me a 2-3  hour fix but it doesn't always work\n\nFurthermore it's not a foolproof fix and it's frustrating to keep doing it every few hours\n\nI see that it's not uncommon but no permanent fix is available",
