    "content": "My phone and system got stolen early January this year. On my devices I have my two Google accounts, one serving as recovery mail for the other. And there was Google Authenticator and and login backup codes for both accounts on the phone and system. I have been trying to access the two accounts with no success. \nI have my life's work on those accounts and I can provide any details to help me regain access to the accounts.
