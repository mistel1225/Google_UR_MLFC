    "content": "Hello, I had my phone in my pocket yesterday during a light rain storm. Phone had some droplets of of water on the screen at one point, but nothing excessive. I was able to use my phone in the evening when I got back home. I was able to use my phone the following morning. When I plugged my phone to charge, after about an hour I noticed the screen wasn't on. The buttons remained responsive e.g. the fingerprint reader, power button. When I tried to restart the phone nothing came on the screen.",
