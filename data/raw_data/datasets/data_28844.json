    "title": "Cannot charge my phone pixel 2 . \"USB preference\" is the issue. Will describe it below.",
    "content": "My Pixel won't recognize the power from the USB-C cable. After I toggled the USB Controlled by: \"Connected Device\" to \"This Device\" the phone used to charge . Now the phone also refuses to switch to 'this device' and says, after trying to switch for about 5 seconds, 'couldn't switch', which is annoying and makes no sense. N now I can only charge my phone when its switched off. I read multiple users are experiencing  it . I need a solution as soon as possible. ",
