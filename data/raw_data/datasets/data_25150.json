    "content": "I have set up several email addresses using IMAP on the Gmail app.\n\nThe emails are set up correctly but the 'from' name is not being displayed when I send an email. The recipient just sees the first part of the email before the @ displayed the sender (eg. dominic)\n\nI have set up my full name to display in the settings but its not showing\n\nCan anyone help please?",
