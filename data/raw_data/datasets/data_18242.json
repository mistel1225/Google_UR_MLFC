    "content": "My phone has been stuck on the reboot loop, and from searching online it's likely cause of a malfunctioning motherboard which needs to be replaced. I currently live in the Netherlands, but plan on visiting a friend in Cologne, Germany. Since I will be there I might as well get the phone repaired in a country which has official support and might have the replacement parts. So as the title of the post, are there any stores which can repair a Google Pixel 1, specifically with the motherboard issue?",
