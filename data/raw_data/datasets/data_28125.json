    "content": "Ok, so when I ride my motorcycle, I have my phone hooked up via bluetooth to my helmet (Sena 10c). When I am riding, Google Assistant's \"ok google\" feature will not work. I mainly try using this feature because I need to call someone to tell them I am on my way, or I am pulling up right now, and much more. The only time I can use the Google Assistant is if I am completely stopped for a long time (and as anyone may know while driving, you are pretty much always moving). So is there a way to fix this so I can use google assistant while riding my motorcycle? And the Google Assistant does work via bluetooth, just not in motion apparently.",
