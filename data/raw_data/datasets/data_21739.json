    "content": "I'm on a Google Pixel 3a XL on Android 10, and like apparently many, many of you I'm having problems with my wifi suddenly and constantly dropping. Sometimes it shows \"connected, no Internet\" and sometimes it just completely disconnects, and all I have to do is go in and manually click on my home network and it connects easily right away. Every other device in our house is still working flawlessly and it's definitely (yet another) problem with the phone, not my router. It's incredibly frustrating.\n\nI've tried several fixes that haven't worked, and am going to try some new ones I've just spotted in the threads here, but in the meantime:\n\nDoes anybody know if there's a way to turn on a notification that will warn me when my wifi has dropped so I can reconnect it *before* using up a metric ton of data? I've searched through all kinds of settings but can't find anything, is this even possible with this phone? Or is there a way to turn off and on its ability to even connect to LTE at all? (Like I could just turn off LTE entirely when I'm at home, so I'll lose Internet completely if my wifi drops and realize that the wifi's gone?)",
