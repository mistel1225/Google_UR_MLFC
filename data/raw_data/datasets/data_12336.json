    "content": "I have three Pixel Stands. Two of them seem to work just fine, without an issue. One of my stands, however, has significant problems with charging. I place it as in the middle as I literally can, and I get a red error message at the bottom to re-align it better.\n\nI re-align it better, and sometimes an orange light will come on. Sometimes without even touching it, the orange light will go away, and start charging for a minute. Then go orange again.\n\nThese stands seem to be plagued with these alignment issues. I wound up throwing that one in the trash since it's obviously junk and Google isnt going to replace it; but has anyone come up with any solution at all? If it happens to my other stands, I would like a solution, if there is one.",
