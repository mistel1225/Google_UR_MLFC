    "content": "I had taken a screen shot that I wanted to send to Google Outlook customer support, and in trying to figure out how to do that, I clicked on an icon at the top of my 'swipe down' home-screen  The icon looks like a Chinese character.  After clicking on it, two small dots on either side of the icon 'blinked' at me, and then the screen went black and the phone was unresponsive for a few minutes and then the clock time appeared and I was able to turn the phone back on.  What happened?  And how can I send a screen shot to Google Outlook customer support.  Thanks in advance from Brian B in Vancouver Canada.",
