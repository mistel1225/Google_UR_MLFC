    "content": "I bought a Pixel 2 reburbished on Amazon and the first 2 days of use worked perfectly. I traveled back home and my phone was black (assumed run out of battery in the plane) so when I connected it, showed  the  black screen with a battery sign (such as in other reviews). I try to turn it on after 2 hrs of being connected and couldn't. I follow up the steps from one of the people here and it worked. ( Click both volume and turn on button at the same time)\n\nThe real question is, my phone is broken? Should I return it? Or was more a one time situation? I still have Couple days on my (\"refurbish guarantee\") \n\nThank you!",
