    "content": "Hi I've deleted almost everything in my Pixel 3a but for some reason it still shows 29Gb (in Settings) of photos and videos that I can't find on my device! On a screenshot it shows 0 video and 27Mb photos. I keep deleting even apps and my storage is still full!!! I still have space in my Google storage (only full up to 47%) so that's not the issue.\nThanks for your help!",
