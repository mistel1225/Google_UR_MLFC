    "content": "I've noticed that if my camera app has been closed for a while, when I reopen and switch to the front camera there is a very loud static noise and the image on the screen is very blurry, this last for a few seconds before it goes to normal or sometimes the noise doesn't stop at all. How do I fix this issue?",
