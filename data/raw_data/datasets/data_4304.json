    "content": "I transferred the sim nano sim card from google fi in my old Pixel card to my new pixel 4a 5G.  Everything seems to work fine.  Everything restored from my old phone.  However, I get a message that the \"sim manager keeps stopping\".  It repeats frequently.  Tried stopping the app.  If I uninstall, there is a warning that says will be lost.  How can I stop this message.",
