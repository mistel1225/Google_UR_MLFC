    "content": " I’m trying to activate a Google pixel phone in an Organization. I’m advised to tap the welcome screen 7 times to enable camera to scan QR code for activation purpose. After scanning the QR code I’m prompted to select wifi to proceed further. Even if I have my SIM card inserted Im unable to use mobile data and wifi is the only option available. I don’t face similar issue with other manufacturers devices, is it by design in pixel?. - did not match any answers in Pixel Phone Help.",
