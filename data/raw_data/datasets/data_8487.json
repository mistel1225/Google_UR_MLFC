    "content": "Say I want to change my lock screen wallpaper. I open settings, choose styles & wallpers, swipe right to chose the lock screen preview. I then click one of the options, then, for some inexplicable reason, lock screen preview disappears and is replaced with the home screen.  I must select \"Lock screen\" at the top.  This will be the second time selecting this option for one task. OK, so I like it. I click the check mark, now it's giving me the option to set it as my home screen, lock screen, or both.  So, again I'm being given more options than I want as a user.  I just want to change my lock screen.  \n\nThe last choice is nothing new, but the behavior before that is a bit goofy. I was legitimately confused when I selected a wallpaper for my lock screen when the home screen preview popped up. Not intuitive.\n\nGoogle, maybe sort this out in your next update?",
