    "content": "I just received my Pixel 3a. As soon as I unboxed it, I tried to turn the phone on. However, there was no response at all. I then figured out that the battery was not charged at all. (it was weird as usually even a brand new phone has its battery charged when shipped.) So, I did charge it with the charger that came with it. After about 20% of battery charged, I was able to turn it on. Then, took a couple of picture to test the portrait modes. Then, I turned it off, and tried to let it fully charged. As it gets charged up to around 80%, the phone just stopped showing the battery status on the screen. The most importantly, It is not turning on at all! No responsive at all now.\n\nI tried this document. (https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/7167687?hl=en-GB)\n- Long press-and-hold power button more than 30 sec.\n- Press both power and volume down button for more than 20 sec.\nStill, the phone is completely non-responsive...\n\nI would like to know if there is any way to fix it.\nAlso, if not possible, can I get a replacement immediately?",
