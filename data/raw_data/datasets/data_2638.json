    "title": "Unable making calls but data and messaging work",
    "content": "I have had this issue 2 weekends in a row now. I have a cottage where cell coverage is really bad (sometimes I do see the 'x' on the signal icon, top right of the screen). Nevertheless, LTE signal gets stronger (almost 5 bars) as soon as I drive a few hundred meters from the place. The problem is that although i am able getting mobile data while driving (listening to Internet radio), I am unable making voice calls. The number appears as if the phone is trying to connect, but after 10 or 15 seconds, the call drops without ever being connected. I tried rebooting the phone several times, I turned airplane mode on and off, but without success. I even tried removing and reinserting the sim card, but no luck. I was eventually able making calls again after driving 20 minutes away from the place (last week it took about 30 minutes).\nThe other weird thing is that while I am on the highway and on a call, I see the 'x' symbol appearing again, although I am right in the middle of a call.\n\nI thought it might be a network issue, but i really looks like it's the phone. \n\nWhat should I do?",
