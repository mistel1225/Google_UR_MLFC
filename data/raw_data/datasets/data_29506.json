    "content": "I have gone through the entire troubleshooting process provided by Google (with the exception of factory reset) \n\nContext\n--\nI booted my phone up after it running out battery and found that there is are thin-angled areas at the top left and bottom right in horizontal directions and top right and bottom left in vertical directions. These areas have dead or off LEDs\nAlmost as if the phone has rotated the display 5 to10 degrees anti-clockwise. Like when you rotate a rectangle from it's original position.",
