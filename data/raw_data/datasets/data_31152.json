    "content": "My new 3a seems to miss a lot of unlocks, even if I add new finger IDs with different parts of my index finger. Anyone else having this issue? I don't think that the finger scanner should be missing this many unlocks, and I don't think I'm holding the phone wrong or not using the finger scanner correctly.",
