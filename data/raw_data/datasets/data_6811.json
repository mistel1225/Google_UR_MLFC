    "content": "I'm going through an issue that I have taken pictures of and I moved them to a folder so they can stay together. The last thing I remember doing was naming it \"Save file\" and creating the album with the pictures I needed. Then, I went back into my photos and deleted the duplicate copies of them. Now I cannot find the \"Save file\" album or the pictures I needed from deleting the duplicates. But a bunch of other pictures I deleted are back onto the main camera file from when I deleted them.",
