    "title": "Pixel 3a. How to silence and vibrate without notifications vibrating.",
    "content": "I just got Pixel 3a. I always keep notifications silent, no vibration, just a notification on top bar. However, when I put the phone in vibration mode, it allows all the notifications to vibrate. How do I make my phone vibrate only for calls but not messages? This is very weird I have never had this problem with other phones. How does vibration mode override my \"no vibration\" choice? I just don't want my kids to wake up to a call, then I start buzzing all the time.",
