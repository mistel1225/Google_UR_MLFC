    "content": "Team,\nI had a software issue with my Google pixel 3 in US and raised a warranty replacement with Google. The process was very smooth, i sent my phone and they sent a replacement phone. But there was some issue with fedex delivering and the package was sent back. I tried contacting google to resend the package, but there is no proper response from the support team. Every time i contact the support team, they say \"Team is working on it, rest assured every thing will be taken care, our expert team will respond within next 24 hours\". And they are saying this for the past 30 days with no expert team taking care of it. \n\nI am patiently following up with them every 4 days with the same response every time. Can some one help me with any Escalation Point of contact email to gain attention on the case 9-4978000028159. Having delays in sending the phone is okay, but not even providing proper response, ETA and not responding to emails is really disappointing.",
