    "content": "I had recently bought pixel 4 on eBay from US. If I understand correctly it's a Verizon version that passed required timeout to unlock it to use in other carriers. I understand that this is a part of Version business secure, but I'm in Russia and I highly doubt pixel will evere return to US back.\nI was trying to write message at Verizon community forum but looks like due to Russian ip I'm unable to even create an account.\nIs there any way to return my pixel's IMEI back to Google pool, so I will be able to unlock it?",
