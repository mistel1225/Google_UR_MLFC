    "content": "This has happened several times including this morning:\nSometimes when I take a photo, the image shows up nicely on my phone and properly on Google Photos app of my phone.\n\nHowever when I check Google Photos on my desktop, it looks like this. My phone and apps are fully updated so I have no idea how to fix this.\n\nAny advice is appreciated.",
