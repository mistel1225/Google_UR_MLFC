    "title": "\"Do not disturb\" mode on child account",
    "content": "On my Pixel 3 I have two accounts, my personal adult account and another one for my 11 years old child. When I enable \"do not disturb\" mode on my adult account, it works as it should, meaning that I can receive calls and notifications from starred contacts (screen on and/or notification sound).\n\nHowever, no matter what, I'm unable to see any notifications when \"do not disturb\" mode is enabled on my child account. I can get the call or the message, but the screen doesn't turn on and there's no sound coming to notify me, even if the call/notification is from a starred contact and the phone is set to allow calls/notifications from those contacts.\n\nThis happenes only on the child account, on the adult account it works as it should.\n\nAny ideas?",
