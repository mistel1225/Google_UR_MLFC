    "content": "Hi, I bought a Pixel for my dad from Gum Tree, the guy I bought it from said it is under warranty until Jan 2021. The Pixel's microphone and headphones stopped working, I tried putting a warranty claim using the IMEI number but Google form says they can't find the details. I'm also contacting the guy I bought it to transfer the contract over to me. Can't Google use the IMEI number to honour the warranty?\n\nThanks",
