    "title": "Can someone help me transfer files from Ubuntu 20.04 to a brand new Pixel 4a?",
    "content": "I have a brand new Pixel 4a and can't seem to put anything on it via a USB A to USB C cable I got with my Huawei phone. I'm using Files in Ubuntu 20.04. I can create folders on the phone via the PC but file copying hangs and crashes the Files program on the laptop.  I read about the Pixel not liking third party cables but it seems odd that I can create folders on the phone but not move files.  Also, whilst using the Files app on the Pixel I can't seem to move files from one directory (downloads) to another (music). Any help would be appreciated and I apologise if this has been solved elsewhere. I did have a good look for this already.",
