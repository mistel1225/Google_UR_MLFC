    "content": "Connected new Pixel 3 to my old Galaxy s7 using the cable as per the setup instructions. When I started the data copying both phones had plenty of battery life, but after nearly an hour (yep, taking its time) I noticed the Galaxy now has 82% battery (started at 65%) and the Pixel is looking really low (can't see a percentage as I don't want to interrupt it).\n\nIs this normal?",
