    "content": "My phone will not turn on, I took it to a MobileKlinik and they told me there is nothing wrong with the charging of the phone and there is no water damage or damage of any sort. They told me to contact google as the phone is still under warranty but I have not been able to get through to anyone. Where can I take it in Edmonton, Alberta for them to help?",
