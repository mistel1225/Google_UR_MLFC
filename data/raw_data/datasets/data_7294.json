    "title": "Cannot hear other person part way through a call",
    "content": "I will be partway through a phone call when suddenly I could no longer hear the other person, but only static/crackling sounds when the other person speaks. I will have to hang up, call back, and then they are clear. However, the other person is able to hear me clearly. Sometimes it will immediately do it again, and I'll have to call back seven times. It's so frustrating. This mostly occurs while driving. I have turned off Wi-Fi calling while driving, however I can't seem to figure out why my phone does this.",
