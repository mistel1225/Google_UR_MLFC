    "content": "-Problem started on November 5th 2020, after a security update : battery drains fast once it's about 20%.. The numbers just jump one after the other until phone dies in seconds, so it's not a gradual drain.\n-Google assistant said no apps that could provoke this, were running in the background\n-Updated phone on November 12th .. problem isn't fixed",
