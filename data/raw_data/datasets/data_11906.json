    "content": "I got my new Pixel 4a yesterday. I've tried different messengers and tried taking voice notes in Google Notes. The audio quality in Telegram and Google Notes is terrible. Extremely muffled, far from clear and rather quiet. However, in videos or in Instagram voice messages the audio quality is fantastic, so it seems to be a software problem. Does anybody know a way to fix this?",
