    "content": "Since I updated my Pixel 3XL to Android 10, I have two major problems: \n1.) I cannot change the ringtone; I can select and test a ringtone, but the phone keeps ringing with a very bad default tone. \n2.) I cannot see my Garmin Chronos as connected Bluetooth device (I need that for smartlock) desite the device is successfully paired and connected.\nI already did a factory reset, with no success.",
