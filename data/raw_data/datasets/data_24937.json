    "content": "I am now on my 3rd pixel 3xl. Frankly I'm done with pixel and won't ever buy another.\n\nFirst one - would put itself on mute. Got replaced\n\nSecond one - wouldn't hold charge longer than 3.5 hours. Got replaced \n\nThird one (currently using) - accelerometer meter sensor isn't work. \n\nAs per usual Google refuses to acknowledge genuine issues with these devices, nor do they provide solutions. Yes I have factory reset. Yes I have tried safe mode. Yes I have deleted suspect apps. The apps suggestion I feel is redundant as it's the same apps I had on the previous two pixels and they did not affect the sensors on those. \n\nDoes anyone have a solution for this problem or should I just smash the phone and bin it?",
