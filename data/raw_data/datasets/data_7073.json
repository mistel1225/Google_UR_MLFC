    "content": "My Pixel 3 has always worked great for calls in my car via Bluetooth.  Unfortunately, I have now bought a smartwatch which also links via Bluetooth to my phone.  I now have an issue.  When trying to make a call from my car, my phone can't determine which Bluetooth connection to keep open (Ideally the car speakers and mic) and which not to use so it chooses neither!  Anybody got any ideas how to keep the phone connected to the car when in it, and connected to the watch once I leave the car.\nMany thanks.",
