    "content": "Earlier this month, I ordered a refurbished phone under Google's RMA program. I sent the broken phone back to Google using the provided Fedex shipping label, with the packing slip inside the provided box. Nearly 2 weeks ago, I dropped the package off at a Fedex store, and Fedex's tracking info said it was delivered to the destination in Texas 2 days later.\nSince then, however, I have received 2 emails from Google asking me if I've sent my broken phone back yet, indicating that they have not processed my return. There is 4 days until the deadline where my credit card will be charged $1000. Most of this is out of my hands at this point-- is there anything I can do to help move the process along before the deadline?",
