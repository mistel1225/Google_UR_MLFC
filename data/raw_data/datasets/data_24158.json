    "content": "There is a strange sound in the recorded video, like a squeak.  It doesn't matter if I play it on a phone, computer or other smartphone.  I don't hear anything like that on YouTube or other videos from other apps.  It's about video recorded with Pixel 3a.  The problem has been around for several days.  Maybe since I installed Android 10, but it may not be related.",
