    "content": "I can't make or receive phone calls.  Message I get is \"Mobile Network Not Available.\"  \n\nI've tried all of the suggestions I've come across so far and nothing has worked.  \n\nThe phone is a little more than a year old and I spent almost $1,000 on it.  I can't even keep in touch with my family members who are sick with the virus.  So frustrating!!  \n\nAny suggestions (other than stomping on it) would be greatly appreciated.\n\n- Stacy",
