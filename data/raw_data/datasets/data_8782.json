    "title": "Sound notifications for incoming texts have stopped on Pixel 3a XL - Can't get them back",
    "content": "My wife's Pixel 3a XL no longer provides a sound notification when a text arrives. I have gone into every Settings menu and checked all possible settings (no Safe Mode or Factory Resets have been performed yet). Volume levels are set correctly for Notifications and turned on. Nothing is muted; Do Not Disturb is disabled. I've tried several different sound effects for text notifications- I can hear them when selected from the menu, but nothing happens after they are saved and a text is received.\n\nAside from that, Sounds work correctly for rings etc. although she mentioned the other day that she didn't hear any voice notifications when using the GPS recently in Google Maps. The phone was bought new in December 2019 and this problem only recently started (in the last few months). It is running the latest Android update.\n\nI have the same exact model phone, bought at the same time, and have no issues with sound notifications, nor have I ever had any issues. I looked at her list of Apps compared to mine and don't see anything in particular that might cause the problem.\n\nSuggestions? I've run out of ideas and settings to adjust.",
