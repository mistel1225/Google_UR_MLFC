    "content": "I have contacted someone in help and support. They recommended trying to clear the cache and storage of the Google app and then to uninstall and reinstall it. We also tried to retrain the voice module several times. I also did a factory reset on my phone. But it still either turns off by itself or won't turn on at all. I can't use ok Google with my new phone at all",
