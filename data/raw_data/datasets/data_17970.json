    "content": "Got my New Pixel 4XL phone, specifically to record slow-motion videos. I read a lot of articles online about Pixel phones having the best camera. However, I am utterly disappointed.\nI get a message saying \"Something Went wrong, Part of this video may not be saved\"\n\nI saw a lot of posts, right back from the Pixel 2 era, that this problem exists. If I knew about this issue, and also that Google support is giving solutions such as resetting your phone, uninstalling updates from the camera app, and so on...I would have never brought this crap.\nI tried to remove the updates, it works fine. However, why would I not want to use an updated camera app?\n\nPixel being a \"Google\" Flagship fone, which boasts about its camera, has not yet resolved this problem is utterly not digestible. This is the incapability of Google.\n\nI am writing this post just so that everyone knows the attitude Google has towards a common issue.",
