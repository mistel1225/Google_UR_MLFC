    "content": "Incoming call audio, alarm audio, and haptic feedback audio are all functioning properly. I have the option to use the media volume slider, but regardless of where it's set, I can't hear any audio. I have tried restarting my phone. Do not disturb is off, and media volume is not set to be turned off even when do not disturb is on. It started happening out of nowhere.",
