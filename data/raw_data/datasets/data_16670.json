    "content": "Hey all,\n\nSince updating to the official release of 11, I've been having an issue with my XB1 controller and Pixel 3a. I mostly use the controller to play Call of Duty Mobile, plus other games. The same night after I updated to 11, I wirelessly connected controller to phone. All buttons, sticks and triggers work when navigating Android UI, but in a game only the button presses register. No stick input ever comes through. Any ideas or thoughts/input?\n\nThanks",
