    "content": "When the issue first started, apps just started closing on their own, and then the mic stopped working for all applications, even calls. \n\nI did a hard reset and wiped the device and everything still persisted. \n\nI am not sure what to do at this point because I am travelling in Costa Rica and there are not many places around me that would be able to help trouble shoot this issue. \n\nPlease let me know if anyone knows anyway whatsoever to solve this.",
