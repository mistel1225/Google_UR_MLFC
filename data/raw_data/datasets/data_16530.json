    "content": "My wife was the victim of a racist assault. She got a little bit of it recorded but they took her phone and smashed it repeatedly against the concrete. The screen is completely ripped off and the glass portion of the back shattered. The camera lens module is gone. the USB port and main body of the phone internals seems to be intact. Its pretty clear that the phone wont read or power on in its current state. I am willing to pay for data recovery as this phone might hold legally important information. Is there a way to remove the memory module or a recommended specialist to take this device to for data recovery? I understand that this potentially can cost thousands of dollars. My Wife was severely beaten and only the first few seconds of the attack was caught on a security camera. The cops that arrived were very dismissive of the event and came off as racist themselves. They took a single picture of her face, refused to take any images of her arms/legs/torso where she was repeatedly kicked on the ground. I do not trust these police to actually do anything with this information or the few seconds of video they got from the store. I'm willing to go to extreme lengths to get any video that remains on the phone.",
