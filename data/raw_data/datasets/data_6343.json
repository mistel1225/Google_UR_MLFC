    "content": "About 2 months ago my vibration stopped working. I would restart my phone and then it would start working again. Then one day it stopped vibrating all together. This was annoying but an issue I could deal with since my phone was no longer under warranty. \nThen a few weeks ago, after I updated my phone, I noticed that randomly, throughout the day, my phone would disconnect from wifi and Bluetooth. I could not reconnect till after I restarted my phone.\nA little over a week ago I tried a factory reset and my phone would then continually crash and I would get a System UI failure message before I could even unlock my phone. After restarting in safe mode it stopped continually crashing but I'm still getting a System UI error message and then my phone disconnects from everything. I'm also finding that now when I restart my phone it does not always fix the problem. \n\nI saw a few others were having similar problems but have not yet seen a solution that has worked for me. My last resort is trying to do a rollback to a previous update but I'm not confident in how to do that. So I will take any suggestions.\n\n\nI was hoping to not get a new phone yet, this one is not even 1 1/2 years old yet (and it was bought new). I also loved having a Google phone and would like to continue having google phones, but i don't love that I'm having problems right after my year warranty is up and seem to be having problems finding someone able to help me.",
