    "content": "Documents folder is full of trash that doesn't need to be there any more.  I can remove some documents with the trash can icon at bottom of menu on lower right of document thumbnail.\nBut some documents are flagged \"view only\" above their text when opened (I don't think I ever flagged anything \"view only\") and they are the ones that seem to be written in stone.  No \"remove\" trash can on the menu.  I looked at Settings but nothing relevant there.  I looked through discussions on deleting Files, but that is different from Docs, right?  These unkillable documents were downloaded or copied/pasted  from the internet, maybe violating copyright?  So now copyright is violating me?  Please help me clean up my phone!",
