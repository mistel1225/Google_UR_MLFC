    "content": "I work for a major telecommunication company as an install tech for fiber. I received two pixel 3 phones from work already factory reset presumably just needing a new sim card. But when I attempt to start the setup process I can't get passed the initial Google account recovery stage. Does anyone know of any way to bypass or remove this requirement? I was looking forward to upgrading but the struggle has me rethinking my choice of phone.",
