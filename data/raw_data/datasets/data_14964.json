    "content": "My pixel 3xl is not charging beyond 90% after i updated to android 11, I'm pretty sure it's not a hardware problem because it was working just fine before the update, and when i tried to drain out my battery, the 1% that was left lasted about 30 min while playing a video, which lead me to think that the battery is actually fully charged and is just not displaying the extra 10%, the problem here that it shows that it's still charging and no matter how long i leave it on charger it doesn't go beyond 90%\nAnyone experienced the same? \nIs that an issue that anyone knows how to fix?",
