    "title": "Earbud middle button always triggers audio news now?",
    "content": "I have a Google Pixel 3 and sometimes listen to news by saying \"OK Google, tell me the latest news.\"  After I'm done with the news I usually just close the Google app (that was playing news), and continue to do other things while listening to ebooks in the @Voice Aloud Reader app. The earbuds' middle button can be used to pause and resume the ebook when I need to. Very convenient.\n\nRecently I paired the phone with a new pair of Google 3 earbuds (my original pair was broken), and after the setup I found that the earbud buttons can be used to control Google Assistant. For example when new notifications come in, I can press the top button to listen to the notification, without taking the phone out of my pocket, which is very cool.\n\nBut then I bump into another problem: nowadays when I listen to ebooks in the @Voice Aloud Reader app, and press the middle button to pause the ebook, next time I press the middle button the ebook doesn't resume, instead the audio news starts playing. This often forces me to stop whatever I'm doing, take the phone out of the pocket, and manually close the Google app, to resume the ebook.\n\nIs there an easy way to make the middle button only pause/resume the ebook in @Voice,  instead of always triggering the audio news? Or do I have to completely turn off the earbuds control with Google Assistant, to get back the convenience to pause/resume ebooks in @Voice with the middle button?",
