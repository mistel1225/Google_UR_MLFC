    "content": "When playing music on a Bose speaker, it cuts out very often.   This has been an ongoing problem for the Pixel.  Three years ago, I purchased the XL and it had the same problem but I just lived with it.   It is time that Google fixed this annoying problem.  I have also had this happen with my car bluetooth, and understand that other Pixel users have the same issue.    PLEASE FIX THIS !!",
