    "content": "I am based in India, and Google is giving me a really hard time with respect to providing a loaner device while my device is in repair process. \nThe response time and answer to queries over emails and over phone is poor to say the least. \nI have communicated the issue more than a week ago and they have not even picked up the device for repair till now. \nThis is not what I expected when I bought their flagship phone.",
