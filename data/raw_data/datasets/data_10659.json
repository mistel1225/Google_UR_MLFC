    "content": "Hello,\n\nI just bought my new Pixel 4 phone from eBay. It was written that the phone is unlocked. I used a forwarder and imported the phone to Georgia (the country). I have done so, many times without any problem and everything worked perfectly before.\n\nNow, I am having the following problem - when I first insert my GSM sim card, it works fine, I can make phone calls, send/receive messages and etc. But, as soon as I connect to the Internet, the phone says that the Sim card isn't supported and asks me to contact Verizon.\n\nThe phone is definitely unlocked, because it reads my sim without the Internet. Furthermore, Verizon has a policy, when after 60 days, they automatically unlock phones and 60 days has already passed.\n\nSo, I am quite sure that it is a Google problem (when I received the device, it had Android 10, I updated it to Android 11 and I still have the same problem). After a factory reset, the phone again reads the sim and again does not recognize it after I turn on the Internet.\n\nCan someone help'?\n\nJust in case, here is the video demonstration of the problem - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR6bVrYVXqk",
