    "content": "My original pixel keeps crashing.\nI've had it crash in safe mode, whilst being used, whilst not being used, after being factory reset (two week grace period thankfully but started again), with Android 9, with Android 10, with songs downloaded on spotify, with spotify uninstalled. It started approximately 3/4 months ago. \n\nFor a little while, battery would die for good at progressively worse incriments. Originally 3, then 8, then 12 and finally 21% thankfully that's not happening too often now. But sometimes it will crash at 12% and think it doesn't have enough juice to turn back on. \n\nI've been trawling forums trying to find an answer that actually works. Please help!",
