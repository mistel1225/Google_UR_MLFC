    "content": "Two things. My screen randomly \"blinks\" and comes back. As in, the screen goes dark long enough to blink your eyes and then returns to normal. Secondly, my phone won't allow me to hear calls unless I am on speaker. Very inconvenient. The only fix is to reset but then it does it again after a few calls. Reverts back to speaker. Highly annoying. Phone is running current OS.",
