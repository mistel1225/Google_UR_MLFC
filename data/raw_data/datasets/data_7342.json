    "content": "I bought a used Google Pixel 3 and the last owner is still signed in. Apparently, I can't do anything unless he signs out, but I have no contact with the seller. I did a factory reset and called the Geek Squad to see what can be done, but it still asks me for the last owners log in. How can I reset it?",
