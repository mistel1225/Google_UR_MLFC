    "content": "I have a Google Pixel 3 with Android 11. When I try and record my screen it's just black with no video. Audio is perfectly fine. After doing a Google search I find many people talking about how it goes black with specific apps but with me it's my whole device, even the home screen, it's just not capturing any video. Is there a way to fix this. Much love. Daniel x",
