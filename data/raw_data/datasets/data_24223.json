    "title": "My Pixel 2 XL lags in clearing info from the notification pane and status bar. Can this be resolved?",
    "content": "When I am on What's app call and after I end my call on screen, I can still see the call is on in the notification pane if I scroll down the status bar. Same is with messenger chat heads. If I close Messenger  the chat heads clear from the notification pane after about 6 seconds.\n\nI tried reaching Google support on 2 occasions, once over chat and once over call. We did some troubleshooting steps while I was sharing my screen but I haven't got resolution yet.",
