    "content": "I WOULD boot in safe mode but my phone is stuck in FASTBOOT Mode with Device-State:error. This all happened because, starting today, it kept telling me my unlock password was wrong and the only solution was to reboot, but it would not turn on unless it was plugged it for the last week or so. An hour ago when I rebooted and it got stuck in Fastboot mode.",
