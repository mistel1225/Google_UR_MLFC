    "content": "I was trying to set a photo as my background wallpaper on my home screen, it then zooms in to the point that the image is unrecognizable, I had to take a screenshot of it and set that as the wallpaper.  Note that the images look EXACTLY the same, when I was looking on message boards trying to figure out why you hired people with developmental disabilities to program your phone I read that this bug is not a bug but in fact a feature.  Please explain how zooming in on an image to the point it is unrecognizable is a good idea.",
