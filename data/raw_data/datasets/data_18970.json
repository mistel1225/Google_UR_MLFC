    "title": "My Pixel 3 displaying a distracting background update notification for the phone app.",
    "content": "Recently the phone app frequently displays a notification to indicate that it is updating, but this is incredibly annoying and misleading from a usability perspective since it displays the phone icon at the top of the screen giving me the impression that a call is in progress that i need to end.\n\nFor obvious reasons there doesn't appear to be a way of disabling phone notifications, but there should certainly be a way of disabling or changing this! \n\nHas anyone else noticed the issue - I couldn't see anything in the community.",
