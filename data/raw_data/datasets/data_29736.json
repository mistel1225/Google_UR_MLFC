    "content": "The camera on my Pixel 2 XL has stopped working.  When I click on the camera the app opens, however the screen is black, as if the camera did not initialize.  After a few seconds, the camera app closes.  Here are the things I have tried and none have worked:\n\n1.  Forced closed and Cleared Data and Cache.\n2.  Uninstalled the camera app and reinstalled.\n3.  Restarted in safe mode\n4.  Ran Recovery option on startup\n5. Factory Data Reset\n\nThe problem occurred around June 5, 2019.  My phone did an update around this time, and it has not worked since. I REALLY like the camera on my Pixel, however it is very frustrating not being able to take pictures.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.\n\nChristopher",
