    "content": "My phone went out of battery yesterday and will not charge. I've followed the instructions from the forum (using multiple original chargers and cables, and even tried a suggestion of using a wireless charger) to no avail. I've checked the physical condition of my phone and the USB-C connector, which all seems to be okay to me. I've also tried, as the forum suggested, to charge via my pc, my computer indicate there was a Qualcomm HS-USB QDLoader 9008 connected on devices setting in Windows, but there's no further indication of the phone, as there's no red light (flashing or on) or the charging logo on my screen.  From the touch of my phone, I'm very certain that it is not charging through the charger or the computer. Did any one encountered the same issue?",
