    "content": "Hello Pixel Community-\n\nRecently my Google Pixel 3 battery has been draining fairly quickly...roughly at about 75% after just having it on idle after unplugging from an evening charge. Once it gets down to about 50% it has now been randomly resetting. If it gets lower than 50%, sometime around 20% or so it will just rapidly start counting down the % as the seconds go by: 19%, 18%, 17% etc. Does this indicate its time to buy a new battery? I've had the phone for about 1 yr 8 mon.\n\nThanks,\nChris",
