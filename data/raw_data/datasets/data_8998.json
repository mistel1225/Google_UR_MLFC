    "content": "I've had the pixel 4a 5g only for some days on the January security patch. The phone freezes often when waking up and the wake up gestures do not work as well. Some times the proximity sensor would stop functioning. The device overall is very buggy and difficult to use. I have to keep restarting it.",
