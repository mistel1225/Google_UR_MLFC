    "content": "No amount of troubleshooting has allowed me to isolate this problem. Safe mode, safe mode with wifi/data disabled. Not even an RMA with a brand new phone has distanced me from this problem. What do I do to fix this? Countless factory resets, and I even moved to the Q beta. It's all the same. Is this hardware related? Will it ever be fixed? I've submitted bug reports on the issue tracker and one of them ended with a \"this will be sent to the developers\" response. However I'm not confident there will ever be a fix. I love this phone for everything else but why do I have to Sprint my $1100 phone to the charger before it dies. I Google this problem once every couple months. I know I'm not alone. Maybe every phone has this problem and the majority of people just don't allow their phone to reach 15% or lower. Anybody ?",
