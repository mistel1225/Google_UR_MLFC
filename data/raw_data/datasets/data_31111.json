    "content": "When on a BT headset, or Android Auto, when I pick up an incoming call BT disconnects.  It happens randomly.  Usually works OK after I reboot the phone (and the car head unit when using Android Auto).  So annoying!  It's been going on for at least 6 months, through several OS updates.  Forgetting and re-pairing devices doesn't help.",
