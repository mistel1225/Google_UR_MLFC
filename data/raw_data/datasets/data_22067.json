    "content": "Hello everybody,\n\n2 days ago , when I wanted to plug my Pixel 4 to my AC Charge (same as usual) it did not charge.\nI tried another charging cable but same result.  When I tried again 3h later (only 1% battery remaining) it worked.\nToday same issue I already tried 3 different cable and non of them work. I used to charge the phone on all those cable (1 at work, 1 at home etc...) and it always worked fine until 2 days ago.\n\nI tried safe mode restart, developper mode , change cable, change socket etc... but nothing is working. A friend of mine borrowed me a wireless samsung station and it works but it is very slow.\n\nI precise that I have the USB Preference page in \"Settings\" all greyed out.\n\nDo you think about a solution for the issue ? Priority would be the charging issue ...\n\nRegards,\n\nBO",
