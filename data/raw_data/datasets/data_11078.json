    "content": "Google photos gets stuck while \"getting ready to back up\"\nI can only trigger the upload after deleting and restoring the photos from trash.\n\nI tried all of the typical ways to fix it like clearing data and cache, removing and re-adding my account, removing and re-adding permissions, uninstalling and reinstalling the app.\n\nThis issue is still there and now I can't see all of my older photos (before April 2020) on the first page. I can only see those photos by going to the \"recently added\" section in Google photos.",
