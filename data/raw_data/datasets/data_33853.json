    "content": "I purchased my Pixel 3 through the Google store after being sent an offer for a £75 voucher. The voucher has never been forthcoming. How do I contact Google directly to chase this? The specific offer sent to me was \"Get £75 Promotional Balance when you buy Pixel 3 or Pixel 3 XL from UK Google Store. Offer valid starting on 9/10/2018 at 8am BST until 1/11/2018 at 6.59am GMT. \"\n\nApologies if this is in the wrong place, it was rather hard to navigate the help community screens.",
