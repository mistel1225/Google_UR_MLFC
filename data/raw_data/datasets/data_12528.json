    "title": "Pixel 5 Unable to activate phone",
    "content": "Hallo,\nToday I received a brand new Pixel 5. After charging it to 100% and swapping out the simcard from my old Pixel 2 I went to activating the 5.\n\nUpon booting it gives me the language screen, then select wifi, all fine.\nThen it comes to \"copy apps and data\". So far I've tried both ways, via connecting my old Pixel 2 and copying using the \"can't use old phone\".\nBoth options ultimate result in the screen saying:\n\"Verify PIN, your phone was reset to factory settings. To use this phone, enter your previous PIN\"\nNow obviously I've tried my old PIN from pixel 2, and even the obvious 0000 and 1234, but none work.\n\nThe option to use my google account on the Verify PIN screen also keeps looping me into saying: \"Please sign in using one of the owner's accounts\"\n\nFrom what I've been able to gather on the internet and around here, it seems that Factory Reset Protection has been triggered for some unknown reason. Now obviously the phone is brand new so there shouldn't be any accounts associated with this phone.\n\nIf anyone knows how to get around, please do let me know as I've tried everything I could think off besides returning the phone.\n\nThanks!",
