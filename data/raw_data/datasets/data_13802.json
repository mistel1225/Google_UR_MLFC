    "content": "I don't understand why there isn't an option to view my call history with the date and time.  I don't need or want my phone to hide call log entries by combining multiple calls to the same contact or not display the date because it was Monday this week.  \n\nThe way the call history logs are displayed is virtually useless, if I called someone twice I want to see 2 entries with specific date and time for that call, not that the contact had 2 calls and the data for only one of them.  \n\nRight now I use an App to send this info over to Microsoft Outlook so I can maintain an accurate call history for work and even then I'm not 100% confident. This is really a major failure in my view.",
