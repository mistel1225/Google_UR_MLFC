    "content": "Dear all,\n\nI have a problem with my Pixel 3XL(till latest update). \n\nIt sometimes happen not to get into Android without PIN even I have setup finger print. \n\nI cannot find the way to reproduce. But, It will happen again.\n\nDoes someone have such a problem with Pixel 3 XL?\n\nEven If I did not have any third party application, I will get the issue. \n\nI don't use \"active edge\" and \"find my device\" and Wi-Fi client and GPS(usually off). Also, I have several Google account on Android. Those use physical token.\n\nAccording to Google Pixel support, It will happen when there is not secure condition. And, They did not tell me enough about the case. But, I just keep putting it on Pixel Stand or laying it down on my desk or holding it to walk or keeping it into my pocket. If It's true that not secure condition, We need to know what is root cause by log or message. what is not secure condition, insecure or unsecure.\n\nKindly give me advice. It's troublesome to face the issue even it's not a big impact. But, It depends on the occasion and more.",
