    "content": "You might have heard that Samsung already have 4 years of updates, beating Google's 3 year policy that used to be unmatched and the best. I just really hope that Google could match or beat that, especially considering Samsung has many times more models to support than Google.\n\nWe might eventually see that as Google are partnering with Qualcomm to make more updates possible, starting with the Snapdragon 888. But Samsung managed to do that with older SoCs.\n\nSo, here's a potential plan:\nFor Pixels with the 888 and newer SoCs (most likely starting with the Pixel 6), 4 years of monthly security and OS updates and 1 extra year of quarterly security updates. For older Pixels, 3 years of monthly security and OS updates (as it currently is) and 1 extra year of quarterly security updates.\n\nThis would be great considering more and more people are holding on to their existing devices.",
