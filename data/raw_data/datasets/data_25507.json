    "content": "Hi all, new issue with battery drain on my device over past 3 weeks or so. Normally don't have to charge until I go to bed on a normal day but am getting to 50% by lunch time at the moment! \n\nOnly thing I can see is an obtuse amount of percentage going into the screen - as per battery usage in settings. I've attached a pic. \n\nAnyone else had a similar issue or have any ideas on fixing it? I've tried resetting but no luck.",
