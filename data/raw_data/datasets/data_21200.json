    "content": "Hi All,\n\nI've just switched over from an iPhone XS to a Pixel 3a and I'm liking it so far but have a few issues. \n\n1) I am wanting to have it so when I receive a WhatsApp message, nothing shows in notifications I just get the app dot, however I have this selected but it only works of I have the notifications coming through on my home screen. This is the same with other apps. \n\nI have done some research and tried all suggestions I have found (making sure it's on Google launcher and dot notifications is enabled etc) but it's still not working? \n\n2) The app icons are too small. I've tried increasing the display size but all the text increases and looks terrible. I've also tried Nova launcher but could access the app draw?\n\nAny advice would be appreciated! \n\nJoe",
