    "title": "it recently has started running slow when I use some Snapchat filters: tha baby face filter.",
    "content": "I have had this for two months now. It was really good and snappy. However, after I updated it, it has started acting like a pixel 4: activates when I lift it up. and it runs really slow now. I can't use some snapchat filters as I used to because the real-time processed image is displayed at around 1-hertz frequency. (so slow it feels like an old keypad-phone recording a video)",
