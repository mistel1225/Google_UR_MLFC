    "content": "I'M REALLY MAD!!!\n\nBeen using Google camera for a while and love it. But the recent photo preview to switch to the gallery app doesn't work!!! But I didn't want to use Google photos. Decided to go with a alternate gallery app.\n\nWell it doesn't work!\n\nGoogle camera only works with Google photos?!?\nWhy?\n\nIs their a setting I'm missing or what is going on?\n\nBeen dealing with this for months?!?\n\nAny help is appreciated!\n\nEdit:\nThe culprit seems to be when you click on the recent photo circle it explicitly specifies (com.google.android.apps.photos) package name as the target.\n\nAnd I can't seem to figure out how to change it?",
