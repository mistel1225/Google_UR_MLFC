    "content": "I just got a new Pixel 3 after I sent my old one in to get the broken camera repaired. Unfortunately, there is a new issue now. People can barely understand me in calls. My voice is intermittent, blurry and very silent, except when using the USB-C headset. However, voice recordings and memos work fine, so the microphone itself is probably not the problem. Any ideas?",
