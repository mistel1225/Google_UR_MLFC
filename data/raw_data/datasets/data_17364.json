    "content": "So many closed questions/forums discussing the front-facing camera squishing/distorting images during the processing. It's incredibly frustrating to see that this has been going on so long and there isn't even an optional setting to turn this off. \n\nIt shrinks my forehead, enlarges my nose and juts out my chin. I've tried turning on and off every possible setting.  You can see in the initial image it looks normal, then the processing loads, and I look like a caveman. Its odd because I just upgraded from the OG pixel to the 4a. I never had this issue before on my Pixel and now I'm regretting my purchase of the 4a if this can't be fixed. \n\nI bought this phone for the nice camera, so what gives?",
