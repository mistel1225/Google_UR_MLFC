    "content": "My phone's battery has not been reliably charging when plugged into the wall with the original charger, sometimes it charges sometimes it doesn't. I've tried a different charger and different plug socket and have the same issue. It was charging when plugged into my laptop however now when plugged into my laptop it is only charging slowly and is saying 4 hours until full and it's on 20%. I've tried cleaning the port, putting it in safe mode and it makes no difference. My phone is only just over a year old and google assistant is saying the battery is fine so I'm not sure what to do.",
