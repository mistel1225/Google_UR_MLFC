    "content": "I have an ongoing issue with callers to my number not hearing a ringing sound i.e. they hear complete silence until I answer or it goes to voicemail. This has only been an issue with the Pixel 4a as far as I'm aware and was brought to my attention a couple of months ago (unsure if it's been a problem the whole 7 months I've had the phone as I obviously can't tell from my end).\n\nThe strange part is it's only happening with certain callers. All of my frequent callers (e.g. family members) hear a dial/ring tone. If I test from my desk landline I hear no ringing sound, and have had this issue confirmed by several others including my carrier.\n\nI've tried troubleshooting with the carrier (including SIM replacement which has not solved the issue) and have an open case with them but I am wondering if this is a known issue and any possible solutions?\n\nTo be very clear - the phone rings at my end and I am able to answer the call as normal. The problem is callers are always surprised when I answer because they haven't heard any ringing sound.\n\nDevice is up to date with Android 11 as of 5 June 2021.\n\nThanks,",
