    "content": "In the past few days, I've had trouble getting my screen to respond to touch or button pressing (power and volume buttons on right side). My phone acknowledges the touch input but freezes completely dark. Taking my phone case off usually helps, as does putting the case back on if I've left it off for a few hours. My screen is completely undamaged and I haven't dropped my phone in ages (and never from a significant height or in a way that impacted the screen directly). Restarting my phone helps sometimes but not always. \nThis problem didn't start until I moved into a new house with a swamp cooler, so maybe it's moisture getting in my phone somehow? If anyone has any advice, it'd be greatly appreciated! In the meantime, I think I'll start backing up things like photos and apps.",
