    "content": "A few weeks ago, I began to notice some oddities with the phone's display; things like colors shifting in brightness, etc. This developed into the appearance of scan lines on the display, and today, after the display flickered several times and displayed some garbled pixels, the display has gone completely dark. I held the power key and got haptic feedback at first, so I shut the phone off with a long press. I am now trying to power it back on, to no avail.",
