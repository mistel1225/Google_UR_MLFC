    "content": "I turned my pixel 3 to 3G mode only, because I have some troubles with phone calling via LTE in country where I am right now, but I discovered a problem with GPS, it doesn't work at all. As soon I turn on LTE then immediately GPS starts work properly. I've tried to set device mode only GPS setting but it didn't help.",
