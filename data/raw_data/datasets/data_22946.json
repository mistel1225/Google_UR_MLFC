    "content": "I have a Pixel 3XL and I need to copy a number of email addresses (approximately 30) from a column in Google Sheets and then paste them into an email I am composing with a view to them being the recipients. I am able to copy the column of email addresses but Gmail is not allowing me to paste them. When this failed I tried to copy and paste them individually but it did still not work. Any ideas? Thanks in advance.",
