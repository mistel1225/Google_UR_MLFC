    "content": "Stock device crashed on normal usage. After showing a corrupted white screen with the Google logo it doesn't turn on anymore. I've tried pressing power button and also power + volume up or down. Nothing happens, no noise, no vibration, no lights turning on, nothing...\n\nOn windows, when connected through USB, the device name shown is \"Qualcomm HS-USB QDLoader 9008\". There were some other people with this problem in the past, but no easy solution, only getting a new phone through warranty.\n\nIs there a solution to this problem?\n\nAlso, regarding the warranty, this phone was bought less than a year ago, but I'm not from the US and I'm using the phone in another country. Am I still eligible for warranty?",
