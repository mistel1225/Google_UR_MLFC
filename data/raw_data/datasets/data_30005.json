    "content": "My Pixel 2xl shuts down randomly while charging. \nI won't be state side for the next year+  and the country I am in is not \"on the list\" of countries...\n\nEven tho it is quite liberating shutting down my phone for 4-5 hours of slow charge, the people I answer to tend to not like it as much as I do.. \n\nI've tried factory reset and had no effect. \n\nPlease.. PLEASE... help :) \n\nCheers, \n\nRam",
