    "content": "Hi, event hough I have installed the latest update (this weekend), my proximity sensor on my Pixel 3xl is just dead.\nIt's only since I have android 11 and trust me my phone becomes unusable. \nIt can't be that Google has no solution after two months? Any chance you can help? This could be a reason some customers leave Android as they can't afford such problems without solutions for so long.",
