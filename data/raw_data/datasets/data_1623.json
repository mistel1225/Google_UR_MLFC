    "content": "From time to time, my phone freeze and the screen is not responsive anymore. Sometimes it even merges the home screen with apps screen together making it look wired. Today it even shut off, and then asked me to reset it to factory setting, or try again. I hit try again, and luckily it worked fine. And there are other times when the screen layout looks wired, and also when Google Maps app (which is supposedly to work perfectly on Pixel) freezes and won't let me zoom in or out. I'm really fed up with this. Therefore, I really love the phone and I don't wanna leave you any bad review, so is there a chance where o could get a replacement phone?\n\nThank you,\nJamal",
