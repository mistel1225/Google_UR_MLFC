    "content": "My Nike SNKRS app only updates when I log out and log back in. \n\nSo my friend who has iphone would ask me \"did you see those XYZ that drop on the 14th?\"\n\nMy response after scrolling the app is \"I dont see any release for the 14th they all stop at the 1st\"\n\nI log out and log back in to app and boom! I have the updated list, even exceeding the 14th etc. \n\nIs this an app issue with android/google? or is it just me that is affected. \n\nApp also shows releases as Sold Out the moment they are released but I can open the web browser at \nnike.com/launch and still select my size and checkout successfully.",
