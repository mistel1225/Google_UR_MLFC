    "content": "Hello. I recently installed the 2nd iteration of the android Q beta. It worked great until one day, I woke up and took a picture with the camera. I went to go look at and showed the picture but quickly blinked away. Plus, they are showing up in my files, and not google photos. Please let me know if you can help me on this issue.",
