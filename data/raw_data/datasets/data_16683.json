    "content": "My phone fell from my hand and then the screen went Black. Sometimes I can see the burned pixels, but I think the phone discharged during night and it's problably blocked in the homescreen without fingerprint sensor allowed. I want to know if there is anyway to check if other functions from the phone are working, cause 'Ok google' doens't seem to be working.",
