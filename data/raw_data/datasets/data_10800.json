    "title": "Pixel 4a android version 11 messages notification bug (not showing notifications)",
    "content": "I ordered and received the brand new Pixel 4a ordered direct from Google Store, that arrived only a couple days ago. It's been a fantastic phone for 48 hours. However, today I noticed that there is likely a bug or if not, please let me know of how to correct it, with the google messages notification setting. I don't believe I noticed this at all for the past 48 hours as I was getting notifications fine. I have made no major adjustments in my notification settings. This is Android version 11. Volume and notifications all on.\n\nTHE ISSUE:\nAll default message notifications are set to \"silent.\" (SEE screenshot here: https://imgur.com/o7xPBtH ) I individually have go in to each contact's notification setting and uncheck and then recheck the \"Show notifications\" button, which will take it from having selected \"Silent\" and then resets it to \"Default: May ring or vibrate based on phone settings.\"\nWhat is the solution here? I found some old reddit threads with a similar issue with Android 10 and Pixel 3's.",
