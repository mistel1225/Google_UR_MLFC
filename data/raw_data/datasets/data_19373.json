    "content": "I have a Pixel 3 and I have set a photo for my wallpaper. Every day or sometimes twice a day, the wallpaper changes to another photo (always the same one). I have cleared the storage and cache in the wallpaper app. I have force stopped, disabled, and restarted the wallpaper app. I have selected the Google wallpaper in the app, and then changed it to a photo, and again, the phone changes it to the same old photo that I did not choose.",
