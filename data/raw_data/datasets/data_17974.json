    "content": "Hey, my phone is the a pixel 4 xl and im running the latest andriod vesrion.\nWhen I get incomming video calls my microphone doesn't seem to work but when I put the video call app in the background (like what you can do in WhatsApp) the other person can hear me bus since I can't see them and they can't see me it kinda makes the call just a regular call.\nThe wierd thing is that in WhatsApp (haven't tried it yet in other apps) when I start the call every thing goes just fine.\nI know a lot pf people had this problem but most of the solutions are doing a factory reset and it is a real bother to back up all of my massages and contacts ect  just for one problem that existed ever since I bought the phone.\nSaying that, if there is no other solution I will do the reset since this problem is really annoying i just wanted to know of there is another solution.",
