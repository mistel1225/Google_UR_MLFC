    "title": "Pixel Repair Tool says unable to connect to USA unlocked Pixel 4a",
    "content": "I bought an unlocked Pixel 4a from Best Buy back in 9/20. I use an AT&T prepaid plan. Yesterday morning, my phone shut off and won't get past the Google 'G' with a loading bar under it. Instead of factory resetting, I wanted to see if the Repair Tool could fix it. I followed the instructions exactly, but when it gets to the Connect your Pixel phase, I'm told its Unable to inspect.\n\nI have tried every carrier provided for every country listed. Nothing works. I also tried popping out my sim card. It makes no difference. Again, this is an unlocked pixel purchased and used in the United States.\n\n\n\nI did some googling, looks like my 4a is in a bootloop. I've let it run for 18 hours straight, and it will not get past the 'G'. I can't boot into recovery mode either. I hope this additional information is useful.",
