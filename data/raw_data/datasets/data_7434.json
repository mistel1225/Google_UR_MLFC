    "title": "My Pixel 4 makes a static sound, then reboots after certain videos play.",
    "content": "This happens at random times, not every time, but if I play a video - whether on Snapchat, Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, even on webpages - it sometimes makes a loud static smacking sound and the phone goes into reboot. If I go back to the same video, it will do it again... if I skip that video and go into a different video it usually does not do it. It's weird because I can't narrow it down to one kind of video or a specific app. So far, the only place I haven't experienced the issue is playing videos from my phone's gallery (knock on wood). I don't know what else to do. I'm on Android 11, but the problem started before the update, though it's more frequent after.",
