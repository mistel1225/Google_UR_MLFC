    "content": "The phone is suddenly charging far more rapidly than before. It used to take about one minute for every percent increase, but now it's only taking 23 seconds per percent increase. The battery is also draining about 50% faster. I've tried deleting the new game I downloaded, restarting the phone, and turning off ambient display. Does anyone know what's going on?",
