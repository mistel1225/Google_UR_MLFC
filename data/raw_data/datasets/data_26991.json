    "content": "I skipped the process of transferring data between phones. I had the phones plugged in but it was taking forever, It said I could transfer data after setup, so being as impatient as I am, I skipped it. I then learn that I have to wait until the phone prompts me to finish the setup to start transferring data between the phones. But its been several days now and my PIxel 4 XL hasn't prompted me at all. \n\nWithout hard resetting the Pixel 4 XL, is there any way to force the data transfer process?",
