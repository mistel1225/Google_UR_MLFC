    "content": "Hello,\n\ndoes the Pixel 4 supports VoLTE for the physical SIM and eSIM in parallel or will enabling VoLTE on the physical SIM disable the usage for the eSIM? Imagine that both sim providers will support VoLTE on their network. I'm forced to use the physical SIM with VoLTE enabled and would like to ensure that the eSIM will work with VoLTE as well.\n\nBest Regards",
