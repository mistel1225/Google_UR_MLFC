    "content": "I've preordered Pixel 4 and received it on the 25th of October. The story could have ended there but, unfortunately, it seemed to me that my phone had a problem - the screen looked yellowish. \nI've contacted support to ask if the yellowishness is okay or if I got a defected device and after trying to change a few settings the support person offered me to do an exchange. Moreover, he offered me an \"advanced\" exchange - which meant that they freeze Pixel's price from my bank account (I've already payed for the first Pixel, and they will freeze money for the second one), then they send me new device first, after that courier picks the defected one and they unfreeze my money.\n\"Cool\", I thought, very convenient and thoughtful of you Google.\nI should have started feeling that something is wrong here but I didn't. Neither did I when courier came and picked my defected phone first. \"Mmmm, okay, maybe they just got timelines screwed, it happens.\"\n\nBut I never got my phone. Today is 29th of November. All I got from these guys was support bullshit bingo with phrases like \"I AM NOW PERSONALLY SOLVING THIS PROBLEM MAXIM. JUST GIVE ME 24 HOURS\". I gave them 24 hours. Like 10 times.\n\nOkay Google, I understand that I've bought the orange Pixel 4 that is in high demand and you must just have sold mine and now you don't have it. \nI have two questions:\n- Will you at least give my money back or are you frauding me?\n- Is this the way to treat customers that preordered the phone for more than 1k SGD? \n\nPosting question here because as I said support is just bullshitting me over.\nThanks!",
