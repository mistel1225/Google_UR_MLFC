    "content": "Post the update today morning. My phone did not recover from the restart and it is stuck in the Google Loading window. I tried rebooting, going into recovery mode and restarting. No Luck. Currently have kept it shut down to retry after sometime.  Meanwhile while in recovery, while I click on run System Test, it says Installing Updates and then comes out abruptly which leads me to think that there is an issue in the updates being installed. Please advise asap as I am stuck with nothing happening and at this time of the pandemic and lock down in the nation.",
