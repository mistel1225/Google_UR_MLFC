    "content": "Hi everyone, \n\nI just got a Pixel 5 and I'd like to know how to take a photo using a voice command (i.e. instead of pressing the shutter button, which I find difficult as I only have one hand). \n\nI haven't found anything about this in the settings. I've had a look online and have found that I can say \"OK Google, take a photo\" and this does technically work, but that takes about 10 seconds in total which isn't ideal. \n\nMy old Samsung phone let me just say \"shoot\" with the camera app open and it would instantly take a photo. Does anyone know if/how I can do this with the Pixel 5?\n\nThanks!",
