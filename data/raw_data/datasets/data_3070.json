    "content": "Just got the Pixel 4a last night and skipped data transfer in the setup. I was just trying to finish setup this morning and do the data transfer from my old phone, but it got all screwed up. I was curious if I could do it without a cable because my old android phone's port only works 10% of the time, but when I clicked that option it said the only available device was my husband's iPhone and there was no option to go back or make any other choices whatsoever. I restarted the phone in the hopes it would take me back to finish the setup, but now there isn't that option anywhere in the settings.",
