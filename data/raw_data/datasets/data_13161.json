    "content": "when i make an outbound or accept inbound call i no longer have the merge feature. Also when on the phone regardless of outbound or inbound generated, when another call comes in, i can no longer swipe up to answer call #2 and it use to put call #1 on hold and it use to allow me to then merge the two calls if necessary. i have rebooted and searched for settings and have found none.  Also when on a call and i select speaker, i now have to select, deselect and select again to get the speaker to turn on.",
