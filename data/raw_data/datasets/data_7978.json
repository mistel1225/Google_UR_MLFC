    "content": "When I finish a call the screen stays off. I have to press power or fingerprint scanner to get the screen back on to hang up. If I make a test call I can cover and uncover the proximity sensor and it reacts accordingly. It seems more like an issue of the phone sleeping after a while than a sensor issue. Very frustrating. Is this normal behaviour?",
