    "content": "I have tried all steps in the forum to try and get the phone working properly up to and including a factory reset. Now when the device tries to install updates during initial setup, it still shuts down. Before the factory reset I was able to keep the phone running when it was in airplane mode but as soon as the wifi or cellular signal was connected, the phone would shut down. \n\nAlso the speakers sound horrible.",
