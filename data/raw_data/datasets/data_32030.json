    "content": "My Google Pixel 3 phone which I got 3 months ago, recently turned off randomly\nThe first time I turned it back on, it was on for about a minute before turning off again\nThe second time, it lasted about 5 minutes\nBut now it won't turn on. I plugged it in to a charger, won't charge, used 3 different chargers so its not the charger, I tried the Volume down + Power, doesn't work, held the power button, won't work. I tried for ages but it didn't work. Anyone know the problem and how I can fix it before I just end up swapping it for god knows how much.\nThanks.",
