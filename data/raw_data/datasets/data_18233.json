    "content": "Hi all, my google pixel 3 selfie camera can't fully zoom in. It can only zoom in until 1.4x. 1.5x and above, the screen go white. If we took a shot 1.5x and above, the photo also goes white. I already try safe mode. The result also the same. Is it the hardware problem? Please help.",
