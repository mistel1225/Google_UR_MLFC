    "content": "I want to create a folder of photos stored on my device (like an apple iphone would have). I dont want an album on google photos because I cannot upload the album directly to instagram like I can with a folder stored on my device. Apple iphones would let me upload my “favorites” photo folder directly to instagram. I cannot upload albums on google photos to instagram. How do I create a folder on my local device to upload to instagram?",
