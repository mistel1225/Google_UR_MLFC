    "title": "Pixel 3a CANNOT CHARGE - continuously connects and disconnects non stop and so doesnt charge",
    "content": "When i plug my phone in, it starts and stops charging NON stop and so doesnt accumulate any actual charge. I know its starting and stopping b/c i can see in the battery icon, and the noise + vibration signalling charging doesnt stop playing. this only started happening after the most recent android update, i havent even had the phone for a full year i bought it in march 2020",
