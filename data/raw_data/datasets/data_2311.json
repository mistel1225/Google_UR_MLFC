    "title": "Faulty Offline Google Assistant",
    "content": "Before, I can do offline google assistant commands (\"open camera app,\" \"send SMS to _\", \"start voice recording\", etc).\n\nNow, I cannot do offline google assistant commands anymore. I have checked online for solutions. The most common one is download \"English (US)\" for the Offline Voice Recognition and it should work.\n\nI have done so, it didn't work. I have uninstalled and reinstalled the language; it still didn't work. I have attached a screenvid for reference.\n\nGoogle team, please help me with this. I think Google is advance enough to offer bug fixes WITHOUT doing a system-wide reset. I do not want to do a reset.\n\nThanks",
