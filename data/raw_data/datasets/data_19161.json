    "title": "Bought Extended warranty but forgot email address",
    "content": "I purchased an extended warranty through Google when ordering Pixel 3 and the warranty is supposed to carry me through Oct 2020. Since Google has become famous for crappy phones, this is another star in their cap. They replaced my device because of a critical fault and supposedly somewhere the email ID associated with my extended warranty got changed. I need to replace the phone again (recurring reboot loop) but unable to proceed so because of the email ID mess that was created by Google. Putting my IMEI # in the repair center shows me that I still have the extended warranty but I can't take advantage of it. This has caused me definite financial loss as I have been trying to just file a claim but being settled between Google and Assurant for the past 5 days, but for both these companies, email address supersedes everything else. I can see the order in my Google store but for Google and Assurant that is not the right email address. Please advise otherwise for me this is falling me in the shady practice of selling something and not honoring the contract at their end.",
