    "title": "Is there any way to escalate for pixel 3 hardware support?",
    "content": "My pixel 3xl’s screen had broken due to a small unfortunate accident and it was collected by B2X on 22nd Aug with a promise of returning within 5-7 working days. Also, I had made a timely payment after they had sent the quotation and payment link over the email. Today is 4th September, and inspite of multiple follow- ups, I haven’t heard either from google support or b2x. In simple words, it’s very unreasonable and pathetic customer service. \n\nWill appreciate any help?\n\nThanks,\nSuhail Kaul",
