    "content": "Just got the 4a and can't believe how strong the vibration is for calls and notifications. Is there a way to adjust this? I went to Accessibility - Vibration and Haptic Strength but the only option is to toggle On or Off, not adjust intensity higher or lower. Please add this feature if it is not already available. I haven't had a phone this loud in years and I'm quite surprised Google has missed the mark",
