    "title": "My Goggle pixel 2 camera is dead with Android 10 even with the November 7.2 update",
    "content": "Tried everything the hundreds of other comments on the various form posts/threads here have said.  Nothing has worked.  This update bricked the camera on my Pixel 2 XL.  The selfie cam still works but nothing works with the rear facing camera.  I tried force closing the camera app, uninstalling the update, restarting my phone, re-downloading the update, etc.  Other people in other form threads have said they even did a full system wipe and factory reset and their cameras still don't work.  Look at all the 1-star reviews for the camera app on the Google play store.  This is crazy.  This update has been out over a month and nothing has been done to fix this or even acknowledge there is an issue with the update.  What is going on Google?\n\nIf anyone has any suggestions besides the common and no brainer ones please let me know.",
