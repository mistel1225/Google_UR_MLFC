    "content": "Hi, I'm using google pixel 3XL right now. Because it's quite hard to get this phone in my country, I just got it in less than a year ago (may 2020 - brand new not second phone) and planning to use it for at least the next 2 years. Once I got it, I bought several stuffs for the phone like the case and etc from google store overseas.\n\nThese are the chronology of my issues last night:\n\nLast time my Pixel 3 XL also had a sudden turn off, but it went back on quite smoothly after turning the power on\nUntil last night, as I was browsing through my Spotify, the phone turned off and went black. I tried to booting up the phone, and successfully enter the landing screen, but after I entered the pin, it shutting down again.\nAfter that I've tried to enter into safe mode and the problem on the point 1 is still occur\nAnd then i tried to booting up the phone once more, with these following settings:\nAirplane mode on\nAfter entered the pin, i turn off the airplane mode, and turning on the mobile data only\nWait for a few minutes, and then turning on the wifi\nThankfully my phone is turned on until now\n\nSo based on my experience above, I tried to do a quick research and found that this issue probably because of the motherboard failure,\n\nI really love this phone, can someone help for my issue here?",
