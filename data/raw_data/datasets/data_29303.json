    "title": "My Pixel 2 XL won't charge while on.",
    "content": "I just charged it for the first time out of the box and it charged fine, then I plugged in for my second charge and nothing. So I powered off and on again, nothing. I powered off, waited a few seconds and then connected and it seemed to be charging. I tried powering on and connecting again but it didn't work. Eventually I powered off, waited a few minutes and connected and it charged, turned on and kept charging. I tried charging in safe mode and nothing, so no apps are the cause of this.\n\nI wouldn't think it's hardware because it does charge, but only after rebooting. I could master reset to factory settings but if there's something else I can try please let me know.",
