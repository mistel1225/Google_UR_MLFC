    "content": "Since I updated my Pixel 3 XL to Android 10 in October the Ambient Display has ceased working. The \"Lift to Wake\" feature does not work at all and when I double tap on the screen I am sent straight to the lockscreen instead of the ambient mode activating.\n\nI have already factory reset the phone as well as simply toggling the settings on and off.\n\nIs there any other option to fix the bug or does it require a software update?",
