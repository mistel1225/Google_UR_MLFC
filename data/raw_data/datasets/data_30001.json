    "content": "Just got my pixel 3 but...\nAfter editing a slow motion video and choosing which bits I want in the slower speed, I have 2 problems when uploading the video to social media or backing up the file. \n1. When backing up the video or If i select the video from the social media app itself it goes completely into slow motion ignoring the adjustments I made. \n2. if I share the video from the photos app to the social media platform the changes I made stay the same, but the audio quality messes up? \nIs there a way to upload excatly what I'm seeing/hearing in the photos app to social media platforms?\nAny suggestions? Thank you.",
