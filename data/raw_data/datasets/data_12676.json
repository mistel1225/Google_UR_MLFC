    "content": "Pixel 4A should have face unlock. Many devices are having face unlock. Even though it's not as secure it should be there as an option. It doesn't have infrared sensor so can't work in dark but it's not necessary. It should not work with eyes closed. It should be using the camera only for face unlock as many devices are doing it. As it has only a camera in front on top it should be capable.\n\nIt used to be there in older versions of android hidden in setting under smart lock and you could set up trusted face. Google needs to add back face unlock in the latest version of android and there should be an option to tick directly skip lockscreen or stay on lockscreen.",
