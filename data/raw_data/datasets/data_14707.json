    "content": "I set up my new Pixel 4a and it has automatically downloaded the 200-odd apps that I had on my old phone. My problem is that the apps that require sign in and password are asking me to sign in as if I have never used them before. Is there a way to transfer all my passwords from my old phone (Honor 7x) to my new Pixel 4a so that the apps just sign in automatically as I obviously don't want to have to go through dozens of apps and look up my passwords and sign in all over again.",
