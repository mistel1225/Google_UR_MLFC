    "title": "Data transfer for a frozen Pixel XL",
    "content": "Recently my Pixel XL froze up on the Google screen.  I can no longer power it up or down.  A replacement phone (same model) is on the way.  I asked the rep at the store if they can transfer my data (text messages, contacts) into the replacement.  I was told she doesn't make enough money to do that.  My question to the community is: can it be done at all?  I will seek out someone with more technical expertise if someone knows it can be done. Thank you!",
