    "content": "Had bought a new Pixel 5 from from Spectum. Also had Spectrum phone Service. I live in Florida, had to go to NJ for my mom's funeral. When I got to NJ got message on phone, \"EMERGENCY CALLS ONLY\". I switched back to Verizon carrier when i returned to Florida after 24 days.  Verizon tried 6 different SIM cards and spent 4 hours trying to program phone I bought at Spectrum. Spectrum made me pay for phone ($640) and advised phone was Sim card unlocked. Had to buy another Pixel 5 through Verizon. What do I do with new Pixel 5 phone from Spectrum?  Spectrum advises phone is not locked, yet when we put Spectrum SIM card back in phone it works. What type of guarantee do I have from Google or Spectrum? Can't seem to get a straight answer?",
