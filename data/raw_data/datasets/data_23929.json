I have the phone with me\n\nUnfortunately it is user account locked. \nI am in contact with the seller.\n\nWhat steps do we need to take to get his account off the phone so I can take ownership?\n\nIs it as simple as the seller going to his Google account online and dropping the device/phone from his account?\n\nScott",
