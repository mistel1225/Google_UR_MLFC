    "content": "I just got my Pixel 3 a couple of weeks ago. It was working fine but when I looked at it today it appeared it hadn't charged at all last night. I have the phone plugged in to an outlet now, but it won't charge when the phone is on and eventually the battery dies. When powered off it seems to charge, but after a minute the phone will automatically power up and will go back to not charging. This cycle happens continuously. I can't even get a long enough charge to go into safe mode or run a factory reset. I updated to Android 10 a few days ago, but otherwise I don't think I've updated or installed anything on the phone that predicated this behavior. Hoping I don't have to send it in but I'm not seeing any other options so far.",
