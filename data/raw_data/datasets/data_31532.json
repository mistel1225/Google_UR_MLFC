    "content": "i just switched from a Samsung Galaxy Note8 to the Google Pixel 3XL and I am incredibly disappointed in my decision. The Samsung gave me countless options built-in to customize not only the home screen, but the icons (more than just the shape... the entire look), the message app (including the bubble color and look), the keyboard (I HATE the Google Keyboard), and anything else I could think of.\n\nGoogle Pixel gives me basically no options. Light vs dark? That's it? Really? No themes? \n\nAnd don't even get me started on the navigation bar. I actually got over the notch almost immediately. But then I noticed when certain windows are open, the navigation bar turns black, further decreasing the screen size. And there does not seem to be a way to fix this.\n\nSo. My question, to anyone, is there ANY WAY to get my phone actually customized? I've read briefly about installing launchers but even those have minimal options.",
