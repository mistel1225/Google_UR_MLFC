    "content": "My phone is syncd to my car's bluetooth.  When a call comes in, it is heard through the car's speakers.  But for some reason, when I go to my voicemail, that is, clicking the phone app > voicemail button (i.e. visual voicemail), playing a message does not come through the car's speakers.  Yes, if I call my voicemail the old fashioned way, it is heard through the speakers, but is anyone else experiencing this issue with the phone/voicemail app?  Thanks.",
