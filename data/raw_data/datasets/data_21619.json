    "content": "My Pixel 3 screen won't stop flickering brightly.  I've seen similar posts describing the same issue, yet can't get it resolved.  I've restarted my phone, restarted the phone in safe mode, and performed a factory reset.  This issue still persists. \n\nI'd greatly appreciate any assistance Google could offer. I've only had this phone for 3 months and have loved it thus far.",
