    "content": "Hi there!\n\nI am having an issue with my Pixel 4 Messages app. After I send a picture, when I tap on it, it displays a very old name of mine. I do not know how Google has this name on record, and I don't know how to update it. It is my dead name and I really would like to get rid of it.\nI have included a photo for reference.",
