    "content": "Ive used Android since... Froyo? Switching from the Galaxy S phones Ive used since.. S6... but this latest version of Android on the pixel 4XL leaves me baffled..\n\nCan we not move the google assistant bar (which is at the bottom by default) to the top? Can we not move the date/time/temp bar to another screen? There no way to set the notification volume for a text higher than for an incoming call ring volume??\n\nIs there a user guide for Pixel 4/Android 10 anywhere?",
