    "content": "I have a Pixel Stand in my office and one on my nightstand. Going between the two of them was no problem for my Pixel 3 XL, but since I got my Pixel 5, the Stand (not to be confused with the Stephen King novel) keeps asking me to verify, being unresponsive to touch and even going so far as to guide me through the tutorial multiple times. It's charging fine. Usually goes through my photo feed fine.",
