    "content": "Hi,\n\nTo my great disappointment, when taking a photo on the new pixel 5 (just black) the camera app screen goes black as soon as the phone tried to process the photo. The photo is also not available in Google photos until some time afterwards. I'm running the latest version of Android, and indeed I could consider reducing the picture size/quality but why should I have to do that for a phone brand that prides itself on its cameras?\n\n\nAny help would be welcome!",
