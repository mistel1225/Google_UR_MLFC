    "content": "Hello. I have an issue with my Pxl 2 XL. The thing is that I have weird buzz sound over the normal sound from my top speaker when listening any audio or making calls. It happened to me yesterday. I tried to clear my phone to the stock after a bit forum searching, but this solved the problem for an hour or two. Then I tried to push the speaker grill a bit into the body, as many people suggested. That fixed the problem, but yet again, for a short period. I also found that this problem is connected to the speaker grill, because when I push it, the intension of this sound is changing (and also disappeare sometimes). Now I don't know what I should do with that. I bought this one about a week or two before, so I don't know what could've been done.",
