    "content": "When sharing a photo from Google Photos app, when I select share and select an app from the app folder such as Facebook or Twitter or Instagram etc., about 15 or 20% of the time it will open a completely different app to share to such as Gmail or Adobe or some other app I have on my phone.  Recent phone updates have not fixed.  I asked this question last month but it is still occurring.",
