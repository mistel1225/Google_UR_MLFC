    "content": "I've been facing this issue since two months...I've also restricted it's background activity..and I just use it for light browsing as I mostly work on my laptop. It drains a lot of battery if it's only used for like say example 5 mins. I'm very much pissed off, as my usual battery backup was reduced by an hour...I'm hardly getting 4.5 hours of bb. I tried clearing it's data...disabling it... re-enabling and installing all updates..but the problem still exists. Let me show you a screenshot. Please suggest me a solution. Thank you.",
