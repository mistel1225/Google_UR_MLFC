    "content": "I am unable to add eSIM to my Pixel 4 XL. There is not + sign next to \"Mobile network\" in Network and Internet\". I bought unlocked UK SKU phone with 2 IMEIs and an EDIM ID shown on the label on the box. Yet only one IMEI shows in \"About phone\" and when setting up the phone I do not get the option to set it up with an eSIM - only with a physical SIM.",
