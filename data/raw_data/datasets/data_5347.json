    "content": "I was promoted to download a system update on my Pixel 4, which I did, but when the phone restarted it had loads of problems. Notifications are not working, neither is the swipe up to switch between apps feature. The swipe in from right edge to go back is also not working, and the settings pull down from the top only shows the first row and doesn't have the settings cog or the ability to pull down further like usual. My screensaver and home screen were also reset to default and I think I only have WiFi but not phone signal. When I go back to the system update section of settings, it tells me a security update is available. I try to download it and it seems to work and restarts the phone, but when the phone restarts and I go back to that page it says \"installation problem, try again\" every time. \n\nI tried rebooting in safe mode and it said that the app \"phone UI\" crashed... \n\nPlease help!",
