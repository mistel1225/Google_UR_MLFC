    "content": "I have a pixel 3 phone.   It stopped pairing with my fitbit charge 2 about a year ago.  I thought it was Fitbit issue as my fitbit is 4 years+ old and the face is cracked.  I now sync via my desktop with a dongle in a USB port.  From that point I did not notice any issues until I bought Pixel buds and because the Pixel buds are a new product I thought the audio issues I were having were on the Buds side and I worked with google on that.  What takes the cake though is I bought a new to me used car with android auto.  I paired up my phone and it worked great for about 50 mins into our road trip to texas from wisconsin.  It kept disconnecting and I was getting super frustrated and was blaming the car and the cables I used to connect.  Until I had my wife connect her phone a pixel 3a.  No issues with her phone the whole rest of the trip. \n\nI reset all network settings, I put my phone in safe mode and still have issues.   confirming that my bluetooth is defective.  After two + years of owning the pixel 3 I assume my only option is to get a new phone which is disappointing as I was hoping to make it 3 years with my phone before I get a new one.  I guess the real reason why I am posting this is to warn others that it may not be the things your trying to pair with but it might be your phone.",
