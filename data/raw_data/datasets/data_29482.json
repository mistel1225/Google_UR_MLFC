    "title": "Google Pixel 1st Gen Freezes and then Reboots randomly (not bootlooping)",
    "content": "Every once in a while my phone will randomly freeze and reboot. It doesn't get stuck in a boot loop, but sometimes it does freeze and restart several times a day. Some days it doesn't happen at all. It doesn't necessarily happen when I am using it either because sometimes when I wake up it's  restarted and I have to enter in my passcode due to a restart. The problem is becoming quite annoying. Any recommendations? I currently have my phone in safe mode to see if that eliminates the problem.",
