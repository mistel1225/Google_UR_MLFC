    "content": "Hi! I have a Pixel 2XL. And I have an internet connection that gives 50-60 mbps. \n\nI have a weird issue that my Pixel 2 XL shows a link speed in the WiFi details to be 54 mbps and the speeds I am getting are between 20-25mbps. Wherein on the other phones that I have I easily get around 50 mbps, and they show a higher link speed. \n\nI tried to turn the WiFi off and on, aeroplane mode and sometimes the link speed shows 144 mbps and I'm able to get around 50 mbps, but it comes down sooner or later. I am not sure what to do in this situation. All the other devices that I have get a consistent download and upload speed.\n\nWhat to do? \n\nI have attached the screenshots. ",
