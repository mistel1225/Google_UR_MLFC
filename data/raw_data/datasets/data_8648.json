    "title": "Why am I having Phone and Voicemail issues suddenly?",
    "content": "Starting yesterday, I was told that my voicemail \"wasn't set up,\" but I've had it set up for a long time. It was only told to me by one place, so maybe it's on them, but it's a call center for my health care providers, so I can't imagine they would tolerate or survive with problems like that...\n\nI'm not sure if it's also related or not, but when I answer the phone, I cannot hear any sound. This happens with or without any Bluetooth devices. I managed to talk to someone on the phone briefly, but then their voice suddenly started sounding warped, and I couldn't understand her.\n\nI just tried to answer two more calls, and I don't know if they could hear me, but I couldn't hear them.\n\nI restarted my phone already. I am trying to avoid resetting the phone to factory settings if I can avoid it. ETA: I have Google FI, and I had full or close to full bars.",
