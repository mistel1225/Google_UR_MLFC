    "content": "https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/22152472?hl=en&msgid=22201205\n\nI found this post. I have the same problem I think but the solution given doesn't work or I don't understand it fully. \n\nI have turned off vibrate and sound for ALL whatsapp messages (in app settings and in my phones settings). This works when I have the overall device notification settings set to sound (so phone calls vibrate and make sound and WhatsApp notification do nothing but show an icon on screen)\n\nBut when I turn on device vibrate (so phone calls vibrate but dont make sound) my whatsapp notification suddenly start vibrating aswell while in the app settings vibrate is still turned off.\n\nthis is anoying to no end. pls help.",
