    "content": "So I just bought the Pixel4a, and am transferring photos from my PC to the pixel.  When I transfer them, even in the album folders, they don't carry into the pixel and all the pictures are just a scattered unorganized mess.  Is there a way I can keep the photo album that the pictures are in and transfer them as such?\nShould I create an album on the phone first and then drag the pictures into it?\n(The USB transferring from phone to phone won't work because my old phone is busted)",
