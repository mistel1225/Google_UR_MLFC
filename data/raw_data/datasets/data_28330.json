    "title": "How to get access to Google Support in Taiwan (for Pixel 3)",
    "content": "Hello,\n\nI have bought a Pixel 3 on the Google Store in Taiwan (where I live) last year in November\n\nSince early 2019, the rear camera autofocus stopped working properly (common problem), and I have ben trying to reach out to Google through multiple channels, without success. Lastly, I founded some support from the French Google Support (where I come from), and they acknowledged the need for a repair. However I need to proceed with Google Taiwan.\n\nThe issue is that the Google Taiwan support website does not give access to Warranty center or anything like that. Impossible to get in touch with any form of customer support.\n\nI hope somebody can help. I really have the feeling hove being cheated by a brand I used to trust.\n\nThanks",
