    "title": "Unable to unlock bootloader (OEM unlock disabled)",
    "content": "The device isn't recognized via ADB.\nI can boot to Bootloader\n\nThe phone was working fine with the latest google stock android 10, i decided to lock the bootloader cuz the phone was getting overheated so i thought it'd be a good idea to lock the bootloader. Prior to do that, it asked me to erase everything! I erased everything and when i tried to reinstall the stock image it asked me to unlock the bootloader!!\nThe problem is that USB debugging isn't enabled and the phone is empty with no system!",
