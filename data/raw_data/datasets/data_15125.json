    "content": "I tried cleaning the caches for Netflix and YouTube (the main two also I use PiP with) and nothing has worked so far. I am assuming it is a bug related issue with the the new update to Android 11. Specifically any time I touch the app I am using in conjunction with the PiP, the video disappears but continues playing audio.",
