    "content": "As soon as I plugin my Pixel 2XL to the charger, it shuts down instantaneously. I tried two different cables - one was the original cable with the original power brick that came with the phone, the other was a USB C to USB A cable. The same thing happened to both of them. \nI have cleaned the charging port of my phone and found no debris. I tried doing the same in safe mode but the same thing happened.",
