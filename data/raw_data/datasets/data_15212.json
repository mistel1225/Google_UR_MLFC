    "title": "Google Pixel 3XL camera super laggy after Android 11 update",
    "content": "My Google Pixel 3XL has a camera app that's been lagging and freezing for ages. Incredibly frustrating, especially since my job relies HEAVILY on getting the perfect shot. The March update seemed to help the issue (didn't fully resolve, but became much more manageable) but the update to Android 11 has DESTROYED the camera AND photos app on my phone! It manages to take two photos on portrait mode before freezing and either shutting the whole app down or saying it's processing HDR+ for sometimes upwards of a minute. Flipping through pictures I did manage to take can take minutes instead of seconds. I'm at my wits end and honestly I doubt I'll be keeping the phone much longer at this rate.",
