You try to call them and they email you, they ask for things and then dont reply, im without a phone for a week almost now.\nI am so disappointed in how this is being handled, if i had an apple device it would have been replaced already.\n\nno liquid damage\nnever dropped\njust stopped working, not reading sims not connecting to wifi, did a factory reset, nothing and nobody is helping me this is crazy.",
