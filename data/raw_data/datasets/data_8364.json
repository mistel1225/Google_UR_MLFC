    "title": "How can I organize and delete device folders (photos) on my Pixel?",
    "content": "1) When I transferred thousands of photos over from my previous iPhone, they were (seemingly randomly) sorted into device folders titled \"APPLE (different numbers)\". How can I delete these folders but keep the photos on the device?\n\n2) How do I consistently create new device folders for photos and move photos to them? When I view photos on the (Google) Photos app, and swipe up for options, I can choose to add photo to album, move to archive, delete from device, etc. Occasionally, there is an option to \"copy to device folder\". Why is this option not always available? Can I make it always available?\n\nThanks in advance!",
