    "content": "My GP2 can't multi task!  If I am tracking a run and playing music, it randomly crashes and won't let me restart the aps.  At times, with a full charge and only music playing, I can get 30 mins out if it before it crashes.  Usually crashes when it is touched (finger scan to open, or on locking), but will also crash without interaction.  Had the phone replaced twice...same issues.  Has Google fixed this with later models?",
