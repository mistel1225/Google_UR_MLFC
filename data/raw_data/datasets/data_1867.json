    "content": "My Pixel 4a 5g, Android 11, purchased 4 months ago. A few weeks ago, would not charge past 40% and then would shut down, restart, shutdown, repeat. I cleared individual app cache, which seemed to fix the problem. Today, same problem occurred with the shut down/restart. Plugged into factory charger. Phone started up and was stable, but it shows 37% charge, and this is not increasing. Proceeded to clear app cache, but problem still exists. Any solutions/suggestions to solve the problem is greatly appreciated. Cheers, David",
