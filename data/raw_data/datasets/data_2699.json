    "content": "Hi I have tried everything to possible to get my phone to sync automatically without having to press \"back up now\" but it will not do it! This is my second my pixel 4a due the first one having a fault and thinking about it I think it may have had the same issue! Only backed up when I pressed it. I've contacted Google numerous times and they cannot work out if it's my phone or what's going on! \n\nLuckily I can still manually back up unlike the previous android 10 update.  I have factory reset, cleared the cache you name it I've tired!  \n\nSomeone please shed any light?! I can't be the only one.  My photos back up, contacts and drive all work. So what's going on? ",
