    "content": "After updating to January 2021 update today, I notice messages was lagging. I open up the app and sometimes no chat messages appear.. closing it and clearing recent apps few times and it works. Sometimes opening individual chats and nothing shows up.. just blank. Again I have to close it and clear the recents and it seems to work.. \n\nAnyone else facing this?",
