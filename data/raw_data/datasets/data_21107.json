    "content": "Bought my pixel 3 from Amazon US this February and just found dust in my rear camera, have anyone experienced that before as I supposed it's rated IP68 and wouldnt have this problem at all (and i never had such issue with my other android phone, tbh i'm a bit disappointed with it)\n\nbesides, i'm not in the US at the moment, would that affect my warranty if I have to send my phone in for a fix?",
