    "content": "I have my wake-up routine set to play the news. It seems like the only way I can get it to pause is by saying \"pause the news\" to Google Assistant, but I would like to be able to access an app to pause, play, go to next broadcast, etc. through the touchscreen interface. Does this exist?",
