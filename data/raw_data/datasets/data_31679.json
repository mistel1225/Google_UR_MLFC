    "content": "The squealing started over a month ago.  It occurs everytime I turn my screen on.  The sound stops when I turn off the screen or when I turn on the flashlight (strangely enough).\nI've tried turning off NFC, Bluetooth, and WiFi.  Just as well I restarted it multiple times and made sure it was completely up to date.",
