    "content": "My Google Messages stopped showing the I.D. of message senders when they come from an automated messaging service such at my bank or McDonald's even though I have the the automated messaging service numbers in my contact's list. I received contact information up until about 3 to 4 weeks ago, about the time my phone received its Android 10 update. I have been on the phone with Google techs three times trying to solve this problem. Can anyone help me?",
