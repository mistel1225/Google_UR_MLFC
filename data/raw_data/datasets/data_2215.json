    "content": "So seemingly out of nowhere my screen phased out while in use; now upon booting the phone, it does not get past the Google logo. Though I am able to open the recovery menu by holding down power and volume down.\nI tried connecting to the Android Flash Tool from Google, though I'm stuck on step one to enable USB Debugging and OEM Unlocking, because I cannot fully boot..\nAny ideas on what I can try? Thank you!",
