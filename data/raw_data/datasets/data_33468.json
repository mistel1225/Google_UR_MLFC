    "content": "I think the new Call Screen feature is pretty nifty, but needs fine tuning. Instead of \"Hi, the person you’re calling is using a screening service from Google...” I'd like it to start with \"You have reached Mark but he is screening calls so...\"\n\nI've already paid for the phone, I don't like the Call Screen to be telling people that big brother Google is listening (or sounding like an advertisement) and I'd like it to tell them exactly who they are calling so they don't hang up thinking they got the wrong person.\n\nIs there any way to modify the outgoing message, or is that something Google may incorporate eventually?",
