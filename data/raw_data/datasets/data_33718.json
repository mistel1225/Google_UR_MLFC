    "title": "My Pixel 3 camera has been having erratic auto focus issues.",
    "content": "I've restarted, cleared the camera app cache, reinstalled the camera app from the Play store.  I've also started the phone is safe mode.  No real change in behavior.  The issue is not so bad for taking pictures as it seems to focus okay most of the time but its terrible in videos.  The focus keeps jumping even on stationary objects. I feel like I noticed the issue after the February update.",
