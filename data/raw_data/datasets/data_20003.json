    "content": "For the past week or so, my Pixel has been waking up while in my shirt pocket, making calls, turning on the flashlight, and other battery-wasting things.  When I take it out of the pocket, it goes to sleep. This is backwards from it's earlier behavior. I can no longer find any settings that control this, though I probably just don't know what they're called. Any suggestions for making it work right again?",
