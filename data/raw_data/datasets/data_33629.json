    "content": "Long story short; I have over 70 emails, 4 online chats and 2 phone calls. This has happend over a period of 2 months. All related to a warranty replacement/repair. \n\nI was told via email i would be entitled to a warranty replacement/repair but that email has since been ignored and i am now getting emails asking the same stuff over and over again. \n\nThis has been by far the worst customer service experience I have ever had. I am getting to the point where I would rather use a broken phone than have to deal with another email from customer support. \n\nYou have sent me an email saying I can have the warranty, why can't this be acted upon? \n\nI have tried ringing customer support but it further complicates things.",
