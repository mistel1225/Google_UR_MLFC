    "content": "I'm in Brazil, I'll be here until January, and my screen broke.  I don't have a Google Fi sim card.  I need my screen fixed ASAP.  I'll buy a new screen (I'd also like to buy a new battery.  Battery life was never great and it's pretty bad now that my Pixel 2 is more than 2 years old) and have it repaired here in Brazil, but getting in touch with Google about getting a replacement screen has been extremely difficult (I haven't been able to talk to anyone because I can't call anyone).  Hopefully somewhere here can help me, because it's pretty close to an emergency!",
