    "title": "Pixel 3 - Insanely high battery usage through Ambient Display",
    "content": "I am experiencing a huge drop in battery percentage. The Ambient Display uses around 50% within a day - that's insane! I have no crazy features enabled such as song identifier, just the plain time and notification for missed calls or messages. No live wallpaper either.\n\nFor comparison: I used navigation with Google Maps for 30 minutes yesterday. It amounted for 5% in battery usage. The Ambient Display, on the other hand had a usage of 49%.\n\n99% of the day, my Pixel is laying on my barely lit office desk. The ambient screen is very dim (on auto brightness) and you barely can read it. So, it's not that I run the screen on the highest brightness settings.\n\nRunning the device in safe mode doesn't make much of a difference either. I am sure this isn't a hardware problem since I should experience a battery drop with everything, not just with the Ambient Display.\n\nI also performed a factory reset in between, hoping that this might help but it didn't. Does anyone have an idea what else I could try before I consider returning the device?",
