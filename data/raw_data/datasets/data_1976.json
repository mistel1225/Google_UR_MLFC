    "content": "I have Ambient mode set it displays the date and time when my screen times out.  It also displays icons for notifications and I have what's playing now enabled.  However, after I have watched a live stream event from Facebook or YouTube, the title of the event shows on the screen saver and the only way I can get rid of it is to restart my phone.   The active link to the event also stays on my notification page and I can't get rid of that either.",
