    "content": "The radio in my phone stopped working in mid-July, so I have not been able to call or receive a call since then.  No cell data access either, of course.  I submitted a request to Google, since I have Preferred Care.  They asked a couple of questions (about one a day), had me update and restart and reset and enter commands into the phone and take bug reports, and then silence.  After a week or so, I asked again, and they said to repeat all the commands and send new copies of the bug reports.  It has now been 2 1/2 months, and they just say \"they're working on it\", but of course they're not. They say they will not repair or replace my phone until their engineering staff verifies it is a hardware problem  But that is not happening, and probably cannot happen without them inspecting the actual device.\n\nHow can I get them to repair or replace my phone?  Why would anyone pay $149 for \"Preferred Care\", promising to repair or replace a defective phone, if they do neither?  \n\nIt sure would be nice if there was a human being to talk to.  Chat with people in India who are paid to get you off the chat and not spend money on repairs or replacement is not customer service.",
