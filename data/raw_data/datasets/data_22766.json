    "content": "I got the phone about a month ago.  It would occasionally freeze and restart a few times a day.  It's increased this past week a lot.  I tried in safe mode and it will still do it.  I took my case off and it would still do it. I finally did a factory reset and it still does it!  Is there anything else to try?\n\nThanks!",
