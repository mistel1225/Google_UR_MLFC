    "content": "Widevine L3 means maximum SD quality on Netflix. Netflix say device is not listed as HD or UHD compatible in the UK. Where do I go from here? Have attempted to contact Google but I'm not convinced their support is equipped to investigate this issue.\n\nNetflix support is also useless and despite the device clearly bring listed as HDR certified on their own site, they say it's not.\n\nAmazon Prime also looks crap so is this a device problem?",
