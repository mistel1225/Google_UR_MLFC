    "content": "So, yesterday my phone began to crash and restart itself at random. Sometimes when it happens there are glitches visible on the screen (random lines of purple and blue, sometimes only a few pixels wide and long, sometimes filling half the screen) but usually there aren't any.  I have tried restarting the phone manually, I've tried booting the phone in safe mode as well. I am trying to factory reset but after the reset, it crashes before i can actually get through setup. I have tried to do this while connected to a charger, but the battery doesn't seem to be it either.",
