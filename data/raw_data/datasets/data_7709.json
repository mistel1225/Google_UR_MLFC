    "content": "Hi. I am on a Google Pixel phone. I have opened Google Drive and \"made files available offline' (I use MS Word) and then, when I write an email in outlook on my phone and hit 'attach' the file I want is greyed out (as are most files). It's so frustrating as it means I can't send any business emails on my phone . I have to log on to my desktop to send them!",
