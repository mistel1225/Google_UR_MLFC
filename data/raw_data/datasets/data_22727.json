    "content": "I had accidentally let my Pixel 4 XL run out of battery power. When I charged it back up, it stopped charging at about 45%. Now it's sitting at about 10% power, and when I connect to the charger it will maintain the power level, but it won't charge further. In the battery settings, it reads \"Plugged in, can't charge right now.\" I have tried turning it completely off and charging it shut down, but that didn't work either.",
