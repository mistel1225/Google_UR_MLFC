    "title": "Pixel 3 brick after latest security update & battery 0%",
    "content": "Latest security update applied to my Pixel 3 yesterday. Phone seemed to be fine for the rest of the day until the battery was depleted (was using the torch at night whilst dealing with baby).\nI put the phone on charge and now it will not boot; it starts up and lasts about 20-30 secs before it appears to reboot. If I enter the recovery menu, pressing the volume buttons to change the option results in the phone rebooting. Can't even wipe the phone before taking it in for support... Phone cannot be turned off, and stays in this loop until the battery is depleted.\nBased in Australia, and under contract with Telstra; hoping they'll give me a replacement!\nAny assistance would be fantastic!",
