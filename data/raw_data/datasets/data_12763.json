    "content": "Using a Google Pixel 3a. With wired 3.5 mm headphones, the sound is strangely low, even when I've cranked up the volume button to its max.\n\nInitially, I thought the problem was the headphones. Bought 3 different brands, but they all have this issue.\n\n(Interestingly, when I use wireless Bluetooth headphones, this isn't a problem. Only with wired.)",
