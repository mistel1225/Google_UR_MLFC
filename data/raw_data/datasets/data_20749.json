    "content": "I have searched the internet for this issue but cannot find anything about it. My wife's phone is a Google Pixel 3. For about 3 weeks this issue has been happening. Once in a while the screen acts like it is getting a big power surge and there is also a crackling sound. It does not matter if it is plugged in or not but it seems to happen more often plugged in. What could cause this and how do we fix it? Thank you.",
