    "content": "Hi, unfortunately my phone got wet yesterday. Thus, the \"liquid or debris, USB port disabled\" message showed up, followed by the \"Okay to use USB port\" message. I then unsuccessfully tried to charge my phone. It seems like the phone registers that the USB has been plugged in, however, it won't charge. The battery percentage always remains at 0%. Interestingly, if I plug my phone in, it would power up, then power down after a few seconds because the battery is too low and then reboot. If I do not plug it in, it would signalize me to be unable to power up because the battery is too low. Do you think the battery might be damaged? Is there anything I can do?\nPlease help ;) Would be happy to be able to get my phone running.",
