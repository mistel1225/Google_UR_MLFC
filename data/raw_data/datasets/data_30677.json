    "content": "I'll go right to the point;\n\nWhile a Pixel phone is locked (My pixel 2 XL), anybody is able to turn it off and it doesn't even ask for a PIN or anything... I see this as a lack of security because if you either forget the phone somewhere or it gets stolen, anybody will be able to turn it off and there wouldn't be any way to locate it... Do you follow me? Even the Samsung S7 has this feature I believe so. \n\nI thought that the Pixel 3 was going to have this feature but I was wrong. Please Google think about this and at least add it as something optional to have.\n\nWho else has noticed this?\n\nThanks in advance!",
