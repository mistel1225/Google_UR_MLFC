    "content": "I keep Do Not Disturb on all the time, so I don't get bothered by robo calls. I have permissions set so that anyone on my contacts will override Do Not Disturb. However, when I turn my ringer off and switch to vibrate, it won't vibrate. The calls come in, but no vibrate. It's silent. How do I fix this?",
