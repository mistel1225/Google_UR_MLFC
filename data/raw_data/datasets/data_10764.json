    "title": "3rd party launcher affecting Gesture Navigation in apps",
    "content": "I am using Google Pixel 4. Whenever I use any 3rd party Launchers like MS Launcher, Nova Launcher, I will encounter issue on the 'gesture navigation'. When in an app, eg. playing games, it affects the touch response at the bottom of corners. But when I switch back to the default 'Pixel launcher', I do not have any problem. \n(Note: No issue when I switch to 3-Buttons navigation when using 3rd party launchers)\nI contacted Google support but was asked to contact the Launcher creators. It seems like the problem only affects Pixel phones and not other Android phones.\nAnyone also having such issue?\n\nLink to recorded screen:\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/11kjVK9uouqzG9fOqKAsy6Pirmb1F1dJH/view?usp=sharing",
