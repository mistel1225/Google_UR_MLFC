    "content": "Tried rebooting several times.\nI can get to settings without logging in.\nUninstalled many Apps in case it was an App causing the issue. Still no success.\nTried to see if I could clear cache and could not get that option.\nHad to resort to factory reset to get the phone to at least accept phone calls.\nWhat is causing this? especially since my phone was working fine. I just wanted to do a restart!\nAlso do not know what is the best way to deal with this situation. What should I be trying as I could not find any good info that actually aligned and worked for the problem I was experiencing.",
