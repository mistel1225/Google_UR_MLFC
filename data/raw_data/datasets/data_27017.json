    "title": "Gboard takes up way too much space when gesture-control is active",
    "content": "When using gesture-control, gboard has an arrow down, that allows the user to close the keyboard due to the missing \"back button\". This arrow takes up ALOT of space, especially when in landscape mode. I've switched back to 3-button-navigation because of this (even though i actually liked it), because it made it really uncomfortable to type in some landscape-applications. Please change the position of the button so that it doesnt take up as much vertical space or give me an option to disable it entirely.",
