    "content": "Every time I get an email, text, or any other type of alert, I hear what I believe is the default sound followed by my selected sound.  I have had multiple chat sessions with Pixel support, plus phone calls, but no one seems to be able to fix this problem.  Right now, I have all sounds turned off for email, but still get the pipe \"clank\" sound when emails come in.  If it can't be fixed, then how do I change this stupid sound to something less obnoxious.  #missmyiphone",
