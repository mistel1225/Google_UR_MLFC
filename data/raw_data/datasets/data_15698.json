    "content": "I jusr recently updated to Android 11 and I couldn't find my Files app at first. I didn't even know it was still there since the icon had changed, and when I opened it up, I found out the normal Pixel file browser had been swapped out for Files by Google. I never liked Files and I don't consider it a real file browser.\n\nHowever, the original app isn't entirely missing, as I noticed while writing another question that it still exists, albeit with some tweaks like being able to filter by large files.\n\nMy question is: can I revert or downgrade my Files app back to the original one?",
