    "content": "I have a month old Pixel3XL.\nIt restarts it self during wifi hotspot use. \nI gave up on wifi hotspot and started using USB tethering. But today it also restarted itself twice while USB tethering and my meeting was interrupted.\n\nI reset the phone and tried everything like trying it without downloading any apps and trying it each and every time as I download new apps but it still resets.\n\nNow USB tethering started creating problems too. \nI can't use the device with these problems as they are major issues and effects my connectivity and business directly.\n\nI bought it about 45-60 days ago.\n\nRight now I'm out of country. \n\nWhat should I do?\n\nThank you for help....",
