    "content": "My current phone is an iPhone7.   My previous phone was a Google Nexus 5 and I am dying to go back to an Android phone.\n\nHowever, my iPhone7 (and all later iPhones) have one must-have feature:  they can connect, via BlueTooth,  with the \"Nucleus 7\" processors for my cochlear implants.   (My implant brand is \"Cochlear\".)\n\nHow do I tell Google that if they can add the Cochlear-brand processor compatibility that I need, then I will happily smash my f*cking iPhone with a sledgehammer and get a Pixel3 or Pixel3 XL?",
