    "content": "I have set my daughter's phone up with a normal google account and her school Google account. Her personal one works fine on the device. Hey school one will work fine for a day or 2 after a factory reset, but it will then log her out of her account and tell her she needs to log in again to get school account. When you log in and put her password in, the app crashes back to the start. She can't use classroom, the school wifi, Gmail, etc. Her school account is also not syncing. It says there is an error in syncing, but no information is given. I've tried clearing caches on Google app, play services. I've tried doing a full factory reset. Anyone have any ideas what is going on?",
