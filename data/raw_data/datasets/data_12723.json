    "content": "Update: \nAfter the Nov 20 security update, it's still status quo, nothing is fixed for this issue.\n\nProblem: \nStarred contacts still did not ring when dnd is turned on.\n\nComments: \nThe alternative solution recommended by others which is to turn on \"allow repeat callers\" is not the right solutions.\n\nWhy would I want to block a call from the same caller just once within a 15 min duration? \n\nWhy does this feature even need to exist in first place. \n\nSolution:\nUnless Google give an option of how many times you can block from the same person before a call gets through otherwise this function is redundant in my own opinion.",
