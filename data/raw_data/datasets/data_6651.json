    "content": "I read about touch problems others were having that were supposedly fixed by the Feb update. I had none of those problems. But since the Feb update I have been experiencing touch problems on my 4a 5G, but these seem different than others that have been mentioned.\n\nIts a little hard to characterize. The problems seem to occur just after awakening the phone by finger touch. The first touch action on the screen then often is wrong. I click on an icon and instead of launching that app it does something else. Sometimes it brings up the apps screen. Other times it does *something* (uncertain what) and then repaints the home screen.\n\nAfter that it seems to return to normal operation. This is not crippling, but it is annoying.\n\nHas anyone else seen this? Is there a fix?",
