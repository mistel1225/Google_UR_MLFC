    "content": "Saw the latest Google update on Friday (10/16) and after that my pixel 4 is no longer connecting to wifi.\n\nI've tried all options including 1) restarting my router, 2) restarting my phone, 3) removing my WiFi credentials and reenter them. None of my other devices have any issues as they are connecting and working fine. I'm 100% sure this issue is related to the latest update as I'd not seen this WiFi issue prior to that and my phone was connecting fine to my router.\n\nHas anyone else seen this?\n\nRelease I've on my phone is: RP1A.201005.004\n\nAndroid 11 release\n\nThanks!",
