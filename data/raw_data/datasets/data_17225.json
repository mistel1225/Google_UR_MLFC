    "content": "When I plug my phone into my computer to download the photos, weird ads (like a screenshot of the ad) from a games app I play (words with friends) come up in amongst my photos - and there are a lot! Also photos from Whatsapp groups are there too and I don't want them either. The funny thing is that I can't see these images/photos in my photos app at all - they just pop up when I download my photos to the computer.",
