    "content": "This applies to both gboard and ms keyboard.\n\n1. To type a ckeyboard, I must type on between the letter and the letter to the right of it ) notice the \"ckeyboard\" which should be \"character\", \"on\" and the misplaced Parenthesis; I can't correct the latter. \n\nThis makes typing useless. \n\n2. Occasionally, random characters appear when typing. I once typed \"top\" and the Phra (see? =) \"Ss ? top\" appeared. \n\n3. I have lost the symbol keyboard on gboard. \n\nSs keyboard doesn't help (that Ss was ripped (typed) as \"changing\". \n\nClearing the cave (cache) foamy (doesn't) work. \n\nIdeas?",
