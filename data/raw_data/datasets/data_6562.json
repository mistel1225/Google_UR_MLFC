    "content": "On the top of my screen where it has the time, battery, percentage and the reception icons, I also have the Wi-Fi connection icon that looks like a fan. At random intervals and sometimes for a long time even though it says I'm still connected to my Wi-Fi, the fan icon turns into a dot. I read somewhere that this is cellular data but really I have no idea. It says I'm still connected to my Wi-Fi. What does this dot mean? Am I using data when this dot is displayed versus my Wi-Fi fan icon?",
