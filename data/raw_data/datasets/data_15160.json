    "content": "Video recording isn't working on my Pixel XL - I have errors like \"something went wrong.. part of the recording may be missing\", \"audio isn't working\", and the camera app is very sluggish. It also crashes the phone now\nI have tried:\nSafe mode - has the same results\nClearing data and cache\nAnother camera app - open camera - this also crashes after a 5-minute recording\n\nWhat do we think - hardware or software?",
