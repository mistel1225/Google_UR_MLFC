    "title": "USB Stopped working after July 2020 Security update",
    "content": "I have a Pixel 2 XL (not sure why it doesnt show up on the list). Everything was working fine until the July update. After that my Android Auto stopped working. I tried with my Samsung S8, everything works fine, so the head unit is OK. Tried swapping out cables, no luck. The I decided to see if there may be something with my USB, so I connected it to my PC and got the \"USB Device Not Recognized\" error. \nI have already tried clearing Play Services cache and Play Store cache etc. Enabling and disabling USB Debugging and reinstalling the drivers on my PC. I have also tried a Type-C to Type-A cable as well as the original cable that came with the phone.",
