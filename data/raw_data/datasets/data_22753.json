    "title": "Why can't I access data while on a phone call?",
    "content": "I have GoogleFi and a Google Pixel2. When I am on a call, my data stops working. Therefore I cannot simultaneously take a phone call and receive a group text message, use the hotspot, or receive an email. Also, recently when I am on a call, the background has turned black (instead of the normal white) even though I don't have data-saver or battery-saver mode turned on (i.e. even when fully charged). What is going on? Thanks!",
