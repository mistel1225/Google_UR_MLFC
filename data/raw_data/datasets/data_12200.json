    "content": "During a either a Phone call or Video calls, My Pixel 5 seems to reset my bluetooth while connected to my Rayon E25's. The connect comes right back and it will repeat ever 30 or so seconds. I do not lose connectivity when listening to music through YT music. What I have done so far\n1. turn off bluetooth,\n2. factory reset E25\n3. cleared bluetooth cache\n4. powercycled pixel 5\n5. turned E25 on and repaired with device.\nStill functions the same way with some irregularity in the timing. Again bluetooth appears to have no other issues with anything else outside of phonecalls  Any ideas?",
