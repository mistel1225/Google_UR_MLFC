    "content": "I'm using \"portrait mode\" on my Pixel 3. When I try to upload my photos to Facebook using the \"3D option\", Facebook doesn't recognize the photo. On further investigation, other sites claim there is no depth map data.\nThis whole thing is strange because when I first got the phone, I was able to upload my \"portrait mode\" photos to facebook as 3D images. Now suddenly I can't.",
