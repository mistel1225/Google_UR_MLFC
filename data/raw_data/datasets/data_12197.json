    "content": "Within the last week my 4A has had instances of random battery drain. Sometimes even after a full charge the battery will suddenly start to die, but if I reboot before it dies it will restart indicating the battery level it had before the drain.\nSometimes a reboot or two will absolve this issue for the day, but it seems to be happening more frequently now, anyone have any idea what the problem may be?\nI'm trying to avoid having to send it back in for repairs/replacement under the 1 year warranty, as this is my only daily phone.",
