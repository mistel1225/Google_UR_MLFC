    "content": "I'm trying to get support for a case that's been open since Jan 21, 2021.\n\nI sent my phone (minus the display screen) into Google Support to repair a screen that went black (faulty).  \nThe quoted repairs were higher than originally quoted and w/o any additional information.  \nI rejected the repair and my phone was sent back\nMy phone was returned in an altered state (w/o permission) with another defective screen was added (Mind you my phone was sent in w/o a screen). \nThe phone is not working the same as it was when I sent it in. \n\nI keep going back and forth with support on making it right and I can't get anyone from support to rationally address the issue.  I keep getting responses that must be coming from responders that do not read the entire history.  It's frustrating.\n\nRE: Case ID 9-5218000031422\n\nIs anyone from Google Support moderating these Community posts and can provide me with some help",
