    "content": "My google pixel 3 will not charge - initially it just wasn't registering the fact a cable was connected. I cleaned out the port and also the charger itself and now it will register a cable if I fiddle with it a bit but even so it shows 0% inside the expanding circle which shows it's charging and then the screen just goes black again after a few minutes. It never gets past 0% . I don't have another cable to try but have tried several different outlets. I also had an issue earlier this evening where it took several attempts before the phone realised my earphones were connected so I'm thinking it could be the port. It seems odd though that the port would suddenly stop working out of no where when I've had no issues whatsoever with it before now. I",
