    "content": "I've bought pixel 2XL , it's been just a week and I'm really worried about the Battery. It drains very fast,! Especially when mobile data is on and camera is used. It needs to be charged often. Twice or thrice a day. Since it's just one week, I'm really worried if it's really cost worth? It has 3250 mAh battery and doesn't seem like it's doing the job. Please suggest.",
