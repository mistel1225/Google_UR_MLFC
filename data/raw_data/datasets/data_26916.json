    "content": "I cannot select the front (selfie) camera anymore. The option has completely disappeared from Snapchat and in the standard camera app the option to switch is still there, but does not do anything. I have even gone as far to do a full factory reset, but no result. Any ideas anyone? Thanks a bunch.",
