    "content": "My Google Pixel 3 XL is constantly starting and then freezing and then restarting.\nI've turned on safe mode using the volume down button, but it makes no difference.\nIf I'm quick enough it lets me open with pin, and it says 'phone starting' but after 40 seconds without loading any apps it just restarts again. The screen / finger print sensor become unresponsive before it restarts.\nI can't factory reset because I can't open anything on the phone.\nHave tried holding down the power button, but it just restarts the phone doesn't give me any options.\nWhen it starts and before freezing and shutting down, it displays the correct time, date, welcome message and battery indicator.\nAny suggestions other than buying a new phone?",
