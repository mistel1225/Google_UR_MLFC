    "content": "Contacted Verizon several times for support. Set reset network settings\nConfirmed smart Lock for trusted devices\nUninstalled apps with permissions\n\nStill occurs every single time.  It will reconnect immediately but of course when you're having a phone conversation there is a delay in reconnection and it will time out again in a short period of time. The battery is drained if I try to listen to my Bluetooth speaker with the screen on for 30 min as the screen has to remain on the entire time I want to listen. It works completely fine prior to this update",
