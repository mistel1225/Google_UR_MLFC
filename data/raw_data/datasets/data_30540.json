    "content": "I'm using my Pixel 3 for shooting a lot of video which is not a problem if I'm able to return to base at the end of each day to move the files via USB to my desktop PC. However, what are my options if I'm away for a few days when I'm certain to max out on the in-phone storage ?\n\nI've looked at Google Drive and the 15GB of free space which might help but only to a degree.\n\nI have a USB-C flash drive which would be perfect but I can't get the Pixel 3 to move files to the flashdrive, only from it.\n\nSeems crazy that, for a phone offering 4K video options, there is no option to access additional storage.\n\nI can't be the first to have this concern/issue when heading off on vacation so what options are there ..... if any ?",
