    "content": "Today everytime I try to watch a video, even the one on my device, it just keep pausing randomly. After a few seconds sometimes 3 or 2 or even 1. I make sure not to touch the screen but it still pauses. On top of that I tried recording a video and it kept stopping after a few second on whatsapp but with the camera app it worked fine.\nAlso while typing on Google search and on Instagram the keyboard keeps disappearing. \n\nI try to research these issues but other suggestions were for Samsungs and it didn't apply to my phone.",
