    "content": "Hi everyone,\nI have a problem with my Pixel 3 phone - dark spot on screen (near lower left corner), flashing part of the screen. Phone wasn't hit or damaged. Procured in US on Sep 20, 2019 via Amazon from Google. Currently I'm in the Republic of Moldova. Going circles in Support sites, cannot find a way to initiate warranty repair for my phone.\nThanks for suggestions!",
