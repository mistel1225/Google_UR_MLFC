    "title": "Pixel 5 Hole Punch",
    "content": "Not sure if I'm alone, but I dislike both the hole-punch on the Pixel 5 and the extremely narrow aspect ration, both a result of eliminating the bezels.\n\nIn a separate post, I asked whether the Pixel 4A had an option to virtually restore the bezels the way the Samsung phones with hole-punch do (so apparently I'm not the only one with this aesthetic). An answer I received that this might be possible, but only through a third-party app.\n\nSo, I don't expect a different answer about the Pixel 5, the phone I'd buy if I can solve this problem, but I wonder whether anyone knows of such a third-party app.",
