    "content": "I have my Pixel 4a normally set on Do Not Disturb (DND) so that only starred contacts can ring me. That works ok. However, when a call comes through the phone does not display the call screen. Instead only a small notification bar appears and in order to answer the call the screen needs to be unlocked. That is new and very annoying. I have missed important calls this way as I was fumbling around to unlock the phone. Is there a fix to it?\nI looked through the forums but none of the half baked solutions work. I assume it's a bug or none of the developers has their phone on DND...\nHelp",
