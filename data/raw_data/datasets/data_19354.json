    "content": "Each time I take a photo in portrait mode, the camera adds the photo to a new folder. So, ten photos means ten separate folders.\n \nIf I'm doing a mini \"photo shoot\", I might have 30 photos, each in its own folder.\n \nThis makes it tedious, slow and frustrating to view the photos from a third-party app or to copy the photos to the desktop.\n \nHow can we turn off this behavior, please?",
