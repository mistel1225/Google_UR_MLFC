Camera App is crashing since may be March or July 2019 for unknown reasons..\n\nAnyone from India with me here.. and anyone would like to come forward.. i am thinking to take this matter to consumer court legally.. as Google is not responding at all.. and on sending device for warranty there service partner b2x comes with unknown reasons to justify that it is not under warranty and asks very very huge amount of money to repair it.",
