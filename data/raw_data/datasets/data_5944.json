    "content": "My phone was dead so I plugged it in to charge. The screen showed it was charging as usual but after a while, I noticed the charge hadn't gone above 1%. After about a half-hour of it charging at 1% I assumed it was a problem with the battery or charging port so I unplugged it. I tried using a wireless charger and faced the same issue. I cleaned out the ports, tried different, cables, and rebooted the phone several times. I noticed that despite being at 1% my phone wasn't dying. It's been nearly 40 minutes of use now at 1% and it's still not dead. I'm assuming this means the battery and charging is fine but the phone can't recognize the charge? Has anyone else come across this issue or know how to fix it?",
