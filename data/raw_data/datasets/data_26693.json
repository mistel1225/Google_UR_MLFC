    "content": "I have an OG Pixel that had its motherboard replaced complimentary of Google. Since then, my GPS has been inaccurate and now it has stopped functioning entirely. The GPS Status & Toolbox app does not find my GPS location, it simply sits at \"Looking for GPS Location.\"\n\nAny advice is appreciated. Thanks",
