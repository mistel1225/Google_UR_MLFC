    "title": "Facebook Messenger Chat Heads glitchy after Android 11 update.",
    "content": "Ever since my phone updated to Android 11 my chat heads/bubbles for Facebook Messenger have had numerous issues. If I have the phone in Landscape mode watching a video and I try to open a chat bubbles the bubble goes off the screen and the screen goes darker and the only way to close the bubble is to exit to the home screen or to the recent apps screen. Also when I just have a chat bubble on my screen at all even closed in portrait mode I cannot type anything on any other apps because my keyboard won't open and the back button doesn't work either until I get rid of the chat bubble entirely.",
