    "content": "Hello! After the December update I got a black screen on my Pixel 3, it is showing \"cannot load the android system. your data may need to perform a factory data reset\" my Pixel 3 was working perfectly fine before this update.\nI have tried side loading the latest OTA update and the same black screen showed up. Is there any other way to fix it without factory reset?",
