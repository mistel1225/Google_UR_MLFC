    "content": "My father and I both have Pixel 2s bought 14 months ago (we bought them at the same time).  They both updated to Android version 10 recently.  \n\nMy father was having an issue where where the \"n\", \"j\", and \"i\" on the keyboard were not working.\n\nHe takes care of his phone and swore he never dropped it (it does have a case).\n\nI turned his phone to landscape and the keyboard worked fine.\n\nI also started it in safe mode and the portrait keyboard issues remained.\n\nI downloaded a touchscreen test app to make sure the touchscreen was working correctly and the following screen is what I got.  He has a large vertical area in white that does not respond to touch.\n\nIs the phone hardware broken or is this something that can be fixed via a factory reset or some other method.\n\nEdit: spelling\n?",
