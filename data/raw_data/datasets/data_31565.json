    "title": "Back Up Not Found as Mother Board Replace",
    "content": "Hi All, I recently had the Motherboard replaced on my Pixel by an authorized service dealer.  During the set up, I was asked to copy the data.  Option was to copy from old phone of the Cloud.  I selected the cloud option.  After signing in with my gmail account, the phone informed me there was no back up to be found.  Prior to getting the phone serviced I made sure everything was backed up.  I verified this by logging into my Google Drive and found there are two back ups.  One is dated today (5/1/2019) And the other is dated 4/29/2019.  The first one is named \"Pixel backup\".  The other one is named \"<my name> Phone Back Up\".  So basically I have a new phone that I cannot restore my data to.\n\nInteresting side note - Before the phone was serviced I had Android V9 (Pie?).  The version that came with the new mother board is Version 8.",
