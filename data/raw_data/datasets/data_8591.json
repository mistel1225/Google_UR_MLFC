    "title": "Pixel 2xl will not connect to wifi.delta.com in airplane mode in the air. Apple device works perfect",
    "content": "Every time I try to use my phone to get on Wi-Fi while I am in the air or get a network connection to Wi-Fi... It says that it's saved but it does not connect. It never allows me to click on the Wi-Fi symbol with an exclamation point to be able to connect. The Wi-Fi symbol with the exclamation point disappears and it just is blocking being connected. I've tried to forget the network, I've tried to start restart my phone clear on my cookies and nothing is working. I tried to get logging on through the Apple device that I have and it worked perfect.",
