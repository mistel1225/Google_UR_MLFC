    "content": "Since I installed the March 5, 2021 update my battery drains rapidly when I stream video or music, app doesn't matter and when I sync my smartwatch. After following all recommended trouble shooting advice I reset my phone and it is still happening. Has anyone else had this issue? I have a Pixel 3 and am running Android 11. Thanks.",
