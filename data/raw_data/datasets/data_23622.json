    "title": "Having problems with swiping up on Pixel 3 with new Android 10 update.",
    "content": "When unlocking phone, you have to swipe up to get to the number pad. With the new Android 10 updates, you have to swipe up 3-5 times before it will actually allow you to get to the number pad. Same thing happens with clearing apps by swiping up. You need to swipe up SEVERAL times before it will actually clear the app. Seems like any feature that requires a swipe up- is not registering the swipe at all.",
