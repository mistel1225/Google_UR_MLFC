    "content": "In my Messages app, I get notifications (vibration, icon in the top bar, vibrate sent to my Fitbit) for about half of my messages, but then don't get any notifications for the other. It seems to be the same people that I don't get notifications from, but I have the same settings for everyone. Anyone else have this problem?",
