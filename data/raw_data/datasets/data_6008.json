    "title": "It has been 3 months since I sent in a replacement device, how do I escalate the issue?",
    "content": "I sent my pixel phone in for replacement over 3 months ago and have not received a replacement. I reached out to the support and initially they were looking to the issue and it seems it got missed. They then confirmed back in January that a replacement had been processed and would be sent out. This again did not happen and I reached out again for support and escalation of the issue only to be told I have reached the highest level of escalation and that they recognize the case has been mishandled and apologize but they would look into it. It is now the end of February with no response or resolution. \n\nAny advice on who I could reach out to in order to help resolve this? Very disappointed with the level or support and customer service. \n\nCase ID [5-1806000030711]",
