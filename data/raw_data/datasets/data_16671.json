    "content": "Since update to Android 11. Phone gets through battery in 3-4 hours. Performance is really slow to open apps. Screen unlock does not always work or respond.\n\nDid factory reset yesterday after update to 11. Still really poor. Screen unlock at least works now, but battery life is hopeless.\n\nAnyone got ideas?",
