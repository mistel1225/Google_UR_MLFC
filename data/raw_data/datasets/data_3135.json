    "content": "I have smart lock enabled for home and work. I also use finger print recognition. At home I still have to enter my pw occasionally even when I've used my phone recently.  I get a message saying something like \"enter your own for extra security\".  I'd like to not have to enter my pw again - that's why I enabled fingerprints - I want quick and easy.  Can I disable this annoying feature?\n\nSmart lock has never worked at my office.\n\nI really just want to be able to use my  fingerprint all the time, every time, everywhere.  Sorry, Google, but that's how it was on my Moto and I liked it.  I don't keep my life on my phone. I don't want the extra security.",
