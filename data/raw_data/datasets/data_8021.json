    "title": "Google Pay has stopped working on my Pixel 2",
    "content": "There's just no recognition between my phone and the terminals in stores anymore, it's as if I'm trying to pay with the screen off. I've been using Google Pay with this phone and these two cards in these stores for a couple of years without problem. Everything on my phone looks normal and I've made no changes to anything - one day I was using contactless, the next day I couldn't.\n\n- I've checked that NFC is enabled and that Google Pay is the default.\n- I've disabled and re-enabled NFC. \n- I've checked in Google Pay and the cards are still there. With both of my loaded cards I get the instruction under the contactless icon to \"hold to the reader.\"\n-In the Contactless Setup it says \"You're all set to pay with your phone\" and everything below has the tick. \n\n\nThis only started to happen a week or two ago with a single store and now I can't use it in any of the stores.",
