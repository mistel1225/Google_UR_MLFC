    "content": "I can't get media to play through my phone's bottom speakers. I also can't get calls to play through my ear speaker. However, speakerphone is working fine, which eliminates a hardware issue with the bottom speakers. The headphone jack is also working fine, as is the microphone. Any ideas?",
