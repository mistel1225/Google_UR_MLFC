    "content": "When using  video app Duo or WhatsApp, the other end cannot hear me. Voice call however works fine. I deleted and downloaded the app, checked mic setting, shut Bluetooth and eventually reset to factory but problem remains. I also removed my phone cover by the way.  Please can someone help before I take the phone for repair. Phone is only 2 months old.",
