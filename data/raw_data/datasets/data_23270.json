    "title": "Pixel 3 freeze and reboot when playing video",
    "content": "Started seeing this issue around 2/3. When playing video, the phone will freeze for about 5 seconds and then reboot. This happens anywhere from 2 to 90 seconds into a video, although usually less than 30 seconds in. It happens every time when viewing an embedded video of sufficient length on facebook.com in Chrome. It happens sometimes but not always when viewing video on other websites, the YouTube app, the Instagram app, and locally from the hard drive. It has happened at least once when recording video and once while not doing anything video-related in the GMail app. Other non-video uses have seemed fine so far. \n\nWe have done a factory reset and updated all apps, but problem persists. It also occurs when booted in Safe Mode. Based on a slim connection to another video issue thread, we tried disabling ad personalization with no change. \n\nDoes all of this point to a hardware problem? We are really hoping not to have to replace the phone, so some sort of fixable software issue would be ideal. \n\nAny and all insights appreciated, thanks!",
