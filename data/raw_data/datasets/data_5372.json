    "content": "I have a pixel 4a on Android 11. After the update on March 5th, 2021, I've been having issues with my phone service. I'll lose the ability to make calls or use my mobile data and my phone will be displaying the no signal sign. I'm in a city where I've never had issues with connectivity. The phone will go from full bars to none in seconds. \n\nThe problem resolved briefly after restarting my phone, but it's not a permanent fix. What's going on? My phone provider said it's not from their end. I'm still able to text and connect to wifi.",
