    "content": "Hello! I filed a claim last week, which was approved the same day, for a new Pixel 3. It came on Saturday and I was happy, but I have not been sent any email or confirmation that provides a return shipping label for my old phone. I can't find anywhere on the site that shows me what address I must send my old phone back to within 15 days. I called the assurant people and they helped me through the process of trying to contact someone via the online chat but it won't give me that option - it's blanked out. I'M SO ANNOYED! Please someone help meeeee",
