    "content": "My wife's Pixel 3 suddenly got stuck in a boot loop. it shows the google logo and starts loading then it restarts.\ni'have tried a factory reset but pressing the volume buttons to get to the factory reset menu will restart the phone making it impossible to factory reset. it will also automatically restart after a couple of seconds if no button is pressed.\nwhat are my options?",
