    "content": "HiI have a Google pixel 1, and after updating to android 10 I have begun to encounter errors with my audio as well as things not loading correctly. My audio will now rarely work, and I have an extremely lucky chance to get my audio to work through just constantly restarting my phone. I have tried booting into safe mode and that only works sometimes, and I have also tried clearing the cache for everything. any help would be appreciated. Thankyou",
