    "content": "Live Caption just started working on my 3a. It's great. I bought the 3a just to play with Live Caption.\n\nI've used it for a few videos on the phone. What would really be great in is if Live Caption provided captions of speech from the other party during phone calls and video calls.\n\nDoes anyone know the reason it does not work with phone calls? Is it a technical barrier – the received audio stream is just not available from the other party during a phone call. Or, is it a marketing barrier – they are afraid it will upset those companies who currently provide real-time captions for phone calls.",
