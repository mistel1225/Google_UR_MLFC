    "content": "My notification sounds are still coming through Even when I have my device on mute or vibrate. It also still does it even when it's on do not disturb. if I restart my phone it will fix the issue for about 4 to 5 hours and then it acts up again. I've tried going through and resetting all of my settings and it still has this problem. I'm looking for any help I can get. It also still sounds when I'm using Android Auto which has an automatic feature to silence all notifications. this just started happening in the past week and I've never had this issue before.",
