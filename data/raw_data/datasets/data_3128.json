    "content": "This morning, my phone began constantly giving me a \"Google Play Services keeps stopping\" pop-up. \nHowever, it is consistently popping up every literal second, so that I am unable to click either \"app info\", \"close app\" nor \"send feedback\". My phone is unusable. I have tried restarting and shutting down several times, to no avail.",
