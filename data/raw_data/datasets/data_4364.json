    "content": "Searching for apps and through Google on the bottom of the screen crashes when you start typing and about half of my apps either crash or won't open at all. Started a day or two ago. Have checked for system updates but there are none and have tried restarting the phone. I have a decent amount of storage left too so I'm unsure what to do. Thanks :)",
