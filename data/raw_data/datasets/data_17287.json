    "content": "The front camera it self works fine, in the camera app, and anywhere where you take a still image but on a video call like Facebook Messenger, What's App, etc the front camera is a blurry mess, I can only describe it as if it looks like the camera lens is smothered in finger prints, everything looks smudges but again, it's limited to them apps and on video calls.",
