    "content": "Hello, I have a Google Pixel 2 that I originally bought from Carphone Warehouse on an O2 contract. Both are saying the other is responsible for unlatching it so that I can give it to my mum who is on EE. I keep going round in circles trying to get it unlocked from the network. Can anyone suggest how I might fix it? I've already tried my own EE sim in it several times and it doesn't recognise the SIM so although most are sold unlocked it seems I'm unlucky that mine wasn't",
