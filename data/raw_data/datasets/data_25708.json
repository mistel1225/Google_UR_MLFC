    "content": "My Pixel downloaded and installed the December OTA update with no issue, I went into setting to see what version it's running and it still has the update dated for October. I understand that there are no further updates for the 2016 Pixel, but shouldn't the date have changed from October to December? If it wasn't going to change what was the point of the update?",
