    "content": "My Pixel 5 with a \"ZAGG - InvisibleShield Glass+ Screen Protector for Google Pixel 5\" is demonstrating inconsistent performance registering touches.  This issue is exacerbated when the device is placed on the Pixel stand wherein touches must be applied repeatedly and with great effort before they are recognized.\n\nMy hope is that Google may release touch screen sensitivity enhancements like provided for the Pixel 4 and (more recently) the 4a.  \n\nHere is a thread with others reporting the same issue:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/jk9jt8/pixel_5_touch_sensitivity/\n\nNote - I have not attempted to operate the device without a screen protector which may 'resolve' the immediate problem but leave the device susceptible to damage.",
