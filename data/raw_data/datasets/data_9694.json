    "content": "I bought a \"so-called\" brand new unlocked US variant of Pixel XL from a store, and received it. Upon inspection, it seems that the phone I bought is neither new nor unlocked.\n\nSo I contacted the seller for a refund, but I was responded as following:\n\n\"Please provide the official inspection statement from the brand owner to prove that the phone is refurbished. Thanks.\"\n\nSo here I am asking if I am wrong. Can I get my phone verified its condition?\nI am 99% sure that the phone i bought is not new. But please advice me if what I discovered is right.",
