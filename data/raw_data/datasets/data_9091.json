    "content": "I've been trying to connect to my school's wifi for 2 days now and my phone keeps switching between being connecting and saving the network. I'm connected just fine on other devices, and I've been able to connect previous semesters as well. I did a complete factory reset of my phone and still no luck. I really don't know what else to do.",
