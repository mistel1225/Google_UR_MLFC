    "content": "Hey guys,\n\nI've had my Google Pixel 3XL for about 2 months now. It's been great. Battery has been great, camera great, really everything has been awesome. Until today, when my screen just stopped working. At first, I figured the phone was just dead, so I plugged it in when I got home, but I realized soon that my phone was still vibrating from presumably texts/snapchats or whatever. I had my brother call me and sure enough my phone would vibrate. I have tried rebooting, factory resetting, cleaning my screen and the sensors. Nothing has worked. It has never been exposed to water or dropped hard; I'm pretty frustrated because I've taken really good care of this phone and it's just not working after only 2 months. Has anyone had this issue before?",
