    "content": "Hello, I have a pixel 4 xl. It's still under warranty until the 29th of this month. I purchased it new. In November  I was having a no charge issue and the battery was stuck on 50%. I took it to ubreakifix and they replaced the battery under warranty. After getting it back the phone would randomly cut off and would not turn back on. I took the phone back and they again replaced the battery and motherboard. \nAll was fine until last week. I again had the 50% issue so I again took it to ubreakifix and they replaced the battery and motherboard again. I picked the phone up last night and have not been able to re activate the phone on sprint using the esim function. Sprint tells me the new motherboard does not have an option to activate using esim. I'm dropping the phone back off at the repair shop but they're telling me they're not sure if they can do anything about it or not. I've always had it activated using the esim previously.\n  I've been trying to chat or get a callback with the pixel 2xl since that's the phone I'm currently using but I can't get the option you work I'm assuming because it's no longer supported.  \n\nWhat are my options from here? I've owned a Nexus S, Galaxy Nexus, Nexus 5, Nexus 6, Pixel, Pixel XL, Pixel 2 xl, pixel 3 xl, pixel 4 xl, Nexus 10, Nexus 9, Pixel C, Pixel Slate, Nexus Player, Chromecast, Chromecast with Google tv, Pixel buds and the pixel buds 2. I bet I'm missing something. Time to go apple I guess....",
