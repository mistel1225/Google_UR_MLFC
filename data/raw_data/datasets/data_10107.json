    "content": "I have 4xl and have developed an issue since the update. I have a 2013 Nissan Titan. Since the update, while playing music from my phone through my trucks stereo via Bluetooth, the stereo no longer displays the song being played, and I can no longer change songs using buttons on the stereo or the steering wheel. The music will play, but that’s it. Before the update, Monday, everything worked great. It displayed the song being played and I could skip songs easily. My phone is the issue. To check to make sure, I connected my wife’s LG G7, and it worked perfectly. It displayed the song playing, I could skip songs. I tried deleting the phone from the car radio and deleting the connection in my phone, and then reconnected. Didn’t fix it. How can I fix this?",
