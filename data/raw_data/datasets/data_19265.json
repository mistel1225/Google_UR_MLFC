    "content": "I bought some Airpods pro for my Pixel 3 XL and the max volume is to quiet even in a silent room. I've tried going to developer options and I turned on \"disable absolute volume\", I've tried volume booster apps, and forgetting and reconnecting to my Airpods pro yet I haven't found anything that makes any difference.",
