    "title": "Pixel 2 apps stopping, factory reset didn't fix",
    "content": "Started with popups saying \"Google has stopped.\" Then other apps did same thing - even some that were closed. Tried clearing cache/data on all apps, deleting all photos/music/files, removing all third party apps, and finally factory reset. Still getting occasional popup with only two third party apps installed, along with frequent app and system crashes and freezes.",
