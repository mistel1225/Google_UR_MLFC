    "content": "My finger print does work always, it used to for few months and now sometime it does sometimes it doesn't. I have another apple work phone which works flawlessly. I deleted and added fingerprint but, only works fine for a short time and does the same. I regret buying Pixel, should have stuck with apple.",
