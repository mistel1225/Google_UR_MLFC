    "title": "Why did my phone not restore all data after a reset?",
    "content": "My Google play app would crash repeatedly upon opening and wasn't able to update anything. So I decided to back up everything and do a factory reset which worked. I went through the process of setting my phone back up and got everything except a few of my photos but I lost all of my saved files on my phone which included docs I had saved to pictures I had backed up and put into docs there's not a single file that has anything in it it's all been lost. Any help would be appreciated. I'm not sure if there is something that can be done or if I'm just SOL.",
