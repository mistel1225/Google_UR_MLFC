    "content": "Hello. I have a pixel 3a. I want to take smaller photos using a different app. can anyone suggest an app that allows me to set the file size to something smaller, and that shows all the photos i take, in any app, and allows me to easily send them down the usb wire to my pc? I don't want massive files, I don't want to share over the internet, I don't want to lose them somewhere I can't  find them in the phone. Or should I just buy a 90's digital camera because this technology has just got so stupid that it has become unusable? Any ideas on a camera app that does this?",
