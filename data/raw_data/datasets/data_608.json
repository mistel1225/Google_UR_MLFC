Twice I have gone outdoors (hiking and at swim practice for my son) and my phone gives the warning its getting too warm. and it is very hot to the touch.  Nothing is running.  Checking or responding to a text message.    I cant go outdoors?  Wednesday google announced no more pixel 5s so there are none to  purchase and return my 4a 5g.  Has anyone fixed this issue?",
