    "content": "I am trying to find out if Call Screening is in fact counterproductive in fighting robocalls and spam, given that in answering such calls, Google Assistant is indicating that the phone number is valid and active. The FCC's rule of thumb seems to be that one should not answer robocalls and spam at all.",
