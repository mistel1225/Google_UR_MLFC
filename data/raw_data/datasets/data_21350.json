    "content": "I'm trying to contact Google support to file a warranty claim. I've been through the recommended procedures from the support site to try to get the phone working again, but all have been unsuccessful. The phone remains off although it is detected when plugged into a computer. Clicking around in circles on the support site trying to open a claim while the warranty is still intact but there's no email address or form I can find to submit this claim. Please advise.",
