    "content": "Hi,\nI bought a Google Pixel 3a today but all my attempts to connect my Beats Solos 3 to my device are unsuccessful. My phone can connect to other wireless devices but not to the Beats headphones. I've tried to turn the Bluetooth on and off as well as my headphones multiple times but the problem persists. Also, I made sure that the location was adequate; there seems to be no reason as to why the Beats Solos do not appear in the list of available devices for the Bluetooth option. I followed all the necessary steps required for a Bluetooth connection but it still does not work. Thank you and looking forward to your answers!",
