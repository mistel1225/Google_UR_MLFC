    "content": "I contacted the help center as the data which was backed up is missing after restoration. more than 1.5GB of data is missing after restoration. but the help center closed the issue in a easy way saying that back up had problem. I have been really upset on the data that is missing during the restoration. i am extremely dissatisfied with the response and loss. i didn't expect this response from google support. the folders that were in the internal storage are missing. i was guided saying that all the data will be safe. but its not. its all missing.",
