Is there any way to change the shutter speed to 20 to 30 seconds or any app..? I have tried Camera FV 5 pro and also other apps where we get manual controls on camera but each and every app shutter speed goes to max 4 seconds ONLY.. \nI want to click light trail photos and light painting.. \nI have also attached camera fv 5 app P3XL shutter speed screenshot for reference...
