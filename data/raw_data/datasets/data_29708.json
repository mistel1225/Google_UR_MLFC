    "content": "Hi!\nMy phone has stopped working.\nIt does not respond to the power button, there is nothing on the screen.\n\nWindows Device Manager defines it as qusb__bulk.\nLinux defines it as Qualcomm USB modem.\n\nBootloader is locked and I have always used only official android.\n\nIt seems that the device has switched to EDL mode.\nI think this is a software error and you solved it in the last update:\nhttps://source.android.com/security/bulletin/pixel/2019-07-01\n\"Fixes an issue for some devices getting stuck in EDL mode with a blank screen\"\n\nPlease help solve this problem.",
