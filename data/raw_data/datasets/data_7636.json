    "content": "Hi, my 3XL has had a weird keyboard lag since Jan 2020 and sometimes I'll be typing without swift but it will just switch to swift although my finger is not touching the screen. I have a hard time typing as it will miss letters due to lag unless I start typing extremely slowly. Anyone have this and fixed it?",
