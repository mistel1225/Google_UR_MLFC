    "content": "According to Google's own website. if you follow the steps then multiple pieces of information will get saved; including text messages.\n\nhttps://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/7179901?hl=en#zippy=%2Cwhat-backs-up-automatically%2Cturn-automatic-backup-on-or-off\n\nMy phone factory reset without my knowledge (not important). I wasn't too concerned as I have everything or at least I thought I had everything being backed up. When my phone reset not everything that google guaranteed was actually backed up. I lost all of my text messages. Now I'm trying to figure out if there is a way to get this back? After the factory reset, when I noticed nothing transferred over, I did another factory reset, which only transferred over my apps. Is there any way to get these text messages back. Some are from people who are no longer with us, and I really didn't want to lose these.\n\nAlso, why does google's site say that texts are backed up? I spoke to someone at google support who said that it \"may or may not work\". I'm not sure why that's not indicated on their website???? Seems like important information.",
