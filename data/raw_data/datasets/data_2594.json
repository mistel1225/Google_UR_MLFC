    "title": "Pixel 4a, Extream battery saver still not so optimized, my 4 years old moto g5s plus works better",
    "content": "I have moto g5s plus running on android 8 and pixel 4a running android 11, I have turned on extreme battery saver in pixel and normal battery saver in moto phone and kept them aside overnight. Surprisingly pixel 4a battery drained more that motorola mobile which also has similar mah battery, so atleast seeing this it doesn't seems this new features offers extra benifit. And also I still haven't put any simcard in my pixel phone but moto has my sim.\n\nNot sure why being latest device with lasted software it doesn't beat 4 years old moto phone",
