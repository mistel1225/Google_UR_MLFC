If not, can that feature be added?  \n\nMost of my spam calls now come from spoofed numbers starting with a particular area code and exchange, but the last 3-4 digits change each time to avoid call blockers.  \n\nSo I would like to enter the number to be blocked using wildcards to match the offending pattern. For example:  312-555-1***",
