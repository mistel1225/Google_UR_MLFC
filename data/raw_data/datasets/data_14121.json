    "content": "Hello,\n\nI would like to use a corded, mic'ed headset with the Pixel 4a. I see that it has a 3.5mm jack, but I can't tell if that jack supports a 4-pole plug (ground, mic, left speaker, right speaker) or if it only supports a 3-pole plug (ground, left speaker, right speaker).\n\nThanks in advance; any information would be helpful!\n\n-=CC=-",
