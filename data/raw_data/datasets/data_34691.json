    "content": "Just wondering if anyone else is having this issue?  Playing a video with no sound/muted and I get a static sound from my top speaker.  I don't get the static while a GIF is playing.  And it happens on every video with no sound/muted, but only at that time.  Have never heard it during any other operation.",
