    "content": "I'm using a Pixel 4XL with a brand new pair of Sony WF100MX3 headphones. With previous Bluetooth headphones I have put the phone on silent and notification sounds would not play. However with these, I cannot stop the sounds from playing and this constantly interrupts music! I thought this may be a problem with the headphones but it's playing the phone's notification sound. Can anyone help?",
