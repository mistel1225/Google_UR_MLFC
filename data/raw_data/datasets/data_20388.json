    "content": "Whenever I plug the Pixel to my laptop (USB-C to USB-C), it always defaults to charging my laptop with my Pixel. Is there a setting to change the default? When I toggle the switch it complains that it can't do it; I had to unplug and re-plug the cable for the setting to take effect.\n\n\n\n\nSeriously Google... I doubt most users wish to charge their laptop with their phone by default when connecting the phone to the laptop.",
