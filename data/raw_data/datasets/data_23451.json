    "content": "My first phone I had to go to the store and they sent me a new one. My second phone worked for about 2 months and had the same problem. It randomely shuts down while pretty charged and I cant charge it or do a hard reset. I love the phone but 2 out of 2 completely stoped working after 1-2 months. I am disappointed that I cant get a phone that works well. Will I have to go exchange my phone for a new one everytime???",
