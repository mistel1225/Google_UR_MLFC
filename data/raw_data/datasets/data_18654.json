    "content": "I was using my phone and when I turned it off and tried to turn it back on it did not respond and then it rebooted. This issue would continue to happen, any time the phone would screen time out it would not turn back on and would then reboot again.\n\nSteps I have taken:\nI booted into safe mode and the issue was still occurring\nI did a full factory reset and a full one by using Power + Volume Down button to full wipe\nI updated all apps to see if they were the issue\nI turned off all features for the lockscreen \n\nIs this happening for anybody else? I would really love a fix for this.\n\nUPDATE: This doesn't occur when the phone is charging.",
