    "content": "Hello,\n\nI have an original Pixel. A few days ago, I had both the screen and battery replaced. Today, I let my phone dip to a low power level. When I plugged it in the first time, the lock screen would flash fora moment before reverting to a black screen.\n\nWhen I plug it in now, I occasionally see a gray screen before flashing back to white. The phone still vibrates when I plug it in or unlock it with my fingerprint, but there's no other response.\n\nAny help is appreciated.",
