    "title": "Pixel 3 XL back panel side is splitting apart",
    "content": "My phone's back cover seems to be coming loose on one side (the side with the power and volume buttons). While the corners and other 3 sides are still nice and tight, the centre of this side is splitting apart.\n\nI have tried pushing it together again and while it is possible to close it with pressure, it will just crack open again slowly in a minute. It just doesn't close. I can see the battery.\n\nI have no other issues with the phone. The phone has never been dropped and there are no dents. The phone is in impeccable condition.\n\nIs it possible to get this fixed under warranty (it is under a 2-year warranty) and is this the best course of action? Please advise.\n\nPixel 3 XL was purchased in 2018 November from Google Store online",
