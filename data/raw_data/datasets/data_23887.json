    "title": "Recorded video on Pixel 3 is shortened to 1 second loop",
    "content": "I have recorded multiple videos on my Pixel 3 and watched them in full after recording them, but some videos do not appear to save properly.  It may have something to do with the back-up process, since I can usually watch the videos the same day I record them fine, but a few days later the video is only one second long.  It does not happen to every video, but it has happened for three videos since early September.\n\nI do not know if there has been an Android update recently, and I am not very tech-savvy, so I do not even know where to begin looking for the video that was saved to the phone instead of Google Photos.\n\nSome of these videos were from a vacation and I'm hoping they are not lost forever, but I just want to know how to get the full video back, and how to prevent this from happening in the future.",
