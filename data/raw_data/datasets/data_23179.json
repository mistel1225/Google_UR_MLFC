    "content": "I was using my phone with the pixel earbuds that come with it. Suddenly, the right audio cut out. I tried to locate the problem, and found that it was the connection from the volume up control and the cord itself. Eventually, the classic \"push the cord to one direction and keep it like that as you listen to audio\" ploy came into light. Is there a way to fix it, or should I just get new headphones?",
