    "content": "Have sent feedback about this after every phone update over the last year!! Every other phone in the world, volume up and down controls the ring volume. When I need my phone to be quite for any reason, I have to unlock it, go into the settings, and manually slide the ring volume down. this is stupid! It's a phone right? Not a computer, a phone. Every other phone knows the difference when I want to turn Netflix down. When nothing else is running, it turns ring volume down. Why does the phone, made by the smartest company in the world, who has endless files on what people use their volume buttons for, think that it's a good idea, to make the volume buttons NOT CONTROLL THE VOLUME!!!!!!! FIX THIS please!?!?",
