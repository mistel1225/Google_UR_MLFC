    "content": "When inputting voice into Google Assistant, the text is off centered and not aligned. I have tried resetting the Google app, clearing cache and storage. Changing system display and font size also did not fix the issue.\n\nThis has been the case since I've gotten the phone day one. Anyone else having the same issue?",
