    "content": "My screen on my google pixel 4 is broken so I took it to a man to have it replaced at the cost of £140. Whilst he had my phone he says the new screen wasn’t compatible with the battery so I have to have a new battery installed at the cost of a further £40. Is this a genuine problem or is this man conning me to get extra cash from me??",
