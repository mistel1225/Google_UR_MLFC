    "title": "Phone not charging shows connected to usb device even when using the wall adapter",
    "content": "My pixel won't charge with the wall adapter, it shows that the device is connected via usb even when connecting to a wall adapter. It also won't recognise my computer unless I change the usb connected device to \"this device\". I've tried my best to fix this issue.....tried force restart, factory reset and even hard resets. The only thing left to do is flashing the firmware. Does anyone have any other ideas which I should consider before flashing the device.\n\nCharging works(very slowly) when the device is turned off",
