    "content": "My camera has started to do this weird thing where it's almost like it's trying to focus but just makes the screen shake. It makes a loud clicking noise I've never noticed before and the whole screen shakes, this can be seen in videos and is causing pictures to blur. Is there any fix to this or does it need to be sent off/replaced? It's only about a month or 2 old.",
