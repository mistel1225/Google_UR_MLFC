    "content": "I just bought a 4A 5G a few days ago and am experiencing contradicting display information. My status bar battery display works for a while then all of a sudden shoots up to 100% and stays there. I can verify it's not displaying correctly by going to the battery page in settings, See below.....\n\nHas anyone else experienced this problem? ",
