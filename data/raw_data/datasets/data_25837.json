    "content": "I have selected English (US) and Finnish (Finland) in device languages. I have also selected English (US) and Finnish (Finnish) in Gboard languages, and on the Virtual keyboard screen on my device, Gboard shows \"Multilingual typing\".\n\nNow I go to some app, change keyboard to Finnish, and start typing, but Gboard stubbornly only suggest and autocorrects my words to something in English.\n\nWhy and how to fix?",
