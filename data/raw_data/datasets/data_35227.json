    "title": "Very specific sounds are not working on my Pixel XL since 15th December.",
    "content": "As of 15th December I have almost no sound from my device. Below are the instances that I can/can't hear sound.\n\nI CAN hear sound when:\n - I can hear my ringtone when someone calls me\n - I can hear someone when I switch to speakerphone (they can hear me through the mic both on speaker phone and normal earpiece mode)\n - I can listen to music via earphones plugged in using 3mm cable (though my inline buttons are not working - not sure if this is related)\n\nI CAN'T hear any sound when:\n- I answer the call and listen using the default speaker at my ear\n- I play media via spotify, Instagram, YouTube etc\n\nThe weird thing is, in the sound settings which break the levels into media, call, ring and alarm volume, only the ring and alarm volumes make a noise when adjusting the sliders. The media and call volumes do not make any sound.\n\nAlso, if I try to set a new ringtone for my phone or alarm sound, I can hear the demo noises. However, if I try to set the ringtone for notifications I cannot hear any of the demos.\n\nWhat is going on? Hopefully someone can shed some light on the matter and the sound may follow ;)",
