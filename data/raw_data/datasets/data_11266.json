    "content": "I'm using the Google Pixel 2XL manufactured in November 2017. I upgraded to Android 11 about a month ago and it's giving me lots of issues (apps crash, phone lags, battery drains really fast)\nI want to downgrade to a lower version which is more suitable for my phone. Which Android version would you recommend as most optimal why? Or, have you tried factory reset and recommend that? Thanks in advance!",
