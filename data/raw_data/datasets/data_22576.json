    "title": "Pixel 3XL shuts down when screen sleeps, but not when playing audio or plugged in",
    "content": "The phone turns itself off, within seconds of being locked or the screen turning off due to inactivity. It starts up again just fine. This started happening 2 days ago - no trigger event as far as I can tell.\n\nCuriously, it stays on if audio is playing, or if plugged into a PC via USB, but not when plugged into a plain charger. This makes me think it's some particular trigger or event in the system that is causing it to turn off.\n\nProblem persists in safe mode. Have done factory reset & phone is fully updated. Phone has an aftermarket screen replacement which has been working fine until now.\n\nAny ideas before looking at replacement? Thanks.",
