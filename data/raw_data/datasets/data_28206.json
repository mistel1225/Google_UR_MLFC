    "content": "So my PIxel 2 XL not only stopped charging, it's telling me it's \"Fully Charged\" at just 36%. So I'm a little nervous to reset it because I know that kills the battery and if it doesn't charge I'll lose my phone. And I've tried 3 different cables, 2 of which were from google. 1 was plugged into my PC's thunderbolt outlet and the other was plugged into the brick also from google into a normal wall outlet. The third one is a type c to type c cable from Mac that's plugged into google's brick. Still get the same results. Right now it's \"charging\" but it keeps dropping. It's at 34% and still says \"Fully Charged\". This is the first time I have no clue what to do. Any suggestions?",
