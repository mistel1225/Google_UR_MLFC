    "content": "All sensors on my Pixel 3 had stopped working right after the June OS update. This includes the accelerometer, light and proximity sensor, magnetometer, compass, gyroscope and barometer. I had tried restarting the device, restarting into safe mode, and even factory resetting twice. Nothing seemed to have worked. To this affect, my screen stays on when I answer a call, my landscape photos come out in portrait, my phone refuses to wake on lifting, calls can't be silenced by flipping, the phone lags heavily when I try to wake it through finger print or the power button, and squeezing the sides won't activate google assistant. I have all of the appropriate settings activated. \n\nThis seems to be a well known, and well documented problem for Pixel 3 using android Q, since last year. When I contacted Google I was told they can't do anything, and I need to send my phone to a repair shop, because my phone isn't under warranty and that they haven't received any reports about such issues regarding sensors. This doesn't seem like a problem with hardware, but a software issue, how is a repair shop supposed to help?",
