    "title": "Pixel 3 bootloop after recent update; recovery/safe mode inaccesible",
    "content": "My pixel 3 has been stuck on a bootloop since December 17th after restarting my phone to finish an update. I've tried to access safe mode, but as soon as I lift my finger off the volume key, it instantly returns to the bootloop. I've let the phone die and tried to reboot it after. It continued to get stuck in the bootloop. I've tried a usb to pc connection but it's not recognized in the usb, whether it's on or off.\n\nAt this point I only want to fix this phone so I can recover my files, because all of the problems I've had since I updated to android 11 are too much. I can't access my files because I have to unlock it, and obviously I can't unlock the pos without it booting...\n\nNone of the websites I've looked at are helpful because they all say the same thing: \"go into safety/recovery boot\", and I can't. I've searched up \"how to fix pixel 3 bootloop when recovery/safety mode won't work\" and it only shows me how to fix it WITH recovery/safety modes. This is honestly a last resort. A lot of those files are important, and they weren't backed up to google drive because google drive has been a train wreck for the past 5 months, making it impossible to upload anything from mobile devices.",
