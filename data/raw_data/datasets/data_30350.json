    "content": "So I've got a new Pixel 3a and when I make long (or even not so long ) calls, a while into it I can still hear the person but they can't hear me and we have to hang up.  I don't think I'm hitting the mute button with my face, and it happens when I'm using the speaker phone too.  I'm on verizon which may be part of the issue.",
