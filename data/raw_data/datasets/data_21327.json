    "content": "Hi there, Good afternoon!\n\nI have the next question, I know that since the last update to android 10 Tap to translate is not working how it used to work. I saw an Image that if your cellphone detect your language the first option once you click into a phrase would be \"Translate\" like this picture\n\n\nBut the thing is that I dont have that option everytime that I need to translate something, is always in the 3 dots options like this \n\n\nMy question is, How can I do to have the \"Translate\" button like the first image, I mean once I click in one word/phrase \n\nThank you so much!",
