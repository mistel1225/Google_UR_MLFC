    "title": "Phone randomly opens camera app & power cycle loop after March 2020 Security Update",
    "content": "March 2020 Update was installed, new features cause power button to be super sensitive (i.e: opens wallet then camera app any time I touch my phone screen or sides). I removed my thin spigen case, cleaned it, and no change. Same issues with the case off, phone still power cycles and opens camera app and wallet. Seems others are having the same issues in the last week or two... those threads are locked for comment... lets not kill the info but find a fix/admit there is an issue. No other issues with the phone performance or operation until the 2020 Security Update. Trying to power drain to see if it will help clear the short term stored memory. Anyone else have this issue and found any fixes?",
