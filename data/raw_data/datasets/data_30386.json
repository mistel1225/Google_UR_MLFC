    "title": "Now Playing History Missing Random Month",
    "content": "Is there a possible bug with the Now Playing that causes it to not show identified songs for a random month? (Or is it possible that there is an option to hide a month which I may unknowingly have activated?)\n\nLong story short, while in the month of May I had a fairly extensive list of identified songs that were being shown in my history. As soon as it became June it is no longer showing anything identified from May in the history. I never deleted or hide anything directly. And interestingly my history goes from April to June 1 - June 1 and is now listing everything identified since the beginning of the month.\n\nBut nothing for May is listed anymore since this month began.",
