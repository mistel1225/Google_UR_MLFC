    "content": "Sometimes at night, city lights generate hugo light rays on photos. It is ugly and I don't know how to set the camera to avoid it.\n\nIt looks like it depends a lot on the current light in the scene as the phenomenon is not systematic.\n\nSometimes it is there, sometimes, there is only a small halo effect that one can tolerate on night time shots....\n\nIs there a setting to avoid the large rays effect?\n\nSee the pictures attached. The photo without the rays was taken on an other day, all photos taken in night mode.",
