    "content": "My pixel 2xl was charging and I went on to read some whatsapp messages and all of a sudden the screen became yellowish and the colors were like faded out, it also flickered for some time but then the flickering was stopped but the yellow filter still remained. I checked if it was the night light but it was off. Can someone help me out?!",
