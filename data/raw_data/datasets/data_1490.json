    "title": "Pixel 3 on Android 11 does not react to calls and call forwards even with all CF settings off",
    "content": "I deactivated call forwarding (all settings off) but phone does not react when receiving a call and keeps forwarding the call.  When I check cf configurations, a phone number shows, but such number is not the one that receives the forwarded call.  In the cf configuration step in which I get to see the cf number, there are only a Cancel and a Activate buttoms, there is no Turn Off buttom (as shown in all instructions found in google).  Please advise on 1) weather this might be a phone service provider issue, or 2) a problem with my cell phone, or cell phone - Android interaction and possible steps to follow to definitively cancel call forwarding.  thanks",
