    "title": "Phone keeps restarting after switching off of sim card authenticated wifi",
    "content": "After updating my phone to android 11, it has with a 100% certainty restarted my phone every single time I connect to a sim card authenticated wifi connection and then switch either to a different wifi connection, to data, or to a different router on the same network. This is a critical bug as a huge part of my weekly use of my phone is on the subway here in Korea.\n\nThis issue only started to occur after updating to 11 and the problem persisted even after reseting my device.",
