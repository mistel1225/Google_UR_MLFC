    "content": "I had my phone on youtube music when it randomly stopped playing. If I press the power button and then the fingerprint scanner the vibrate function for when it would normally wake the screen will trigger. I have tried triggering safe mode(the volume down button and power button for 8 seconds) but that had no effect. I have tried turning on and off the device to no effect. Sometimes with no apparent consistency when I turn on the phone a flash will appear in the bottom left corner of the device.",
