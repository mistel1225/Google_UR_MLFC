    "content": "It has been two weeks and nothing has been done to locate the phone that I sent to google!  Terrible service.  I have the tracking number and verification that google received my phone and I have gotten no update or confirmation that my phone has been received.  \n\nI get a different support person every time and they ask the same questions over and over. Not once have I had a resolution to my issue.  This is the worst customer service I've ever experienced.\n\nDo not buy a phone from google!!!!!",
