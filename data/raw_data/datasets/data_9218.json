    "content": "I am really disappointed with this poor video quality issue in WhatApp in my new Google pixel 5. In this social media age a very bad camera during video/photo is something not acceptable at all. Apple does a great job. I am not sure what you could do to fix this. I am very much upset to have bought the new Google pixel 5.\n\nDo something about it.",
