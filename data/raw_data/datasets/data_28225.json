    "content": "Tried buying unlocked Google Pixel 3a from Target but they gave me Verizon version. Didn't realize as I was using a prepaid Verizon Sim in USA.  Went back to Peru and now it says only works with Verizon Sim cards - Peru doesn't have Verizon.\n\nVerizon said they aren't going to unlock it so is there anything Google can do to help turn my $400 dollar paperweight back into a cellphone?",
