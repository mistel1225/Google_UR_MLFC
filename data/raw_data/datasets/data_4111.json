    "title": "Pixel 5 Wobbly Camera Autofocus Issues",
    "content": "I bought my phone exactly one month ago and since a few days I am experiencing autofocus stuttering issues with the primary lens (ultrawide and front facing camera still work perfectly fine). When I open the camera app I see a blurry image most of the time and when I then use the white circle to focus on an object I would hear a clicking/rattling sound and a shaking image with the primary lens trying to focus on the object. Sometimes it works after mulitple attempts, sometimes it doesnt and the image remains blurry. Clearing the cache, restoring the system and starting the phone in safe mode has not helped so far. Has anyone else experienced these issues before?",
