    "title": "Pixel 3a Not Displaying Correct Caller ID",
    "content": "My Pixel 3a has never properly displayed the incoming caller's ID. This includes both contacts already in my phone (transferred from my old Nexus 5X) and calls not in my Contacts. \nI feel like I've tried everything possible. I've been in touch with Google support many times and followed every suggestion they made, some of which messed up other settings. I finally did a Factory Reset (which created a whole new set of FRUSTRATING problems) and am back to Square 1. \nTexts come in with the correct sender's ID, but calls persistently show my own number as the Caller ID.\nThis is getting old, returning to 1990, not knowing who is calling me before I answer. Any ideas?\n\nThings I've already tried:\n- Turning on/off Caller ID and Spam Filtering\n- Updating/Turning off/uninstalling Hangouts \n- Dialing the FixMe code\n- Factory Reset\n- Asking for a new phone from Google (which resulted in me being told I'd be sent a refurbished phone and charged the price of a new phone if I failed to send in the NEW phone I ordered back in June if I didn't return it in time which about made me hit the ceiling!)",
