    "content": "My camera app will not launch. It was completely fine yesterday as I took a few photos of artwork & my cat. I have tried everything that is suggested in the support article; cleaning the lenses, restarting the phone (did this several times), clear camera app's cache, update the app & all apps, and checked to see if other apps are the problem. I deleted the last few apps I downloaded and nothing has changed. It won't even open. None of my apps that have a camera function work. This is extremely frustrating as it was perfectly fine yesterday and I use this phone to create videos for work purposes. If anyone has suggestions, I would greatly appreciate the help.",
