    "content": "I ordered the Pixel 4 XL and some other items (Nest and Google Home Max) last month.\n\nOnce it arrived, I could not find the phone included in the parcel so I contacted the support. After 6 cases and 4 weeks of investigation we found the phone finally. As I already bought another locally in the meantime, I decided to return it, however now I am being refused and told they will not accept my return.\n\nI explicitely asked about the return period deadline AHEAD of time to ensure I would not run into this problem and even got reassured NOT to worry about any periods as these are special circumstances.\n\nThe phone number provided in the emails 1-855-836-3978 and all the others I found on the internet do not work due to the current corona crisis and the chat option (that I contacted 20+ times now) does not help any further either...\n\nI am desperate!",
