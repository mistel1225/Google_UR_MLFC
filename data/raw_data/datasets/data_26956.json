    "content": "Since upgrading to Android 10, I have had repeated issues with bluetooth and with my battery performance.\n\nBluetooth -- My car will connect to bluetooth on my Pixel 3, but it won't always play through the car speakers. I have to select the audio output on the phone, change it from car to This Device, then back to car, to get it to play. I will also have to adjust bluetooth volume settings almost every time as it resets them to mute.\n\nBattery -- My battery is draining twice as fast at least as it used to. As I type this (on my computer, not my phone), my phone is on the charger and has lost 4% battery in 5 minutes. WHILE CHARGING.\n\nGoogle needs to acknowledge these issues and either fix them or let us downgrade to Android 9.",
