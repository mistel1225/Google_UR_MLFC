    "title": "Issues after A11 update",
    "content": "Since the update I continually experience the following, which are typically alleviated with a reboot for about 5 hours or so before returning (Pixel 4XL).\n\n- Browser windows will individually show offline and won't refresh.  Copying the address and opening a new browser window fixes the issue for a bit.\n- Approaching the phone no longer activates the screen.  \n- Lifting no longer activates the screen.\n- Facial unlock stops activating, going right to PIN entry.\n- FPS while scrolling apps/websites/documents drops to 15 when used after being on charger while asleep.\n\nThat;'s about it atm.  Like I said, rebooting fixes most of the issues for a few hours before they return. Hoping someone gets this to the right hands so fixes can be made and patched.",
