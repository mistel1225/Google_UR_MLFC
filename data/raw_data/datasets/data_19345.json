    "content": "My phone constantly blocks 2 specific numbers. They go straight to vm. There are no numbers in my blocking list. Spoke with Bell. They have checked their equipment and can't figure it out. They were going to escalate to their engineers dept. No resolution yet. Been months. These numbers are important.  Very inconvenient for me and the two people whose numbers are blocked. Suggestions? Need help.",
