    "content": "Each time I log into the Barclays app the notification for 'contactless mobile payments active' will only appear for a minute or so before it requires me to log into the app again to reactivate. I've tried changing the privacy setting on the phone but this doesn't seem to work.\nAny ideas on how to extend the availability time?",
