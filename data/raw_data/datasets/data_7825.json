    "content": "I have Crossfade 2 Wireless Codex Edition headphones.  Previously I had a Pixel 2 and was able to use aptX audio codec.  After upgrading to a Pixel 5 and android 11 I am no longer able to connect via any option except SBC (all other options are grayed out).  Any ideas?  All solutions I have seen with this issue are related to Sony headphones.  Thanks.",
