    "content": "Remove/shut off Pixel 3 \"see latest message\" that  automatically shows up at bottom of text message when we are scrolling through a text thread.  We've searched all options on Pixel 3, but didn't find option to get rid of that.  It blocks actual texts & messes up screen shots of texts.  Thank you.",
