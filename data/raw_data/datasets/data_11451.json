    "content": "I am so frustrated. I just ordered the Pixel 4a 5g for the larger screen. I had a Samsung Galaxy 9 and I thought the larger screen on the 4a 5g would make the font sizes even larger. I am visually impaired so this is very important to me. \nI set up my new phone with the largest font sizes and everything is significantly smaller than my old phone. I am so disappointed. I can't change the size in messenger. My apps all look the same. The font is laughable. How is this accessible? Did the developers even work with someone who's visually impaired to see if it's well designed? I wonder how terrible the accessibility is for people with other disabilities. \nI've honestly never been an iPhone or Apple user, but the thoughtlessness of the design of this phone means I'll be returning this to finally get an iPhone since apparently they're they best in the game when it comes to accessibility. STEP IT UP GOOGLE!",
