    "content": "Its just a trivial matter but since i got the pixel 3a along with a front and a back glass protectors. Is it okay to put a back glass protector on the backside of the phone ? I mean if it was glass it would be actually effective but considering the more grippy and polycarbonate material on the back side of the phone, will it cause any problem ?",
