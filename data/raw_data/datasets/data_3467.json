    "title": "Liquid and Debris message won't go away despite port appearing clean and dry",
    "content": "The liquid and Debris message is something I'm familiar with but it usually shows up for an hour at most. It's been around now for about 2-2.5 hours. I tried all the recommended solutions to no avail.\n\nWhile I did initially find water in the port it appears to be gone now and wasn't a large amount to begin with but the message is still there. I don't want to risk permanent damage to my device by enabling the port to charge it\n\nAny help is appreciated",
