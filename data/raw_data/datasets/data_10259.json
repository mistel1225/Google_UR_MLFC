    "content": "Below around 60% if I open any app that uses the camera, the phone will crash and will lose significant battery. I have tried factory reset, camera in safe mode and clearing app cache. Not sure if this is a battery, camera or software issue and as my device is out of warranty, I am not sure what to do or even what to get a repair for.",
