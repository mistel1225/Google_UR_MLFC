    "content": "Google stand was working fine. I had to reset my phone to factory settings because it was getting to slow. I did it and after that when I place my pixel 3xl on the pixel stand it won't show the tips bubbles with recommend Google assistant commands. Instead it only shows a grey scale Google assistant icon and the label stating that it is fast charging. Any idea on how to get the bubble tips back? \n\nI tried to forget the Google stand and configure it again and didn't work. \n\nThabks",
