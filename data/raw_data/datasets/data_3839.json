    "title": "Sudden overnight battery drain on Pixel 3a",
    "content": "I restrict permissions on my Pixel 3A, keep location off, don't use bluetooth, avoid heavy-duty apps (like Facebook), and turn on airplane mode before going to bed.  Almost always the phone loses 2-3% of its battery level overnight.  But last night, without any apparent explanation, it lost 18%, dropping from 89 to 71 in 8 hours with no use. Something similar happened a couple of years ago, but that was after a software update;. And another odd symptom: When I tried to check battery usage data to see if one app was responsible, it said this data wasn't available (which I've never seen before). Any suggestions?",
