    "content": "While winter walking i place my cellphone in a coat pocket and have a bluetooth headset paired. To avoid false touch dialing or launching etc many manufacturers turn off the touch response while in pocket or facedown and thats smart. Apple told me that my 8 shuts down voice response also and indeed I found it would not respond for bluetooth or direct voice when facedown or in pocket.  My last android did awaken to bluetooth button on earset but not to hey google voice request on bluetooth in pocket. I need it to awaken to voice not only to the physical bluetooth button's signal.  Does the Pixel 3a do this?  Thanks",
