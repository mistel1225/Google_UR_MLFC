    "title": "Android: chrome stuck in dark mode",
    "content": "I turned on dark mode for chrome on my pixel 3 back when it was first announced and required turning on flags and whatnot.  Since then no matter what I do it's been stuck in dark mode, which wouldn't be so bad but it's constantly making images show up in negative and it's driving me nuts.  I've tried reverting all the settings back to default, turning off anything to do with dark mode on the phone.  I've turned off dark mode and dark app themes on all the pcs I use, and the furthest I've gotten is to have the Google home page show up normal but as soon as I search something the results pages go back to dark mode...  Any suggestions on how to fix this would be appreciated.",
