    "title": "My phone can't connect to chargers consistently",
    "content": "I have gotten the port professionally cleaned, and the charger still didn't consistently work. I then had someone replace the usb-c port and it still won't consistently charge. The port clicks into place with the cord, but doesn't charge. The charging only works occasionally and only on one side of the cord. Wireless charging nworks, but seems slower than before this issue. \n\nThe audio for the pixel usb-c headphones also doesnt really work. \n\nDoes anyone know what the problem could possibly be?",
