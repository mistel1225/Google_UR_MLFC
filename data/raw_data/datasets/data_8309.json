    "content": "Hi. This is a nightmare. I ordered the Pixel 5 with the Bose promotion in October 2020, I waited 15 days and then claimed my headphones which was validated.\nHere we are in January and I tried contact who deals with the promotion, here's where the fun starts.\nThey said they sent the headphones out (didn't know when), I had no confirmation email,  but they were Supposedly returned to them as the address is wrong?\nThey wanted me to do a new claim, so asked me to send  my EMEI number again, and address,  I sent a  photograph of an addressed letter to me (just so there is no confusion) long with another photo of my EMEI number. Unsure why I have to do a new claim if by there own admission they already validated the original claim and sent them out\nThis was the 5th of January, they don't reply to my emails, I contacted Google who said they can't help because it's basically nothing to do with them, they suggested I email, how helpful!.\nI have come to the conclusion that I will not see these headphones, I now feel conned and would not have bought the phone in the first place if it wasn't for the promotion, I would have stuck with One+.\nHere's the bummer, I can't return the phone as it's not broken and I'm past my 30 day return period.\nAnyone have any Idea's as Google are unable to help with there own promotion issues, can't return the phone.\nMany thanks\nfrom a soon to be ex very loyal Google products purchaser.",
