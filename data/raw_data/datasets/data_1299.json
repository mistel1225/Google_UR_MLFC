    "content": "I installed the Android 12 Beta on my Pixel 4a, then after it installed I wiped my phone, now at the Android setup I am prompted for my pin, I enter it, then it asks if I want to restore from an old phone, no matter what I do here I am returned to a screen asking for my PIN to verify the device, then again to restoring my phone from a previous backup. Then again back to PIN, and so on.\n\nThis happens indefinitely no matter what I do. I can wipe the device and get the same exact results. The phone is basically unusable at this point. \n\nThe phone was not OEM unlocked beforehand so I flashing another build is not an option.",
