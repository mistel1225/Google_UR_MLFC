    "content": "Locked screen even after factory reset. My 6 year old son typed the pattern in too many times incorrectly and the phone said that the phone was locked and that the fingerprint was disabled. I tried to reset through the FindDevice website to no avail. So I reset it using the buttons. Now it is on the \"Hi There\" screen after the reset with a lock icon in the top left and I am unable to press any buttons on the screen to get started.",
