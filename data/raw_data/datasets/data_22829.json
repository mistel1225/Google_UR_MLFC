    "content": "Can someone please assist me?\n\nI am having issues charging my Pixel 3 on the Pixel Stand. In the middle of the night it'll show an orange light on the stand and my Pixel 3 will stop charging no matter what percentage it's at.\n\nIt's been doing this a few times for weeks. I have tried removing the case, rebooting the phone, disabling Pixel Stand app because it's insanely buggy and constantly flickers the screen in a lock/unlock state.\n\nThe Pixel Stand is plugged into a $30 8 outlet Belkin surge protector that is six years old. I doubt that is the issue.\n\nCan anyone explain to me why the stand is being incredibly stubborn in charging my phone? Half the time it works, it charges slowly.\n\nI really don't want to have to wipe my Pixel because I use it for work as well, with my RSA softkey, which is a nightmare to renew.\n\nPlease advise, thanks.",
