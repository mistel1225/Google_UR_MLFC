    "content": "Hi there,\n\nI upgraded my Google Pixel 3 to Android 10. After the update, there are many features of the phone that is not working such as mobile data not being able to turn on. The home button is not working. The function to backup the phone is missing as well and I am unable to use developer mode to enable USB debugging. I want to downgrade the phone back to Android 9 but I am unable to backup as well as unable to use my PC to backup because I cannot use USB debugging which I previously have enabled. The Play Store is also unable to update apps as well.\n\nThere are many problems with the phone now, is there a way to revert back to the previous version without losing all my data?",
