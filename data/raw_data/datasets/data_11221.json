    "content": "Pixel 3XL directly connected to computer; with Windows 10 OS, using a cable for downloads. I've attempted to change \"USB setting\" from \"charging\" to transfer files or USB storage device and always receive a message that - windows does Not recognize USB device and I cannot transfer anything....!\n\nFrustrating, especially when it used to be sssooooooo easy to switch between the two settings and just download.\n\nThank you kindly for remedying this silly \"glitch\".",
