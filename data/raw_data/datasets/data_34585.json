    "content": "Hi~ \nI got a Pixel 3, which work fine until recently.\nAs USB-C cable can be charge for both side plugged in, but now it can only charge for 1 side connected. \nTried different cable and power plugged, still work same.\n\nI found out if I connect the non-working side and restart it, it will work fine but only limit to charge slowly. If I unplugged and plugged it again, it won't work.\n\nAny solution ?",
