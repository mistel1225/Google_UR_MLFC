    "content": "So here the problem, from my understanding pixel phone have nfc transaction , by transaction i mean that the phone can transmit signal and not only read\n\nI had a pop up that offered me to download google pay , so i went on it redirects me to google play , hold and behold Google play says the phone is not compatible which is weird.\nWent and download a different app , called cards (allow u to clone ur bus card / credit card and more) didn't work either.\n\n\nI made sure nfc was enable in the settings \n\nSo, whats going on",
