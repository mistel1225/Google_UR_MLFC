    "content": "I Just bought googlepixel 3 two weeks ago. I regret this decision. I didnt expect something like this to come out of a “Google phone” specialt not pixel. It didn’t fall even once, I use the original cable and charger. Ive been very carefully using it since day1, Now all of a sudden it turned into weird lightings on and off. I tried restarting it and that didnt work until the third try. I restarted it and worked well then after 4 more hours same thing happened again right after i changed the wallpaper which isnt supposed to be a shocking action for he phone! Now the phone is not even responding. It only keeps lighting on and off with no responding to any button as you can see in the video. After an hour of lighting on and off out of nowhere, now its not even switching on. I swear i never regretted paying this amount of money on anything as i regret now! This isn’t what i would ever expect of a google product. I kindly request a fast solution! \nI live in Cairo,Egypt and i cant reach no one! Kindly prove that you have a decent after-sale and trustable services because at this moment i deeply regret letting go of why i have always used!",
