    "content": "Hi there,\n\ni notice that the overall quality of the pixel camera outside the official pixel camera app is very poor. \nI mean if i use the whatapp in app photo shoot or wanna take an instagram story the photo/video quality is soo bad.\n\nHere it is a comparison between cameras and apps used to take pictures.\n\nRight now the only way to take a pic is to use the google app but i found this very frustrating.\n\nAlso the video quality overall is very very poor and very noisy in the rear cam. I tested it with professional light etc....my old Motorola one vision take a better looking shoot btw and is a 200â‚¬ phone.\n\nWhy? Is a lack of software optimization? \nI'm very disappointed! Not what i'm expecting from a google flagship!\n\nThanks, G.\n\nIn order:\n\nYoutube link to video comparison: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jM0kqoJMvjc&feature=youtu.be\n\nPixel Cam Front \nWhatapp cam Front \nInstagram Cam Front ",
