    "title": "After Android Q Update (on Pixel) - Phone Dialing Issues",
    "content": "Hello,\n\nAfter updating yesterday to Android Q version I am having issues making and receiving phone calls.  When I choose to dial someone or a number there is about a 30 - 45 second delay before the call actually connects.  This also happens with inbound calls before the call is connected.\n\nI tried rebooting, also uninstalling updates for the dialer app and trying a 3rd party app with no luck.\n\nThank you.",
