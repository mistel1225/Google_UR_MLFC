    "title": "Pixel 2 Camera App Crashing/Flashlight greyed out, other dependent apps not loading",
    "content": "Just recently I noticed my camera app would crash, reboot the phone and sometimes it'd work but now it will consistently crash upon opening. In addition, the flashlight option is also grayed out which shows to me that it seems to be a driver/software related within the OS rather than hardware related to the camera itself. \n\nSnapchat seems to have issues working due to this, I've since uninstalled it and tried to reinstall it but it will lag when trying to log in; I'm leaning towards whatever the issue is with the camera also affects the app. \n\nI have tried: \n\nReboot\nForce Stop app\nClear app cache\nSafe mode. \n\nIssue persists. \n\nIt's nearly Black Friday, and while there are decent phone deals I'd rather not have to drop hundreds upon hundreds of dollars because of this. \n\nThank you.",
