    "title": "Phone restarts when using \"power off\" option",
    "content": "So since the latest update, I cannot shut down my phone using the \"power off\" option from holding the actual power button, as usual. If I hit \"restart', it does restart. If I hit \"power off\", it does restart. Is that some sort of configuration that came with the new update?\n\nBtw, I did a factory reset, don't have a case on, the phone is in perfect condition and the power button works fine. \n\nThank you for your time.",
