    "content": "I had the same problem with my Google Pixel 2 XL. I click free up space, and it deletes maybe 300 megabytes. But almost my entire storage, gigabytes, is taken up by photos. Why are these not getting backed up and deleted? It's very frustrating. I've tried clearing the cache for camera and photos, but that doesn't fix it.",
