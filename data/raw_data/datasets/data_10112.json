    "content": "I have the Pixel 3 (unlocked) and updated to Android 11. I haven't been able to use the screen recording feature, when started, it, it appears to work. When I go into 'System UI' while running the recorder I can see the cache size increasing about 3+ MB per second. I have at least 15 GB free.\n\nWhen I stop the app I get the message \"error deleting screen recording\". I've tried disabling Developer Options and clear the 'System UI' cache, all to no avail. Before I run off to Google Help forums, I wonder if anyone else has had similar experiences.",
