    "content": "I have no issues day to day with my Pixel 4. A few days in while travelling in Aruba I quit receiving all texts and calls.  Outgoing texts sometimes worked, sms pictures repeated dozens of times on the receiving phones, but my phone didn't display them.  My husband's Samsung phone using same carrier had no issues.   Once back in the US, all sms and voicemail came thru.",
