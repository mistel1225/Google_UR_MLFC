So here goes, I am now usinga a }00Google Pixel 2 right now and for the past 2 Â½ years and love it.. But it is time for an upgrade so I ordered and it will be here tomorrow the new Pixel 4A-5G UW...  So I am going to be replacing the Pixel 2 with the Pixel 4A 5G UW..  I am with Verizon and have been for a long time and I was wondering has anybody switched to This phonedrom a 4G phone.\n\nDo I need to get a 5G SIM card because on some sites and some of those being Verizon says that the 4G LTE SIM card will work fine but then I also Bridget it will not and it needs a 5G SIM card for the full 5G experiencm ultrawide part mainly",
