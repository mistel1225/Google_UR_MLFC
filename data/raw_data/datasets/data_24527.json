    "content": "I have a Pixel 3 XL and a Pixel Stand in my home office. I have 2 Google accounts on the phone. It used to correctly display photos from my primary account, then I turned off the Photo Frame for a while. I am now trying to turn the Photo Frame option back on, but it is only offering me albums from the secondary account on the phone, which has no photos in it. I have tried forgetting the stand and setting back up, but no luck. I have tried making sure Google Photos has the primary account up and visible, no luck. I have no wish to remove the secondary account as it is a business account and I need to get emails and voice messages. How is the stand deciding which Google Account to display photos from??",
