    "content": "I was sent a replacement unit for my Pixel 4 green tint issue, but the replacement unit has more green tint than my normal device.\nThis is ridiculous. How is it that, with one month of warranty left on my device, I now have TWO PIXEL 4s with the same problem, and the \"replacement\" unit has a more aggressive green tint now.\nGoogle chat is not available at the moment, so I have no way of even contacting support. What the hell is this customer support and quality control?\nDoes anyone have any ideas or solutions (that does not contain me disabling Smooth Display)?\n\n\nEdit: I tried contacting through Google Chat, in which they responded just once after I greeted them. They proceeded to not respond to me for the next 30 minutes, and I still have not received a response since. So now not only do I have two phones, with the newer one having the worse issue, but no support to assist me in dealing with the situation?\nWhat on earth is going on? Am I just blacklisted or something?",
