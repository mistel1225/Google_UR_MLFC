    "content": "Any updates on the Android 11 cooking phones, draining batteries, all round poor performance?  Have restarted plenty of times and deleted a bunch of apps.  I'm even having distortion come through the audio output whether that be phone or headphones.  This is causing dial tones not to be recognised on phone calls.  All round my phone is now barely functional.  If this can't be resolved asap I'm in the market for a new phone on a new platform.",
