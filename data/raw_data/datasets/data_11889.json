    "title": "Pixel 5 unable to verify credit card in Google Pay",
    "content": "I'm trying to add my MasterCard to google pay and asked me to sign into my mobile banking app to verify. The normal process as usual. Once I sign in, it says that Mobile Banking Verification not available for my card. Which is weird because I never had this issue with my previous device, Huawei P20 Pro.\n\nCalled my bank and they said that my card is authorized and there is $0.00 charge on my card.\nGoogle support wasn't helpful, just kept saying my card was added but needs to be verified and ask me to contact my bank.",
