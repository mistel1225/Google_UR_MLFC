    "title": "How to stop Pixel Buds answering calls in do not disturb mode",
    "content": "When I'm listening to music on my pixel buds and pixel phone with do not disturb mode on, the music will pause whenever someone is calling me. Then I naturally tap the buds to unpause the music. The tap triggers the buds to answer the call, and all of a sudden I've picked up a call from someone, but I don't know who they are and I didn't want to be disturbed in the first place. Very awkward. Is there a way to prevent this?",
