    "title": "Not Getting Notifications for Play Store App Updates",
    "content": "Wondering if anyone else has stopped receiving notifications when app updates are available and whether apps (specifically set to auto-update) do not automatically update?\n\nMy spouse has a Google Pixel 2 and I just (this week) upgraded from a Google Pixel 2 XL to a Google Pixel 4 XL on which this problem continues.\n\nSo, this is happening on multiple phones and it started several months ago or so. Previously, we had no issues receiving updates. I am unsure whether this issue started with Android 10 but it is possible.\n\nFor the last several months, we have received zero notifications when updates are available. Sometimes, rebooting the phone will make the apps update and other times not. I have been forced to occasionally check \"Google Play > My apps & games\" to see if updates are available and, if so, press \"Install all\" manually for anything to ever be updated.\n\nI have verified that all of the apps are set to \"Enable auto update\".\n\nI have verified that Settings > Notification Settings > Updates is on.\n\nI have verified the app is not prevented from sending notifications in the phone settings.\n\nGoogle Support had me do a check-in procedure to be sure the phone was talking to their servers but it made no difference.\n\nLinking to screenshots of my phone. Note that the Google Play Store app clearly indicates there are ZERO notifications per week!\n\nScreenshots verifying update buttons are correct",
