    "content": "Hi there, \n\nin pre Corona time  my Commute traveling time was shown every morning and this was really helpful because I knew should I leave my home right away or I can take my time.  \nNow when we started our working times normal this very helpful feature is not shown on my Pixel phone,  I have tried to delete it from google maps and then write it back again but it did not help. In this 3 months of home office I did not change anything of my settings (as I remember) only usual updates. \nI am talking of course about \"at glance\" feature, please help :) \n\nthanks",
