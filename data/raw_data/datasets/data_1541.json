    "content": "Hi All. I'm getting close to buying another phone because although I think the hardware on this pixel 4a is nice, I'm finding the phone frustrating to use. I seem to be getting poorer network coverage than my old Samsung S5. Half the time the Pixel has been giving me annoying 'popcorn' notifications telling my there was no network available. I've managed to switch off the notifications, but the issue is that once it looses connection in certain parts of the house - it doesn't restore it in areas I know I should have connection. I've tried resetting the wifi/network and it didn't seem to help.\n\nI have now switched off automatic network selection, and had to pick the 3G connection - which seems to have better coverage. \n\nHowever - I think I should have 4G available here. So my question really is - are other people having poor network connection performance on their Pixel 4a? Is there anything else I can do before I try another phone? Thanks for any input...",
