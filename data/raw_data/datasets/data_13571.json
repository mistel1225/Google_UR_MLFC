    "title": "My speaker has static noise. Additionally, sometimes Maps refuses to close. Lots of small issues",
    "content": "Since purchasing this phone I've noticed a number of issues I have never before experienced on any of the smartphones I've owned before. Occasionally, Maps refuses to stop navigating long after I reached my destination. Most recently, my speakers have an awful crackling static noise whenever I play audio. The phone will freeze and need to be reset randomly. This is awful for a phone that's less than two months old. I doubt I'll ever get another google phone.",
