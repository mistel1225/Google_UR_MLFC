    "content": "I’ve tried putting the Pixel 2 XL in bootloader and restarting it by pressing the power & volume down buttons together & and my phone remains unresponsive. I used it without a problem the entire day and right before bed I left it to charge and woke up the next day to an unresponsive phone.  A week prior I opened a message that I received from Sprint and it caused my phone to become unresponsive, but my touch screen would at least power on although it seemed unresponsive and frozen. I rebooted the phone at least 6-10 times before it returned to a normal functional state. I opended my text message app only to find a lot of my messages deleted, when all I did was restart my phone 6-10 times. This led me to believe that my phone and accounts were hacked, so I changed a lot of passwords and froze my accounts. I’d consider backing up the Pixel 2 prior to updating while also turning off the auto-updates in settings.",
