    "content": "So for my new pixel 4xl. I didn't know gesture swiping would be different than my current 3xl. \n\nI'm getting used to it. But I noticed one glaring problem. Holding down the home button before would bring up what's on my screen and assistant. Now there seems to be no way to do that. I really liked that feature.\n\nTo be honest all the continual changes to navigation is leaving me a tech junky kinda tired. I loved the 3 buttons. But I got pretty used to whatever the gesture mode was on 3xl. This new 4xl version is just way to complicated and non-intuitive. In a sense I see how it can be but it's also not. Maybe I'll learn the curve. My mom gets pixel phones, she would lose her mind on the 4. Thank you for at least having the option to switch to the old buttons. \n\nI think you need to work on gesture more or at least a long press should activate the home button as well work a way to get the what's on my screen or the Google lens more easily into the picture.\n\nAnd ive owned every single Google production phone since Android one. \n\nAlso one other thing. You guys have ruined autocorrect. Go back to the older ones that worked. I hear others saying the same thing. It just doesn't work right anymore. Even on the iPhone I hear they botched that up. \n\nHope this input helps. Still a fan. Get it together.",
