    "content": "My phone won't turn on. Earlier I turned my phone on and it was fine. Then it turned off because the battery was low. Usually when this happens after awhile of letting it sit, it will come on when I hold down the power button. But today when I went back to turn it on, it wouldn't come on. All I see is a red blinking light and the battery icon. When I press the power button my phone buzzes like how it usually does and then shows the Google screen and then goes back to a black screen.",
