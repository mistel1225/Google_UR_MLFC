    "content": "I am an educator and need my phone on vibrate during the day.  I normally do this by pressing a volume button and changing the settings to vibrate and silent for calls/notifications.  A few minutes later, my phone pings with a notification and I notice my volume settings are back to normal when I didn't even touch the phone.  I reset the settings to vibrate and silent again and put my phone away.  A few minutes later, it pings again with full volume.  What is causing my phone to automatically change my volume settings?  I have Motion Sense turned off so it can't be that and I have looked through the Volume settings menu but see nothing that could be related to what I am experiencing.",
