    "content": "Hello, my Pixel 2 phone was stolen from me a couple days ago. I am trying to restore/retrieve the photos/downloads/random files to my new phone or possible download the data straight to my laptop.\n\nI remember seeing that Pixel devices automatically back-up photos and so am wondering how to do this?\n\nThe majority of my other data from apps has transferred over to the new phone. The other major info outstanding is website tabs that I had open in the firefox app, any way to retrieve these?\n\nThanks!",
