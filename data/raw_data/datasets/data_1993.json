    "content": "Have my brand new Pixel 4a phone updated to May security patch and noticed disgusting photos on my front camera compared to my old Pixel 3a. Tried to do factory reset, updated camera app, kept the distance more than 16 inches and still 3a's photos the way better than on 4a. I guess it might be my last Pixel phone.",
