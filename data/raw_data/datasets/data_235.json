    "content": "Hi, \nmy pixel 3a fell and the power and touch screen stopped responding.\nat first the screen was on and with the finger print reader in the back it would turn on, the volume rocker worked as well. \nhad to connect a corded mouse with a usb to try and restart the device.\nonce the screen turned off in the restart, it would not turn on again. \nI can feel the haptic feedback when i touch the finger print reader or connect a charger.\n nothing else works, the screen is black and there is no sound. tried to call the number or use find my device but nothing.\nwhen connected to a computer with a USB cable, i can see the device in the \"other devices\" list. if i long press the power button, i can see it is gone. a few seconds after i stop pressing it, the device will reappear in the list. \nshould I try and look at the screen connections? what about the power button? \nthanks in advance\nRoey",
