    "content": "The top speaker on my Pixel 3 has started buzzing heavily when I open the front camera. It was very occasional a few days ago, and a few camera switches would get it back to normal. But, it's very frequent now, and it also gets triggered with the slightest knock on the top part of the phone. I haven't dropped the phone or done anything that might have accidentally triggered this malfunction. I was wondering if anyone has similar problems with their Pixel devices and the possible steps I could take to get of this.\n https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWz-xWAtZ0M",
