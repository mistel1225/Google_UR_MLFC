    "content": "Hi,\n\nI had a missed call notification on my Pixel. I tapped the call back back on the notification then I put the phone to my ear. After a few seconds of complete silence I lowered the phone to check if it was calling and I realized that the phone was stuck on the call screen (as shown in the photo). The touch-screen did not work and the buttons also did not work. After 10 minutes I have tried holding down the power button again this time it worked and the phone restarted. I tried to make the call again, and it again failed to make the call but thankfully this time it didn't freeze. I cancelled the call and closed the phone app. Then I realized, the \"making a call\" icon was still on the notification bar. I restarted the phone, and made a third attempt to make the call. It finally worked without a problem. \n\nWhat is the cause of this issue? Is there anything I can do to not have to deal with it in the future? Any help would be appreciated. Thanks in advance. (I have been having many other issues on this device lately, I don't know if they are related. I can share those problems as well if required.)\n\nP.S.: I hope this wasn't unnecessarily long, I just wanted to be clear. I'm not a native English speaker so apologies for any mistakes.",
