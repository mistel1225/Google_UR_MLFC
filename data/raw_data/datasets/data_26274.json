    "title": "What happened to the \"quick switch between apps\" feature? It disappeared on latest update.",
    "content": "I have missed the \"quick switch between apps\" feature since taking the latest upgrade.  I used to be able to go through all of my open apps with a single slow horizontal swipe of my thumb from the very bottom of the screen where the home button is.  Now I can only do it with swipe up and then go through history. Not as convenient to do with one hand as the other cooler feature.\n\nThis is described at minute 4:30 of this video.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/JRV-1WnyUOk\n\nThanks,\n\nMike",
