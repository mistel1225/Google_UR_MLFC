    "content": "I've been using an Anker PowerPort to wirelessly charge my Pixel 3 XL for 8 months or so. In the past few weeks, the charging seems to stop at around 70%. The phone shows it's \"wirelessly charging\" but it doesn't get to full battery. \n\nDoes anyone else have this issue? Is there something wrong with my phone? The charger?\n\nThanks!",
