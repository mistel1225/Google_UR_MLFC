    "content": "Basically as per the question.  I seem to get really bad sensitivity when typing.\n  I have tried the device at the store and a friends and we get the same issue, so it's not just isolated.  It's on both sides of the screen.\n  It's definitely worse with a screen protector but the same happens without one too.\n  Maybe we need an increase sensitivity option?",
