    "title": "Ridiculous battery drain on Pixel XL after updating to Android 10",
    "content": "Every since updating to Android 10 on my Pixel XL (the OG Pixel) I've experienced a ridiculous amount of battery drain.  My battery literally loses one percent per minute after charging battery to 100%.  I didn't have this issue on Android 9. I would go a full day and a half with heavy usage (emails, calendar, pictures and video, live chat, etc) without having to charge the phone. Now I can see the battery dropping without doing anything.\n\nI've done all the usual troubleshooting (factory reset, safe mode, setting all apps to auto update, etc.) but nothing has worked.  And what's pissing me off even more is Google refuses to acknowledge the problem! Instead they rather put blame on the user saying \"Everyone uses their device differently and results may vary blah blah blah.....\" The typical corporate hogwash that big companies say when doing damage control. \n\nThis is unacceptable, I've been a long time Android fan since day one but I think it's time to switch to the other side!",
