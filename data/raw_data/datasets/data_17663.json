    "content": "I've tried connecting to different PCs and using different cables.  All cables are official Pixel cables.  I've also tried rebooting the Pixel 2xl and the PCs.  The phone will charge via USB from the PC but the dialog to choose how to communicate does not come up on the phone when the USB cable is first connected.",
