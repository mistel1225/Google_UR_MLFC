    "content": "I'm having multiple troubles with touch:\n1. When I try to roll the screen with a swipe gesture my device read it as a single touch, selecting whatever is in the screen.\n2. When typing on keyboard some keys are not typed.\n\nThis is a problem Im having since November maybe, I waited for an update to be back as it used to be but nothing has happened.\n\nI tried all on \"Fix touchscreen\" tips, factory reset included. Nothing changed.\n\nHelp please ðŸ¥º",
