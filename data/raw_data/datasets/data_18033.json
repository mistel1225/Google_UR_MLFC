    "content": "I have sent my Pixel 2XL for repair. It's been more than a week. I have tried contacting B2X but no response from them seems the support s temporarily closed. If at least they had notified this earlier it would have been helpful. There is very less coordination between Google & B2X too. Can we have a quick solution? At least let us know if the customer service is functional and we will get back our device safely.",
