    "content": "I have 3 big issues \n\nWill not download the November security patch am really hopeful that will fix the other 2 problems. \n\nOn a black screen it flickers not horribly but noticeable. \n\nThe random volume is the worst though \nSometimes I play a video and the volume is louder than I could ever turn it up to and the volume does not respond. \n\nAlso a third is speech to text stops working in android auto until I reboot phone then it works again for maybe 10 minutes or so. \n\nThe support system on the phone has been no Help at all \n\nI have factory reset the phone and tried to leave it without restoring the apps and data will not update still.\n\nPlease help me I really want to love pixel phones the 2xl was amazing the 3xl was. Pretty good the 4 was a complete mess. If I can't figure out these issues I am going to try a different brand phone any suggestions would be welcome for that also.",
