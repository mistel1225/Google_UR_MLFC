    "content": "I went to sleep one night and my alarm went off in the morning, however the screen has not turned on since. The screen is totally off as if the phone was turned off. I know the phone still works because I can still receive phone calls and notifications. There was no instance of the phone being dropped recently to have caused this.\n\nI have tried the following:\n\n1. Letting the phone die, recharging to full and then trying to turn on\n\n2. Tried to turn on the phone in safe mode\n\n3. Held the power button down for 30 seconds ",
