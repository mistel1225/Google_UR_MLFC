    "content": "Hello, I have choosen the following screen lock option: \"None\". Sometimes, (very often), swiping up does not work when I wake up the phone. The home page is frozen. I have first to open an app to unfreeze it. If I choose a screen lock wake up option (swipe up, for example), the freezing problem does not show up. I hope I have been clear. It's not that a big deal but thank you anyway.",
