    "title": "My Pixel XL has terrible or no cell service in places I used to get full bars",
    "content": "I have had my Pixel XL for 2 years now on AT&T and ~8 months ago it started dropping calls, not picking up service where it used to, losing GPS while driving through populated areas, etc. and it's only getting worse.\n\nGoogle has rejected to help me further than recommending resets on my phone (which I've tried), saying it's AT&Ts fault. It's not AT&T because my peers nearby me with the same service never have remotely near the same issues I have.\n\nAnyone else having similar issues or ever find a fix? I am ready to buy a new phone at this point but am worried about having the same issues if I stick with Pixel.",
