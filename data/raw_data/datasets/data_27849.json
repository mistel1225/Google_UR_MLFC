    "content": "I unplugged phone opened a baby so to document my son was awake, fed him and then went back to bed... Was around 15 to 20 min my phone screen was off and I went from 100% to 80%... \n\nPost update my phone feels hotter at times and it's completely gone with simple web browsing (no videos etc) in less than 4 hrs. I work at a hospital and now need a portable charger with me in my pocket to keep my phone alive. \n\nThis phone is way too damn expensive to have this issue. When is the fix coming ?\n\nGrrrr",
