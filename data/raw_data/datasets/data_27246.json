    "title": "why is the design of the pixel 4 terrible",
    "content": "After using the pixel 3 I have been disappointed with the design of the pixel 4. Front facing speakers are something I enjoy every day and I don't want them to go away with the pixel 4. I also don't like how the fingerprint sensor is removed. I heavily rely on the fingerprint sensor to unlock my phone before it comes out of my pocket and to quickly access notifications and the control center. If you guys copy apple with their terrible face id I will have to spend a lot more time unlocking my phone in a less secure way. I also hate how you removed system UI tuner because I would always need the seconds on my clock. Also, even though smaller bezels are very nice, typing may be hard for some people when the keyboard is closer to the bottom of the phone so I really think that there should be a option to add a small buffer under the keyboard in Gboard.",
