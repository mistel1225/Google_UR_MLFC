    "content": "Hello, I've tried to get my phone back from repair for 3 weeks now.  It was repaired, according to the notes on the case and was supposed to be shipped back March 12th.  Since then I've chatted and emailed multiple times.  All to no avail.  My requests for escalation or to have a manger contact me went unheeded as well.  Looking for any contact info for a person/department who can answer a simple question.  When is my phone going to be sent back to me.  I am getting really frustrated with the lack of response form this company.  Thank you very much.",
