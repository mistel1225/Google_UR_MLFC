    "content": "Hi,\n\nEvery now and then (once a day) my Pixel 3 gets stuck on the lock screen.\nI can unlock it by fingerprint (meaning that i can see sensitive notifications); but there is no way to fully remove the lockscreen.  If i swipe up by pressing the homebutton (the line/bar at the bottom of the second screenshot) I can briefly see the other apps that run. But when releasing or trying to select another app it returns to lockscreen. Any ideas ?\n\nSo it gets stuck on this screen:\n\n\nI can get to this screen (after which the phone will always go back to the prior screen above)",
