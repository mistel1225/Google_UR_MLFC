    "content": "One of my games while playing it The status bar will pop up with a notification and when the notification goes away the black status bar will remain on the screen until I actually close the app. If I just go home without closing it it'll still be there. It cuts off the top portion of the screen which is not much but enough if there's small details of info it's blocking. Is this a bug or just a quirk?",
