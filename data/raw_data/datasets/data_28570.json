    "content": "For the last three days, I have been locked out of my Pixel 1. It acknowledges that my Pin is correct, flashes black for a second and returns me to the lock-screen. I have too much data (voice recordings etc) to do a factory reset. I am hoping this can be fixed with a software update from Google and that a factory reset can be avoided. Would welcome any suggestions.\n\nThank you",
