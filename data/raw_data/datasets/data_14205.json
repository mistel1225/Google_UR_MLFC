    "content": "Today my Pixel 3 XL just started to turn the volume down on its own while listening to Spotify when connected to my Bluetooth speaker. It hasn't done it for my Bluetooth earbuds yet (hopefully). I'm assuming this issue is related to Android 11, because my phone seems to be experiencing new bugs on the regular since updating. \n\nAny suggestions or similar experiences?",
