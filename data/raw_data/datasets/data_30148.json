    "content": "Hello!\nGoogle assistant in my Pixel 3 will recognize ok the voice command e.g \"play music on Spotify\", Spotify will start but no music is played, nothing happens except that Spotify app is started!!\nI have already un-linked then re-linked my Spotify (premium) account but still this happens. I cannot find any other faults or settings I may change in the actual set-up. \nSo I'm puzzled why assistant will recognize ok the voice command but will not actually do the action.\nAs info, I have a Google speaker with same setup for Google assistant as my Pixel 3, same wifi network, and I can use same command (to play music et.) without any problem.\n\nDo I need to use specific/other voice command on Pixel 3 to actually start playing music? (I know it sounds a bit strange!)\nOr any other ideas?\n\nBest regards,\nAdrian",
