    "title": "Is Battery Saver actually functioning well ?",
    "content": "Having Android 10, the battery is not much better. Normally I get less than 4 hours SOT in a day.\nI am trying Battery Saver mode, and didn't find it useful either. Many apps still running in background.\n\nEG the popular Facebook app with Background restriction. Active use 46 mins, background 5 hours 24 min. Many apps which I didn't open, also have many background process.\n\nFurther, I found out the phone drains battery very fast after unplug cable from charging. It seems like all the apps are doing \"things\" in background, draining ~ 5~10% battery in abnormal pace.\n\nPlease do not recommend to factory reset / reboot phone / clear cache, etc.",
