    "title": "So frustrated - phone continuously crashes due to \"corrupt data\" + forces me to wipe my phone",
    "content": "I am so frustrated and at the end of my rope because my phone crashed for the third time within ~my first year~ of this Pixel and I've been forced to wipe my phone for the third time. Because I was forced to wipe my phone a few days ago, I lost 60+ precious photos for my 21st birthday trip. What's more, every time I am forced to wipe my phone, I have to go through the effort of restoring my apps and restoring all my 2FA accounts. I contacted Project Fi the last time my phone crashed and they clearly dismissed my concerns and frustrations. \n\nThe error is always the same: \"Can't load Android system. Your data may be corrupt. If you continue to get this message, you may need to perform a factory data reset and erase all data stored on the data.\"\n\nDoes anyone have any suggestions for ensuring that this never happens again, or do you simply recommend I return to Apple and an iPhone?",
