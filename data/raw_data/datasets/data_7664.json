    "content": "I find it overall inconvenient that the search bar cannot be removed, or at the very least, repositioned.  I only just realized this today because I set a new wallpaper and the search bar is obscuring my art.  \nAre you so afraid we'll stop using Google if you give us more power over our phones?  I have so many ways to access Search on my phone as it is.  \nIt led me trying out different launchers.\nGetting a Pixel phone means we should have the best Android has to offer, not restrictions.",
