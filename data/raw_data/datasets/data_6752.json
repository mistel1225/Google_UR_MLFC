    "content": "I am using a Pixel 4a and I love it except for the battery life. I don't use a lot of other features like the assistant, etc., that consume a lot of battery in general. Even with most of the power intensive features turned off, my pixel doesn't give me the best. The average SOT is 4 to 5 hours, sometimes < 4h. Can somebody tell me what I should do to increase the screen usage?\n\nI don't let the battery percentage drop below 20% and qo usually charge it till it reaches 95 so that the SOT counter resets.\n\nI've seen users boasting of 7h SOT. So, I would like to hear from you all.\n\nThanks,\nGoqu.",
