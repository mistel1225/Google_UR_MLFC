    "content": "I have a Pixel 2 XL, I have been having issues with the port for over a year now. It's so bad, that I have been forced to use Bluetooth headphones, due to the AUX Adapter not being able to connect into the port when plugged in. I've repeatedly needed to unplug and replug my charger over and over and over since it plugs in, charges for a split second, then stops, then I have to unplug, and replug, until it FINALLY connects and begins charging. NOW It's not even finally connecting, and it just constantly charges for a split second, then stops entirely.\n\nI have been taking wooden toothpicks and cleaning out my phone's port, I have been getting NO lint, no matter how hard I scrape. I'm on toothpick number 8, and nothing is coming out and it is doing nothing to fix my phone. I am also seeing HUNDREDS of people online complaining over SEVERAL different pixel phones, 1-3, saying their ports are all not working in some way shape or form. EVERY single response is \"It must be dust.\" I've been trying to get this \"dust\" out of my phone and there's nothing. Tell me what I need to do, cause I'm so close to going and switching this phone for a samsung.",
