    "content": "Brand new Pixel 3.  Opened it yesterday. The right edge of my phone is a darker shade than the left edge of my phone, regardless of what is on screen.  There is permanent pink/purple hue on the right side. Its most obvious when the background is white or in nighttime mode.   This is my second Pixel 3 ( lost the first one ) and it definitely did not have this problem.",
