    "content": "I am in Tokyo. I am being sent from one place to another. Where do I go? My Google Pixel 5 screen cracked some time ago. First it was functioning ok with the cracks, but now the phone is dead. I've been to 1) the shop where I bought the phone, (Bic Camera), 2) been to their support/repair desk, 3) been to the mobile provider (Softbank). Wherever I go, they tell me they are not the ones to help and tell me to go to one of the two other places. I need to have it fixed, but where do I go? Or do I send the hardware to an address?",
