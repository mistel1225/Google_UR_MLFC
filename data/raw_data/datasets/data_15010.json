    "content": "Pixel 2 that doesn't even have a scratch on it and was working fine an hour ago just went blank. It doesn't restart, it doesn't turn on, it doesn't reset. The battery was almost full so that's not the issue and it won't work on a charger either. I think she's dead. I tried contacting tech support but there is no number and they keep bringing me here.",
