    "content": "RMA02467049. I had issues with my phone and ordered a replacement. The instructions asked me to send my phone to a center in India. On reaching out to support, they escalated the issue to a specialist team but they have charged me $841 for non return of phone. I have been following up for more than a month and the support team has no clue why it is taking so long. They do not even give me a way to reach the specialist team. The device is ready to be shipped . I just need a shipping label to a US location. It cant be so difficult. It is pathetic that they are no resolution servive timelines at Google.Google Support Inquiry: Case ID [6-2982000028662]",
