    "content": "Hi,\nWhen I connect my phone to my car via Bluetooth, the car sometimes complains that it cannot import the contacts. When I check the Bluetooth settings for my car on my phone I can see that contact sharing is not enabled despite having it enabled before. The other two settings (phone calls and media audio) are always on and never change.\nI don't know at what point contact sharing turns itself off or why it does it.\nDo you have any ideas as to why this could happen?\nThanks!",
