    "content": "Hi Guys,\nI have a Pixel 3 with a Google Fi eSIM that has been working fine ever since I bought it. In the last few months it started randomly losing mobile data, it displays \"no SIM card detected - Emergency calls only\" which is weird because I have no SIM card at all - that's the whole point of the eSIM. Restarting the phone usually solves the problem, but lately it has become much more prevalent and it's maddening, because I lose data while driving and navigating, or when I try to pay for something in a shop. It's completely random; sometimes it's faulty as soon as I turn it on, sometimes it runs fine for a day. I tried contacting Google Fi support, but everything seems fine on their end. I tried hard rebooting (by long pressing the power button), resetting network settings, even a full factory reset (not importing all my old apps and settings!) and none of it worked. Restarting in safe mode does provide mobile data, but I don't know how long because I can't properly use my apps there. It's driving me crazy, and I just can't find a solution. Please help!",
