    "content": "Hi all,\n\nI seem to be having issues with whats app video calling. When I'm on a video call, when the person speaks I can hear them first then after 1/2 seconds I can see them speaking it. Like some sort of sync issue between audio and visual. I've updated the app and restarted my Pixel 5 but no luck? Any ideas how to fix this? Thanks",
