    "content": "I have this phone for about a month. Everything that could be wrong with a new phone has gone wrong. My messages don't show up. when my saved contacts call me their name doesn't show up. The background light is constantly flickering. Phone often freezes. I need a contact for Google so I can get this replaced asap. This is extremely frustrating trying to submit a claim and yet when I put it in, says my serial number or whatever other number is invalid. I had a Google pixel in the past and had no issues with it. This one is a lemon and I need a replacement. I Google customer service and all I get is this stupid forum. Why can't I get a phone number or be directed to something other than placing a question on a forum?!?!",
