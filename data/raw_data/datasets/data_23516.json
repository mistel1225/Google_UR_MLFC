    "content": "Bluetooth randomly stops working since Android 9. I have now the latest update (Android 10 with security update January 2020), but the problem still persists.\n\nI have Mi Band 4 and sometimes it starts to receive notification with a delay, after a while it looses the connection at all. When it happens it is impossible to connect any Bluetooth deceives. It also impossible to restart the Bluetooth - it won't be turned on. Only restating the device helps.\n\nAny suggestions?",
