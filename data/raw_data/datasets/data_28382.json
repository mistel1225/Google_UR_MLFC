    "content": "Doing a restart (power button + hit restart) does not make the phone restart. It just makes the screen black. I can feel a haptic feedback when I touch the fingerprint sensor. Waited for 10 mins but nothing happened. Need to long press the power button for the phone to boot up properly. I am currently on Android 10. Factory reset did not solve the issue.\n\nAny suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.",
