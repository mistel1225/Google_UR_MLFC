    "content": "I originally tried contacting google through googlepixel on Instagram, then managed to chat to someone in the Google Support Team via the chat directly on my phone. They escalated this to Product Specialist on 21st May (email stated I would get an answer in 1-2 business days). I am still waiting to hear anything back, several weeks and chasers later.\n\nI keep getting an overheating warning on my phone. This has only started to happen recently (owned the phone for less than a year). I have not been using my phone any differently (perhaps a bit more time on google duo). Is there anyone I can contact to get help with my case?",
