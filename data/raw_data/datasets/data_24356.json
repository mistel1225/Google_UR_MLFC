    "content": "Hi, \n\n I have seen many have reported the fuzzy static screen on pixel 2. I have received poor customer support feedback. How can I file an official complaint to Google? \n\n I have switched from iphone to Pixel, but did not expect such a poor built quality of Google phone and the funny thing is that the customer service manager from Google's call center has referred Google as a \"software\" manufacturer - that puts in me serious doubt about all \"hardware\" manufactured by Google. \n\n Any one has any ideas? Or should we take it as that Google don't care? If so, I think we should start all considering switching back to Apple or Samsung for the phones and Amazon for the home connected products.\n\n Thanks",
