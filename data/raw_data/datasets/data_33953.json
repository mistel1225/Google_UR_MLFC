    "content": "I've spent the last three months exchanging 50+ emails to Google support as I'm unable to cast on 10+ Google Home/Chromecast/Android TV/etc devices. This is only an issue on my new Pixel XL and no other device. Support teams are passing me back and forth with no end in sight. See attached for a more recent reply where I was told to get an iPhone. Pretty shocking given my loyalty and investment in Google.",
