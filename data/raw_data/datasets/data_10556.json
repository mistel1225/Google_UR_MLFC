    "content": "I have tried resetting my phone. My phone is completely up to date. I'm running my phone on 5ghz. I just did a speed check with my Amazon fire Stick and my hotspot is only running at 0.84 mbps download. 1.33 MbPS upload. Ping 40.3 MS. Jitter 2.1ms. I've been reading that it should run at least 10 mbps. I have full bars so I know that's not the issue. This just started within the last 3 weeks. This is only when running my hotspot.",
