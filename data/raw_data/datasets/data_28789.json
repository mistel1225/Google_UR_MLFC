This is against UK Consumer Law. \nIve stated UK Consumer Law .\nI've sent 13 emails and ask for management to speak to me and also for the complaints procedure but all I get back is the specialist team advise to get the phone fixed myself at my own cost. \nI want to raise a formal complaint and need to know how, I cannot find anything with complaint details or procedure for UK Google.",
