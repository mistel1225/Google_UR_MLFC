    "content": "due to a wrong module my Pixel 4 XL does not boot anymore, or my screen remains dark after booting. Is there a way to remove Magisk modules? The tip https://www.droidviews.com/fix-pixel-4-xl-bootloop-magisk-module/ does not work for me, because flashing the \"image-newpixel4xl.img\" stops with an error message.\n\ni have the latest april-software and i can still get into fastboot mode without problems.\n\nthanks a lot",
