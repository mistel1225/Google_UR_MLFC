    "title": "Pixel 2 XL keeps restarting - already did factory reset",
    "content": "The June update installed on my Pixel 2 XL the other day, and then yesterday, my phone randomly shut down. Since then, it's been restarting or just shutting down multiple times a day (sometimes multiple times in an hour), which is annoying at best. It's charged, of course - no issue with a low battery. I reviewed troubleshooting suggestions, and I did the full factory reset to no avail. It continues to restart or shut down periodically. Any help will be appreciated!",
