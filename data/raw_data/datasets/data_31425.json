    "content": "I bought my Pixel 3 XL in Nov. 2018 and paid via the Google Fi store. It was shipped to my home address in TX. Once I received the phone I had to travel for work to Germany for an extended stay 6+months.\nNow that I am having charging issues I contacted customer service and put in a Hardware support case. They deemed it defect after a number of troubleshooting attempts and want to ship me a replacement. However, they refuse to ship to an APO address even though it is a U.S. address. Why is this? What can I do?",
