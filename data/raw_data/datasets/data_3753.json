    "content": "VOLTE does not work on Greece (also in another countries) because it's locked by Google.\n\nWhy Google has locked the option for VOLTE? \n\nAny other brand working fine. I have contact with my carrier and of course they said that they done everything they can to enable this option but it is locked by Google because Google pixel phones has enabled this option only for known carriers. Why is that?\n\nPlease don't tell me that is carrier (Cosmote) problem because this is not the case. This is a known issue that is going on from a long time and many users has mentioned it in forums but we don't have an official answer. \n\nPlease unlock the future with an update. It's up to Google!\n\nWithout VOLTE call drops to 3G, you cannot use the internet also you don't have HD call. The carriers will soon stop using 3G so then we will have serious problems.\n\nAs far as I know the problem will continue with 5G voice calls at the future if Google do not enable this option too like he did with 4G voice call (VOLTE).\n\nPlease help us, we are so many users of pixel phones that we don't live in US and we like to have VOLTE and Wi-Fi calling to our phones.\n\nTHANK YOU IN ADVANCE",
