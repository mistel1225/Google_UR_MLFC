    "content": "I'm trying to find out disconnect a device a connected to my Wi-Fi Mobile Hotspot. I don't necessarily want to change my password because sometimes I want to be able to share my connection with other devices and other times I don't want to share it with all the devices I've shared my connection with in the past. I can see how many devices are connected to my Hotspot. My question is how can I manage (i.e. kick off) certain devices when my hotspot is turned on? I don't see a way to do this. Has anyone else figured out a way to do this?",
