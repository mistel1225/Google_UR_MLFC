    "content": "I just upgraded to the Pixel 3a XL from an original Pixel XL, but the problem existed in the Pixel XL also.  Is there a way to change/delete the seemingly arbitrary list of contacts offered in the lower contact banner when I take a screenshot and choose to share screenshot?  Currently there are some contacts that I regularly text with and a random (work) email address from years ago.  Why???????  I have attached a screenshot of what I'm referring to.\n  ",
