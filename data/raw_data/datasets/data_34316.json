    "title": "Unable to send SMS through AA.",
    "content": "I have a pixel 2 xl that used to have no issues with this, but as of the January 2019 update, I can no longer send SMS messages through Android auto.  I can do it through bt with the same car and phone.  I have tried this on both my 2019 outback with the stock stereo, and with my son's 2014 Forester with an aftermarket Sony xav-1000 deck, both of which worked before the update.\n\nI have done a factory reset on my phone and in the stereo in my outback, neither helped.  I can get assistant to choose a contact (doesn't matter which one), then all for the message, then confirm it, then when I say send, it says I am not sure how to help with that.  Anybody else see this?",
