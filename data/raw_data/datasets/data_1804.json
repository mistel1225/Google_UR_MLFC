    "content": "Android auto on my Pixel 5 does not work on my 2021 DMax.  I contacted the Android Auto team and they advised to contact Pixel support after I provided a debug.  Advice was it was an issue with the phone, not the application.  What I know:\n\n- The phone does charge successfully when connected\n- All other devices (about 10 tested) work across different manufacturers although I haven't tested another Pixel 5\n- Pixel 2 works fine with the same cable\n- Phone has been wiped of its cached, updated etc following standard support advice with no success\n\nRelated Android Auto case:\n\nhttps://support.google.com/androidauto/thread/103278037/pixel-5-can-t-connect-to-isuzu-dmax-2021-via-usb?hl=en",
