    "title": "My google assistant won't understand me when playing a game through google assistant",
    "content": "My google assistant always recognizes and understands my voice until I try to play a game through it. It understands \"I want to play a game\" and when I tell it what game I want to play, but as soon as it asks how many players it won't understand what I say. It recognizes and puts the speech into the proper texts (i.e if I say \"One\" it will print \"1\" in the speech bubble), but it doesn't recognize my response as an answer and repeatedly asks me to repeat myself.",
