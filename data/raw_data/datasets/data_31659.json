    "title": "How to copy files via usb without charging",
    "content": "I want to copy files from one phone to another via the USB C cable, but I do not want one device to try to charge the other.  When I plug the 2 phones together it forces me to have one device charge the other, there doesn't seem any way to disable it.  If I go to the USB Preferences and try to disable 'Charge connected device' then it simply changes the direction of charging and this device is charged isntead of the other.\n\nIs there a way to just copy files but disable charging in either direction?",
