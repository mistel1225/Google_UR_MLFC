    "content": "After receiving a picture in a text from an iPhone user, I can't reply.  (Note that it might be some other sort of Apple-specific multimedia message since this doesn't occur for all pictures from those users in texts.)\n\nTypically, I'll get a message, look at it, and then respond.  But the response doesn't send.  Instead, I get a notification that I got a new text that says (unhelpfully) \"Message not sent.\"\n\nWhen I look at the affected message list, I have a little message \"Not sent, tap to try again\" in red.  But tapping elicits the same behavior.\n\nI'm using the standard messaging app.  I have all the software updates, etc. that have been pushed to me.\n\nHow do I get this to work?",
