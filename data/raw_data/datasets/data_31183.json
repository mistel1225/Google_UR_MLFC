    "title": "I have had bad experiences of purchasing mobile from Flipkart. R there other Pixel retailers in Pune",
    "content": "I was one of the first buyers of the first gen Moto G and I was very excited because it was powered by Google. Unfortunately, I had issues with the phone performance and had to get it exchanged.\nThe replaced piece gave me similar problems with the phone heating up real bad when put on charge or used for a while. \n\nGoogle Pixel's main retailer in India is Flipkart and there are multiple complaints that the phone has a 10-DAY REPLACEMENT POLICY which sounds absolutely ridiculous. How can a phone's performance to the buyer's needs within 10 days!?\n\nPlus the customer service team is not even remotely helpful towards the people who are facing these complaints. \n\nI want to but this amazing piece of technology- the Pixel 3 with my first salary on EMI and it is stuck because of Flipkart and purchasing options. Please help.",
