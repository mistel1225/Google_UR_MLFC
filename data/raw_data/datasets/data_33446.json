    "content": "I've read the help articles and I've done everything short of a hard reset. After restarting a few times it last night it started working again, but when I woke up this morning I couldn't silence my alarm, unlock the phone or anything. All the external buttons, bluetooth headsets and such are working fine; it's just the touchscreen. I'd like to get it working again and ensure my photos and settings are backed up properly before I do a hard reset.",
