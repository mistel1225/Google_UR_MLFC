    "content": "I have a Pixel 4a 5g and Huawei ΑΜ61 Bluetooth headphones. I use my phone for interval running so I use the timer while listening to music. The peculiar thing I have encountered is that while the timer rings, the music stops as normal but when the timer is dismissed I don't get the  music back. Spotify is on play but I cant her any music, so I do a restart. This happened to my previous phone which was a Xiaomi Mi A3 (android one) but I had a workaround which was to send a message το myself and the music would start again. Now I don't even have the workaround. Any suggestions?",
