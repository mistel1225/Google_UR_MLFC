    "content": "I am facing exactly the same set of problems mentioned regarding System UI not responding, Phone app crash, No audio during call, Mic/Speaker not working sometimes. All these seems to occur after recent software update if I match the time.\n I contacted Google support and B2X collected my phone for repair. I paid money for few parts replacement and service. I received my serviced phone and I still face the same set of problems. I don't know what repair was done by Google support partner. I have sent mail to the pixel escalations team. Hope to get some positive actions.\n Anyways it's disappointed to see Google not able to support or fix the wide spread issue  even after repair and service.",
