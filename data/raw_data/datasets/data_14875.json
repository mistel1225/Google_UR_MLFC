    "content": "My phone stopped working well in recent weeks, always showing a warning that there is insufficient storage.\nTrying to delete files didn't work - it seems like files deleted didn't \"give back\" the space they were using to Android and the phone assumed there is still no storage space.\n\nUsing a PC connection to check how much files are on the device and the space they consume indicate ~20Gb used, while the actual device storage indicate 49.9Gb used and 99% of available space used.\n\nHow can I solve this problem?",
