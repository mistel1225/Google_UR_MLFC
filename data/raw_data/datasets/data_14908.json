    "content": "Replacement phone due to be delivered by 5th October, but not shipped by that date. Contacted chat to find out why, but they were unable to tell me, got transferred a couple of times. Eventually told I would get an email with 24-48 hours with resolution.\n\nNo such email and now after now than 1.5 hours of wait with 6 incorrect transfers so far I am still waiting. \n\nI cannot believe how much fluff and apologies and confirmations you have to go through with each person who apologises for the previous wrong transfer, then proceeds to make another incorrect transfer to a new wrong team.\n\nMy soul is being sucked from me with small sips. How can an organisation such as Google have such a mind bendingly awful support process. \n\nI wish there was a way to vent one's frustration with the belief that you would be heard and that something would improve, but sadly this is not the first time and I suspect it won't be the last.\n\nWow, I almost feel a bit better ðŸ¤¬",
