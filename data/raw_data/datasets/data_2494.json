    "title": "Android picture in picture only renders in keyboard on pixel 5",
    "content": "The picture in picture feature does not work most of the time since I got the pixel 5. When I gesture to go home the picture disappears, but if I'm watching a video, sound keeps playing. When I open the keyboard, the video is there and I can interact with it, but doing other multitasking, it's hidden (same thing for maps and other apps with this feature). \n\nIf I restart my phone it seems resolved for some time, but it will always get into this state later where this feature is unusable.",
