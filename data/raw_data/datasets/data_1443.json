    "content": "The motherboard failed on my Pixel 4XL and I had it replaced au ubreakifix. I brought the SIM over to my new phone and went through the setup. At the restore data step I selected the option that my old phone was not available. I then chose the option for a cloud restore, but it is only giving me the option to restore a backup from a pixel slate I was given as a present. It does not give me an option for my lost Pixel 4 back up. I was definitely backing everything up on my old pixel, I even switched over to the paid account storage to have more space.\n\nWhen I lost my pixel 2 some years ago I was able to restore basically everything (SMSs, apps, data, etc) from a cloud backup. It worked beautifully and is one reason I have stuck with Pixels since then \n\nI would really like to not lose all my SMSs and data. For what its worth I am using the stock Android Message app, though I think I did choose the option to use RCS or whatever it is called for more modern functionality.",
