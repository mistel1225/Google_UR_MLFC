    "content": "I have a routine linked to my go to work alarm, it tells me the weather, my commute, and then plays the news. Sometimes I only want to hear one or two of the news stories and then have it stop. I have tried every way of stopping it that I can think of and find online and nothing works other than pressing play in Spotify. No apps are running while it's telling me the news so I can't force it there. All voice commands do nothing. How in the world do you just make it stop?",
