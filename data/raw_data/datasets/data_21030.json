    "content": "Do not disturb mode is ignoring its own settings. I have my phone set to not allow calls from anyone and turned off repeat caller allowance and all calls are still being brought up on screen and ringing as usual if do not disturb was turned off. What is the point of a dedicated do not disturb function if it makes no difference to having the phone on silent??",
