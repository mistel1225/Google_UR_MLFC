    "content": "I have a pixel 3xl that will disconnect from android auto randomly and fully remove the car from my trusted bluetooth devices.\n\nI have had this phone with other vehicles and the Bluetooth connection was always fine. Nissan and ford. This is my first time using Android auto. It's a 2020 Honda insight.\n\nOne time I had problems and it fully disconnected and deleted the car from my Bluetooth was when several group text messages arrived.\n\nThis has happened many times. Sometimes several times in a weekend. Sometimes every other week.\n\nI have to pull over and reconnect the phone to my car, as the phone has deleted it from the devices. This is ridiculous, hazardous, and annoying. I am using Android auto to navigate places.\n\nAttached an example of what sometimes shows when connecting. Sometimes if I disconnect and reconnect the phone by USB, it will connect.\n\nThere's also issues where the map freezes on the display. Or the Android auto screen goes black. Sometimes changing the song causes the screen to refresh properly.\n\nThis has been going on since October, when I got the vehicle. This is my first time using Android auto. If this is normal, I'd like to know, so that I can switch to something that is actually useful.",
