    "content": "Hello, I'm having issues with my pixel 3 XL that notifications that pop up on my phone becomes invisible. It's usually random and unpredictable. The apps having the issue, I have tried to uninstall and reinstall them again and I've also factory reset my phone but no luck. The only way to fix the problem temporarily is to switch between light and dark mode and vice versa. I'm using the default launcher.\n\nThanks",
