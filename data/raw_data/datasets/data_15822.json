    "title": "Android 11 pop out convo feature not working well",
    "content": "The new feature to pop out chat convos does not work well for me. First, it doesn't seem to be available for any apps other than FB Messenger (I've gotten messages in Chats, Hangouts, and WhatsApp), and then it doesn't work half the time or work well. I tap the little icon in the bottom right but sometimes it just closes the notification bar (but the notification remains), sometimes it dismisses the notification without opening the convo, and sometimes it opens the convo as expected but once I tap out of the convo it closes the bubble, it does not keep it open to reopen the convo easily in the future like it used to. Is this just me, or does this feature not work yet? \nI have turned chat bubbles off and back on in settings but no difference.",
