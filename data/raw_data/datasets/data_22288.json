    "content": "When I go to the Vibration and Haptic Strength settings I only have the ability to toggle vibration off and on. I believe there should be additional settings on this page to adjust the vibration strength/intensity from low to high. The Vibration and Haptic Strength settings can be found under accessibility settings. One screen shot attached is what mine looks like but I've seen screen shots on the web that shows the ability to adjust the vibration intensity so I'm wondering why my phone doesn't have this ability (the other screen shot is one from another pixel phone I found researching this issue that has the intensity adjustment settings)",
