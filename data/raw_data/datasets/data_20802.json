    "content": "I have a Kenwood DMX701DABS head unit in my car.  Had it for about a year now and it's always bugged me that I cannot get spotify or even Google Play Music to play via bluetooth,  but when I connect my phone with the cable it's fine.  My phone is definitely  connected to the car via bluetooth,  because if I make a call, it works as it should (this is without a cable).\n\nIs there a setting somewhere  that I'm missing ?\n\nThanks in advance for any help.\n\nBobby",
