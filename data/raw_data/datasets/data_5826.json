    "content": "Hi,\nWhile cleaning up my installed apps, I clicked on the Share Phone app to see what it was. Apparently, I had set this up some time back with very restricted permissions and had forgotten all about it. Now I cannot use almost any app on my phone (I can browse the list of apps, open the Files app, but that's about it). \nI tried locking my phone and re-entering my passcode, restarting with no luck.\nDoes anyone know how to disable the restrictions so I can get full access to my phone?\n\nThanks a lot in advance.",
