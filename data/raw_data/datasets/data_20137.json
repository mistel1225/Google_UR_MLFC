    "content": "My Pixel Stand does not seem to charge my Pixel 4 phone wirelessly in a consistent manner after the June 2020 Android 10 update. This used to work perfectly before this month's update. I have rebooted the phone with the same behavior. The phone charges fine if I connect with the cable directly. The wireless charging would charge sometimes and disconnects most of the time. If I reposition the phone, it will charge again but not charging after a couple of minutes.\n\nAny suggestions please? Thanks.",
