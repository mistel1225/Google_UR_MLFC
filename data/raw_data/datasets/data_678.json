    "content": "My partner's Pixel 4a is having touch screen issues where it does not recognize any touch. There is no screen protector, we tried rebooting to factory settings and we got as far as \"start\" (still not working). Now it's stuck in emergency mode almost calling 911. What should we do? We can't even turn it off.",
