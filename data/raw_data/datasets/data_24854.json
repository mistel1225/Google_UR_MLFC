    "content": "I just have my Pixel 3a, all the contacts were transferred fine from my iPhone - including an international emergency number.\nOnly when I tried to make some changes to that contact, the phone refused to save them - I then deleted the contact and tried to make it again but I can't get it saved, the contact keeps being refused.\nAdding 'normal' contacts just works fine",
