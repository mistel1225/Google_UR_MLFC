    "content": "My Google Pixel has gone into talkback mode on its own twice.  Both times, I was in the AirBnB app working with the Check in instructions or the inbox in AirBnB.  Of course, it's the worst time, when you're standing outside your AirBnB for your phone to stop working. I was in Poland in two different cities when this happened.",
