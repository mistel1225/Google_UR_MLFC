    "content": "Smart Lock is great, but sometimes my phone will stay unlocked when it's in my pocket. There's been several times when I've taken out my phone to see an app open with random text typed in from all the times my thigh me contact with the screen. It'd be great if Pixel phones could detect when they are in your pocket so they can either a) lock or b) ignore touch input until the device is taken out. I'm sure this are many ways to accomplish this, such as a combination of the proximity sensor, LED flash, and rear cameras to identify it is in a pocket.",
