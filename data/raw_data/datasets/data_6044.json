    "content": "I've been having this issue where my Pixel Buds 2 keep connecting to my phone and playing audio on them even when they're inside the closed charging case. I try to adjust them in the case to make sure they're making contact and charging right, but I usually have to end up just manually changing the audio playback settings on my phone to fix it. Does anyone else have this problem or any potential solutions? I bought the pixel buds 2 from the Google store along with my Pixel 5 in October of 2020 so could I be eligible to swap them out or something too?",
