    "content": "It happens only in 90 Hz. I assume because of pixel trying to optimize battery usage, and jumping between 60 and 90 Hz.\nTherefore, switching permanently to 60 Hz in Settings fixes the problem.\n\nHowever, that's obviously a software bug which needs to be fixed.\n\nThanks in advance!",
