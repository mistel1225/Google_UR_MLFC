    "title": "Camera app closes with battery <70%",
    "content": "Recently I encounter problems with my Google Camera app. The app crashes randomly when the phone is not plugged to a charger (or powerbank) and the battery level is below 70%. It's a rather odd issue. However, sometimes also the phone crashes (when using gmaps, home button or just switching apps and going to settings) on the stated battery level. If battery is below 60% the phone often remains in a restart loop which only plugging to an external power source stops. All these issues happend before and after I reset my phone. Any idea what's causing the issue, familiar problems, remedies?",
