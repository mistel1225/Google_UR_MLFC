    "content": "I do not remember my PIN and have performed a factory reset.  Afterwards my device during setup requests to verify my previous pin which I do not remember.  I tried using my account email but it does not seem to be accepting the account I set it up with and I am out of options.\nIs there a way to reset this device clean where previous pin or account information is not needed or do I have to send device back to Google?\n\nNeed help on this please!",
