    "content": "Hey, \n\nI have had an issue with my Pixel 4XL turning off all the time. Rang Google, they said they would inspect it, so sent a warranty returns postage label for me to return the device. So I sent it off but it seems DHL have lost the parcel.\n\nI have contacted Google Device Support about this, but they are trying to make out its my problem its lost, even though its their parcel company and they arrange/paid for the postage. After nearly 2 weeks of emails to Google support asking them to create a case with DHL, they still have not. I just keep getting passed around from person to person, each of whom ask for all the information again and then do not do anything.\n\nI know its not Googles fault the parcel got lost but its their postage company and they are unwilling to help or even try to resolve this. They also seem to be ignoring my emails now which is very unprofessional and these have been to a Supervisor. I have spoken to DHL but as Google arranged postage they need Google to contact them. \n\nI literally do not know what to do to resolve this matter now, has anyone got any ideas? Btw I live in the UK.\n\nI am happy to post the emails to and from Google Support, honestly its embarrassing on Googles side.\n\nThank you in advance an for your time.\n\nJosh",
