    "content": "Called Verizon and visual voicemail is on but when they left test voice messages, the voicemail icon wouldn't appear and I had no indication a message was left by the caller. I have to call my voicemail box and listen to it the old-school way. Tried restarting phone, resetting Bluetooth, mobile, and wifi data, taking out sim card, etc...Verizon tech support couldn't help me either.",
