    "content": "Fingerprint scanner to unlock phone (Pixel 3) fails most of the time, has about a 10% success rate, based on multiple fingers as well (left and right).   Tried wiping it out and recreating the saved fingers as well.\n\nI have the switch parental controls app, and it's locked with fingerprint.  And it unlocks at a better succes rate.  So it's wierd.",
