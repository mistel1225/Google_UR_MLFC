    "content": "My phone will not turn on. When I charge it a gray battery icon shows up on the screen for a couple seconds. I thought this meant my phone was dead, but even after charging for 2 hours it will still not turn on.\n\nA couple days before my phone shut off completely it was already having difficulty charging. I tried three different chargers and none of them would charge my phone properly. However, when using these chargers on other devices they worked fine.\n\nI have done all the suggested steps for when your phone won't turn on or charge but none of them are working. Any help would be appreciated.",
