    "content": "1. Last night my pixel 3 shut off and after a few hours of trying to get it to turn back on it wouldn't. I contacted google to see what was wrong but they said since 2 months earlier I dropped it and that could be the problem even though I haven't had problems with it until now.\n\n2. This morning my phone miraculously turns back on so I was ecstatic and was about to cancel the $99 dollars assurant charges for a claim. Yet it now turns off about 20 seconds of me turning it on. I've got it to load into safe mode so I can factory reset. Still during the reset it turns off.\n\n3. I can enter recovery mode and it wont shut off. Only when at home screen or areas like that.\n\nIs there any fixes before I have to pay to get a replacement phone?",
