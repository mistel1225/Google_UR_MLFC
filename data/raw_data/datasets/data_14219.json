    "content": "Just received my Pixel 5 and been setting it all up the way I want. However I've noticed that I am unable to access the settings for the Pixel Stand.\n\nThe phone charges just fine when placed on the stand, however I can't find the settings anywhere. There was no pop-up when I first placed it on the stand and it is not showing up under Previously Connected Devices.\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated as I was hoping to use all the features of the stand.\n\nThanks!",
