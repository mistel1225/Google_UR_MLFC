    "title": "Can I use an external mic with the stock camera app on the original Pixel?",
    "content": "I have tried multiple external mics using the 3.5mm jack on my original (Pixel 1) Pixel XL with the stock camera app and cannot get it to work, despite all sorts of news and a statement from a Google rep on this forum that ALL Pixel phones would receive an update in 2018 that would allow the stock camera app to record audio from an external mic.\n\nI am using a PowerDeWise lavalier mic, with a 3-ring, 3.5mm jack.\n\nWhen I record with the Open Camera app it records audio with the video.\n\nWhen I record with the Moment app it records audio with the video.\n\nWhen I record with the stock camera app it records video, but no audio.\n\nI've watched videos where people show how on their phones (Pixel 2 and 3) when they plug in an external mic, it provides an option in the stock camera app to select and use the external mic.\n\nI do not see any such option appear on my phone.\n\nAnyone had this problem and found a solution?",
