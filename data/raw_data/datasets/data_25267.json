    "title": "Google Pixel 2 XL - Half the screen turns black after screen rotation",
    "content": "On my Google Pixel 2 XL I have had some troubles with the screen and I haven't found any related problems yet. When I am in landscape mode (either watching a video or browsing Chrome) and I switch back to portrait mode, sometimes half of my screen turns black. I can still use the bottom half of the screen because the bottom navigation buttons still work and I can move back and forth on the screen still using the bottom half. The screen usually turns back to normal after I go to a different page or back to my home screen. I've tried restarting a few times to see if that would fix the issue, but it still seems to happen a few times a day. \n\nI've attached a screenshot of when the screen goes black. The picture hasn't been cropped or anything, that is exactly how it looks.\n\nAny help would be appreciated!\n\nThanks!",
