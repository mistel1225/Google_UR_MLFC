    "content": "Hey everyone. I tried asking Google on twitter but they didn't really acknowledge my problem, and when I asked Netflix they said it was a \"function\" on Google's end. Anyway here it goes:\nWhenever I play *any* title from the Netflix app my brightness rises to the max and night light gets activated. It's fine when it's daylight, but when I'm in bed with lights off it's kinda blinding, especially when the scene is sunny. It doesn't do it with other video apps, and I found no option to change this neither in my phone's settings nor in the Netflix app.\nWhat could it be? Can I change it? Can Google get rid of this useless \"function\" (in quotes because I HATE it)? If I want my brightness higher I can do it manually, I don't need them to force it on me. Sorry about the bitterness but I really dislike when I can't decide for myself how to use my phone.\n\nEDIT: Talked with Netflix and apparently it's a problem on their end on titles that have HDR. If you can, talk to them and inform them that your device has this issue, because they said not many people have phones with HDR yet so they received very little reports of this problem.",
