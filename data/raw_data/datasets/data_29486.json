    "content": "A few days back, I had issues with Google Photos backup. My Google Photos App kept showing backup completed. But there were some photos which did not backup. These photos had the not backed up symbol on the right-side corner and I was unable to upload them to an album. I googled to fix this issue and tried a couple of things. One of this included to Disable the Photos App from Settings and Enable it back after a few seconds. I did that and it solved the backup problem. But now I cannot find the photos that had the not backup symbol on them.\nAlso, since then my camera is also acting weird. In the circle on the right side of the shutter, which generally shows last clicked image, now is gray. When I click it nothing happens. When I click a photo and then click the circle it does shows the last photo but that's it. I cannot swipe to see other clicked photos.\nPlease help me with retrieving the photos. There were about 300 photos from a trip and they are not in Trash or Archive folder or on any other account. Neither are these photos visible when I go to photos.google.com on my laptop.",
