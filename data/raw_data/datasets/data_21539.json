    "content": "Months ago as my Pixel 3 USB type C port is physically damaged, I have been using wireless charger.\nThe phone was running fine until pretty recent.\nWeek ago, I was using hotspot + wireless charging at the same time for a couple hours, and then it randomly shuts off. To turn it back on, I could only factory reset the phone.\n\nNow, with only a few apps on the phone, it randomly shuts off when the battery is below 30%. The battery percentage would drop down within a few seconds and shuts off. Sometimes I could start the phone back on and it shows 0% battery or to whatever battery percentage it had. But the phone will still have the issue unless I recharge the phone for hours.\n\nI took the phone to fix the port so I can charge the phone with cable faster. But the issue is still there, technician told me to change a battery as they tested it and said my phone battery is getting old. But I worry that a new battery will not fix this problem as the battery was fine and the phone came up with this big issue all of sudden; it seems to me it's a firmware or software issue.\n\nI have done alot of research but could not find a solution, can anyone help please?",
