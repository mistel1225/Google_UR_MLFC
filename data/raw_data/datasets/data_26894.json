    "title": "My pixel 4 starts acting crazy on Android auto. Google assistant come on every 30 seconds.",
    "content": "Phone is connected to my car and I m using maps on Android auto. Google assistant randomly gets triggered every few seconds. It comes on and starts reading old notifications and messages without any triggers. Minimizes maps on its own, causing a lot of hassle. Disconnecting and closing all apps fixes the issue for a few minutes but it happens again.",
