    "content": "Apps routinely get minimized whenever my screen times out.  For example, if I'm on hold on a call, then  the phone is answered, the Phone app has been minimized when I unlock my phone.  I then have to go to the square button to open the Phone app from the Recently used apps list.\n\nI'm not exactly sure how many of my apps this is currently affecting.  I do know for sure that it happens with Phone app, Google Podcasts, Chrome and Messages.",
