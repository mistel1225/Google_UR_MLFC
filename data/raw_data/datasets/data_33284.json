    "content": "When trying to connect second call to first with merge button, it seems to lose first call and replace it with a recorded message to \"please put in a password\". \nThe first call is lost and recorded message plays over and over second caller and myself.\nThis has gone on for sometime now and was hoping a fix would have happened by now but still doing this problem. Any help on this issue coming soon?",
