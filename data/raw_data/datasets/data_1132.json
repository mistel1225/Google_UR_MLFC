    "content": "My Pixel 4 has been having problems connecting with wifi. At first, it was just this one network, but now, I can't connect to ANY wifi. I've made sure I'm inputting the login info correctly, I've tried connecting to other networks, but nothing works. I did a factory reset, and unfortunately that didn't fix the problem. The same thing keeps happening- I enter the login information, and it saves the network, but can't connect to it.\nCan anybody help?",
