    "content": "Hi\n\nthis question isn't related to Pixel Phone however I hope someone can help me anyway. I am interested in purchasing the Pixel Buds just for the sake of listening to music from my Samsung Gear Sport (Tizen OS) smartwatch. I don't care about any of the bud's special features. I think Bluetooth-wise there shouldn't be a problem since my watch and the buds are 4.2 compatible (AFAIK) however I am worried because my smartwatch runs Tizen and Google states that the buds can only be used with iOS or Android devices.\nCan someone verify that the buds can be used as plain headphones with non iOS - and Android devices?\n\nThanks in advance",
