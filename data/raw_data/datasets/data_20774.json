    "content": "My pixel 2 will sometimes restart when the battery is around 30% and I try to use some apps (I have seen it while trying to answer a WhatsApp Video Call and Spotify). \n\nI have tried to factory reset the phone but without any luck.\nAnyone else with the same problem? Any suggestion of what I can do to try to fix the problem?\n\nI have this phone since November 2017 and it sounds it is a little bit early to start having these battery issues. I owned a Nexus 6 in the past that the battery was good even after 3 years of usage.",
