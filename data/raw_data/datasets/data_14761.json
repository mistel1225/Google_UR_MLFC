    "content": "I just got my pixel 4a, everything is working fine.\nHowever, when I shake my phone, I can hear something moving inside my phone,  around the top of the phone, I'm a bit concerned as it means something is not fixed properly inside, and one of the component might not be working, is there a way to test that ? Any idea what it could be ?",
