    "content": "When ever the volume goes off automatically, I would restart my phone immediately. I have to reset my phone once it happens and it happens everyday. Recently I had to restart my phone twice due to these issues after the android 11 update. Now I'm asking whoever know this issue please help me. I really love my pixel phone very much. I just need help with this situation.\n\nThanks",
