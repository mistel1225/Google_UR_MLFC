    "title": "Pixel 3a Restarted 3 times in last 2 months, each time losing 'call screening'",
    "content": "This phone is Only used for phone calls, no 3rd party apps. \n\nAuto updates are on and it is fully patched for all System and apps.\n\nIt has restarted to the DOS prompt asking if try again or factory reset 3 times in last 2 months.   Each time I tell it to try again, and it comes up, but 'call screening' is lost.\n\nIt's just used to screen calls - it's not my main phone (which is an iphone), so without the call screening feature, it's Useless and I can't depend on it as it could have restarted and be essentially OFF and non-responsive waiting for me to Restart it, totally missing calls.\n\nThis is the Worst Phone I have Ever had.  My iPhone has a lot of stupid software issues (using CarPlay in my Porsche kills notifications on my Watch after I leave the car), but I can still use it as a Phone and it doesn't Ever restart and suddenly lose features that were Briefly working.\n\nWhat is the point of a phone that gets the latest security updates if the phone just Doesn't work???\n\nHow can I just use it as a phone safely - for text and phone calls ONLY.  I don't care about anything else - I don't use apps on this phone?  I don't even take it out of my house, it's Wifi only replacing my old land line.\n\nI could have bought a cheap $50 phone and it would probably work better than this disaster.  It works, them it doesn't, then it works, then it doesn't.  Disaster.",
