    "content": "So, when moving the phone from left to right while the Camera app is opened I can hear some kind of \"ultrasound\"/high pitch noise from the camera module.\nI've recorded it, here's the video (headphones are recommended) - https://youtu.be/dQrY9VhIWdg\nMy friend's Pixel 4 XL has the same issue (headphones are recommended) - https://youtu.be/E2sl1eEXhjQ\n\nI created a thread on Reddit and seems like other people have the same issue. Here's the link - https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/g7ulig/google_pixel_4_ultrasoundhigh_pitch_noises_when/\n\nThe 6 people out of 75 have the same issue which is pretty high percentage (8%) of devices.\n\nThere's one more issue which can be linked with this one - There are 'clicks' when switching the Camera app modes (e.h. Camera/Portrait/Video).",
