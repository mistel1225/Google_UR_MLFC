    "content": "Apps won't open or close quickly. Most apps do this. An error pops up, but instantly disappears before I can read it. I've restarted a number of times, deleted apps installed lately and run malware and virus checks. The problem also occurs when using the google search widget. As soon as I type 1 letter the app closes. Amazon tries to open but crashes before it fully initiates and some apps don't respond at all when I press their icon.",
