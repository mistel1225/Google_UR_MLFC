    "content": "I'd like to ask if is there any function that allows for a rotation/change of lock screens daily? I am aware that daily wallpapers is a thing, so just wondering if is it available for wallpapers too? Would it also be possible for me to customize and choose the daily wallpaper/lockscreen from my own set of photos? Thanks a lot!",
