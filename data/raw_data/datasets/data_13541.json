    "content": "A couple of weeks ago I woke up with a crack on my screen, this happened overnight the phone was not dropped. Today I have literally just taken the phone out of my pocket to check messages and another crack has formed across the screen , this doesn't seem normal to me please help, I bought the phone under contract in July 2019 and so have around 9 months left paying for it so I assume it's under warranty?",
