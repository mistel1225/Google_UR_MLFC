    "title": "What is the status of Photos for Pixel owners?",
    "content": "I have a Pixel 4a 5g, which I enjoy by the way. I keep reading conflicting information about Photos storage limits changing in June, 2021. Some articles say Pixel owners get unlimited storage, some say to move photos to another platform, and others are ambiguous. I have gotten notices from Google saying to pay, move the photos, or lose them. But, I distinctly remember seeing information that Pixel owners were exempt; although, I didn't save the source. Can someone point me towards the real story here?\n\nI'm also a bit confused about what happens if I'm logging in from different platforms other than my Pixel phone (e.g. non google android tablet, Windows PC). Does using those platforms in any way negate my having a Pixel and having access to unlimited storage, if in fact I do? \n\nI know I still have a month, but I'd like to get this figured out before the last minute. Thanks in advance.",
