    "content": "So the issue started today, my phone hasn't been dropped or scratched or damaged in anyway. The screen jumps in the KLM region of the keyboard and when I try to delete characters the keyboard jumps to the M character too. The messenger app and WhatsApp app don't allow me to send messages when I click on the arrow and when I try to digitally lower or increase the volume it doesn't let me but when I click or use an app in the region of the screen it works perfectly fine. I am so confused.",
