    "content": "I purchased a Pixel 3 yesterday. I am wanting to turn on Flip to Shhh. I looked under gestures and it is not there. I then tried to look under Digital Wellbeing, but that is not anywhere under settings. Every site I have looked at says Flip to Shhh is under either of those two settings.\nI have tried to search my phone for flip to shhh as well as Digital Wellbeing and nothing comes up. Can someone please help me figure out what is wrong? Thank You!!!",
