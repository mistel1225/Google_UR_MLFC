    "content": "Just purchased the Pixel 5 today.  Of course, I have to move all of my apps from my Pixel 3XL.  Play Store starts the process and it has now been stuck at \"installed 48 out of 95 applications\" for over 4 hours.  I've hard stopped Play Store, rebooted my phone, and it still comes back to the same issue.\n\nIdeas?",
