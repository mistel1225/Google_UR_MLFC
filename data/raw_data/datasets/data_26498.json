    "title": "Google Pixel Static Screen after Screen Replacement",
    "content": "Have an original Google Pixel.  Owned over 3 years, well out of warranty now.    Battery was shot, wouldnt hold a charge for more than 20 minutes.  Time for battery replacement.\n\nThe screen is glued on and the battery is under the screen.  Not only is the screen glued on, but this phone had been replaced once under warranty with a \"factory refurbished\" one and they were very enthusiastic with the glue.   \n\nLong story short, no way to replace the battery without also replacing the screen.  Screen cant be removed without destroying it. \n\nSo I ordered a battery and a screen.   Battery replacement was routine and uneventful.   Plugged in the screen to test it before gluing it down.   It lights up but its all colorful static.  \n\nThe rest of the phone works fine.  I can call it and it rings, so obviously the processor is up.  It responds to pressing the power buttons and the volume buttons.  And I plug it into my computer and USB recognizes it.  Vibrator works and speakers work.  Basically the only thing NOT working is the new screen.\n\nIs it just a junk defective replacement screen?  Or is there any way the video chip was damaged somehow?\n\nHas anyone run into this before on screen replacements?\n\nThanks",
