    "title": "Pixel 4a fingerprint registration not working",
    "content": "My Pixel 4a's fingerprint sensor doesn't register my finger, giving an error message saying that it's dirty. After spending 10 minutes cleaning my finger and the sensor repetitively it still says the same thing. My finger hasn't got any scratches or anything, and it's been doing this for quite some time now. \n\nI know techniques like registering my finger on the side, pressing harder or softer, or registering the finger multiple times have been used to solve problems like this before but I can't even use them because I can't even register my finger! Please help ðŸ˜­",
