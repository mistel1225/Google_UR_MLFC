    "content": "Hi, \nMy phone was on airplane mode and when I went to take it off, it wouldn't connect to any service. I restarted my phone and recieved the follwing message with a black screen:\n\nAndroid Recovery\ngoogle/crosshatch/crosshatch\n9/PQ3A.190605.004.A1/5579337\nuser/release-keys\nUse volume up/down and power\nCan't load Android system. Your data may be corrupt. If you continue to get this message, you may need to perform a factory data reset and erase all user data stored on this device.\n\nWhat do I do??? I've tried a hard restart and that has not happened. Has this happened to anyone else??\n\nThanks",
