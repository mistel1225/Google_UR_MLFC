    "content": "Gifs are not playing in my default messaging app. Once in a great while they work, but usually it's just a still image. I've had people send them that are on the same carrier as me. I've received them from Iphones and from Androids and that doesn't seem to make any difference. They work on FB  and FB messenger, they work on Twitter. Has anyone else had this problem & fixed it? I am not very tech savvy so if anyone has any ideas how to fix it please help! Thank you.",
