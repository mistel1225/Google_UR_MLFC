    "content": "Somehow the dark theme has been turned on (black background, white letters) for some of the apps such as contacts and the setting screen (but not all of them, the phone app is white with black letters.) I have tried changing in themes and accessibility but nothing seems to be letting me go back to white with black letters. Any suggestions?",
