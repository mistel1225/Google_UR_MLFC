    "content": "Hello, I don't know what happened but I'm facing this problem from past couple of months that when ever I export something from ANY third party editing application like Adobe Lightroom or picsart or snapseed. It doesn't show in the gallery, for weeks. It was not happening earlier but started around 2 months back. And sometimes, just sometimes when I restart the phone it does show 1-2 images out of 10 but not all and not everytime I restart. also, even if it shows after restarting the device, I can not upload/send them on any social media because it doest show there too. I don't know what to do now, please help.",
