    "title": "Bluetooth audio drops out on multiple devices on pixel 4a.",
    "content": "Since receiving my 4a I've noticed that the bluetooth audio intermittently cuts out in various ways.\n1) when running with pixel buds the streaming audio quality degrades sometimes. When it does occur it gets worse if I move my head away from the phone, which is on my waist.\n2) for my car radio and a remote bluetooth speakerfor 10 seconds or so it will completely drop audio, but appears to remain connected.  Then it will cut in playing the audio like nothing happened.",
