    "content": "I bought a 90° adapter so I could fit my phone into my gimbal and also use my external microphone at the same time however it says it isn't compatible with the phone. Is there an adapter which is compatible out there? The USB C to 3.5mm adapter won't fit in the phone when it's in the gimbal hence why I need one which comes out of the USB C port at an angle.",
