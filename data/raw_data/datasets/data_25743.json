    "content": "Hi! I received a Pixel2 as a gift. But I couldn't check my IMEI on google's repair site. The site showed \"For the device with this IMEI or serial number, youâ€™ll have to check the Hardware Warranty Center to see your repair options \" after I entered IMEI. I wonder why...\nMany thanks!",
