    "title": "Pixel 3a XL keeps rejecting my pin and will not unlock phone",
    "content": "At some point between 9am and 12pm today, my phone locked and will not allow me to unlock it. First, I tried to use my fingerprint sensor and was told for additional security, I must enter my PIN. Then when I entered my PIN, it was rejected and deemed incorrect. I enter this pin often and recently so there is no reason it should not work.\n\nMy research has shown this may be a bug primarily associated with the Pixel XL phones. I tried rebooting in Safe Mode and no change. I accepted that I had to reset and erase my phone, despite thinking this is a   pathetic response from a company as large as Google towards its hardware. So anyway, I just reset my phone and now want to access my backed up data and am told I need to use my old PIN. I did that and THE PHONE STILL WON'T ACCEPT THE NUMBER! Does this mean I cannot access my backed up data? Why is there no work around for this? I have all my correct passwords and successfully linked my google account yet cannot access the backup that is saved within the Google account. How do I fix this?",
