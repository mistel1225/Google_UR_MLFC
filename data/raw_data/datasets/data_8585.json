    "content": "I just got my Pixel 4a but was found that the volumes of media, ring, alarm and call are all very low. The problem is especially serious with ring volume: Despite the fact that I have already chosen a ringtone with a rather loud sound when used in my old phone, I still need to adjust the volume to over half of the volume bar in order to barely hear a ring. May I know if there is any way to effectively fix this problem? Thanks.",
