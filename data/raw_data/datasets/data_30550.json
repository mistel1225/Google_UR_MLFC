    "content": "Good afternoon. I bought my phone last summer at the Finnish airport at the Fnac store. \nToday a white line appeared on the screen from the edge of the phone. \nAnd to the right of the front camera, the area where the battery charge is shown has become noticeably darker similar to the left. This happened after quite a long viewing of YouTube. \n\nPlease tell me how to behave in such a situation? The phone was bought as a gift, I live in Russia and we have this phone is not for sale. (( I'll be in France on vacation in about a month, there's an Fnac store there. Can they help me? \nI apologize for the quality of the pictures, I still do not shoot on Pixel. \n\nDo not pay attention to the broken protective glass, it is installed for a year. There's no damage underneath. (In the camera I had to break the glass due to contamination of these cameras.",
