    "content": "I'm trying to transfer all my old chrome bookmarks from my old samsung phone to my new pixel 4a.  I do not want to sync with my pc account because I have different bookmarks on my chrome pc vs my phone chrome.   Can I transfer using my pc without getting all my bookmarks from my pc transferred as well?\n\nThanks.",
