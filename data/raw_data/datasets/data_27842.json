    "content": "For some reason, out of nowhere, I keep getting a message on my home screen saying that my live wallpaper has stopped. I have stopped the app and tried rebooting my phone, but it keeps happening. I'm using the Marvellous Marble wallpaper (planet earth with live weather from weather.com). Any ideas if I can fix this, or is there a deeper problem with the wallpaper?",
