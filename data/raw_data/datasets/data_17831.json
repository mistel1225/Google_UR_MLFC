    "content": "I just bought a new Google Pixel 3 XL and have been working for 3 days to get rid of an annoying random notification sound. The sound is not one of the default sounds in my settings and cannot be explained via notification or sound settings. I've read it could be related to NFC or Bluetooth, so I've disabled both. I've checked the notification log too, but these are not noted. Even reset my phone but to no avail. I finally contacted support and they said it's not a known issue (even though I see evidence of it for Pixels and other Android phones via Google search) and they suggested I return the phone, which I'm doing and I'm hoping I won't find the same issue with the replacement.\n\nI did migrate a backup from a Huawei Mate 9 -- wondering if it could be connected to the China tracking system??? ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜‚ I'm just frustrated AF. I bought a Pixel because I figured I'd get as close to the native Android as possible and hoped to avoid annoyances I saw on my Huawei. Any insights would be great.",
