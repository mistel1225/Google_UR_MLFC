    "content": "Anyone suffering from battery drain after upgrading to android 11 from 10?\nThe battery uses up fast noticeably compared to times I'm using android 10. I did not install any new apps after the upgrade, did the reboot yet it's still not working. \nI hope Google releasing another update soon.",
