    "title": "Jio caller (india) -- display discoloration around bottom icon panel?",
    "content": "Did anyone notice while using JioCall app (from google playstore) with router, on the bottom part of the \"green jio screen\" some kind of discoloration (band like) veering off to left side starting from around where the call icon is? I don't know if it is because it is a third party app OR eclipse live wall paper & dark theme on display causing some weird discoloration? Any thoughts? On solid colors I see fine patterns -- like fine lines or fine eddy like structures. One case (solid wall paper -- e.g. cyan) I could confirm that the gradient (fine lines) were superposed on the solid color since some one NOT using google phone confirmed they are saying the same on their screen also. Appreciate any inputs you may have. I have a 7d return window, I do hope I don't have to return! Thanks.",
