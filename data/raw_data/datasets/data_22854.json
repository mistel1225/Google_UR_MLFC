    "title": "Phone will not charge with a cord",
    "content": "My Pixel 3xl is displaying a silent notification that says \"charging connected device via USB\" In the USB preferences I am not able to switch the UBS controller to \"this device.\" It tries and says \"couldn't switch.\" I am only able to charge my phone with a wireless charger. Thousands of people online have had this problem. I have already tried cleaning the port, forcing a shut down, numerous different cords..... Something needs to give. A cellphone should last more than a year.",
