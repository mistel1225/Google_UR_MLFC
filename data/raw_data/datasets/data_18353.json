    "content": "My phone crashed one day, then was stuck at 50% battery life. Last night it shut off (I assumed it died). But it will not charge. When I plug it into a charger and hold down the power button a different screen pops up. It shows all the phones information then the last line of information says the phone is locked by key combo. How can I get past this so I can turn on my phone?",
