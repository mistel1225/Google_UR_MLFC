    "content": "My Pixel 4a battery life seems to do pretty well. But monitoring my battery usage, one thing stood out: Chrome used 9% of my battery when \"Used for 10 Minutes\". This is the same amount my ambient display used in almost 12 hours, and more than my screen used in over 2 hours. I did not have the app actively open, and it had only 2 tabs open when I did. Is this a setting issue? Or is it just normal operation?",
