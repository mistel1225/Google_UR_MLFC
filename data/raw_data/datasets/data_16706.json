    "content": "I recently got the Google Earth Live Case with the River design for my Pixel 2. I understand that the Live Cases app is no longer supported by Google. I downloaded the app, but it won't let me log in. However, I'd really like to get the matching wallpaper that's shown in the promotional images, but I can't find the original high-res image anywhere. Is there any possible way to get this wallpaper?",
