    "content": "Hello. I purchased a google pixel 3a on ebay, which I was very happy about. I fully used it for exactly a month. A month later, the phone connection was blocked. In the notification bar, a message appeared that you need to check with the T - MOBILE operator about the possibility of using third-party SIM cards. I contacted T - MOBILE tech support, but they said they couldn't help because I couldn't give them a T - MOBILE account. My phone and I are located in Russia, where this operator does not exist. Please help me with this issue.",
