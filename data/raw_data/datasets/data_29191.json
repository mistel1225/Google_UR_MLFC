    "content": "I have a Pixel 3 and I have a Tesla Model 3. I am using the Tesla App which enables me to control my EV. My google assistant goes mute when I enter my car (phone & calendar are synced to the car).  I. can ask a question, it responds on the screen but there is no audio.   When I exit the car and the car goes to sleep, my Google assistant is no longer mute. Is this a Bluetooth issue?",
