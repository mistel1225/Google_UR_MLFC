    "title": "Why does my Google Pixel 4 XL lock screen turn on when no notifications are shown?",
    "content": "When my phone is locked, the screen will randomly turn on not showing any notifications. I've turned off the \"Always on\" setting, so it's not that. I've turned off all notifications on social media apps like Instagram, Snapchat, and Twitter thinking this was the issue. But the lock screen continues to turn on randomly. I've tried to play around with the notifications setting and the display lock screen settings, but I can't seem to make it stop. It is really inconvenient as my phone would do this roughly every hour, using up battery. If you know a solution please help me out. I literally just got this phone two weeks ago. Thank you.",
