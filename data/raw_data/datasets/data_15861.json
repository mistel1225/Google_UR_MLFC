    "content": "Hi, \n\nI had to flash my pixel with last build for Android 10, cause Android 11 is simply not working properly.\n\nNotifications, my old 3 buttons in the bottom, most of apps... What was that!?\n\nI did it 4 times with clean update and without any special settings. I made it with Android tools to be sure phone was wiped correctly.\nNothing. \n\nMy pixel 3 XL simply doesn't work with 11.\n\nI have no idea what happened exactly and honestly, all new features are just more problems to setup that, like \"conversations\", one theses that not working with most of of social apps, or bubbles not working, etc.\n\nAnd we're waiting for settings for notifications sound and ringtone separately, since Oreo.\n\nHow many ppl it takes to say that things like wellbeing or setting sounds are not mandatory for every people? Why going so far with wellbeing and settings that is way too intrusive that I can't deactivate it with 11 even if this release work with my phone? \n\nAnd when can we expect a real good release for 11? \n\nI'm discouraged. \n\nLove ideas, like conversations, like bubbles, even wellbeing is a good idea if people need it!\nBUT... I HATE when you force ideas everywhere, especially Wellbeing and sound settings.\nAnd for now, all I want is a fresh and GOOD update for Android 11 that will work, and at least, less wellbeing dependant, and obviously... 2 settings for notifications sounds and ringtone AGAIN.\n\n\nP.s.: sorry if I made mistakes, English is not my first language.\n\nSeph√Æ.",
