    "title": "Pixel 4a: Awful interface!",
    "content": "Why did Google create such an awful interface on the 4a?? Almost every time I try to \"swipe left\" to view more information on a page, it interprets the motion as \"go back\" and I lose what I'm trying to do. The same thing happens when trying to scroll down on a page: either the phone interprets this motion as a click/tap or it goes back to the home screen. This also creates a ridiculous amount of unintentional ad response/interactions. Why is it so difficult to just scroll???\n\nI desperately miss the home and back buttons. I feel like I'm using an iPhone, which I hate for the main reason that it lacks the \"back\" button. \n\nSadly, I just missed the 15 day return window (I thought it was 30 days) so I guess I'm stuck with this thing for a while. Planning to go back to Samsung in the future.",
