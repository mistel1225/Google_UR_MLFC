    "content": "I created labels in the Contacts application to organize my contacts. For example, I created Friends, Doctors, Work, etc. All is fine in the Contacts app. But when I go to the phone app, it shows is my full Contact list. I don't want that. I want it to only show one of the custom label lists that created in the Contacts application. I would also like it to allow me to switch between the different contact labeled lists the same way it works in the Contact app.",
