    "content": "Had two updates to Android 10 this month.  One was for the beginning of the month and another one was for today (9/24) for Android 10. However I only see the update for the beginning of the month reflecting on the 3a after today's update was completed. I'm wondering if the update actually installed or not? Are the hotfixes not cataloged with the System Update tool on the phone? Is it just major patch updates an OS updates it accounts for?",
