    "content": "I just installed the august security patch and now my Pixel won't unlock by itself when i put my finger on the fingerprint scanner. It locks just fine, but when i try to unlock it via pixel imprint the phone does not vibrate as it does normally and the screen doesn't turn on. When i press the power button (once or multiple times) nothing seems to be happening for like 3-5 seconds, then the screen lights up. I already restarted the phone for like 3 times and nothing seems to change. Everytime i pick up the phone it takes about 5-7 seconds before i can even see the homescreen.. Please help",
