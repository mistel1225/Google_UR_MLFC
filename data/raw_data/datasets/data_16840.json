    "title": "Our Pixel 2 phones are almost all swollen back from summer break (13 out of 15)",
    "content": "We are a public school and we use Pixel 2 phones in our classes to show Android programming to our students. Back from the summer break we had the bad surprise to find out that 13 out of our 15 phones have swollen. We are a few months shy from the warranty. I don't think this is normal that the phones have all done that. That must be a defective lot.\n\nCan Google do something about that? How can we contact them? What can we do?\n\nI attached a link to an album showing the phones.\n\nLink to album",
