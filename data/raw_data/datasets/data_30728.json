    "content": "Over the last few days, I've noticed my Do Not Disturb is turning itself on.  I have two rules set: wind down between 11pm and 5am and also \"flip to shhh\".  That's it.  \n\nMy phone wasn't flipped for any of the next three situations and it wasn't between my wind down time parameters:\n\nTwo days ago, I kept missing calls between 10am and noon - only to realize that my DND was on when I didn't set it to be.  \n\nLast night, I was at dinner about 5:30pm and kept missing texts and calls.  Sure enough, DND was on... \n\nThis morning, phone was working fine, DND was off; then at 9:30am I noticed DND was turned on.  I turned it off.  Then at 9:35am noticed it was turned on again. I was on my phone at the time (using Facebook) and saw the upper right status bar icon populate without me prompting it to turn on. \n\nI've disabled DND, I've restarted my phone, I've read every thread out there already and can't find anything that matches what's happening for me.  Anyone else experiencing this?",
