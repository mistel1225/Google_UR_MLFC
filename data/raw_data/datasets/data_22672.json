    "content": "I hope I am in the correct category.\n\nDidnt see any info to the contrary, but isn't motion sense supposed to work in the Pixel 3? Just bought one, already updated to Android 10, but the option of Motion Sense, inside System doesn't even show up.\n\nDoesn't it have to do with the country I am in?\n\nI reside in Portugal, Europe.\n\nThank you!",
