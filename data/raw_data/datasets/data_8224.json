    "title": "Battery Drain - Slow at First, then Speeds Up?",
    "content": "Something I've observed with the battery percentage on my new Pixel 4a: The battery appears to be slow to drain at first (e.g., 20 minutes of screen on time from 100% --> 99%), but then drains more quickly throughout the day even with consistent quantity and quality of (fairly light) usage. Is this normal? And/or is this just a product of somewhat inaccurate battery readings, and not a precise reflection of the battery level? For context, the phone is fully updated with the latest Android updates.",
