    "title": "I Broke The SIM Card Slot On My Pixel, What Are My Repair Options?",
    "content": "I upgraded from a Samsung S5 and i did not realise the SIM card was the incorrect size, it got stuck in the SIM slot when i was trying to insert it with the tray and i spent hours trying to get it out with tweezers. It looks like i damaged the housing and now no SIM cards are being recognised (tried two different ones that are known to work). Is there anywhere i can goto to get it repaired (obviously warranty shouldn't cover user error)?",
