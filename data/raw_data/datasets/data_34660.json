    "title": "Pixel 2 xl, less than 2 years old, network issue while roaming. takes too much time to get connected",
    "content": "Whenever i am on roaming and travel across different states within India, i typically use flight mode and once get on to the other state, it takes atleast five minutes to get connected to the local available network which is not the case with my ios device (since this is my other device which i use) just in case the android doesnt work. And to my expectations this has been happening which is really irritating when you are in a hurry to book cabs from the airport and have to wait for my mobile to get connected to the network. Need this issue to be addressed asap.",
