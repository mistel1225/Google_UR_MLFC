    "content": "My Pixel 4a has always automatically connected to my home WiFi network no problem until yesterday. I have run through the trouble shooting steps Google support provided me with and still not working. \n\nThe strange thing is though my other Pixel 4a phone was working fine the WiFi would automatically turn back on that's until I switched my WiFi box off and back on and now I have the same problem on that phone! Again I run the trouble shooting steps and even factory reset the phone and still not working! \n\nI have checked with my network provider Virgin and there are outages in my local area which could be affecting the phones but I have since been to a friend's and my phone didn't automatically switch WiFi on there either.\n\nSo I'm confused as to whether it's a network problem affecting the phones or whether there's an issue with the phones. But like I said the problem occured on both handsets on the same day. \n\nHas anyone had a similar issue? I'm fed up with Google saying to file a warranty for the phone when it's clearly not specific to the one handset. \n\nAlso I'd like to add if I leave the WiFi symbol on it does automatically connect to the networks saved just won't switch WiFi back on when off anymore.
