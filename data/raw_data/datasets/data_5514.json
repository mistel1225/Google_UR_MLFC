    "content": "Hi there.\n\nI am having issues with Google assistant. For some reason, there are certain results it will not speak out loud through my phone - for example, my phone will not speak results of the weather out loud, but it will speak random facts or jokes out loud.\n\nIf I have earphones or headphones in, then it will speak any and all results through my headphones.\n\nHowever, I did notice that if I go to where it says \"Assistant devices\", under \"Personal\", it tells me I have some wired headphones registered to my account (which is strange because they should de-register as soon as I unplug them) - I think that somehow the Google assistant thinks my headphones are still plugged in, hence why I can't hear most of my search results. I tried to remove them - but there is no delete button!\n\nJust to get everyone on the same page, I have attached a couple screenshots below so you know exactly which screen I am talking about.\n\nPlease help me with this issue, thanks.",
