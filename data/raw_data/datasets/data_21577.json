    "title": "Little but annoying and things are off about my phone.",
    "content": "I was in a place with barely any connection and data and I was trying to download something, and it unsurprisingly wasn't working that well but then I set my phone aside and when I next tried to use it certain features didn't work. I assume that the phone restarted. The features that aren't working is I can't swipe up to see the screens I have open and the home button won't work, so I have to repeatedly hit the back button to get to the home screen. The home button won't summon Google either. Also when I try to swipe the menu screen down, the basic stuff like wifi, Bluetooth, and flashlight will show but it won't go past that first row. I can't adjust brightness or turn on data. I even tried turning on the data through the settings app but it wouldn't work. \nI have restarted my phone multiple times as well as cleared the wifi/Bluetooth settings and the apps settings.",
