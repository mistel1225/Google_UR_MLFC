    "content": "I cant receive verification code from any institute requires 2-step verification code to access. I can receive text message from my friend and family though. I have talked to my carrier (Verizon), and they send me a work through test message, however, any message contains CODE doesn't work.\n\nI read articles here, someone mentions to turn the turn on premium SMS access, however, in the setting of my pixel 5 shows no installed apps have requested Premium SMS access. It is a dead-end, not even an option to choose turn-on anything.\n\n\nwhat should I do to fix this issue??",
