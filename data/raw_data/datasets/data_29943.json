    "content": "Hi,\n\nI bought the Pixel 3a and part of the deal was to receive the original Pixel 3a case. I did and I really like it but it is damaged! There's a stitch in the top left corner and I'm worried it might start to get worse over time. \n\nHowever I can't see were to start a case to get it replace! This web page is very hard to navigate thru.\n\nWhere could I start a case to get this going?\n\nThanks.",
