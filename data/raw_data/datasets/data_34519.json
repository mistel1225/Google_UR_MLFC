    "content": "I have contacted google support about this problem earlier, I thought it was resolved but the problem has picked up again, I did everything all the way down to a factory reset and it's working better but the problem still persists. Basically, my camera app and any other other related camera app (Snap chat, Google Cardboard Camera, even in SMS etc.) doesn't take pics. I open the app, and sometimes it's frozen on just a plain black screen, other times the app just crashes, in other apps, for example, Snapchat, I sometimes get a warning saying \"Snapchat\" isn't responding and gives me some options to either restart the app or send feedback. I have done everything that the Google Site suggested all the way down to a factory reset. Like I said before sometimes it works perfectly fine like nothing is wrong, and than within a moment it crashes.",
