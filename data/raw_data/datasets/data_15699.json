    "content": "In certain apps that use portrait mode or make use of the whole screen horizontally don't work sometimes, so far specifically on YouTube and ygopro2, ygopro2 gets compressed to fit the screen vertically, and youtube will give me the amount of screen I would normally get in non-full screen, while in full screen, this only started happening after the recent update, the only thing that seems to fix it is restarting the phone or waiting, closing the app and reopening it doesn't work",
