    "content": "Anytime I use the flash in the camera app, the pic comes out very washed out or just plain white. It doesn't matter if there is already a light source, it's white. The auto flash doesn't work at all,.even in a pitch black room.\n\nIf I use another app, like Snapchat, there are no problems.",
