    "content": "When I swipe down, I can see six setting shortcuts that I've selected. Until today, I could select and pull down that section to see 9 to 12 setting shortcuts. Now, I can only side scroll? Is that new or did I accidentally reset something?\n\n(I don't love it. I keep actually hitting a settings  button instead of actually swiping and it's really annoying. And the whole point of the extended view is to be able to see all of them and not have to scroll through.)",
