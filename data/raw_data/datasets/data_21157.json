    "content": "So the history is this:\n\nI bought a pixel 3a from Amazon .de and 1 month ago the bottom speaker stopped working. I did the factory reset how I saw on the comunnity and nothing changed. I asked the community support what should I do and on their advice, I contact the seller trough Amazon platform.\nThe seller told me to contact 1:1 technician chat or call and if it s not working they will tell me all the details to send it back to repair/replace because my warranty is available.\nThey gave me a link but all of the steps are like a continuous loop because it s just taking me back to the beginning or to ask comunity.\n\nAny help, please?",
