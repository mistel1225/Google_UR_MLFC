    "content": "I want to prevent my cellular phone to turn of my lights at my house when I am at a friends house and he send the command \"Ok Google Turn Of Lights\", to his google assistance. There should be no reason why another user can control my  home devices with google assistance on my mobile device. As my mobile device not only controls lights, it also controls both of my garage doors. This should get fix as soon as possible. I should only be able to talk to my google assistance on my mobile phone and send commands to open doors or turn off lights.",
