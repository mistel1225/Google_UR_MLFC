    "content": "recently the phone has had short frozen moments with typing msgs, then today the camera said the lens was blur, and while i was trying to send a picture from the camera section, it crashed. Black screen.\nwhen i hold the on button for 30 secs, Google sign comes on, the G, then crashes again. Now if I hold for 30 secs, only Google sign comes on, then screen goes black again. This is my first expensive phone, bought 3 years ago new. I'm very disappointed and would like to know what to do to resurrect it. :(",
