    "content": "Hi,\nI used to pay with my phone until this morning when the phone didn't react beeing close to the paiyment terminal.\nI tried with an NFC tag, and I can read it, but the tag has to be pushed against the phone.  This was not the case yesterday, the tag was recognized as from 1 or 2 cms away from the smartphone.\n\nWhen I put my bankcard against the Pixel, it does not react like it did before, what could be the problem ?\n\nCheers, \n\nYves\nPixel 3 - Android 10 - Buid QP1A.191005.007",
