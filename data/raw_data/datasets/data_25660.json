    "content": "Hi! After updating to Android 10 all alarms (especially google's) are skipping if the screen is locked. All notifications are on. All sounds are on their places and \"do not disturb\" is off. If the screen isn't locked alarm works in it's normal condition, but how may I wake up in the morning?) Thanks for responding!",
