    "content": "I have had my Google Pixel 2 for seven months.  Today, my screen died.  I picked up my phone and it was black.  I tried restarting it and but it did not resolve my issue.  One of the first times I tried, my screen showed tiny green lines in the upper left hand corner but was black every time afterwards.  The phone still works with the bluetooth in my car and if I know a call is coming in (I call my phone) I can answer it.  The phone was still powered on and sometimes the haptic works.  I have tried resetting the phone but nothing comes up on the screen.  I have removed the case and tried restarting and resetting the phone (power and lower volume buttons for a minimum of 8 seconds).  I have tried plugging it in for 10 minutes and then trying again.  The phone is still black.",
