    "content": "I sent a group Zoom meeting invite message out 4 days ago and had no problem.  But today my invite won't go out; it keeps saying \"unsupported.\"  I tried clearing the cache and restarting and even sending the message as plain text, but still no luck.  The Zoom website says there was a 'New Release' sent out 3 days ago - could that effect it?  Even so, how do I fix it?",
