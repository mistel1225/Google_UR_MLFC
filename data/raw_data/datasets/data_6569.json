    "content": "Randomly, the sound totally disappears. It becomes impossible to hear when I receive a message or phone call, and I have no sound when I play music or radio.\nVery occasionally the sound comes on but most of the time it is off.\nI searched the internet and apply the usual solutions such as turning Bluetooth off, making sound sounds are enabled, etc., But I cannot resolve the issue.",
