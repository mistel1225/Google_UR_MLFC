    "content": "My pixel2XL is silent once I leave known wifi. I believe I accidentally set the Rules feature on and I can't figure out how to undo it. Everything I see under rules is about enabling wifi which I have clicked on but I see no way to disable the whole feature and just go back to the way things were. I need my phone to ring and have audible text alerts.",
