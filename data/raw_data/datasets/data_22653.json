    "content": "Every time I go into contacts, my Pixel 3A keeps putting up a 'contacts keeps stopping' notice which is impacting on being able to put in numbers, call people accurately and use systems that require you to input numeric codes. If I click close app, it doesn't help. It has only started in the last few days - I have tried force stopping it, but I can't uninstall as it is key to the device. Help!",
