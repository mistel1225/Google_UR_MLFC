    "content": "Not sure if this coincides with the recent Android update, but I started having problems sending group messages via the Messages app after restarting my phone this morning. Sending individual messages seems to work fine.\n\nI'm also seeing the same behavior on the desktop app. Has anyone else experienced this?",
