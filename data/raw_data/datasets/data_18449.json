They have given her the runaround day after day after day. Her case has been escalated to 5 different teams, yet no one can tell her where her replacement is. They always want 48 hours, yet no one ever gets back to her. She lives alone and has no phone.  How is it that every other company has people available to call, yet Google can only communicate over a chat due to Covid? Ridiculous!",
