    "content": "I've been using the clock app bedtime function to play music for a set time via YouTube music. Over the past week, it has stopped turning the music off at the end of the set time. It doesn't even stop at the end of the album I have set and will continue playing indefinitely until I wake up and turn it off manually.",
