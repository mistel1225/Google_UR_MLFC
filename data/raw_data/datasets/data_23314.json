    "content": "I used to use Safe Text Auto app on my original pixel phone..now that I have a pixel 4 XL that app is no longer available apparently. I just purchase the premium version of Auto message on the app store and it's not intuitive to use. Thoughts? I need to let people know I'm unavailable while I'm on the phone with another client.. either thru text or through voice. Thx!",
