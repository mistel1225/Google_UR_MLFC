    "title": "My Pixel 3 keeps freezing and crashing. Sometimes the screen stops working correctly, it wont let me touch certain place or just stops working all together. It is very lagy like im over using it. This is a refurbished phone i have factory reset it a few times. Nothing seems to help. I use Pokemon Go the Camera, Gmail Facebook, no gaming just everyday type stuff. Im thinking about returning it because the issues are just so frustrating. Id like to keep it but, it needs to be fixed somehow. Please Help!",
