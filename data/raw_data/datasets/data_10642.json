    "content": "Trying to get support, I'm encouraged to reboot and then reconnect to the same chat agent \"I'll be here waiting\" he said. Then the app won't let me reconnect to chat, probably due to my open ticket. This is ridiculous. Also, your little paper clip thing here does absolutely nothing. This support is for the birds.",
