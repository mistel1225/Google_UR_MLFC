    "content": "Pixel 3a randomly goes to a screen that requires a password. My google password doesn't work. Every time I enter the password it says 'you've entered the wrong password 25 (or however many) times, then counts down 30 seconds before it prompts me for the password again. Nothing gets through to the phone - no texts, calls, anything. FIND MY PHONE doesn't work because it can't connect with the phone. When I restart, the same thing happens \"password required after restart\". This has happened twice and the ONLY solution was a factory reset which is crazy!!!  HELP!!!",
