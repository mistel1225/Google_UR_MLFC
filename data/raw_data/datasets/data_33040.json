    "title": "Brand new pixel 3XL unable to identify my SIM card (AT&T)",
    "content": "I have tried rebooting the phone numerous times, have updated all Android updates so it is up to date, have tried resetting my network settings, and have also tried re-seating the SIM card numerous times, all to no avail. I also have a second phone with a nano SIM card, and try to put that in my pixel 3XL to see if it worked, and it did not. Both SIM cards I tried to use work just fine in my other phones.\n\nI ended up opening a chat session with a Google support Tech, where they ran through all of the above troubleshooting steps, and ended up opening a case for me and said someone would reach out to me by email. The problem is I never received any sort of confirmation in my email that a case was opened, and have no sense of when I should expect someone to reach out to me. I bought the phone on Amazon, so I don't have a store that I can take it to to get any support for it.\n\nDoes anyone know what might be the the best place to go from here? I can't seem to find a support phone number to figure out what my case number is, but it should be tied to my Google account so I don't think it should be hard to find if it was opened, but at this point my phone doesn't work and have no idea if there's an active case going on to help get this resolved.",
