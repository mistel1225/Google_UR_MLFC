    "title": "Pixel 4 New Assistant - Send SMS unusable - no ability to change/confirm",
    "content": "Hey Google - send an SMS to [my contact] - \nit says, 'what's the message' , and then lookout - whatever it hears, and whenever it decides to stop, you will have an SMS sent, just like that. It could be totally opposite of what you intended. \nI've found no way to change that? Really?  Even asking this assistant how to change its own behavior brings results about the old assistant ! (that don't work of course).\n\nThis is the 'New Assistant' and I really can't find much at all about it - it doesn't appear as an app, and everywhere within Google sites about assistant, as well as most external sites, the 'old assistant' is what's described.\n\n(I even tried Google support - and the stupid outsourced(?)/offshore help knew less than me - I gave up because he didn't know how any Google assistant worked! Unbelievable!)",
