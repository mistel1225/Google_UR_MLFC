    "content": "So I want to screen record a game (Mortal Kombat) is records but without audio even though I have selected in device audio. I had the same problem with Call of Duty and Tik Tok, but now I can screen record with them with audio, so is it a matter of time until the audio can be recorded on Mortal Kombat or can I do something right now.",
