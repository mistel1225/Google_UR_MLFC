    "content": "A year ago we had a close call w a tornado at night and the alert didn't vibrate until 6am when my DND is scheduled to turn off. My wife and both have Pixel 3s and we had a support agent got thru a complex work-around to make this work. It's severe weather season again and I'm back to getting the alerts at 6am again. I'd like to get the alerts in realtime so I can get to the basement vs. at 6am afterwards. \n\nI can't be the only one that wants to be disturbed if a tornado is on top of my house. ðŸ™ƒ. Feature request?",
