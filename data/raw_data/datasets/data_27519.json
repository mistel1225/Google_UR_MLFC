    "content": "Hi, I recently ran into an issue when I open the camera app or any other camera related app that unless I get really close to an object the camera will not focus on said object. Like I will get the \"move away to focus better\" pop up and when I move the phone away from the object it loses focus. Is this a new issue?  I have tried to clear the storage/cache, as well as restart in safe mode, and I just factory reset my phone. Should I wait for the March update before really freaking out?",
