    "title": "How to stop my Pixel 2 scree from sleeping/turning black every 30 seconds?",
    "content": "So I've tried changing the settings on my phone (sleep after 1/2/15/30 minutes of inactivity), and my Pixel still sleeps after like 30 seconds (dims momentarily, then shuts the screen off). It doesn't lock instantly, but will after some time.\n\nI've updated it to the most current firmware and factory reset it at least twice. I don't want to replace/repair the phone, and I know it's a software issue after testing (and otherwise the phone has no issues). \n\nAlso, it stays awake if I'm watching a video (except Desktop version Youtube from Chrome, weird but I don't think relevant). And the developer setting (Screen Always On) isn't a solution as that requires the phone to be in charge, and I also need a timeout of like 2 minutes.",
