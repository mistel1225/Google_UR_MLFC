    "content": "I tried recording a video with my phone , snowy weather shots and my phone died in the process of recording. I have the video on my phone but it says 0 seconds and I tried uploading to youtube and it says corrupt, but the video is 583 mb in size so that leads me to believe it is on the phone but corrupted, is there anyway I can repair the footage? Thanks in advance.",
