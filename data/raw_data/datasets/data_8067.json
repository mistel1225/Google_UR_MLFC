    "title": "Pixel 4a 5G: How do I silence an incoming call?",
    "content": "I want to silence the ringer, but not ignore the call, which immediately sends caller to voice mail. Power button doesn't work. Putting phone face down doesn't work. Turning on \"Do Not Disturb\" is not a option as it takes too long. \"Active Edge\" squeezing is not an option on this phone, and wasn't/isn't a real-world solution anyway as the phone is in a case.  Any solutions out there? Thanks.",
