    "content": "Hello.\n\nAs you might know, data encryption stops being \"enhanced\" the moment you enable an accessibility service. I've been using an accessibility service until now (which I don't need anymore), and I'm wondering how to re-enable the enhanced data encryption after disabling the accessibility service.\n\nI do not want to use secure start-up (it's annoying, and I'd like Direct Boot support). I would just like for my data to be encrypted with my PIN. I'm on Android 9.",
