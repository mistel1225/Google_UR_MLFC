    "content": "Sometimes at the top of my screen while I have certain apps open, the drop down menu bar at the top will show up where it isn't usually and I cannot get rid of it without closing the app and opening it again. As far as I can tell, there is nothing specific that causes it, and I can't find any settings to turn it off.",
