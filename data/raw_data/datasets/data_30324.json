    "content": "Hello, I bought Pixel 2 XL in Australia. Right now I am in the Philippines. My phone doesn't charge anymore (I have done everything to troubleshoot).\n\nI am trying to find the page where I can go ahead and fill out the forms for warranty process; but i cannot simply find the page with a form.\n\nI read online that people in Australia is supposed to send the phone to Hong Kong, which would be even better (and cheaper) for me to proceed.\nCould anyone help me with that?",
