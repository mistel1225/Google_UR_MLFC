    "content": "Playing game, certain fights require pausing game. I am encountering issue where you can clearly see the input is being pressed as the pause button animation (bottom left) is showing I'm pressing the virtual button however the game is not pausing. I will upload a small clip showing this. First the pause is pressed and registers few times, then it fails to register even on multiple pressed. Please help https://streamable.com/bx64l",
