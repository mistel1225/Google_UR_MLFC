    "content": "When I make or receive calls, through SIM or whatsapp calls, I cannot hear anything nor does the other person hear anything. The call just goes blank and the phone sometimes freezes. \nI have also tried resetting it to factory settings, deleting all data. It does not work. I have changed SIM cards too still no luck. \nMy phone may not be covered by warranty but should a over $1000 phone fail in its most basic function so soon.",
