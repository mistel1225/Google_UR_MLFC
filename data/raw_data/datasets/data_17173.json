    "content": "I have two issues regarding my Pixel 3.\n\n1. The battery drains extremely quickly. If I wake up at 7am, the battery is typically down to 20% by 11am, even with very minimal usage.\n\n2. When opening the Settings app, the screen stays white for about 2 seconds then closes back to the home screen. Sometimes there will be no message. Other times the phone reads \"Settings keeps stopping\" with the options for App info, Close app, Send feedback.\n\nI am unaware what is causing these problems and am unable to access any solutions via the Settings app that I've seen mentioned on other question submissions.",
