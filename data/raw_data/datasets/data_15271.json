    "content": "I have tried contacting Facebook support, I've updated my Facebook messenger app. I still can't use the chatheads while my phone is in landscape mode. I will add a link to a screen recording to show what I mean. Please fix this issue soon, if it were a problem with the app itself, it would have been sorted by now. \nhttps://photos.app.goo.gl/vCJTcTCeSLNfmNBT9",
