    "content": "On my phone I have two downloaded eSims. I recently chose to do a factory reset on my device. When I did the factory reset there was a checkbox option that said delete downloaded Sim data. I made sure that this was unchecked and continued with the factory reset. \nHowever, after the device completed the factory reset the downloaded Sim information is gone and I can't find a way to restore the information. \n\nCan someone in the community help me restore my downloaded Sim data?",
