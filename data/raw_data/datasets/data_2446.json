    "title": "Why does Pixel 4a camera scale down panorama images to very low resolution ?",
    "content": "Photos taken using the panorama feature are always scaled down, so that the short side is around 1600 pixels long. It makes the panorama feature useless, as the images can't be blown up or cropped . \nPanorama is a standard feature in so many phones . iPhone manages high res. \nIs this something that can be changed? \nCan I submit this as a feature request?",
