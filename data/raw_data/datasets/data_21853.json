    "content": "I have an old contact and can't remember if I have previously called this person or not. I'd like to find that out before I embarrass myself. Going to \"Recents\" does not help me because IF I have contacted this person, is was months ago and I don't know when exactly.  When I click on the contact information for this person, there SHOULD be a communication log appearing of all the past texts or calls I had with this person, but I don't think Google Pixel 3 has that feature, or am I blind... ?",
