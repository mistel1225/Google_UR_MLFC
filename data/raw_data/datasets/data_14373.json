    "content": "Hi, I am a perspective buyer of Pixel 4A and concerned about the overheating issues with the phone that are discussed on Reddit as well as in some reviews. \nMy question is that if I face severe overheating issues and slowdowns within the period of warranty, am I eligible for a replacement? Also, if the replacement device also performs similarly, can I claim a full refund?\nNote that I am from India and the answer should be specific to the region.\n\nThanks.",
