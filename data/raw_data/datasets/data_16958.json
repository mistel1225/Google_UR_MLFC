    "content": "I have a brand new Pixel 4a. Not even used but maybe a few hours. \nI'm noticing the phone screen pictures are either Beautiful or very lacking. Some are way too dark, too orange, or too pale. How can I adjust the color spectrum myself? Color Adjustments/ie Red Green, Blue yellow Corrections on Accessibility didn't help correct anything. I'm noticing this on Google Play games such as Township and also on You Tube.\nWill later Pixel 4a updates help correct this?",
