    "content": "Pixel 3 is no longer tracking steps. I used Fit. I have uninstalled, reinstalled, rebooted phone, checked the settings. I also downloaded a 2nd pedometer. Neither records steps. \n\nFit has mapped my route. Currently indicates I have 138 steps and no move minutes but I know I've walked a mile plus. Journal shows no activity since Oct 1, it is now Oct 6. \n\nIs there a way to test/troubleshoot the sensors?",
