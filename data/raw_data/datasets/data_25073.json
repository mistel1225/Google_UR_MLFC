    "content": "My Bluetooth all of a sudden will stop working. It gives me a message saying it has stopped working. But this message will keep popping up roughly every 5 seconds until I reset my phone. It will happen randomly sometimes when no apps are open. If I don't click the error message box more boxes will just keep appearing on top. The other issue is then sometimes when I reset the phone it will sometimes take over an hour to come back on.\nThe WiFi issue I am having is where It will lose connection to the WiFi and will no longer be able to find any networks. Even if there are several about on other devices. When I then click on the WiFi to turn it off and then back on it doesn't come back on but just flicks back off. Again the only way to resolve this is by restarting the phone. When I do this all networks are then available again and work perfectly fine for a day or so.\nI have had my phone into the EE repair shop but the issue didn't happen when they were looking at it (it's an intermittent issue) so they sent it back. I have since been back to EE and they suggested speaking to Google direct. I have since taken a video and screen shot of the issues. I will attach the picture.\n\nPhil",
