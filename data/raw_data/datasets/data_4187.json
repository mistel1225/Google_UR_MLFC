    "content": "For a couple of months now my Pixel Safety app will not start up. It gets stuck on the screen attached with this post and will not let me sign into the app (the app did work when I first got the phone, but stopped at some point and never worked since). I have tried uninstalling updates, clearing cache and data, restating the phone, and booting in safe mode.",
