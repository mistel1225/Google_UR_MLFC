    "content": "Hello All,\nI recently purchased a Google Pixel 4a and everything was working fine.\nSuddenly since yesterday my Phone app does not show all the contacts when I dial using the T9 dialer.\nI have multiple contacts with similar names, so if I searched \"Store\" it used to display all contacts with \"Store\" name but now it shows only 1 contact. So I have to type the full name to go to that particular contact.\nE.g I have 2 contacts \"Store VCL 313\" & \"Store VCL 2\".\nWhen I type \"Store\" it only shows \"Store VCL 2\" but just a day before it used to show all the contacts that had \"Store\" in the name.\n\nPlease help it is very annoying.",
