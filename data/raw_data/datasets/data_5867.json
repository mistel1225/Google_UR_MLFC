    "title": "How to remove accessibility icon from Pixel 5 navigation bar? Don't tell me to use gesture instead.",
    "content": "How do I remove that obnoxious little man in the bottom right corner of my navigation bar? I don't want it there and I never selected for it to be there. It simply gets in my way. It gets accidentally pressed and why why should it even be there? I will not use gestures instead, so don't bother suggesting it. Using gestures is out of the question because it gets trigger accidentally when I'm trying to do something as simple as scrolling. And lowering the sensitivity does not help. I simply want the accessibility icon gone from my three button navigation bar.",
