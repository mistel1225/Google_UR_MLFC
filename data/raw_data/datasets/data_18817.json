    "content": "this beeping contunues if the phone is in use or not and is getting annoying.  There are no messages or anything else that might be associated with the beeps, I just get 4 beeps every 10 to 20 minutes.  It's not the same time interval or at any specific time on the clock, just random beeping every 10 to 20 minutes.",
