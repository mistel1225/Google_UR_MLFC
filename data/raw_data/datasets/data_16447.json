    "content": "So I'm having issues connecting my phone to my TV, so I can cast my phone screen to it. \n\nMy Google home detects it, and I can communicate to it via my speaker, but I can't connect my phone. It's a new LG 2020 TV. \n\nThis is the image I get on the Google home app. I can cast my Samsung s8 to it no problem. But not the pixel. Any help would be appreciated!",
