    "content": "Hi\n\nI've recently received a refurbished Pixel 2 XL from google to replace a previous faulty device.\n\nThe new device sporadically starts the camera application when single clicking the power button. It doesn't do this every time and I can go 30 min or an hour using the phone, turning the power on and off without incident.\n\nHowever, when it does exhibit the problem, it'll usually occur multiple times when successively single pressing the power button. This results in the phone continuing to return to the camera application instead of powering the screen off.\n\nI've attempted the following to rectify the issue\n\nStopping camera app, and clearing cache and data\nRemoving phone case\nBooting into safe mode\nFactory resetting the phone\n\nNone of the above has rectified the issue.\n\nI've called Google support, who have advised that I take the same set of trouble shooting actions, and have subsequently advised I report the issue through the settings app as well as post here.\n\nAny help would be appreciated.\n\nCheers",
