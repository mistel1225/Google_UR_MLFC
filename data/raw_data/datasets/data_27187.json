    "title": "No timescales for RMA after Android 10 update killed my Pixel",
    "content": "On Thurs 3rd October I tried updating my Pixel 3 to Android 10. It didn't work, my phone stuck on a black screen and didn't respond to any button presses (including plug in to laptop, and factory reset). \n\nI called Google October 4th and spoke to their support, they told me to send it back using the RMA label they'd emailed me, and that I would receive a replacement within 5-10 working days (16th October latest). I received UPS confirmation that they had received my faulty Google Pixel in their warehouse on Tuesday 8th October. \n\nNearly two weeks later (20th) and I've heard nothing. I've used online chat with support twice, only to be told that they don't have any stock of the Pixel 3 anymore, and they don't know when they will be able to send me a replacement device. They can't provide any estimated timescales either.\n\nIs anybody else experiencing a similar issue? It's 4 days since the maximum latest replacement delivery deadline, I'm not getting any specific information from Google and it's incredibly frustrating. I've contacted the Google Support email several times and receive a semi automated response saying their specialist team 'are looking into it'. \n\nI loved my Pixel, but I'm so put off by this whole experience I just want a refund so I can buy a different phone and forget it happened. In terms of consumer rights is this something I'm entitled to? Rather than waiting in a phone-less limbo...\n\nAny help or advice would be much appreciated.\n\nGem",
