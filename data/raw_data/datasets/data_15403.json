    "content": "Has this issue been previously solved? The blue stripes on edges of my Pixel 3 showed up after nearly 1 year use. I would like to know if this can worsen throughout time or not (I wouldn't like to waste my time for RMA). \n\n• The blue stripes are visible only on hard light.\n\n• The blue stripes are not visible in the dark when the display is on.\n\n• The blue stripes don't disappear when the phone is off.\n\nI tested the display with several apps and it has been responding well. I haven't tried factory reset yet but will in a few hours.\n\nAny ideas?",
