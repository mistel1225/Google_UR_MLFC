    "title": "google and apps not working",
    "content": "My phone has been having freezing issues and crashing with a couple of apps over the past few days, Two Dots and Libby (online library). Today, they won't open at all. Also, google search is no longer working. I can type something into the search bar on the bottom of the screen, but nothing opens and it goes to my home screen as soon as I press enter. \n\nWhen I touch the square button at the bottom of the screen, the apps still look like they're open in the background, but when I try to actually open them, it just goes back to home screen. \n\nMy phone and the apps are fully updated, very recently, and I've tried restarting a couple of time with no success. I've only had the phone for a couple of months (new, not refurbished) and only have about 20 percent of the memory used.\n\nPlease help. \n\nThank you.",
