    "content": "After android 11 update I'm facing a weird problem. I don't know if its me or somebody else also facing the same prob on their pixel 2xl devices. While charging the phone if i want to watch youtube videos i don't able to rotate the screen, not only youtube but also if i want to play some games during that time, sometime games also stop responding. Can't rotate the screen as well. So basically every single time i've to restart my phone when i plug in to my charger to work properly, and after charging if I plug off the device I face the same issue once again. i've to restart again to fix the issure. Is this a bug or what? Is there any solution for this? Thanks in advance. ",
