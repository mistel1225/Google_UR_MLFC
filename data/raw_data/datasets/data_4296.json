    "content": "Hello there Everyone!\n\nI am setting up my new Google Pixel 4a and I went to login to Hulu with my family Hulu account information (which is under my mom's email) and I can not figure out how to do it.  The system gives me two options - \"Start your free trial\" and \"Log out of Hulu\" and when I go to log out of Hulu it just gives me the \"Google Smart Lock\" information and will not actually hold on the login screen.  Has anyone else encountered this problem?  I need to be able to use services not only under my personal email address.\n\nYour help is greatly appreciated!\n\nJenna",
