    "title": "My Pixel 2 keeps freezing with screen turned on. Restarts might work 1 in 5 cases.",
    "content": "My Pixel 2 keeps freezing with screen turned on for 10-15 times a day. I tried all solutions that Google described in \"Fix a Pixel that freezes or won't respond\". At first, restarts helped me, but then it started to happen more often so I decided to return phone to factory settings. Freezings stopped for a few days but then all started again. If it starts to freeze I cant use Pixel more than 2 minutes, I need to restart it 3-6 times to use it again. Phone wasnt physically damaged or been under water, any critical temperatures. But sometimes phone works without any freezings for a day or 2, but not any longer. I dont know what to do.\nhttps://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/6377386#zippy=%2Ccheck-for-android-updates%2Ccheck-storage-clear-space%2Cfind-out-whether-an-app-causes-your-problem%2Cpost-your-question-to-a-google-forum",
