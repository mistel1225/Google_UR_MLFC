    "content": "Hi all,\n\nI`m having an issue where my Pixel 3 simply shut down after I tried to restart it. Several attempts to start failed - the screen remains black and it refuses to boot. So I`m charging it by cable which shows the battery is at 78% and still charging. \n\nI`ve tried the 30 seconds holding power button but that doesn't seem to work. \nDoes anybody have a suggestion what I`m missing, or what another step could be?\nThe phone is completely stock with latest updates installed.",
