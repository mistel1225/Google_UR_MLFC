    "content": "I have noticed that the System Wide Dark Mode under the Display option keeps turning off. I think that i have pinpointed this to plugging my phone into my 2020 Kia Soul to use Android Auto. I have set my phone up 2 different ways - One with the backup from my Pixel 3 XL & one from no backups. It does this no matter which way I setup after a Factory Reset.",
