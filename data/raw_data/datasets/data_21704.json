    "content": "I have a pixel 3XL and I just purchased a Lexuma portable screen.\n\nhttps://www.lexuma.com/products/lexuma-xscreen-15-6-touch-portable-monitor-type-c-hdmi-1080p-usb-powered\n\nIt states that type-C to type-C cable can be used to enable to portable screen as the screen of the phone.\n\nHowever, I'm unable to get the connection to work - I was reading in some reddit threads that the pixel type-C cable is not capable of type-C video output etc.\n\nCan someone shed some light on this please? thanks!\n\n~Weilin",
