    "content": "I have added an external ssd drive to my phone, and I would like the pictures and videos taken on it to be directly saved on that drive - not on my internal storage. I'm interested in filming long videos so I don't want to be limited by my phones internal storage.\n How can I change my camera's default storage place? I've searched and found no such option. Is there maybe an app that could help?",
