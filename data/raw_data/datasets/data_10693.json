    "content": "My google assistant is not responding to OK Google when I am on a voice call or listening to music. I am using a new pixel 4a 5G  with android 11.  I was able to do this fine on my older Moto G7 plus on android 10. Any ideas any one. I love the phone but if this wont work on the pixel 4a 5G its being returned.",
