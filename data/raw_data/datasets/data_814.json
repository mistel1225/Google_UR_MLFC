    "content": "Hi Guys. I got the pixel 3 and had this problem since last weekend. Had a update few days before. No damage or drops to the phone. Can't use he rear camera at all. Can't use the torch as camera in use. But the front camera still works.\n\nI read a million posts. \nand so tired of hearing or reading the same rubbish!\n\nClear cache, safe mode, reset phone, etc ! Wish those annoying people would stop replying to these posts  with this useless information! cause it helps nobody! They don't work!!!\n\nOnly thing I can see is and hope not . It's a way for Google to get you to buy newer model phones. (Just like Apple were doing by slowing down your old phones!)\nGoogle messes with the main selling point of the phone!!! The camera!\n\nwould appreciate some actual real answers. Not from the trolls leaving same wrong info and don't know what they are talking about!??",
