    "content": "My Pixel 2 works fine on every wifi network I connect to except my girlfriend's AT&T wifi. All of her devices and her roommates devices work fine, but my apps won't run on her wifi. It says signal strength is excellent on my phone. I've tried restarting the router several times and changing the channel of the router. Any help would be amazing!",
