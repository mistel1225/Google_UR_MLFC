    "content": "My Pixel 5 keeps changing my wallpaper daily. Even if I choose a photo from my gallery and set it as a wallpaper, it will still change it to one of the stock google photos the next day. Is there any way to disable this feature? The only thing I found so far is a button on the bottom right hand side of any of the stock google wallpapers folders that says that the wallpaper will change daily, without giving me the option to disable it.",
