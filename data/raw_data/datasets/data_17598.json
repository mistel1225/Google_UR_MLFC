    "content": "Ask to answer:\nLots of posts about this but few if any with the answer that I needed; finally got it fixed though. Turns out the earpiece gap at the top of the screen can leak a bit of air and dust into the proximity sensor area making it get dusty in there and block the sensor. Just spray the left side of the earpiece gap with some compressed air for a few seconds and it may fix your problem.",
