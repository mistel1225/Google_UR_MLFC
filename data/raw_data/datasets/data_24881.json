    "content": "I've contacted multiple support agents about my issue. I even factory reset my phone and had some support agent watch what I was doing to try to fix this issue. I just finished talking to a support agent and they told me to go to the forum. My AR mode doesn't work on my phone every time I use it it crashes. I've sent in countless feedback and I've gotten no solutions. I got this phone this year 2019, and I'm overall very upset that this feature doesn't want to work. I have friends with Google pixel 3's and their AR mode works fine. Is it a possibility that my phone is faulty? Multiple support agents already tried different troubleshooting methods but nothing works, this is my last resort.",
