    "title": "How to fix audio from 3.5mm headphone jack?",
    "content": "I've noticed that whenever I plug in 3.5mm aux cable into Pixel 4a, the audio from various streaming music apps (i.e. Spotify, and Pandora) will cut out 1 minute and 30 seconds after turning off my screen. This does not seem to be an issue when the phone is connected on WiFi as it only happens when I'm outside and in my car. \n\nI would love to know if (1) others are experiencing the same issues, (2) whether this is a software or hardware issue, and (3) is there a fix for the issue?\n\nWould appreciate any help. \n\nThanks!",
