    "content": "I started noticing it around the last security update, but whenever I'm typing texts or emails the gboard randomly capitalizes letters. It's usually the last letter in a word but sometimes it's in the middle of the word. I was hoping it would happen in this chat so I could show it but it doesn't not seem to happen in the browser, just everywhere else I use my phone, including the google messages app.",
