    "content": "The phone started to randomly reset and now is stuck in a bootloop. I let the battery drain but plugging it back in to try and factory reset has just lead to it getting hot and smoking. \nSupport is now taking days to respond and is saying the case is escalated but is refusing to provide any insight on a phone that has burned my leg and hand",
