    "content": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pMol9oxIVg\nA display uniformity issue was found in Pixel 4 that wasn't even in Google Pixel 2 xl. Pixel 4 users need to make sure their displays don't have the same problems as me. Google should not use LG displays. I'm Korean, so it's hard to exchange. I want the official Korean release of the Pixel series.",
