    "content": "I bought a Pixel in 2017 and recently started having issues with it not making calls successfully, and if it does connect a call the person on the other line cannot hear me or I cannot hear them. Sometimes if I turn on speakerphone I can hear them but they cannot hear me. But if I turn it off I cannot hear them and they cannot hear me. Sometimes when a call is coming in the phone freezes and occasionally it will restart. \n\nAdditionally the voice dictation has stopped working.\n\nTried testing phone in safe mode. Same problem with calls.\n\nPhone also occasionally turns off and won't turn back on for a while even if I try to power it back on. Also restarts occasionally.\n\nProblems started 2 weeks ago and are getting progressively worse. Not sure what to do.",
