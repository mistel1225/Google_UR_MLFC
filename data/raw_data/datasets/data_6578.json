    "content": "My photos seemed to be disappearing on the pixel 5, Please can another pixel 5 owner confirm that they are seeing this issue... \n\nWhen taking a photo in the stock camera app it takes the photo as per normal, but, if I swipe out of the app straight after taking the photo it doesn't appear in the google photos app. Seemingly the only way to get it  to save the photo from the camera app to photos is by opening the photo after taking it by clicking on the small thumbnail in the camera app. once viewed then it saves the picture. \n\nany one else experienced missing photos. \n\nMany thanks",
