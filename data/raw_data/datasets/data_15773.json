    "content": "Google, the fact that you took away or discontinued the beep after you say \"ok google\" has to be one of the most illogical decisions from Google. I don't know if Google realizes how vital that beep was as it prompted a phone user to start communicating with Google. Now with the beep gone, one has to guess as to when Google is listening now. Also, what if one is visually impaired or has phone in their pocket/purse when prompting ok Google & theres no beep to alert the user to start talking?! By Google choosing this route it has gone backwards & Siri is now a better assistant. Google if you cared what the consumer thinks read the thousands of forums on this very subject!",
