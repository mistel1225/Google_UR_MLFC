    "title": "calendar entries from BlackBerry Content Transfer account on Priv does not move to Pixel 4a calendar",
    "content": "Trying to transfer all of my data, calendar, accounts, etc from a BlackBerry Priv (running  Android 6.0) to Pixel 4a. Used data cable and most info moved over. On the priv - the blackberry Calendar app pulls entries from  3 account (hotmail, gmail and BB content transfer). On both phones, the google calendar app does not display entries from BB content transfer - same for BB calendar app on the new phone.  This info might be on the SD card. (If so, how would I know if there is any other data from the SD card that I am missing?)\n\n- Is there a way to copy the calendar entries from the content transfer account to another (i.e. from blackberry content transfer to my gmail account and then refresh the calendar on the pixel 4a?) \n\n- I tried uploading all of the data to the BlackBerry Content Transfer app -- but that does not appear to be available on the Pixel 4a. That could be another option if that app can be used to transfer data from a BlackBerry to Pixel 4a. \n\n\nHope that you can help. \n\nAroon",
