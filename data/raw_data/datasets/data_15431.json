    "content": "My SiriusXM app keeps crashing when I'm connected to a BT speaker.  Sometimes it's within a few minutes, sometimes it'll be 15 minutes.  It NEVER crashes when playing through the phone's speakers.  I've uninstalled/reinstalled the app but the problem persists.\n\nAny suggestions on what to do?",
