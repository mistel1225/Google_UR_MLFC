    "content": "Using traditional heapdphones with the supplied USB C headphone jack is a complete FAIL!\nI have had Pixel phones since inception and after the Pixel 2 listening to music, making/receiving calls using the supplied USB C headphone jack is practically impossible.\nTo (re)solve I have tried:\nResetting the phone: issues goes away and then eventually comes back\nLogging multiple support tickets, nothing found, no HW issues found\nUnistalling apps\nRe-start in SAFE mode\nMultiple USB options in DEVELOPER mode\nCleaning the USB port\n...\n...\n...\n\nI can go on....\n\nSupport suggested a RESET, obviously this is not the preferred option. I would argue though that a full reset should not be required.\nThere should be a bug/tracing mechanism on the phone/OS that kills or warns of a HW malfunction or a SW issue. \nThe fact that this issue is on/off (i had it come and go in my Pixel2 XL and now 3XL) makes the quality and reliability of the phone very questionable. \nA shame, as all other functions are faultless in my experience. Bring back headphone jack and I think a lot of these issues would disappear.\n\nWhat is being done to resolving this issue for the multiple users facing this problem?",
