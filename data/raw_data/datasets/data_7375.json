    "content": "I've tried cleaning my USB C port, and every solution I've found in Google Forums, even did a factory reset with no luck. Phone does charge normally, but is not recognized by my Windows 10 PC or Android Auto compatible vehicle. I've tried other Android devices with same cable and all work flawlessly, except for my device.",
