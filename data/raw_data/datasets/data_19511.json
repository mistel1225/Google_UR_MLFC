    "content": "I have an issue. Whenever I open the Google app it automatically takes me to a new tab in Chrome. Same with Google podcasts and Google assistant. It's very irritating. When I go to my settings and remove Chrome as my default browser I get a pop-up asking to either use Chrome or Samsung Internet. Also I've tried clearing my cache and I still have this problem. Is there anyone who knows how to fix this?",
