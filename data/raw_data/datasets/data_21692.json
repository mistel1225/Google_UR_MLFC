    "content": "I'm amusing myself trying to prove I can protect the internal mics on my Pixel 3 from excessive wind noise when recording outside. I have created a furry cover for the mic on the bottom-front but I didn't realise that the Pixel 3 has other mics albeit I have no idea what they do !\n\nTo make this work, do I need to protect those mics as well or is it just the bottom-front one that matters ?\n\nAny advice/help appreciated !",
