    "content": "Hi, quick question please.\n\nI have a Pixel 5 and the official Google Stand.\n\nWhen I sit my P5 on the stand it states \"Charging wirelessly\", I'm pretty sure it used to state Charging Rapidly. \n\nIf I unplug the cable from the Stand and plug it directly into my P5, it states \"Charging rapidly\"\n\nHas something changed that I'm missing ?\n\nI'm pretty disappointed  if the Pixel Stand does not do some sort of quick charge (anymore) !\n\nI have always had the settings for Adaptive Battery and Adaptive Charging set to on.\n\nThanks",
