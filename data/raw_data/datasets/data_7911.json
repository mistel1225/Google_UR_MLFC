    "title": "Pixel 4 won't charge wirelessly after just 13 months. Lost warranty by less than a month.",
    "content": "Pixel 4 no longer charges wirelessly. I have all Google equipment and have replaced every conceivable part. Charges with USB-C cable without any issues. Sometimes, it starts to charge wirelessly and then stops at random times. Missed the warranty by less than a month. Phone is 13 months old. Battery not bloated and does not get hot. Love Pixel phones but this is redic. My 100$ moto lasted longer than my iPhone. If I can't fix, I'm afraid that I must give up on my beloved Pixel brand. No sense in upgrading if this is going to happen again.",
