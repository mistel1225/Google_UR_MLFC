    "title": "Pixel 3 XL Call audio fuzzy, and metallic and sometimes cuts out. Pixel 2 worked fine.",
    "content": "When making called with my new pixel 3 xl, people say my voice is hard to heard, sounds robotic or fuzzy, and it takes about 5 seconds after the call is answered before they can hear me, I can hear them clearly but not the other way around. I did not have this problem with my pixel 2 xl (which was stolen). Tried rebooting the phone, but problem persists. I got the phone a week ago. Can this be fixed? Should I return and get a different brand of phone? My work depends heavily on voice calls.",
