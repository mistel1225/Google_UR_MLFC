    "content": "Hi. My Garmin smart watch (Vivoactive 3 Music) is connected to my phone via Bluetooth (it syncs, I get notifications etc.) but is not listed on the BT connected devices page of the phone. I suspect it has something to do with the fact that it was set-up from a backup from my old faulty Pixel 3. Has anyone any ideas why this is and how I can rectify?",
