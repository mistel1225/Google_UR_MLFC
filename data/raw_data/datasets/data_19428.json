    "content": "Hello, Starting yesterday, my Pixel 2 got stuck in the Google loading screen. My phone died the night before, and when I plugged it up yesterday, this happened. I do not want to do a factory reset, because I have a bunch of stuff I have verified didn't get backed up. I have tried rebooting several times, I have tried rebooting from recovery mode, and I've tried leaving it going until it died. I tried sideloading the OTA file to the phone from the recovery mode, both the build number my phone is currently on and the July 2020 update, and it doesn't work. In fact, the phone seems to reject the latter update, reverting back to the previous build. Please, can someone help me? I really don't want to do a factory reset if I don't have to.",
