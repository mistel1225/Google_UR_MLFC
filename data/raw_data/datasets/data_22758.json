    "content": "I have a company Outlook shared calendar that is not accessible or visible from the Outlook App on android or Google Calendar.  This calendar is visible when logged into Microsoft 365 on a browser and within outlook on desktop.  This issues appears not to happen on iOS devices as they can manually \"add shared calendar\" and search by name. This function does not work for myself or anyone else at the company with google phones.\n\nHas anyone run into this accessibly issues with google phones?",
