    "content": "My google maps can find my location and map a route but as soon as I move 200 feet it says \"GPS signal lost\" and it never comes back. I finally took the plunge, after chatting with an unhelpful google support person, and did a factory reset tonight. What a total pain. An still no luck with GPS. Just as an aside, Waze doesn't work either. Same issue. I want a new phone.",
