    "title": "Why the heck isn't there a YouTube TV app for Daydream VR? Daydream has been out since 2016!",
    "content": "I absolutely cannot believe there's NO WAY AT ALL to view YouTube TV within the Daydream VR ecosystem. Nothing. It's maddening! How could you think up a VR viewer AND the awesomeness that is YouTubeTV but fail to think about putting the two together? I mean, you already have plain old YouTube available as an app. Who wouldn't want to watch their shows/tv privately on occasion? The wife often falls asleep and doesn't want the light from the TV. I'd love to watch the news/shows and not disturb others. \n\nI have tried to open the website for YouTubeTV and watch it in Canary, Chrome, and even FullDive VR web browser. Despite being in \"PC\" mode where it doesn't think I'm in a mobile browser, it still won't play any videos. \n\nUGH!!! Only solution I have to this possible awesomeness is  to hook my Oculus Rift up to a PC that I drag near my bed at night. But the DayDream could be such an easy and sensible solution to this!",
