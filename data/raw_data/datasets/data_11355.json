    "content": "I have sent my phone away and believe that another user has posted the same issue with their product. I sent my Pixel 3 XL away via the Google packing box and DHL label to be sent to Poland. I sent my product on 21st November 2020 and on 25th November 2020 have received the following text.\n\nWe have your DHL shipment (XXXXXXXXXX) on hold at our Edinburgh depot as it contains a damaged electronics which are prohibited on our network. This will need to be collected from our service centre DHL UNIT 2 CHARIOT DRIVE EH28 8PA **This will be held for 30days before its destroyed**\n\nI have yet had success raising my case to the Google support team and was hoping to escalate my case through the community as well if this was possible.\n\nThis is just to keep on record that I have done the best to my abilities to contact Google about this issue and I will not be able to break the law and travel out into another area of the country with a different lockdown tier not to mention it is a >120 mile round trip for me.\n\nBest wishes,\nEric",
