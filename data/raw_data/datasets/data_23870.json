    "content": "I'm trying to use the advertised split-screen multitasking feature of my Pixel 3 but there is no way for me to use it. I've read how to use the feature but it seems like my phone wasn't programmed with the ability to do so.\n\nI've tried opening up the apps page, holding down on an app, and looking for any box that says \"open in split-screen\" but here is none. Is there a way to enable this tool?",
