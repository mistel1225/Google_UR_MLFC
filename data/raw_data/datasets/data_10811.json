    "content": "I am trying to allow access to the portable hotspot from my secondary user account. I have a work account profile on my pixel 5 but am unable to enable portable hotspot. So if I want to tether another device. (Which is a necessity due to poor wifi at work) I am forced to switch to my primary personal account to access it. Wondering if there is a way to fix this? ",
