    "content": "My Pixel 2 is current for system and apps. (Play Store? Who can tell?)\n\nAll the info I keep reading about Nearby Sharing suggests I should be able to find a way to enable it in Settings | Google (though there are several different variations on where it is in there, either at the top level or in Device Connections.)\n\nIt's not there. Nowhere.\n\nAny ideas?",
