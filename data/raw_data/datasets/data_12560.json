    "title": "Still have not updated android",
    "content": "I have not updated my 2XL.  Still running the original software. I get nudge messages from Google to do the update. \nNOPE.\nI must use my phone at work every day.\nMy Pixel is now over 2 years old and I am beginning to consider a 5G capable phone. There is no 5G service locally other than on freeways and business centers.\nIt will not be a Google phone from their failure to get in front of this software mess with many, many unhappy customers.\nThis is very poor customer support that could have resulted in a huge spike in customer loyalty if Google had stepped up.\nMy only recent problem has been unable to download or update apps but there are true steps to fix this just through a Google search. The steps are few and successful to remove and reset caches from the Settings options with no reset required.",
