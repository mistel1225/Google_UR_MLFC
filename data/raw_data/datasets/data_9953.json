    "content": "Pixel 2\nVersion 11  (RP1A.201005.004)\n\nMy phone is being odd, good thing I'm looking to replace it soon, but I would like this fixed in the mean-time. This phone alerts me of nothing. No text notifications, and even more odd no phone notifications.\n\nThe phone doesn't even alert me in any way when I have a phone call coming in. I'm using pushbullet, so if I'm at my computer I will get an alert there, but I have no way to answer it. I've checked the notification settings. Everything is on, but greyed out. Also checked message notifications, everything seems fine there. Again, will see the notifications through pushbullet.\n\nLet me be clear with this, when receiving a call there is no alert what-so-ever. No sound, no bubble, nothing visible on the phone app. If I try to make a call during an incoming call, it will say I must answer the incoming call first. But, again, there is no way to do that. When I miss the call there is no missed call notification. I can make calls just fine.\n\nWhat could be going on with my phone? Google searching doesn't seem to help, it's always about how to turn on notifications, but as far as I can see they are already turned on.",
