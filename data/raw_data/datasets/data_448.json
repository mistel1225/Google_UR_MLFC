    "content": "Every time I take a screenshot, or record a audio message on WhatsApp... or any other action that makes a certain type of audio, it's SO loud. I switched from a Pixel 3 to a 4a and it's very very noticeable with no way to change it...\n\nI notice this was a problem on the Pixel 5 as well but actually got a patch earlier this year, yet it is still an issue on the 4a??? Why was it only fixed on the 5?",
