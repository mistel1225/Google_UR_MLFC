    "title": "Phone App Contacts and Contact App Contacts do not match",
    "content": "When I open my CONTACTS APP. I can see my contacts. All good. \nWhen I open my PHONE APP and select CONTACTS from the bottom right (I have 3 options, favourites, recent and contacts) I see my contacts and all my husbands contacts. This in itself isn't a massive issue but it appears WHATS APP links to this version of contacts, so it messes up my contacts in whats app. for example....Mum is no longer my mum but my husbands mum and so on.\n\nI do have my husbands google account added to my phone but only have his calendar set to synch. So I'm failing to understand why his contacts have synched and stayed there! \n\nI have tried almost everything and seem to be unable to resolve this, other than going through and individually delete his contacts. I have done this before, but when I remove his google account from my phone, and then re-add it....all the contacts come back. I would have expected that if you turn off the synch for contacts it should remove any that had previously synched.\n\nthanks for any help",
