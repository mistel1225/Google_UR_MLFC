    "content": "Since March update (security for existing Android 11.0), I receive no alert sounds, no notifications sounds, no phone ring sounds. Music and music videos play well in speakers and phone caller can hear me and I can hear them.\nJust no other sounds emit from phone. VERY aggravating missing alerts, alarms and phone calls.\nI have done a \"Factory Reset\" and before apps loaded, tried all sounds, none worked before apps loaded. (also, very aggravating, took 3 hours to restore). \nGoogle, when will you push out a fix. I see dozens of complaints here, and dozens more on Reddit and other forums. This is a widespread problem.",
