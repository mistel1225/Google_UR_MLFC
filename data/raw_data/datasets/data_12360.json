    "content": "I have been referred to the order management team to check a cancelled order for a replacement 4a. I ordered a replacement with the code they sent, but they then cancelled the order 5 mins later. \n\nSo far it has been 10 days and I have had no email from them. Device support keep saying they will respond in 24hrs but not getting anything from order management. \n\nHelp!",
