    "title": "Data Connection Repeatedly Resets Causing Phone Restart",
    "content": "Occasionally, the wi-fi connection drops reverting to cell data connection, and the cell data connection frequently resets (and seems exacerbated by the use of Maps). Behavior seems to make the Wi-fi connection reset as well after wi-fi returns. If the data connection resets too many times in a row, the phone will reboot itself. Can confirm that the behavior occurs in Safe Mode while using Maps - data connection disappears and then reconnects repeatedly. This makes it useless in using Maps on the road, since I need to unlock my phone after reset and it's impossible while driving.",
