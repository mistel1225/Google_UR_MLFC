    "content": "My Pixel 4 XL works perfectly (no speed or app issues) until I enable Face Unlock. Depending on some variable I can't figure out, after Face Unlock is enabled my phone will occasionally freeze and then reboot when I'm trying to open it. It could start after a day, or after 10 minutes. It might reboot once and be good for another day, or reboot 3 times in a row and then again after a few minutes. If I disable Face Unlock AND delete face data, it works perfectly again. I've reset my phone and cleared data a few times, but nothing changes the behavior. As soon as I reenable Face Unlock I get the symptoms. Any thoughts? Any advice on a way to better capture details?",
