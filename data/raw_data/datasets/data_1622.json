    "content": "Pixel 4a 5G bought in Feb 2021.\nDuring Cellular Voice calls it Shuts down or reboots randomly. This happens almost every day for 1 or 2 calls. The screen stops being responsive while the call is On then the phone goes off. \n\nPhone is fully updated.\nSensors or connections like GPS, WiFi, Bluetooth etc being On/Off doesn't make a difference. Apps running or not running in the background don't make a difference. Charging status doesn't make a difference. Phone temperature feels normal and doesn't feel warm or overheated when this happens.",
