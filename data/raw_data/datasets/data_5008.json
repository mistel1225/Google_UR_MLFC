    "content": " I recently upgraded to the Pixel 5 and I was very happy with the change until my chat features went out!  Then I realized I was not receiving messages at all.  I talked to the Google support team at the end of January and finally on 02/18/21 I received shipping labels and an RMA.  I had some time on 03/08/21 to send my phone in via Fedex.  I followed up with the Google support department on 03/11/21 and I was told that the shipping labels that I received via email on 2/18/21 were cancelled and I did not use the appropriate RMA or shipping label.  Even though that is the only email that I ever received.  I have talked to the Google support team every other day since 03/11/21 and have had an ongoing case.  I am not getting any answers to my questions and they are saying that my phone is just lost even though FedEx shows it signed for on 3/10/21 in Grapevine TX.  I just would like a resolution to this issue.  My Case ID is 8-4307000031366.  If you could please reach out or let me know how to talk to a manager it would be greatly appreciated.",
