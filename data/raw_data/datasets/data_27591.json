    "content": "Hello,\nIt has been one month that I have sent back my Pixel 3 to google Support after they sent me the UPS label. After asking 2 times the support I haven't got a propoer answer.\nI'm a bit worried about when I will see my phone again.\nIs it normal to have such a long time? This is a first time I see a support that long for a RMA.\n\nThanks in advance",
