    "content": "After I've downloaded Android V11, my Pixel 3 is now randomly rebooting at a frequency that it shut down 3 times while I'm posting this. I've done due diligence by taking off my screen protector, my phone case, then did a factory reset with no avail. It feels like the power button is extra sensitive and I don't know how to fix it. My provider didn't help because it's over a year and my warranty expires. I spent $1,100 CAD for the device and the current situation is extremely upsetting. I'm a Google phone lover and used a Google Nexus 4 for 6 years without any issue. This is an urgent issue for me and I would truly appreciate if any Pixel Tech Support would reach out to me to fix my issue. I wasn't expecting this to happen at all.",
