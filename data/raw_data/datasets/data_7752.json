    "content": "Screen Record function in Android 11 produce video that's out of sync with audio. The audio is recorded in real time and matches time recorded on other phones/cameras, the video is completely out of sync with variable frame rate (sometimes 45 fps sometimes 32.01 fps etc), and video seem to skip any google assistant result page recorded.\n\nI recorded a video to demonstrate these problems: https://youtu.be/BUaJ6UzHKqA\n\nTLDR: Android 11 Screen record, audio is good, video out of sync.",
