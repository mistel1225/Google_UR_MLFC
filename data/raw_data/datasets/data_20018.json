    "title": "Google Pixel 2 - won't send texts to short numbers",
    "content": "I have a Google pixel 2 and for some reason I cannot get it to text short numbers. For example the cable company text me and I need to confirm my appointment, and reply with yes, but the phone blocks a message. This happens for all providers that text me from a short phone number to confirm appointments, notification of things, etc... I can't seem to find in the settings how to adjust this.",
