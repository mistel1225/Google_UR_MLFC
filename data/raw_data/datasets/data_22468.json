    "content": "I noticed that my phone picks up dust relatively easy. I don't mind this, but the concerning thing about this fact is that the dust gets inside the crevice between the screen and the sidepanels. I have attached a photo to show this.\n\nDoes your pixel 4 phone also have this issue? Have you witnessed any technical problems with regards to dust?\n\nI know that pixel 4 is IP68 rated (dust shouldn't get in) but I still can't help but overthink of the involvement of dust in a crevice on a phone, that is SURPRISINGLY existent.\n\nEngineering team, please give advise.",
