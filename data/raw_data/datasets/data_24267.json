    "content": "Does the Pixel 3 have some type of notification LED?  I'm getting varying answers.  I know the Pixel 3A does not have one.  I've heard that there are some apps that can produce some type of notification LED on the Pixel 3 using the front facing camera lens or something like that.  Would like to get a definitive answer so asking here.  Thanks.",
