    "content": "I bought an external mic for my 3a XL, but it does not seem to be working. \n\nSometimes I see a little option in the camera to use an external mic and sometimes it does not pop up.  Even when it does pop up and I select external mic it still is not working and my audio is exactly the same as if I was using the built in mic.\n\nA quick Google search revealed quite a few issues with the mic, but I could not find anything to help me get it to work.  \n\nIf you have any tips or ideas I would greatly appreciate them.  Thank you!",
