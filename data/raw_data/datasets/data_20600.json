    "content": "I have a line of what I can only describe as either screen burn or dead pixels appear on the right had side of the screen when I took my Pixel 2XL off charge this morning. \n\nI've tried factory reset etc but it's still there. It doesn't show when the screen is locked or when the phone is powering on, only when the phone is unlocked. \n\nSee attached picture. \n\n\n\n\nAlso there is no option to post this as an issue with the Pixel 2XL, only option was for Pixel 2.",
