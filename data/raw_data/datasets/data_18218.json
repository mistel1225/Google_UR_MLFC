    "content": "So, I got my phone repaired for the microphone issues which occured after Feb, 2020 security patch update and the screen burnin issue which appereared just after one year of purchase of my device Google Pixel 2XL. I did not really worry about the screen burnin as it was at the bottom part of the screen and most of the times it was not visible, i was used to it. but since I had sent my device to service factory Mumbai, India for microphone issue I thought I might as well get the screen fixed as my device was in warranty and after 22 days of long wait and multiple follow ups and Emails i got my device back, But the new screen that was replaced is worse. On lowest brightness levels it shows that the bottom part is darker than the top portion and its got dark-bright patches which is visible on applications like Gmail or Instagram with a dark background. So just after a day I decided to send it back however the B2X team says they found no faults in the device. there are issues with the screen which I also shared the pictures of or i'm not crazy to send the phone back because there is no fun in staying with a spare phone. Google this is disgraceful. @Google-India-Escalation",
