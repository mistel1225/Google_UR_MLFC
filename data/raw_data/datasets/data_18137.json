    "content": "My pixel 3a XL stopped accepting a charge yesterday. \n\nI have tried multiple cables, multiple sources of power including 3 wall chargers and a laptop. I have tried starting it in safe mode. I tried cleaning the charging port.  \n\nI had a little success where it would charge while off yesterday. But then the phone started turning itself on every time I would plug it in. \n\nMy current guesses - recent update problems? Charging port issues? The fact that it turns itself on while plugged in, won't do that while not plugged in, and yet still doesn't recognize its plugged in to charge, is really weird.",
