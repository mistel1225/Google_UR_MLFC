    "content": "I have been facing a random shutdown on my Pixel 3a xl phone despite performed all the trouble shooting steps including the safe mode and factory reset. This issue is annoying and because of this I am missing lot of important calls.  I am looking forward to either replace the phone or full refund of money from Flipkart but they keep on rejecting my return request. Please help me to get this replaced or refunded.\n\nThanks,\nMadhu",
