    "content": "I've got kind of a weird concern. I’m in the U.S. and I just received an unlocked Pixel 4a that I ordered on Amazon (and I made sure to order one that had “ships from and sold by Amazon.com” listed).\n\nI just turned the phone on to do initial setup and after finishing that, I noticed in the upper left corner it had “VINAPHONE” listed as a cell carrier. Weird. So I open up the SIM slot and there’s a SIM card in there that says Vinaphone as well. A quick google search shows that this company is a Vietnamese cell phone provider.\n\nShould I be concerned? The box had all the normal seals and stickers so I don’t think it was tampered with, and the phone definitely appears to be new and untouched...but I’m a little concerned the unlocked new 4a I ordered is somehow not legit (due to this rogue SIM card being present). Any one have any ideas what to do? The sticker on the box says I have model G025J (which is the model number for the U.S. version), so I’m a little confused how a Vietnamese SIM card (let alone any SIM card) ended up in the phone.",
