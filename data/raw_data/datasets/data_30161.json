    "title": "Photos not accessible in phone folders?",
    "content": "I normally move photos from my phone to an external hard drive connected to my computer, via a USB cord. I use the computer's File Explorer to view the details of the photos in the DCIM/Camera folder on the phone. But when I get to this folder, none of the photos I have taken in the past 2 months are listed. I can view them in the camera app on the phone, and the file properties seem to indicate that they are stored in the Camera folder.  Is there a setting that needs to be reverted, so that the folder contents are up to date?\nThanks.",
