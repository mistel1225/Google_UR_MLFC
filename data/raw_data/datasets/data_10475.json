    "content": " I tried plugging my pixel 1 phone into the charger today and it did not show the battery indicating that it was actively charging...just a black screen. So I took the following steps to troubleshoot the issue (with no luck):\nUnplugged the charger from the wall, plugged it into another outlet that had a lamp that was working (to rule out that the outlet was the issue)\nTested the phone with another charger that I had to see if the charger was the issue.\nInspected the charging port to ensure that there was no dust, and that the charger was correctly holding in place.\nPlugged the phone into the charger again and tried a forced reboot (hold power button down for 10 seconds)\nTried another form of the forced reboot (hold the power button down button for 30 seconds)\nTried another form of the forced reboot (hold the power and the volume-down button for 30 seconds)\nPlugged the phone into a powered-on computer for 15 min, unplugged briefly then plugged back in to see if a red light or anything showed up...nothing\n I thought maybe it was my screen that was the problem, so I called my phone from another phone... no rings, straight to voicemail. \n\n If anyone has any idea on what might be wrong, if there is a solution...I'm all ears!\n\nThanks",
