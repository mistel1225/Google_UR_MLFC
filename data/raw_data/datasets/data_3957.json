    "content": "Recently I noticed that if I'm playing some music while the screen is off, when I try to turn up or down the volume quickly by long pressing the volume buttons, it doesn't work. Instead the phone thinks that I only pressed the button once and will react by adjusting the volume by a small amount. I didn't notice this until today and thought maybe this was a feature to stop accidental presses if the phone is in your pocket, but I swear I've been able to do this in the past. Anyone else noticed this yet?",
