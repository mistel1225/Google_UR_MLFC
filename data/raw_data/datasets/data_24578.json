    "content": "I can't update to Android 10. It gets stuck on the 'searching for update' screen for hours. I see advice saying to reset my device to factory settings, but I can't do that as I can't sync my account to google drive, I think because I don't have Android 10. Any help would be greatly appreciated.",
