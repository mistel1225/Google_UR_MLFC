    "content": "My Pixel 3 regularly (a few times per day) freezes with some app, or often system UI, displaying the message 'not responding' and the phone either has to be shut off and restarted, or wait a while until the problem goes away. \n\nI have not identified a particular app as a problem, and it's definitely more than one, but the most common are when using the camera, auto-rotating the screen (either in the camera or with an app) and the system ui. \n\nI was hoping that this would be a software fix, but I'm all up to date and it still happens frequently. \n\nIt is under warranty, but would like to check first and I'd rather not be without while it's getting fixed.",
