    "content": "Hi there,\n\nSome back story. I work for a company who purchased a Pixel 4 device for an employee who has since left the company. I have the proof of purchase showing that we own the device. Unfortunately, the employee did not log out of their account prior to leaving the company, and as such since we reset the device we cannot get access to it to re-deploy it to another user.\n\nPreviously I have contacted Google regarding removing the activation lock, and was essentially told that they cannot remove the lock and that I need to log into the last used account on the device. The issue is that we do not have that information, and have no way of getting that information.\n\nLike I said, I have proof of purchase (an invoice from our carrier) proving that we own the device, but I'm stuck in a loop here. While I understand it's not the same, Apple was able to successfully remove activation locks on devices that we were able to prove we owned the device, and I'm hoping Google can do the same.\n\nI'm not expecting anybody to unlock the device here, simply I'm looking for the best way to contact somebody at Google to help with getting this unlocked as the chat support hasn't been very helpful.\n\nThank you",
