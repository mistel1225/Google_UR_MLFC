    "content": "I've been using my Airpods 2 for months now with my Pixel 4 XL and relatively no issues. But ever since I upgraded to Android 11 I've been having these issues:\n\nFrequently get randomly disconnected.\nWhen connected, volume cannot be changed (remains at the same level or comepltely mute).\n\nAnd this is happening to my Airpods only, I keep having to upair-pair every time. No issues with my car bluetooth.",
