    "content": "Hi, on my other Android phone, my Bluetooth headphones icon on the top of my phone will be a earpiece icon with a power indicator to tell me conveniently how much power my headphones has. Is there a way to indicate this for Google Pixel 3a? All I see is a Bluetooth icon showing that the device is connected, which doesn't do much. At first, I thought this was just the phone telling me Bluetooth is on.",
