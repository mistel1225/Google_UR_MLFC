    "content": "My Pixel 4xl (running Android 11) resets constantly whenever Mobile data is enabled. I woke up in the morning (obviously not using my phone for hours) to find a message in very fine print across the top of my phone recommending I perform a factory reset. I chose not to and discovered my phone would constantly reset within 90 seconds or less after each reset. If I disable Mobile data, it stops resetting but it is basically not a phone anymore, since there is no WiFi or cellular service. Just disabling the WiFi does not help. Also, if I enable WiFi with Mobile data disabled, it continues to reset.",
