    "content": "Ok so what I want to achieve is a way to use my previous pixel device that still has unlimited and unmetered full quality back ups for photos.\n\nIs there a simple way to sync specific folders from my pixel 4 to a pixel 3/2 device, preferably using NFC or wifi direct (for fastest possible transfer speeds)\nData usage incurred by transferring the pixel 4's media files to older pixel is not a problem for me.\n\nExtra info that may come into play\nI have both devices within 5 metres of each other and the older devices is connected to the pixel 4's hotspot whenever wifi internet is unavailable. And if it is they are connected to the same network.\n\nAll accounts on both devices are logged into the same user.\nSame Google account logged into both.",
