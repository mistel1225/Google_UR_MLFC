    "content": "I had been canoeing at a beach in the Dominican Republic, and my phone slipped out of my pocket on the canoe in a small puddle of salt water. I had been using it to shoot videos, but when I pulled it out again it only vibrated every time I tried to turn it on, and nothing would show up on screen. When I stepped out of the water, the phone started to heat up, no matter if I charged it or not. The screen stayed black despite my attempts to turn it on, and eventually it cooled down. But when I tried to charge it, there was no indication that it was charging, even though I had cleaned out the charging port of water and checked to see if the charge itself was working.",
