    "content": "I've smashed the rear glass on my Pixel 3 dropping it on a concrete floor, despite being in a protective case.\n\nI want to replace the rear glass but I'm unable to find a replacement part anywhere, I know there are repair centers that will repair the phone for me, however there are no repair centers near me and I rely of the phone every day for work so I cannot afford to be without it for any length of time.\n\nI'd like to replace the glass myself and having seen a few guides on how to do so I'm sure it is something I would very easily manage myself. Does anyone have an advice as to where I can find a replacement glass in the UK?\n\nThanks",
