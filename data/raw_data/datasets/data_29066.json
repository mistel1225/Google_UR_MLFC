    "content": "I bought my Pixel2XL last year around Sept end. But I never realized that the 'At a glance' feature stopped working after a month or so. I have so many reminders, so many flights, buses, trains to catch but never get on screen update like it is advertised for pixel devices. I chatted with pixel team they said we will screenmirror but that didn't work and even after 4-5 constant mail conversation I have not got my problem solved.",
