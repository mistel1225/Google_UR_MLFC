    "content": "My Google account keeps going to the center off the ocean ones I fill in s full address. Does not matter which address, it all goes the same point. And It specifically happens with my Google account, because it also happens on my laptop if a log in. And it also only happens with full adresses, so with the house number. If I only to the street, it works. \n\nI tried all; installing updates, removing updates, deleting the app, logging in, logging out, removing cache. It does not work!\n\nI wish I could call you",
