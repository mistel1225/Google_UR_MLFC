    "content": "I've ensured all updates were made. I've cleared cache and data. I've started it in safe mode and when that didn't work, I reset the phone in factory mode. That didn't work, so tried safe mode again and it still restarts. The phone has not been dropped or damaged. I'm thinking it's a lemon and needs to be replaced.",
