    "content": "My PIxel 3a XL is starting to warp/bend a little. I don't place it in my back pocket, only in front pocket. The warping is going from the bottom left corner to the top right. Screen and device still works, just seems odd for it to be this weak.   I made a video to show it, basically placing the phone screen down on a flat surface and then seeing it wobble. \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtQLuOLlJMQ\n\nT-Mobile said I must be causing it to bend, but I've never had another phone warp on me, was curious if I was alone or if this was a design flaw in the device.",
