    "content": "I have a do not disturb schedule set from 10 PM to 7 AM. Do not disturb consistently turns on at 10, but sometimes it will fail to turn off in the morning and never turn off again. I'll finally realize it's still on days later and discover I missed an entire week of phone calls. This has actually cause me problems at work since I miss calls from my coworkers all the time. I think maybe what's happening is that turning it on manually breaks the schedule but I'm not sure. How do I fix this?",
