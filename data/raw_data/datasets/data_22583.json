    "content": "You will notice after a recent update that Samsung's smart lock trusted places no longer works at all or certainly doesn't on my note8. It has previously been working on and off after reboot but now it doesn't work at all. I noticed that when i have previously edited my home location it always identifies properties and their numbers around my home when i move the pointer slightly. Now it shows my current location as unknown and every other location around my home as unknown. This is definitely a Samsung update issue that they need to resolve. All fixes shown online will not work if your device is showing the same, no matter how many times you add your home location, reboot your device etc. Very annoying as this was a useful feature.",
