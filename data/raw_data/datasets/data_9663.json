    "content": "Hello, \nMy Pixel 2XL always disconnects my phone calls after 5 minutes. I read through prior forums which stated that it was an issue with \"Advanced calling\" that was turned on. When I would turn advanced calling off, the phone did not disconnect my calls after 5 minutes while on Mobile data. \n\nHowever, when I was connected to wifi, my phone calls always disconnected after 5 minutes, even if the \"Advanced calling\" feature was turned off.\n\nI have tried to restart my phone, restart on safe mode, and toggle the advanced calling feature on and off. My phone calls always disconnect.\n\nPlease what is the issue here?",
