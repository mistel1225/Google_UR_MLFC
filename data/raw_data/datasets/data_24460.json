    "content": "Ok I'm setting up my phone and this has caused me alot of fustration.\nHow can I back out of window, rather than going to a different window? Also how do you unselect copied items?\nTo see what I mean, try moving folders and files around in a file manager. (I'm using solid explorer)\nIt's a crap shoot to what happens.\nI'm not going back to the 3 buttons as I'm kinda use to navigation gestures.\nCan someone from Google answer if gestures are going to be editable in the near future? If not I need to return this. \nWhat fool suggested to remove the back gesture? Even more what idiot agreed this is the future?\nI'm saying that as a serious user. \nI was so excited, now only after 3 hours I wanna throw this phone at the wall, or just go back in time and use 3 buttons. What a terrible step backwards.\nPlease unlock gestures let us choose what is controlled, I have no use for assistant and now it's hard coded in 2 corners, one being the back gesture.\nIf Steve Jobs was still around he'd be marvelling in your screw up.",
