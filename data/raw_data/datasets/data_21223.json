    "content": "Hi! \n\nI brought a Pixel 3 XL from a Google Store in the US to Colombia. I have tried different carrier networks (locally) and it doesnâ€™t connect to none of them (mobile network signal with an x). One of the local carriers told me that could be possible that this phone has been blocked by the manufacturer... Could you please help me checking?\n\nThanks!",
