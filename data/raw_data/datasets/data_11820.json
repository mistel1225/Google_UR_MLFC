    "title": "Pixel 3 camera updates regarding zoom and panorama-- actually downgrades!",
    "content": "It seems Google has pushed a few \"upgrades\" in recent \"security\" updates which have all been affecting the Pixel 3 camera's user friendliness.\nOne issue has been about the panorma feature now only available in vertical mode, even if you have auto-rotate function turned on. I only ever take horizontal panoramas, and now Google makes me take these using vertical mode, which is so stupid!\n\nBut the main reason for this post: before the recent \"upgrade\", the camera used to have a soft sliding key up and down with 7x the zoom. Now: depending on night mode or regular camera mode, you're only given two options-- 1x or 2x. How is this an upgrade?!  Not only that, there used to be another slide meter on the top side of the camera viewfinder which allowed you to maneuver light/exposure.  Now, that feature is hidden or not available.",
