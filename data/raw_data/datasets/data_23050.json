    "title": "Constant notifications from \"(app) got your location in the background.\" How to turn off?",
    "content": "The notifications are constant, at least 1 or 2 a day. Some at 3am. I've already given these apps permission to run. There is no way to turn the notifications off. When I press and hold, it says \"These notifications can't be modified.\" So I press the gear icon, the show notifications switch is stuck on, I press \"permission reminders\" below it, again the show notifications switch is stuck on, I change the setting from alerting to silent, switch on the \"minimize\" option, and am hoping this will shut it up. Even if this works to make the notifications quiet, how can I turn them off entirely? I don't care to see them, especially since I've already given the apps permission, repeatedly.",
