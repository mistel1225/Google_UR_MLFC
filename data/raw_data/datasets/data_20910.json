    "content": "Attached are the screenshots of my battery life. Device entirely on 3G data mode (deliberately chose 3G over LTE). So do you guys think this is good enough? With WiFi I get an extra 30-60 mins of SOT but yeah nothing more. The maximum I got was 5h25m and that's rare to be frank. Your comments and suggestions are appreciated.",
