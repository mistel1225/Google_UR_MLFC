    "content": "A great example of how obviously swept under the rug pixel 1 users are is that the dropdown for the device details on this post doesn't even have an option for the Pixel 1 XL I guess those devices \"don't exist\".\n\nSo where to start (more like where does it end). Other than the fact that after having two seperate phones with broken audio ( so my third pone finally \"works\") (although now it's started rebooting and doing weird stuff sometimes)..\n\nA) the fingerprint scanner doesn't work reliably\n\nB) it just reboots every now and again which hopefully isn't that awful audio problem again.\n\nC) the battery is already dying\n\nD) it was more expensive than I had ever spent on a phone\n\nE) It's started to feel like it's dying MUCH sooner, I had a galaxy S4 all the way until the pixel came out and it still worked FINE it just need a battery.\n\nF) speaking of batteries I could replace the battery in that easily which is another thing that is just plane worse about the pixels.\n\nI've never felt this abandoned for a hardware investment in my entire life. Very very disappointing. I see people with Pixel 2s failing already in the forums like what is google doing, this is bad for the planet and my wallet wtf.\n\nThey should have a program where people who had to deal with the phones with broken audio get a free new pixel lmao.",
