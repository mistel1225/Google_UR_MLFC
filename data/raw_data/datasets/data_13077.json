    "content": "As of sometime last night, all of my Pixel 5's sensors have stopped working.  The compass, proximity sensor, light sensor, accelerometer, etc.  I have seen several others saying that the same thing happened at the same time, so it's probably a software issue.\n\nSafe mode doesn't help, nor does a reset.  Tried to get in touch with support, but to no avail.",
