    "content": "This is so ridiculous that the Google doesn't even think of his customers at all. Old Pixel users always expecting a new features to be available to them which was launched to the newer Pixel phones. Atleast not all but they can push the new features via PIXEL FEATURE DROP. \nToday I was expecting a more pixel feature drop to my pixel 3a. Atleast Google should push either adaptive sound or adaptive charging feature to the pixel 3 & 3a. Iam very disappointed that Google didn't push that one. \nBut the Adaptive charging is the must have feature to all the supported Google pixel phones. I hope atleast this one feature to be available.",
