    "content": "The speaker on my Pixel 3 a stopped working. There is no dust and I just did a factory reset\n It works if I speak loud into the bottom for Google assistant. Phone calls have to be on speaker phone. Phone isn't even a year old but this is the second pixel I have owned the first being the original pixel which my sound went out. Maybe try making better phones.",
