    "content": "Whether I have voicemail or not, when I do a morning or bedtime routine (only ones I really use) the assistant always says:\n\nWhen you get a second I keep getting your voicemail.\n\nI have not idea how to get rid of this.  I have tried working with the help chat on my phone, but they could not figure it out.  Any ideas would be appreciated",
