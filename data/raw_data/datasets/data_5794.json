    "content": "I want to use pixel4a but i need the back button to be on the right side on navigation bar.\n\nI cannot stand it on left and  don't want to be confused each time i press the wrong button.\nThe only solution i found is third party programs but they don't work properly and have ads.\n\nCan you add this to a new update as others phones have to be able to choose which side the back button is otherwise i will have to return the pixel and find another phone as it bugs me to no end.",
