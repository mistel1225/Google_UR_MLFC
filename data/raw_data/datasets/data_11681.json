    "content": "I bought the new Pixel 4a 5g, I'm charging it with the included charger and cable. It says its going to take over 5hrs to charge from 35% on rapid charge... What the heck. It has the latest updates. Tried restarting. Tried safe mode. Same results... Is anyone else having this same issue with the included 18W charger?",
