    "content": "Finally got the update to 11 today, but since installing I've had constant issues. All apps seem to crash constantly, anything playing music or video freezes and starts again every 5 seconds, even pressing volume up/down halts everything for a few seconds. Tried a factory reset, reinstalled a few apps to no avail. Chatted with support too, they suggested it's a hardware issue, which I find hard to believe. Anyone experiencing similar? Things seem more normal in safe mode, what does that point me to?",
