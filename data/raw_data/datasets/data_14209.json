    "content": "I've been using a pixel 3 for the last 2 years and been backing everything up automatically to Google drive. Same for WhatsApp. Just got a new pixel 5 and looking to restore my backup. All my apps seem to have downloaded but basic settings like home screen icons I was hoping to have copied haven't. Likewise SMS haven't copied over. Is there something else I need to do? I was hoping after the restore from drive has happened my new pixel 5 would mirror exactly my pixel 3. Icons in same place, alarm settings, ringer settings, etc. Is this possible at all? I believe ALL settings are restored on iPhone with iCloud and was hoping the same would happen in this instance. Any help much appreciated.",
