    "content": "I have a Pixel 3. The battery was 1% and when I was going to put the charger in, the phone showed the turning off message and turned off. After that, the phone won't turn on neither show anything on the screen. I tried everything (holding the power button for x seconds, trying to boot on security mode and stuff) but nothing appears on the screen and no sound or vibration happens. I reckon this might be a software issue as the phone it's quite new and it was working fine, I've also never dropped it or something like that. I really don't know what to do.",
