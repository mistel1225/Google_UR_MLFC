    "content": "Having issues with Bluetooth headphones cutting out when I also have hotspot functionality on. E.g. hotspotting from my phone to my laptop, whilst also using my Bluetooth headphones to listen to music on my phone. The headphones will work for a short time (5 min) before cutting out completely. I can disconnect and reconnect the headphones, but the same issues occur. Issue resolve once I disconnect from hotspotting. Any tips on how to resolve this??",
