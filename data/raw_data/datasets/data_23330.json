    "title": "[Pixel 3] Volume increases automatically.",
    "content": "Whenever I connect my headphones via bluetooth or my wired pixel buds, the volume turns itself up while playing music. Sometimes it refuses to go down even after multiple presses on the volume down button (but the refusal is only for a second or two). This happens when I connect the head/earphones and press the power button or the fingerprint sensor to unlock, if it didn't happen within 5 min after I connected the headset and started playing music.\n\nAt this rate, I'll soon be deaf. Any suggestions on fixing this?\n\nThe issue happens with Youtube/Youtube Music; haven't tried other apps. \n\nThanks.",
