    "content": "Phone camera is glitchy, especially in video mode, cam shakes. Definately a hardware issue (can hear a piece physically moving when this happens).\nHappens in safe mode, and with and without camera app updates. \nProblem is, the only support option i have listed is \"callback\" and not \"chat\", and every time i try the call option, i receive an alert \"please try again during normal business hours\" however i have tried different hours throughout the day!\nNeed help contacting Google for a replacement.",
