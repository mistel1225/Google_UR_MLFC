    "content": "Hello there, I believe I have an update stuck in background of my pixel 5 but I am not able to proceed with it as it is always heating up even with no tasks and apps running.\nI tried to update the software from settings but no luck as it says software is up to date. \nI don't know if anyone has ran into this same issue.\nNote that CPU 1-6 are always 100% in use due to this issue.",
