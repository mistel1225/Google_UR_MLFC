    "content": "Pixel 3/Android 11 (but have seen the same issue with 10 before that): I have At A Glance on my home screen (date and temp), as well as the lock screen. The temperature scale is set to Celsius. However, it switches to Fahrenheit AT RANDOM and I have to go and switch it back several times a week - I can switch it back just fine, but no idea what messes it up in the first place, and eventually it happens again. Has anyone else seen this issue and/or knows how to fix it?",
