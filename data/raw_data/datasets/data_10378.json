    "content": "Went to google store after logging in I cant do anything with the bag.  Ghostbuster sign.  Contacted a Josh on 12/10/20.  He tells me his system is slow.  It was really slow I spent too much time getting nowhere.  He couldn't fix that and suggested I buy another from 3rd party so I did (Amazon).  I need my original phone fixed or replaced and I get looped in the online questioning format.  Getting nowhere.  My original now un-useable 4A was purchased on 11/3/20 and not working properly on 12/9/20 then dead (black screen) on 12/10/20.  I need the un-useable 4A returned for repair or replacement.  Where do I get return information other than looping questions.",
