    "title": "My pixel 2 phone is having a completely blank screen",
    "content": "I have tried to turn it on, charge it, connect it to a Chromebook, and all of that stuff. What's odd is that it will make all the noises that it should like phone calls, texts, etc. If I got the power button nothing happens, even for a while. The phone has not been having any other problems.\nEdit: \n1. Shining a light into the sensor does not affect the brightness.",
