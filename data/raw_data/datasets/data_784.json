    "content": "Sometimes my GPS signal will keep getting lost.\n\nMy Location accuracy is apparently already optimized. All my Location settings, as well as Bluetooth and WiFi, are turned on.\n\nI tried to find where my phone allows Maps to run in the background, but I couldn't find it, so I'm not sure if it's running in the background or not.\n\nI tried clearing the cache, but I didn't have anything in it.\n\nI really don't want to do a factory reset, but I'm not sure what other steps to take before that.",
