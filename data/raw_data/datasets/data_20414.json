    "content": "My Pixel 2XL has a white vertical line through the length of the screen. It is still within warranty and so I wanted to send it in for repair. Last time that I dealt with warranty on a Google device (a first generation Pixel in May 2017), they sent me the replacement phone before I had to send in the old device. It seems that the policy has changed now and I need to send in my old device first. This means that I won't have a phone for 2 weeks, which I need for my job. Is there any options available for a quicker turnaround?",
