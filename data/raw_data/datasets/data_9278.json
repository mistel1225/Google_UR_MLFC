    "content": "The WiFi on my Pixel 4 will randomly stop working. I have tried all the fixes I can find on the internet with no success. I factory reset my phone and that worked for a few hours but im not going to constantly factory reset my phone all the time . So I started experimenting with my own fix. I finally found a fix that works every time and uncovered a manufacturing defect in the proccess. When my WiFi stops working I will shut the phone off and place an icepack on it for approximately 3 to 5 minutes. then turn the phone on and the WiFi works again every time. It will work for about 2 days and then I have to do it again. This leads me to believe it is a manufacturing defect. most likely a solder connection that gets just hot enough that the connection separates causing a loss of WiFi. Im curious if anyone else is having a WiFi issue and if they try this fix with an ice pack and if that works for them also.",
