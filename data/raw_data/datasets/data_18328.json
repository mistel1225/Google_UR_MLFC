    "content": "My original charger form Google stops working all of sudden. It starts working fine again for a few days after 1-2 days' rest. And this continues. My phone always gets charged by other chargers. The data cable is also fine, I have tried with other adapters. So I guess it's an issue with adapter. Why does this happen?",
