    "content": "In mid-December I sent my phone away to get fixed under a warranty claim, and was wondering how I can get an update on the progress of this claim?\n\nI received confirmation from the freight company that the phone had been delivered on the 2nd of January, but am yet to receive any communications from Google regarding the matter. Should I expect any communication from Google, or will my device just randomly show up one day?\n\nThanks in advance,\nJoe",
