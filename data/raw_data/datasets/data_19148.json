    "content": "Hi all,\n\nI have had my Pixel 4 XL since launch and up until now I have really enjoyed it. However, every few days all my apps will crash as soon as they are opened. I will then restart my phone, which fixes the problem for a few days, then it will happen again.\n\nHas anyone else experienced this and it so how did you fix it?\n\nThanks.",
