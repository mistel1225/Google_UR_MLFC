    "title": "Has anyone else had trouble pairing the Google Pixel 3 with a Schwin IC4?",
    "content": "I've been trying, unsuccessfully, to connect my Pixel 3 to my new Schwinn IC4 stationary bike via Bluetooth.\n\nThe phone finds the bike, which appears when I select, \"Pair a new device\"\n\nThe bike's bluetooth symbol lights when I select it and the phone reads, \"Pairing...\" \n\nBut then it just spins and ultimately times out. It did work one time, amidst dozens of attempts, but doesn't appear in my \"previously connected devices\" list. I have no idea why it worked that one time, and didn't before or after.\n\nThe other bluetooth device that came with the device - a pulse reader - connects perfectly, so at this point I am at a loss.\n\nIdeas anyone?",
