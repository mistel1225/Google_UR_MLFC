    "content": "Why do you refuse to fix the navbar bug? Google, are you even there?\n\nI can only attach 3 screenshots, so instead of displaying the bug again, here are the community help posts that Google continues to ignore.\n\nI tried submitting a bug report, which was summarily dismissed and I was redirected to the community forums to \"understand the feature\".\n\nBut it is a bug. Two navbars, one non-functional, are not supposed to be displayed simultaneously. It's not a \"third party developer\" issue when I can replicate it on Google's own apps, running on Google's own Pixel Launcher.\n\nI would be more than happy to help. I can replicate it repeatedly. I can submit a wintrace or any other debug info they want. Just please fix it.\n\nI love Google products and I love my Pixel. Is it so much to ask that they even acknowledge a single, highly visible bug?",
