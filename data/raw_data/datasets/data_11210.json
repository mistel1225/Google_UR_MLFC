    "content": "My camera uses WPS button or pin to connect to my phone to download my photos. I have used this feature for the past 4 years on multiple phones and this phone for the past year. Today (Nov 29) it disconnected and will it not reconnect to my camera without a WPS pin or button. This is my only way of retrieving my photos from my camera, and I need it to work. How do I find the WPS pin or button to rectify this issue?",
