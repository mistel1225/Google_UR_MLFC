    "content": "I bought some wipes from the store. I know that Google informed that you can wipe your phone with 70% isopropyl alcohol, but these wipes contain also all kinds of other chemicals. Here are the ingredients:\nAqua, alcohol denat., isopropyl alcohol, dimethyl glutarate, C9-11 pareth-8, dimethyl succinate, dimethyladipate, PEG-75 lanolin, parfum, DMDM hydantoin, chlorhexidine digluconate, hexylcinnamal, citral, butylphenyl methylpropional, iodopropynylbutylcarbamate\nSo do you know if this is safe for the Pixel 4 XL and the oleo-phobic coating?\nAll responses appreciated!",
