    "content": "While trying to create a mini using the sticker app (accessed using the GBoard keyboard), I press on the create button and the app tries to access the camera but immediately shuts down and a small alert comes up at the bottom of the screen saying Need Camera Permissions to Create Minis. I've checked all the permissions, cleared the camera cache and restarted the phone without any success. Not sure what else to do. Any help would be appreciated.",
