    "content": "I cannot seem to exit safe mode. I have tried restarting the device and shutting down for an extended period. I have pressed volume down and power key to restart in recovery mode with the hopes of wiping the dalvik cache but I saw no option to clear cache. I really don't want to do a factory reset. Are there any other options available to me?",
