    "content": "Ive noticed that whenever i use a dark/grey/black wallpaper, my screen starts to show green tint and white lines on top of the display. This happens apperently only on my home screen, not on my lockscreen. I tried using the same wallpaper for my lockscreen and homescreen\n\nand this issue is only present on my homescreen. As you can see here, the green tint and white lines are very noticable on my homescreen but are not present on my lock screen. P.S my brightness was at 100% when i took this screenshot",
