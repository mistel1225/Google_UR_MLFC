    "content": "Hi,\nSince I have updated my pixel 2 to android 11, I have noticed a bug with the now playing feature. After listening to music with different music players, after a moment, the now playing stops working as it remains in pause even if the application which causes the pause doesn't work. I add underneath two screenshots of this bug where you can see that music player blackplayer is not playing any song but now playing is still paused by it:",
