    "title": "Microphone doesn't work while using the Loud Speaker during phone calls",
    "content": "When I am on a Phone call and I activate the Speaker, my microphone doesn't work so people on the other side of the call can't hear me. It works well for Recordings, Voice notes, Google assistant, video recording, everything works well except during phone calls with loud speaker on. I already tried Safe Mode and it didn't work, the November update didn't fix it. I already did a Factory Reset and the issue is still not fixed.",
