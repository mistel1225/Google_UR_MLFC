    "content": "I have been trying to charge my Pixel 5 on my Pixel Stand, and it will not wirelessly charge. When I unplug the stand, and plug in the phone, the power cord still works perfectly. However, once I plug the stand back in and put the phone back on the stand, it tells me it will take up 9 days to charge, and the power just decreases. I have also tried removing the case, and that has had no effect. Any information on what can be done to fix this would be appreciated.",
