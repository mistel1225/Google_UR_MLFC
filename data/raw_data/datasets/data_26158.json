    "title": "Audio mutes itself when connected to aux cable -- grayed out, can't turn up",
    "content": "My phone was working fine until I updated to Android 10. I can play music through Bluetooth in my house, but since updating to Android 10, if I try to connect to my car stereo with an aux cable, it plays for about  30 seconds to a minute before the volume mutes itself. If you try to turn the volume up, you can't, because the control is grayed out on the screen. \n\nI do have Bluetooth in my car, but only for phone calls. My 2010 Jetta Bluetooth setup doesn't support streaming Bluetooth audio--it has an aux input instead. I thought that might be the issue somehow, but it does the same thing when plugged into my stereo inside the house, away from any Bluetooth signals. \n\nI've tried restarting, tried different aux cables, tried plugging it into my home stereo through an aux cable, I even did a factory reset of the phone. Nothing. \n\nAlso does the same thing when I try to play YouTube videos, which has nothing to do with the aux cable. I can't get audio on ANY YouTube video. \n\nDoes anyone have any insight into the issue? Anything? Google support just told me to restart. Gee, thanks, guys.",
