    "content": "Your search - Google Pixel 1 stuck on bootload randomly after working perfectly fine. I left it for a few hours and eventually it randomly started working again when it gave me a low battery notification. I let it charge to 60% and started using it, 3 minutes later it crashed and went back into the bootloop. I am able to get it into fastboot mode by holding the volume down button but when I try go into recovery mode, it just goes straight back into bootloop",
