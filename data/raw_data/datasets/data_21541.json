    "title": "Casting Issues post April Android 10 Update",
    "content": "After updating my Pixel 2 XL yesterday to the new Android 10 security patch update, my phone will not cast to my Chromecast or Google Home Mini. I am operating on the same network. My other devices will cast. My Google Home App shows the cast devices but tells that they are unavailable. The cast button does not show any devices to cast to. I can only assume that this issue is related to the update. Does anyone know how I can resolve this?",
