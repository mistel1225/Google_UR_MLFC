    "content": "Since yesterday (October 13th) The battery on my Pixel 2 has been draining ridiculously fast, and it feels warm. I've searched all the forums and haven't been able to resolve my issue. I went through the troubleshooting on my phone and didn't and it didn't detect any problems. I cleared the cache on Google Play Services, and I refreshed my APN settings, still no dice. I tried to contacting Google support through my troubleshooter, and it keeps running into a problem whenever I try to chat or call. Where do I go from here?",
