    "title": "In Google Maps GPS Mode (Driving Mode) Assistant Doesn't Work For Some Things",
    "content": "When I'm in GPS mode (edit: Driving Mode) and I tell Google Assistant to \"Set Home Thermostat to Heat,\" a command which works when I'm not in GPS mode, Google Assistant icon looks like it's activated and moves around, but nothing happens, and my home thermostat is not set to heat.  I have to exit out of GPS mode and go to my home screen, and place the voice command there, while the GPS window is minimized showing only a small preview of the GPS screen.  Not an ideal thing to do while driving.  Prefer to just put the voice command while in GPS mode.  I had the same problem as well with the Pixel 1 as I'm having now with Pixel 5.  The Google Assistant in GPS mode seems to work for things like adding another stop to the route.",
