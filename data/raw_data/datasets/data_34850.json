    "content": "When plugging the phone in, it immediately crashes to the 'battery' screen.  It will restart by pressing and holding the power button, and come up, but will occasionally restart immediately.  It seems related to the initiation of the rapid charge sub-system.  \n\nThis started after the January 5th update.   The phone has been isolated, apps removed.  The phone has been set back to factory default.   The phone has been updated to the February update and reset.  Every single time is is plugged into a Google charger, or any USB-C power source it immediately shuts down.    \n\nThe port has been totally and completely cleaned of any & all debris.  \nThe phone has been factory reset.  \nEverything has been tried.   \n\nGoogle, time to step up to the plate on this or your following will choose competitors for their reliability. This is a software bug introduced by your updates.  This is not an isolated issue, even your search engine autofills the \"Pixel 2\" + \"crashing when charging\" now!  Fix it or face consumer wrath.",
