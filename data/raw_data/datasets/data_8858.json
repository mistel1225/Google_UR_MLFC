    "content": "I was using my phone this morning. But As I arrived to work it became unresponsive. Completely black screen, no lights, wont connect to a charge, no heat coming off. It's a complete brick. I've tried leaving it on the charger for hours. Holding down combinations of power button and volume buttons. Nothing. \n\nI tried connecting it to the computer, nothing. \n\nAt this point I want to get it taken apart. This has never happened to my devices before.",
