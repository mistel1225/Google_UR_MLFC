    "content": "I'm trying to make widgets on my 4a like the ones I had on my previous Motorola phone. I want one that goes right to my connected bluetooth devices and one that goes to display settings. But I can't figure out how to make this happen. I press on the home screen and select Widgets, then select the Settings shortcut and drag it to the screen, then it shows me all the settings options and I press on one, then everything disappears and no new widget is left on my home screen. What do I need to do differently, or is this not possible?",
