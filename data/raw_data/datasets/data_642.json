    "content": "Since the last update to the Camera, Files and Gallery App I have the following bugs:\n\n- When I take a picture the camera app crashes approx 2 seconds later after the picture get's shown in the gallery preview bubble in the bottom right corner\n- Same when I take a video, however there the app crashes before the video appears in the preview bubble\n- Gallery app does not show any pictures\n- Files app does does not show any media (pictures, videos, audio -> all with 0 bytes) -> however when I navigate to the respective folders of course all files are still there\n- In Files -> Settings -> Show hidden files -> Then all of a sudden the media files appear and also the file sizes are calculated correctly. However the camera still crashes / Gallery does not show the photos from the devices\n- When checking the file locations I noted files called \".pending-162....balbal\" and the files cannot be opend and also files with the marker \"RESTORED\" in their filesnames\n- Other apps (WhatsApp, Telegram) cannot show the preview pictures in their respective message windows\n\n- I deleted the caches and data of all of these three apps -> did not help\n- I uninstalled all updates and went back to the base verison of all apps -> did not help\n- I just updated the phone with the latest security update -> did not help\n- I took all permissions and re-granted them -> did not help\n- Build-Number: RQ3A.210605.005\n\nI really want to prevent a factory reset ...",
