    "content": "I've tried to figure out how to disable the \"Privacy Mode\" that activates when the screen is close to something else (the notification says to move it away from my ear, but it's never my ear). It is so annoying that the screen is blocked and the sound good to the headphone jack. I don't need this setting at all.",
