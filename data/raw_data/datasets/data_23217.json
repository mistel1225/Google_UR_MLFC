    "content": "Case ID 2-7015000026190.  March 2 I ordered a NEW Pixel 3. There was a hardware issue and the screen flashed constantly. (I understand now that this is common with Pixel 3s.) It was returned and replaced with another NEW Pixel 3 on March 11.  The same hardware issue has happened and I wanted a refund because at this point, I do not trust this device to work properly.  A refund could not be granted because it was past the 15 days eligibility.  I explained that I no longer trust the dependability of this device because the same issue happened with the 2nd replacement device. I was told that if this 3rd replacement had issues, a full refund would be processed.  The 3rd replacement arrived yesterday, but it is a REFURBISHED Pixel 3.  I paid over $800 for a NEW Pixel 3 device, not a refurbished device.  I called again to explain that the 3rd replacement has not been opened and I want to return it, along with my 2nd defective device, and receive a refund.  She said that she will call back today, but has not contacted me yet by phone or email.  It has now been 3 days with no contact by phone or email from management. Anyone else have this happen? I am surprised and disappointed that Google will treat their customers this way. Why would they dupe me into settling for a refurbished device when I paid for a new one?  Why are they delaying an RMA?",
