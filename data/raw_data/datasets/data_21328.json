    "content": "a few days ago I stopped receiving notification from messages, twitch, spotify, reddit, discord, buzzfeed, my message app, and several other. The only one of my social platforms that notifications work for is snapchat. I noticed my phone get text notifs in safe mode but besides that, nothing. Not sure what to try at this point.",
