    "title": "how to fix OG Pixel XL low charging voltage",
    "content": "My OG pixel XL has a low charging voltage (around 4200 mV) and is also charging slower than usual (around 53% an hour). \n\nI tried charging with multiple Google charging bricks to no change. However, I was charging before using another outlet which yielded much faster charge rates and voltages. \n\nCould this be a outlet issue or a hardware issue?",
