    "content": "Total newbie here and I'm trying to connect my Pixel 4a phone to my Windows 10 laptop via Bluetooth. I think my problem is the very first step - turning on Bluetooth on my phone. When I go into settings, it shows that Bluetooth is on but the Bluetooth icon never shows on the top of my phone (see 2 pictures). When I select a picture in files, I'm never given the choice to send the file via Bluetooth. I am given the option for nearby but Windows 10 can only do nearby with other Windows 10 computers. I turned off nearby and still don't have the option to transfer files via Bluetooth. I've rebooted my phone - no luck. I see the laptop in devices but cannot connect to it via my phone (see picture) although they are paired. I have the most recent Android version (see picture). Bluetooth is turned on on my laptop and you can see they are paired (see picture).\n\nWhat am I doing wrong. Thanks so much for helping this novice!\n\n(I couldn't attach more than 3 pictures - sorry)",
