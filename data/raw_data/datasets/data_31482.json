    "content": "My battery isn't holding a charge well. I have to charge it 2-3x a day!? Does this sound normal or acceptable? \n\nI suspect it's simply an aging battery as when I go look in Settings / Battery - there is no feedback as to what app(s) to restrict.\n\nThe solution posted here is is possibly the most time consuming and ambiguous solution I could imagine. I do not feel that it is acceptable to ask a customer who paid $800 for a device to play detective and go fund which app may be consuming the most battery.\n\nPlease tell me why I that I cannot trust my Google Android OS to I form me which apps to restrict and why battery performance drops so drastically after around 500 days?!",
