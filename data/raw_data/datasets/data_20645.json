    "content": "After the June feature drop which has improved adaptive battery drainage when the device is not being used. It was happy that Google considering the battery drainage problems in there pixel devices. But these tech works sometimes and also true that it doesn't work sometimes. \nIn my pixel 3a before this June feature drop battery was simply draining when iam not even using the device. After these update it stops draining. Although it doesn't work sometimes and battery discharges continuously when device is being idle. I don't know what's happening. Anybody experience or notice this please let me know that iam not the only one experiencing these.",
