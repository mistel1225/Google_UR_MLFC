    "content": "When trying to access \"Tips & support\" in Settings, the page fails to load and I get a prompt saying that Google Play Services has stopped responding.\n\nClearing the data for Google Play Services in Settings temporarily alleviates the issue but it comes back pretty quickly (a matter of minutes) after that.\n\nMy Google Play Services version is 16.0.89. This is happening on both my OG Pixel and my new Pixel 3.",
