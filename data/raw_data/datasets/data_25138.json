I have also told it \"ok Google, call Kurt on speakerphone\" and it doesn't work. Very frustrating.  IT DOESN'T WORK YET IT WOULD WORK FOR MY GOOGLE PIXEL 2016 EVERY TIME. Now it opens the call and doesn't turn on speaker and I see a message at the bottom that says \"assistant can't start when another app is using the microphone\". I click end call and on my home screen, I see that the assistant is open on the bottom but the microphone isn't listening. GOOGLE SUPPORT DIDN'T HELP AT ALL!! I'm completely at a loss at what to do now! Tried screen sharing my device with Google support, factory data resetting, clearing the cache for phone and Google app (as instructed) uninstalling app updates and retraining voice model as well. NOTHING. Please help!",
