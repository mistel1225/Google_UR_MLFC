    "content": "When I am texting, if I type the letter U, auto correct automatically changes it to the letter I which makes no sense when I complete my text. I have to then go back and correct the I's to U's. I took it into Verizon and the employee there told me there is nothing that can be done, it's a programming issue. I have sense turned off the auto correct but the problem continues.",
