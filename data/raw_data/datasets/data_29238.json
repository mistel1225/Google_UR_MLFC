    "content": "YouTube, Reddit, etc works just fine, I am just getting the error for no apparent reason.\n\nI believe this is because I have a custom home network with a very strict firewall. What port/protocol do I have to allow through to allow my phone to \"phone home\" and realize that it has connection to the internet.\n\nFor further detail I have an extended ACL on a Cisco router that basically only allows echo-replies, established TCP traffic, and enough UDP for my ISP to send my router a DHCP address (bootpc and bootps)",
