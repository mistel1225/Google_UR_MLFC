But after I make a whatsapp call, the mic stops working for all the apps in the phone like whatsapp, Google assistant, normal call, voice recorder, etc. When I restart the phone, the problem is fixed but only until I make another whatsapp call. Tried resetting device, updated the phone with latest software patch. But problem persists.",
