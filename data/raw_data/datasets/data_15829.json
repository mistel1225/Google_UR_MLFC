    "content": "3 different fully updating xbox controllers no longer work with my pixel 2 in apps. Only a,b,x,and y are doing anything. Outside of apps, all the buttons work fine. Everything worked on android 10 but once I updated to 11 the controllers quit. Any other similar problems out there after android 11 update?",
