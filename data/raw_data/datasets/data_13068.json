    "content": "My new pixel 4a is unable to read a specific special character that my pixel was seeing very well. The new phone is converting this symbol into a box with an x inside. I have tried downloading a font app to no success and I have tweeked around in all the display, font, text options, still nothing. This symbol is part of my online name therefore it's really annoying that I can't see it or use it as I did with my old phone.(last of the 3 symbols on screenshot)  Any ideas?",
