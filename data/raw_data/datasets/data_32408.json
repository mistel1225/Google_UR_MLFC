    "content": "I have issue with my proximity sensor, used Sensor Test app and it shows all the time 0 cm.\n\nAfter dialing phone number the screen goes immediatelly black without bringing it close to face. It looks like the proximity sensor is malfunctioning. \n\nAfter blocking the phone with the clock option turned on, clock is displayed for a moment and then screen goes black in few seconds without any reason. Same after having it in a pocket, when taken outside it is sometimes completly black. One have to press power button twice to have it back on. Moreover, fingerprint reader is also not responding after taking it outside the pocket.\n\nSometimes it helps when one geantly squeezing top of the phone with fingers. Then the screen goes on again. When exposed to lower temperatures (between 0 and 5 degree Celcius) it can go black completly and nothing helps. When laying it down on a cold seat in a car in a early morning, it just goes black, I cannot even answer a call.\n\nI removed tempered glass and cleaned the screen with a professional cleaner. I also did full reset without any luck.",
