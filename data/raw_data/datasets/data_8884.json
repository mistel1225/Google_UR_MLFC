    "content": "My Google Pixel 3a XL after having it connected through the headphone jack to my car or headphones, text notifications will not make any noise. This is a duplicatable problem. It says Google is muting some sounds in the control panel for sound. The only way the text message sounds come back is if I turn off my phone completely for a reboot. This has been going on for a couple weeks and is really freaking annoying. Anybody else having this issue?",
