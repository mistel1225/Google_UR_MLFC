    "content": "I'm in holidays in Thailand and I just charged my phone while having breakfast. Got to the beach took some pictures and came back to the hotel after lunch. Connected my pixel 2 to the charger and it doesn't charge at all. Tried my girlfriend's pixel 3 to see if was a cable troubleshoot but her charges easily and mine doesn't. ( We have 3 chargers and 3 different cables, all works on hers and none on mine )\nTried everything, battery calibration, cleaned the USB door ( wasn't dirty at all before ) factory reset, hard reset, soft reset , another place to charge,  everything .. nothing worked.\nNow the phone died out of battery and connected to the wall it appears the battery logo with a thunder inside ( making me know it's connected to a charger )  ,  looks it's about to charge, then changes to the normal battery screen where it should start going up and charge the phone but it doesn't. Just goes black screen and goes back to the begining... Goes back to the battery with a thunder inside , swaps to the normal battery screen and goes black again and over and over again ... Left it for 30 minutes hoping was charging but it's not.\nWhat should I do ? Bought it in May 2018 and never gave me any problems. This is the first one. I was on beta android Q , but that shouldn't be the issue because I was on it for 4 days already... And it just charged during the breakfast and just stopped out of nowhere .\n\nAnyone knows what's going on with the phone and if there's any solution ? \n\nThanks for your time.",
