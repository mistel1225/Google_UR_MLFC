    "content": " I have a Pixel 2 and about a week ago my partner said he could hear beeping on the line. I dismissed it but as of today 5 people have said the same thing to me that they hear random beeping every 10 to 20 seconds when they are speaking to me. It is not me accidentally pressing the screen, as it happens also when I use speakerphone. It happens when I am the caller or call receiver and I cannot hear the beeps. Has anyone else come across this before? I have had this phone almost a year but has just started. Thanks",
