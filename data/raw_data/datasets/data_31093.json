    "content": "When I'm on a phone call to someone, sometimes my screen will stay blank. It's very annoying if I'm trying to put it on loud speaker or want to use my phone as I can't access anything until the call has been ended by the other person. It's very random, it sometimes works normally other times it will work if I push the lock screen button a couple times and there's been a few occasions where it's full on not responded and I either wait for the call to end for it to work or I've had to restart my phonefor it to work again. What should I do?",
