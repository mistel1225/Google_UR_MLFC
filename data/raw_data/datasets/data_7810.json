    "content": "I was using my Pixel 4a 5G to view the web. I had been using it for about 15 minutes when I made a loud pop sound, and a small amount of clear liquid was ejected from what looks like the right speaker of the phone. It still works. It's not hot. It's not making any other sounds.\n\nCould this be some kind of battery leak? Or something else?",
