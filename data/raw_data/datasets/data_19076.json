    "content": "Usually while taking picture using Gcam it always shows the \"degree\" if we are holding the device straight or not.But from today onwards it showing wrong inclination of 4 or 3 degree. May any one know the reason. I have already updated to the latest version and also removed the cache memory.  I am also attaching a screenshot from my device.\nThe picture shows 0 degree but its actually inclined.",
