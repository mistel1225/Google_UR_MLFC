    "content": "Hello, I recently updated my Pixel 3a to Android 11 and found that Override Do Not Disturb does not seem to be working anymore. I have a specific contact I would like to override my do not disturb settings and vibrate my phone at any time, for messages as well as calls. I have this conversation marked as priority, starred, etc and in multiple places in settings override do not disturb is enabled for this contact, but my device stubbornly refuses to vibrate when I get a message from this or any contact no matter what the settings are. My phone is indeed set to vibrate under the do not disturb settings and it worked just fine before the update, so I am wondering if there is a fix for this or I am missing something?",
