    "content": "My phone updated today and now my phone won't recognize a swipe up gesture to return to the home screen, allow me to see previously opened apps, or the back button that used to be there. I have tested the screen and it isn't the screen. I also am not able to use the three button navigation.  It's almost like the very bottom of my screen has gone unresponsive but only for navigation. I can still scroll on pages.",
