    "title": "Pixel 2 & 4 security update keeps pausing due to \"metered network\"",
    "content": "We live in a rural area and use 4G connected to a TP-Link TL-MR6400 router as our internet. The contract is unlimited data so it is not metered.\n\nBoth the Pixel 2 and 4 won't download security updates as they say the network is metered. I have set it so \"Treat as unmetered\" in the \"Network Usage\" section of the \"Network Details\" settings but this does not make a difference.\n\nAny ideas?",
