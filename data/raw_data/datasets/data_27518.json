    "content": "My Pixel phone for some reason will no longer stay shut down. When I select Power off the phone shuts down but then 5 seconds later turns it's self back on. I have tried a factory reset, turning off via recovery but neither have made a difference. I am wondering if this is an android 10 bug?",
