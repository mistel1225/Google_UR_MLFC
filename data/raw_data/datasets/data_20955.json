    "content": "I have had the Google Pixels 3a XL for less than a year. I am under warranty. I never had a problem with the phone. All of a sudden two weeks ago the phone would not charge. Nothing wrong with the cable or adapter. To make a long story short, I sent it to Google and they supposedly \"fixed\" it. I received my phone back to find out the problem was still there. That means someone must have replaced the battery and not even check the USB port. Mind you I mentioned to two representatives that the battery was not charging. And the battery health was good. I spoke to a representative last night, and he said he was gonna send me shipping labels and instructions after a half an hour. It has been 24 hours. I spoke to two more representatives via chat. The first one said that it seems someone made a mistake putting in the replacement order. And they \"escalated\" it. I just spoke to another one who said to reply to the email thread which I did and mentioned more than 7 times that no one is replying to it. I am still paying for this phone. This has to be the worst customer service ever. To think that I left Samsung because of their terrible customer service...now look at this.",
