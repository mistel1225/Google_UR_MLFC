    "content": "I've been told many of the Samsung phones have MirrorLink support, but I wanted to buy myself a pixel and be able to use it in my 2019 car that comes without Android Auto or Apple CarPlay. If anyone is aware of a Pixel phone that supports MirrorLink, please do tell, it would be a great help. Else if Google could consider providing this in it's future releases, it would be a godsend!",
