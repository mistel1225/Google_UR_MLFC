    "content": "Hello. I have had Google Fi's service for 2 years. Over these 2 years, I have had 8 (yes, EIGHT) Pixel 3 phones. 6 of the 8 were warranty/insurance claims over the dreaded Green Screen flicker. I am currently waiting on a new replacement at the moment for a broken volume down button, and just today, the screen began to flicker.\n\nIn order for me to continue to use Google products, I need to know; what is the fix that is being used for this issue? Has the cause been identified and rectified? There are several posts here regarding the issue, yet none speak of an actual repair or issue identification. Is it an app (possibly)? Is it a faulty LCD (unlikely)? \n\nHow can I justify continuing to give my money to Google if they won't address this persistent and ridiculous issue. Please advise.",
