    "content": "Is there any way to get rid of this? I always take screenshots with this method and now I keep accidentally pressing the little emergency icon instead - it's where the screenshot icon used to be. Also what does it do? When I press it it prompts me to dial a number or enter emergency info. I'd rather not see this every time I hold the power button to take a screenshot.",
