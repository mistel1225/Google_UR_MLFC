    "title": "I can't hear video call/loudspeaker, no notification sounds at all. Also all videos stopped playing.",
    "content": "I have tried everything to sort this issue but the notification sound just doesn't work which is most frustrating, what's the point in having a phone if you can't hear it ringing!!?? I can make video calls, but I can't hear anything at all and if I put a call on loudspeaker, I can't hear anything, but can hear on normal calls. If that wasn't frustrating enough, the phone has now stopped playing any kind of video, be it on an app like instagram or even from my camera role. Any help would be much appreciated.",
