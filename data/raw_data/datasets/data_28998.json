    "content": "One day I was giving my speaker aux input from my pixel phone. Something happened like a small blast and my aux input stopped working. Later I find that I was unable to make calls and see videos. I tried using other dialler apps but it still isn't working. I was unable to make calls completely. Then I searched on internet I found that my IC must be destroyed so it's not working. I tried other options like using Bluetooth earphones after which I was able to see videos but no one can hear my voice on call nor could I. I just want to ask now if I can use type C earphone of Google will they work for my problem. Can I be able to make calls from my phone again?",
