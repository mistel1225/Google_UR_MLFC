    "content": "i have been facing this issue since the time I purchased the phone. When ever I play a game or watch a video on YouTube. The touch icon placed at the corner of the bottom of the phone doesn't seem to work....I have to minimise and get the game or the video again to make them work. I thought it was a software issue so I factory reseted it and also gave the phone for checking in December. They didn't find the phone and I still had that issue. Old let me know if you have any solution to this problem.",
