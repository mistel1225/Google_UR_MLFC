    "content": "Hi fellow Pixel users.\n\nSince a few days the Location History only takes samples with big gaps in between. Which causes it to miss walks and runs completely. I also try to force location requests using a gps logger which itself uses the (physical) activity detection and Google Fit with enabled location tracking. This worked fine until recently, but also stopped working. So I would assume the activity detection does no longer work?\n\nAnybody notices a similar change? Thanks!",
