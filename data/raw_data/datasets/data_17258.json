    "content": "anyone else keep getting screwed over by Google's RMAs?\nI cannot seem to get ONE device under their RMA service that does not have issues. \n\nMy RMAs for my Pixel 2016:\n1. the first RMA randomly died and could not even be hard reset, within hours of opening the RMA box\n\n2. the second RMA has massive battery issues, including very rapid battery drain and dying while the charge is not even close to 0%, literally an hour after opening the box\n\nMy RMAs for my Pixel XL 2016:\n1. the RMA I had was suffering overheating issues\n\n2. after about a month of usage, the 2nd RMA also had overheating issues, worse than the first (would get up to 43 C after a measly 30 minutes of internet browsing)\n\nI do not know why this is happening, and why the employees at the warehouses cannot check a phone properly. \n\nAnd yes, I was using the phones properly. and yes, I had done all the troubleshooting tips.",
