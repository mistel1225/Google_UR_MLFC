    "title": "How do I silence notifications when on a phone call?",
    "content": "I have no sound or vibrations for all notifications on my Pixel 4a (except phone calls) so that I have to look at my phone to see if I have received a message as I don't like to be constantly distracted. However, when I am on a phone call, if any notifications from any other app comes through, it plays a little audible tone and vibrates to notify me which I find distracting from the phone call. Is there a way to turn this sound off? I'm not sure why they play a sound on phone calls if I have them all on quiet the rest of the time. Can't seem to see this anywhere in settings on found an answer online. Any help would be apprecaited, thanks!",
