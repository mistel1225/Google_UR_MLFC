    "title": "I dont use cloud. I dont like it. Can I turn it off, or will that stop google from refreshing?",
    "content": "I stopped google cloud apps years ago when I was unable to retrieve pictures of friends, relatives and deceased pets, would not allow me to bring them back to my own phone. \nNow, I curiosily looked into the cloud app, after a new upgrade. Nothing was in it but my photos I do not want there, and yet again, cannot get them off. \n\nHow else does sync affect my phone besides unwantingly put my stuff on the cloud? \nI have memory cards that are 5 billion more times reliable. \nIf I stop syncing, will that not allow me to open other apps?\nFor me, cloud is the worse crap created. I dont want my info floating anywhere beside with me. \nTo all out there.... if u CAN MALE IT, someone sure then hell can break into it, and I have already been a casuality of them not living up to their losing over 500 very precious and not replaceable photos of mine.\nNow, they have, without me doing a backup, have access to more than 200 photos. \nRegards,\nDesperate and pissed.",
