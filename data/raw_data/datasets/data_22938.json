    "content": "Hi! I'm trying to set up the work profile on my Pixel 4, however, I do not see the option to add it under  \"Settings->Google->Set up & restore\". What can I do to enable it?\n\nAndroid version 10,  updated.\nI'm already logged to the corporate account and would like to split the profiles like it was with Pixel 3.\n\nThank you in advance for your help!",
