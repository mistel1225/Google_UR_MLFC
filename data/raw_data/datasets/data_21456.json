    "content": "What does Back Sensitivity actually mean?\n\nIf one increases it, what will happen in everyday use? I've just upgraded and never used the Google gestures before. I've tried searching the phone's help pages with no luck. Thanks.\n\nDoes it mean, if I try and go back, the \"back\" feature will manifest itself further into the screen? Or perhaps it will be more prevalent towards the edge of the screen?",
