    "content": "I know for a fact my phone is listening to me.\n\nI saw a product in a store last night which I hadn't seen in years, and mentioned it by name to my friends. This morning when I opened YouTube one of the first ads I saw was for the same product, when I have never seen an advertisement for it before.\n\nPlease don't tell me \"it's just coincidence\", because at this point you're not going to convince me. This is not the first time this has happened, only the most blatant. Maybe I am being paranoid, I don't care. I have already disabled permissions for my microphone except to apps that absolutely need it, and only when they're in use. How do I stop Google from spying on me through my phone?",
