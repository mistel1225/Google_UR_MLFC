    "content": "Recently my Pixel 3 stopped working properly during speaker phone or video calls, the person on the other side cannot hear me. Videos record audio fine, Google Assistant hears me fine, I downloaded a recorder app and it hears me fine.\n\nI've checked permissions and nothing seems obviously amiss. Restarted phone to no avail. Not sure what to try next.",
