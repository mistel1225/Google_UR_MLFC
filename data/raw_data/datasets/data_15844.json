    "content": "Calls are dropping and sound is dropping at random. I've tried the following:\n\n1) Checking the Fido website to confirm there are no service outages in my area\n2) Switching my SIM card, given to me to try by a Fido rep\n3) Clearing the phone app cache\n4) Calling Customer Support, who suggested it was a network issue and he \"reset my network\" and advised me whenever it happens to just reset my network settings.\n5) Today I was told to try the Google support chat available directly through my phone. It says chat unavailable so that doesn't seem to be an option.\n\nIs there any solution to this, before I send my phone in for repairs?",
