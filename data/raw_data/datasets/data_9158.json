    "content": "I discovered that some of my photos had more \"suggestion\" edit features yesterday. However, I cannot figure out why. I took several photos during a walk in the woods with the same camera settings, yet only a batch of four photos with the same subject matter had more editing options. With this batch of four photos, I have 9 total \"suggestions\" options, (enhance, dynamic, vivid, luminous, radiant, ember, airy, afterglow and stormy.) Literally no other picture seems to have these options. They just have the standard four, (enhance, dynamic, warm, cold). So what is up with that? ",
