    "content": "So, I know there's a compatibility list of a dozen or so territories that have official support for 5G.\n\nMy question is if there is any way to connect to 5G in the rest of the world without root. I've been told that it's relatively simple with root to connect to 5G networks where I currently live in Hong Kong, but I would prefer it if it was just an option in settings. \n\nOther phones from other manufacturers have far wider 5G support, and it's disheartening that Google might never choose to give us the option to try to connect to a network outside of their select list.\n\nFortunately the phone still has LTE support internationally. Imagine if that had been blocked too ðŸ˜‚\n\n[waits for Pixel update to turn off LTE in \"unsupported countries\"]",
