    "content": "I've installed Instagram a few times and cleared the cache but I can't find Superzoom in my Instagram app (for stories). Where is it??? I just swapped from an iPhone 6S and it had this feature, and generally despite being 2 years old is a lot more responsive and easy to use than the pixel. Kind of regretting changing now to be honest, this phone is plagued with issues.",
