    "content": "I returned my pixel 3 under warranty over 2 weeks ago due to a faulty usb c port that wouldn't charge.  After receiving my phone, google sent me a refurbished pixel 3.  I tried inserting my sim card into it (and a friend's sim card), but the device wouldn't recognize it.  I called and chatted with google multiple times.  Initially, they told me the issue had been escalated and I would receive an email within 24 hours.  I did receive a canned email, which didn't address my issue, and I responded to it.  I have never heard back from that email.  I then proceeded to call google again.  This time I asked for a supervisor.  I was told one would call me back withing 5 minutes.  It never happend.  So I called again.  This time I was told a supervisor would call back the next day.  No one called.  Then yesterday, I chatted with another person, who told me that I would receive an email from a supervisor within two hours (chat  ID 0-6526000028390.)  I have still not received an email.  \n\nUltimately, what I was able to find out (or seemingly find out ) in over 5 hours of calls to google was that the refurbished device that was sent to me was still listed as \"pending return\".  Unfortunatley, no one I've spoken with has any idea of how this will be addressed or when I will receive a functioning phone.   IT IS WITHOUT A DOUBT THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EXPERIENCE I HAVE EVER HAD.",
