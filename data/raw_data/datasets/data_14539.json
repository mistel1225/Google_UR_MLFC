    "content": "A fix to this issue I found online is to locate a \"blank\" or unnamed app and delete it, but I don't have such a thing on my phone.  I have reinstalled Chrome to no avail, and ran malware/virus scans with no results.  No matter what I try, deleting history, cache, etc., nothing works - I am at a loss for what to do and wish that Google would help as this is their phone and operating system.",
