    "content": "Is the contactless payments feature for 4a available in India? It tells me to download a payments app to use the feature. I already have GPay installed on my device but it isn't accepting either MasterCard or Visa debit card stating the type of card isn't valid. How do I get the NFC payments started on my device? Which app would make it work?",
