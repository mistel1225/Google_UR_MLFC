    "content": "Hi Google, \n\nThe Night Sight mode in awesome in general, and I love it! But for it kinds of falls short for astrophotography and seems to actually be counter productive. The issue (illustrated on video here: https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/aeuf44/google_pixel_3_night_sight_preprocessing_ruins/) is that Night Sight post-processing makes night sky shots look way worse than what initially comes out of the sensor.\n\nWould you consider an astrophotography mode, where postprocessing is disabled, or at least tuned to retain some of the original deep-sky details? Or, maybe more easily, is there a way to keep the original frames, before they're being post-processed in Night Sight mode?\n\nThanks!",
