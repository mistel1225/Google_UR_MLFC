    "content": "On my Google pixel 2xl after replacing the battery, screen & digitizer when playing music sound starts loud & automatically lowers. I also can’t get phone to ring using sounds, but vibrates. I took the phone apart multiple times and checked every connection that I could see, but the issue continues. I have not yet mounted the display since I don’t want to keep partying it apart. Is it possible to do a reset, but not a factory reset where I would need to reinstall everything?",
