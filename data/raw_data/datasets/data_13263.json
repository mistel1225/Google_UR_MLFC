    "content": "Hi , I have had the pixel 5 for more than a week in that time at least twice when I have put the phone on charge at night it doesn't charge , the screen reads charging rapidly X amount left for full charge however its not charging, in the morning I have to restart the phone and then put on charge again and it's starts charging , I don't know if this is the same problem as the battery percentage getting stuck but mine doesn't seem to charge at all just for clarification my battery life during the day is normal no problems and I haven't charged it during day once . Thanks",
