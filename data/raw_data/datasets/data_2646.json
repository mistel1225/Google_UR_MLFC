    "content": "When I went to sleep last night, my new pixel 4a 5g was fine, 60% charged. When I woke up this morning, it seemed to be restarting. It's been like that for the last 6 hours. \nI have tried to shut it down but it restarts. I've tried various methods including holding the on/off button and also the on-off and volume buttons. \nEvery attempt looks promising when the word Google appears on the screen and the powered by android logo appears at the bottom of the screen. The G appears and a small line below that looks as if it's doing the right thing and then that is it.\n\nHave not tried removing the SIM card - don't know if it's somehow stuck in a loop. Phone worked, apps worked. but now it just keeps trying to start.\n\nThanks,\n\nSally",
