    "content": "My father is senile. He bought a pixel 3, never used it so he gave it to me. However, he can't remember the PIN to the phone, and apparently deleted his Gmail account. I've factory reset the phone, but cannot complete setup without the previous PIN or the Gmail account. However, so since the account was deleted even my correct password cannot be used because the account cannot be found. I've tried to recover his original account but it won't work. I'm not sure what to do now, hope I don't have a $600 brick.",
