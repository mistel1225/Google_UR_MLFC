    "content": "This issue has occurred several times. After a period of time (random), my Pixel 3 stops receiving messages. I contacted my carrier, and they suggested I remove the SIM card and put it into another handset, and then put the SIM card back into my Pixel 3. This solution works, but the problem occurs again after some time. I contacted my carrier again to try and find a more permanent fix, but they suggested that it was an issue with the device. What should I do in this case? I went to Pixel Phone Help and was redirected to Community (here I am). I'm pretty lost as to what could be causing this.",
