    "content": "When I try to use the QR look feature on snapseed to use the looks I use on my old phone, it doesn't work at all. The camera seems to make the image distorted, I'm guessing that is why the code isn't scanning. The main camera can scan the QR codes no problem, but snapseed app can't manage it. Any way to get this to work?",
