    "title": "Ive had these JLab Neon bluetooth headphones for over a year now and had no trouble connecting. Recently it was stalling out in the middle of songs, so i tried turning bluetooth on and off as well as the accessory on and off. Afterwards when that didnt work i figured i could unpair the device and try again with a new connection. Ive been trying for days now and the headphones arent showing up on my device! Ive tried resetting the settings for wifi and bluetooth and that still hasnt helped. I dont know where to go from here",
