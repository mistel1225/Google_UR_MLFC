    "content": "I received a new insurance phone, same model as my previous phone, and none of my photos on google photos from the past two years are popping up. They are all backed up and I wasn't sure why they weren't loading onto my new phone. I tried updating the phone and I haven't logged out in fear of messing up the phone by deleting my primary gmail account. I wasn't sure if that was my option though.",
