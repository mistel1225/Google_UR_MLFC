    "title": "How to show thumbnails when uploading images using Windows Explorer or third party apps",
    "content": "I have a Pixel 4a 5G and when I try to upload photos using Windows Explorer (or third party apps) the thumbnails are greyed out. I've seen a couple of old threads about this, but was there any solution?\n\nI often have to upload photos for work and can't use Google Photos for this, and also have a couple of apps from work that I need to upload photos to. This issue makes the phone almost useless and I wouldn't have bought a Pixel phone if I knew about it.\n\nThanks",
