    "content": "My wife and I recently visited Barcelona. We are American. We bought sim cards at the airport and it worked on my Pixel 3 but not on my wife's Pixel 3a. I just spoke to a support rep and they said all Pixel 3a phones bought in USA come unlocked, but Pixel 3a's are not compatible with certain international carriers. Can you tell us which international carriers are not compatible, so we know for next time we travel abroad and don't waste 50 euros on a useless SIM card?",
