    "content": "A few days ago, my phone charge began freezing so that it never showed an increase or decrease in charge. Then, it started sporadically rebooting, now always showing the power at 50%. Today the phone stopped in the middle of a call and will no longer restart.\n\nI want to file a warranty claim, but can find no way to actually do so. Every link simply sends you an endless circle. How can I actually file a claim?",
