    "title": "Troubles scanning QR codes",
    "content": "I need to scan QR codes that redirect to web links of stereoscopic images that I generate for work. The issue is that the links generated by the cloud service I use (and that I am not able to change) for some reason I don't know always end with &version=2 (even if it isn't the second version of anything). I never had any troubles scanning these links with third party apps, but when I do so with the Pixel's camera it just omits this part of the link, and therefore I can't open the image I need.",
