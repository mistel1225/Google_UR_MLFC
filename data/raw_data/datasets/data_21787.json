    "content": "I have a GMRS radio device called \"Beartooth\" that connects to the phone via Bluetooth.  It has an app that runs on the phone to allow text/PTT voice and location sharing to another Beartooth user.  \n\nI would like to use it with a Bluetooth headset - at the same time - is this possible?  If so where are the instructions?  Thank you.",
