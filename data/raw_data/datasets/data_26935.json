    "content": "I can not figure out how to make the BofA app use FaceID and now there is no finger print reader, so I'm being forced to key my password every time I want to open my bank account.   Honestly, if this isn't fixed, I'm going to have to return this phone and go back to Pixel3 or iPhone.",
