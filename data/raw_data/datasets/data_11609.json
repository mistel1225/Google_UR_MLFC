    "content": "I want to transfer photos from my pixel(1st Gen) to my windows laptop. I have done this numerous times before. But from past two months I am not able to do it. Even after changing USB preference to File transfer, I dont see the pixel folder in my PC. I am using the same standard USB C to USB A cable which came with the phone. Please help! I also tried few other cables that I had at home. I tried restarting both phone and laptop. Downloading from Google photos takes a very long time!!",
