    "content": "Hello,\n\nI'm in the process of upgrading my Kenwood head unit in my car to the next model up.\n\nThere are two i am looking at, one states wired and wireless Android Auto and the other states Wireless Mirroring for Android Phones via WiFi.\n\nThere is about a Â£200 difference  between the two, i am wondering if I go for the cheaper unit with the Wireless Mirroring  for Android phones via WiFi, will my Google Pixel 4 work or do I have to go for the very latest totally wireless unit ?\n\nThanks for any advice.\n\nBobby",
