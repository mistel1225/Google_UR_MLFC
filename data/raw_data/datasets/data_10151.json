    "content": "I removed the updates on the pixel camera app to troubleshoot some photo quality issues.\n\nWhen I did this it also seemed to remove updates from the Google photos app.\n\nWhen I installed the updates for both the camera and Google photos apps again, the Google photos live wallpaper option that I was previously using vanished.\n\nIt still has not come back and there are no new updates to apply on my phone.\n\nHow can I get the live wallpaper feature back? It doesn't make any sense to me that there camera app update removal forced Google photos updates removal and it makes even less sense to me that applying the same updates back removed a feature I previously had.",
