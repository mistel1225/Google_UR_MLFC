    "content": "I've tried to look for data files in hidden folders but nothing works, I have multiple games that I play and then save the folder with the progress in a different folder and then uninstall the game, then once I get the update for the game I download it and reinstall it and paste the saved folder in the data files to continue, now I can't find the data files. Please help me.....",
