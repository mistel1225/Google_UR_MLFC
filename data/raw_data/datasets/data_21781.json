    "content": "I have just used the timer to count down 15 minutes for my daughter's school work test. Opened Timer in the Clock app, Set 15.00 minutes, pressed start.\nAfter 5 minutes and again at 10 minutes the phone started to make an alarm noise which it is not set to do at those intervals. \nIt did sound the alarm correctly after 15 mins but I do not want it to ring before the end time.\n How do I correct this? Any ideas?",
