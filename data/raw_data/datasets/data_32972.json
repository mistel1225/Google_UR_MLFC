    "content": "My Pixel 3 XL updated today and now it won't power on\n\nI saw that an android update applied itself earlier in the day today and when I restarted by device everything appeared to be working correctly.  A couple hours later I sat down my device after using it and 10 minutes later I picked it back up and it was off, all attempts to power it back on (soft reset, hard reset) produced nothing.  The device is bricked, no charging indicator on either wired or wireless charging and nothing will get the device to power back on.",
