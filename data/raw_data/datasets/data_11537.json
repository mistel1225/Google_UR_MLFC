    "content": "When I scroll through apps especially in dark mode , the dark colours like black just spread and it fades away within milliseconds .and if I just scroll up and down faster it seems like it's wiggling. It mostly happens when dark colours overlap on grey color and it just spread at the pace of my scrolling .if I scroll slowly it will be like the dark colour is having a shadow .",
