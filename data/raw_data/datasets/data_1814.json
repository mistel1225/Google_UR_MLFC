    "content": "Until a week or so ago, dictating on my Pixel 4 specifying punctuation marks worked just fine. For example, I'd say \"call me period\" and it would come out correctly as \"call me.\" But something changed and now it writes out all punctuation marks, like \"call me {period}\" Other examples are {comma}, {question-mark} etc.\n\nWhat happened? How do I fix it, please?????\n\nVery confusing & frustrating.",
