    "content": "My Pixel 3xl has stopped receiving SMS messages unless the device is rebooted. once rebooted I will get the missed SMS messages but after about 10 minutes the device will stop receiving messages again. \n\nI have factory reset the device 4 times, 2 times restoring to a backup and 2 times without restoring to a backup, however the issue persists. \n\nI have rebooted into safe mode and the issue appears to stop. but as soon as I reboot out of safe-mode the issue resurfaces .\n\nIs there a more thorough factory reset I could do to ensure the phone is scraped clean or or does anyone have any other suggestions? \n\nthanks!",
