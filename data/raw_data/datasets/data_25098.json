    "title": "No one can ever hear me clearly when I'm on speakerphone talk during a call. Tried compressed air",
    "content": "I have tried using compressed air on all of the audio compartments to blow out excess dust and I have restarted the device multiple times and the problem is still there. I am also using an OtterBox defender series but that shouldn't affect the audio at all. People can hear me when I am off of speaker When my phone is at my ear during the call and it's very frustrating",
