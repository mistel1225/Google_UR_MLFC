    "content": "Hi all..I'm currently struggling with the following  Case ID 8-99450000. No proper response from any support teams.eventhough my device is still in warranty . I m not satisfied with the current pixel device due to bad performance and also phone heats up very frequently.bad battery backup..I have asked gooogle to refund my money but are refusing to do so .I even went to next level asking them to send me a another equivalent device with pixel 3 but are refusing for that as well.and forced me saying bthat only option is to accept the same replacement phone which is no longer supported by Google as it is out of the market.\n\nI need this to be looked after this issue asap.",
