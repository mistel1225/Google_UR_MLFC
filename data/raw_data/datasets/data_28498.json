    "content": "Updated pixel 3 to android 10. Installed newest android auto app. When I connect this to my car, I get the \"old version\" on the display in the car.\n\nOn my old phone with android 9 there was an option in the menu in the android auto app to try the new look on the car display (modern look, new notification center, etc).\n\nWith me pixel, I am missing that option, even though I tried the same or newer  version of android auto. \n\nHow can I get the new look?",
