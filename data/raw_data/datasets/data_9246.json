    "content": "Every Pixel I've owned has a USB-C that fails. It starts out just fine, then eventually fails. I tried all 3 of my wired headsets and earbuds. None work now, and they did when this replacement phone first showed up.\n\nI can't use bluetooth, so I must have this option for work!\n\nI'm told it happens to all Pixels .. that their USB-C ports are defective. Anyone else?",
