    "title": "how to undo removing Digital Wellbeing from the app list?",
    "content": "I was poking around in Digital Wellbeing's settings earlier today, and saw a setting that said \"remove Digital Wellbeing from the app list\" or something to that effect. Of course, me being the idiot that I am, I tapped the setting. Immediately the app closed and, like magic, disappeared from the app list. I can still find it by using the search function, but the app won't open from there. I found it in the Google Play Store, but the app won't open from there either, it only gives me the option to uninstall, and I don't want to lose my screen time history. I found the app in settings, but it only gives me a \"force stop\" button that doesn't seem to do anything. I found that I can still access screen time and app timers through \"screen time\" under \"apps & notifications\" in settings, but I would really like to just have the Digital Wellbeing app back.",
