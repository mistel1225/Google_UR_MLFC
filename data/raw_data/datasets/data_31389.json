    "content": "I'm on my THIRD Pixel 1 handset and all of them have developed the audio silence on phonecalls fault. Google Support refuse to acknowledge it's a systematic problem with the whole range and keep fobbing me off with replacements they're \"positive\" won't develop the fault again, even though that's what they said twice before! I want they to offer at least an upgrade to a Pixel 2 to give me a better chance of it but happening again (although I hear there are problems with those handsets too). Why won't they do what's right and help me rather than just the best minimum? No care for their customers or any corporate responsibility for their faulty goods.",
