    "content": "(Sorry long post) My Pixel 3xl magically stopped charging the other night. I woke up to my phone being at 12%. I thought it was a fluke with my cord because it is the original charger that came with the phone so it is a tad bit worn. However, I plugged in another USB-C charger and still nothing. I was able to charge intermittently with my car charger, but that stopped working and now I am reduced to a wireless charger which literally takes the entire night to get to 100%. \nAlso, my battery is draining quickly. I lost 12% in less than 30 minutes with immediately turning on the phone it goes to 99%. The brightness is on adaptive or I adjust to at most 50% (I don't like bright screens so if it goes to high I turn it down). \nI have started in Safe Mode and the battery was slipping but a little slower. \nDiagnosis says all apps are fine and nothing is draining my batter. When I restarted no apps were running other than Chrome and Google Messages. I don't download new apps often and the last one I downloaded was Zelle and have since removed it. \nThen add to that, Google Messages won't download pictures. I am updated to the last system update.\nI really liked this phone and wasn't having any issues until the previous update and started seeing the battery drainage which after a couple of resets seem to be a bit better, but now its back. \n\nIs the next step a factory refresh and if that doesnt help just be with a bum phone? My phone is backed up but if it is an issue with a setting or something, if I refresh it won't it just reboot with the same issue?",
