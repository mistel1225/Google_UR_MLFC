    "content": "I've tried rebooting my device and turning headphones on and off again but when I'm connected to my Bluetooth headphones the Spotify audio keeps suddenly switching to device sound when I try and adjust volume or pause and play. Sometimes it'll fix if I go to Bluetooth and toggle media audio on and off but often I have to restart my headphones each time.",
