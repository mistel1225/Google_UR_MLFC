    "content": "I updated to Android 10 today. I had it set previously that the theme would match my wallpaper. Is there a way to do that now? Also, I like some things to have dark mode, and others not. I like the app drawer to be dark but my messages to be light. Is there a way to customize this? Or is it all one or the other?",
