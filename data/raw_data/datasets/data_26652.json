    "title": "Android 10 update causes swipe-to-unlock issue",
    "content": "Before the Android 10 update, you could easily flick your thumb up to reach the unlock screen. You needed to only swipe about 5-10% of the length of the screen, and could do it with one hand.\n\nSince the update, it now requires a much longer swipe. I can get it on the first try every time, IF I SWIPE 20 or 30% OF THE SCREEN LENGTH OR MORE. It sometimes takes two hands to unlock the phone now, or some awkward contorting to try to cover that much in a single swipe, but always requires being cognizant of how long my swipe is. \n\nBasically, the update took something that was easy and user friendly and made it awkward and sometimes difficult. And being that the fingerprint scanner is so abysmal that it only works for a day or two after it's programmed, this swiping issue is a real problem.",
