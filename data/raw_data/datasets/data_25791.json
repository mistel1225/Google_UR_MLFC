    "content": " Since the latest security update, my phone whilst power is on will not charge (3A), tried original charger and 3 others, but when switched off it charges fine first time no problems with all chargers. Tried hard reset and factory reset. Have to switch off to charge. It's not the cables or phone as it's fine charging switched off.",
