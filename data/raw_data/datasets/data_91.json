    "content": "I've been using a Pixel 3a XL for about a year. Unfortunately, it stopped recognizing the PIN that I've been using since I first started using this phone. Is there a reliable workaround to getting my data off the phone? Or better yet, is there a way to get the phone to recognize the PIN? I do have fingerprint recognition set up, if that matters. I have some important data on the phone that I'd like to access/not lose. I really appreciate any help with the matter.",
