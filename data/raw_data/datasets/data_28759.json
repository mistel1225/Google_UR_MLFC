    "content": "When my phone is left idle it will randomly shut down. It does not shut down when in use - only if I put it down.\n\nI have restarted the phone in 'safe mode' and updated every app on top of updating the phone to the latest version of Android. None of this has worked.\n\nAny help much appreciated x",
