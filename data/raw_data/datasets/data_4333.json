    "content": "I am trying to add my bank account to gpay app. I did this easily before in my previous nokia 5.1 plus phone. However, when I try to add the same bank account using the same airtel number in pixel 4a, I get a failure when UPI confirmation message is sent to my device, because a flash message shows up which switches the app and gpay complains that app switching is not allowed while adding the bank account.\n\nHas anyone encountered this before? Is there anyway to solve this?\n\nThanks.",
