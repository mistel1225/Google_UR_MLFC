    "content": "Hello, I've recently upgraded myself from the iPhone 5 to the Pixel 3. I've used the iphone for years before and the pixel is my first android related product. \n\nI've been scouring around the internet to find a way to extend the time it takes for the lock screen to time out. Right now I find it really difficult to read through all my notifications when the screen goes dim within EXACTLY 10 seconds. I thought that by interacting with the notifications on the lock screen it would pause the timer. This does not seem to be the case, I would be swiping down on a banner to read more about the notification but while my finger is still in contact with the screen, it would go black within 10 seconds. \n\nSome have advised to just unlock the phone to read the notification, why would I do this, when my intent was just to read the notification, acknowledge what it is and lock the phone. \n\nOn the iphone, when a notification comes in, i can interact with it, look at it and as long as my finger is on the lock screen, it will not timeout whatsoever. Is there a setting I can turn on that lets me do this as well? Or is the pixel hardcoded to always turn off after a set amount of time on the lock screen?",
