    "content": "Google Pixle 3A touchscreen will randomly freeze and become unresponsive. This has probably happened between 5-10 times.\n\nI have tried:\n\n1. Restarting the phone - doesn't work\n2. Plugging charging cable into phone via computer, this has fixed the problem a few times but it has now also stopped working\n\nAny tips? \n\nAll I have not yet done is a factory reset. \n\nThanks, from a very very frustrated long time Pixle fan (possibly for not much longer!).",
