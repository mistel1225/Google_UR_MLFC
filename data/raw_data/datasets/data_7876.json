    "content": "I've been having an issue lately while I'm charging my phone and try to watch a video, it doesn't allow the video to full screen or when I rotate the phone, the video won't full screen or give the option to do so. Sometimes it won't do it when I'm not charging. It does work when I restarty phone but only for a few minutes then it just goes back to if I was holding the phone regular instead of sideways.",
