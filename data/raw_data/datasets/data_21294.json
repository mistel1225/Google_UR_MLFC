    "content": "So, I bought this phone because it states that it works will all CDMA/GSM, and with any phone service in the US at least. But I've tried getting it activated through Boost Mobile (which connects to sprint network) and they say it's incompatible. I've contact Google buy they just told me it should work because the Pixel 4 is designed for any phone company. They say they have my case open but no solution has been brought up. I don't want to lose the opportunity on refunding my phone, although I love to have it activated on Boost Mobile since I already fell in love with the Pixel 4.\n\nI would like to know the details on why Boost Mobile cannot activate my phone, if anyone knows.",
