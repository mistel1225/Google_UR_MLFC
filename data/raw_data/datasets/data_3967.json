    "title": "Chrome \"add to home screen\" icons VANISHED",
    "content": "I often use the \"add to home screen\" option from the Chrome mobile app. It creates an icon on my home screen that links to the web page. Today, they all vanished. \n\nMy discussion with support was extremely frustrating. I fully understand that there's no way to get them back, but they wouldn't even acknowledge that this is an issue. They kept insisting I must have deleted them myself. There were literally dozens of icons, alone and grouped in folders. I didn't delete them by accident. \n\nThey also denied this being a known bug or issue, in spite of the fact that a quick little web search (Google wtf) revealed many other users have had this happen. \n\nI asked to know why this happened so I could prevent it and continue using this service and trust that my data won't be randomly deleted. They had nothing to say to me. \n\nAnyone have a clue what I can do? I've restarted and reinstalled chrome. I guess I should also report this as a bug, but it really seems like no one will take this seriously.",
