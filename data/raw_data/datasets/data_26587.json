    "content": "Hi There,\nOn Feb 14 I purchased a brand new Google Pixel 3.\nSince day 1 I encountered 2 major issues with the camera:\n\n1. Many photos come out with a massive lens flare signs. Examples:\n\n\n2. Under indoor light shooting, body skin is orange and colors seems to be unreal. Examples:\n\n\nThere are many other photos with same issues (if you need more examples).\n\nBesides, I have some other issues with speaker (no one can hear me on speaker within a phone call),\nScreen brightness that changes suddenly to almost black screen,\nand some other minor issues.\n\nI have to say that I am really disappointed from the Pixel 3. I thought it's one of the best smartphones in the market, but the truth is that this phone is full of issues (Maybe I mistakenly got a defected product, and maybe this is a wider issue).\n\nI'd be happy to get some help with this,\nOmri Cohen",
