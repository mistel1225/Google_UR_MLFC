    "content": "I bought my phone a couple of weeks ago and immediatly updated to andorid 10 december. Today I tried changing the notification options on vibration intensity and since then the phone started vibratoing when I unlock it with fingerprint. I disabled every vibration option and the vibration is still present, something that wasn't present before. The only workaround I found was batery save mode but that is far from a solution. How can such a simple thing be so diffucult to disable?",
