It helps to keep track together, to get an idea on when they ship, what models are being delivered sooner and in general, help each other deal with the long wait for a new phone!\n Which model, storage size, color did you order? \nCarrier variant or unlocked?\nAre you trading in your current device?\nWhat did you order with your pre-order bonus? \n And finally, what do you like the most about these new phone? What made you want to order it right away? Or are you still thinking about it? Do you have any concerns?\n I was thinking about it for few days, but finally placed an order today!\n S21 Ultra (The camera, screen and battery life are the most exciting features to me)\n128GB (I know, never enough, but I looked at my current usage and since pictures and videos are backed up to Google Photos, it should actually be plenty. 256GB for only $50 more was tempting, but it wasn't available in the color I want and the other color ships 3 weeks later too!)\nPhantom Silver (Just like silver or white phones)\nAT&T (Usually get my carrier model to take advantage of advanced network features)\nTrading in Note 20 Ultra (Yes, it's a tough call since the Note is an amazing device, but their pre-order offers are too good! Couldn't resist)\nUsed my Pre-Order Bonus to get a Galaxy Watch Active2, a Leather case and a Rugged case. The new Buds Pro were tempting, but I already have 4 pairs of Samsung earbuds (Buds, Buds+, Live, IconX) so I figured a new smartwatch will be more useful! \n\n\nIf my post answered your question, please be sure to accept it as solution so other users can find answers quicker.

So I call support to find out what's going on, the man I talked to, tells me don't worry he's going to contact shipping and to hold on, so I hold, he comes back and says \"good news, the phone will be there on the 25th you will recieve a tracking number on the 21st or 22nd at the latest\". I thank him, and So I wait, then On the 22nd, I get an email, \"your order has been delayed\". So now I'm **bleep**. Again I call Samsung to find out what's going on, I explain that the guy I talked to on the 19th said I was supposed to be getting my phone the 25th, and that I was supposed to recieve a tracking number today, not a delay email, she says \" I'm sorry sir there is no way for us to be able to tell when the phone will ship, we only have the same Information on our end as you do. So I asked her, \"you are telling me the man I talked to on the 19th lied to me? He lied right to my face\"? She says \"yes sir, I'm sorry he lied, but we have no way to tell you when the phone is going to come\" so they not only can't fulfill my order, or tell me when it's coming, their employees blatantly lie to you! I ask to cancel my order, she tells me I can't, \"the only thing you can do is reject the delivery\" I ask to talk to a supervisor, she tells me \"he's going to say the same thing\" and \"I'll give you 10% off the phone if you keep your order\" basically 10% off the device, when the phone arrives, I am so angry that I can't get my phone, and I get lied to, for all I know it could be next year before I get it. She says \"the refund I'll send you, will be in an email, with a case number, and it will say \"when the phone gets there if I don't reject the delivery that I will get 10% off\". Guess what!?!.. I still haven't received the phone, the accessories, or the 10% off email, with the case number. I'm so **bleep**. I'm so angry, WHAT COMPANY LIES TO LOYAL CUSTOMERS!? ",

I payed off the $800 by May 6 than boom on May 11 around 4:30am I received an email telling me that they will charge my account for $550 because my trade in phone did not meet the requirements for the discount, So I call both the bank Td and Samsung to find out whats going on. Td says call Samsung says call Td I get the run around at first and finally I speak to a representative who explained to me because they emailed me \"not postal mail\" in April to tell me they had a problem and because I never responded to said email they kept my trade inn phone so i told him i didn't receive any mail or email from them about my phone I told him I wanted my phone back because the main reason I did the trade in is because I couldn't afford the price of the new phone in the first place. I don't think I should have to pay when Samsung never returned my trade in, by the way the trade in phone was in excellent condition . I've been a Samsung customer through Tmobile for over 10 years and never had a problem til now i feel cheated .Never thought that they would have to give a bad review this really made me wish I went with Apple. still paying off this extra  $550 on my account but as soon as am done paying I will cut them off. I am soo disappointed in them. I will most definitely report this to the BBB as soon as possible. Be careful they will rob you when your not looking. God Bless",

In fact even this phone had actually connected earlier, but something is preventing it now. (While my computer purrs along 2 feet away without issue.)\n  I turned the phone's WiFi off and on. Rebooted the phone, rebooted the router, and successfully looked for a way to turn off the 5G (Apparently AT&T doesn't allow that.) All to no avail.\n  The most aggrivating fact being that, I've gone into the room with the router, am getting 3 or 4 bars, depending how you count it, but your phone STILL isn't letting me select the better and stronger WiFi network.\n  I can't use the phone like this, so I did the only thing I COULD do. Turn off mobile data on my brand new $1,500 Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra. (Which, BTW has NO SD Slot! As computer user / programmer since 1982, the ONE steady rule about computers is that you're eventually going to REQUIRE MORE MEMORY!)\n  Thanks\n - Jim\n ",

    "context": "Hi, \nJust bought an S21 - had an iPhone for 5 years prior. \nI noticed that the S21's lock screen doesn't light up when I get a notification, compared to an iPhone. I then discovered edge lighting, but noticed it only works on select apps. After reading various forums and Reddit threads, I believe there is no fix to this except to download a third party app. Was wondering if Samsung, in a future software update, could make it so that edge lighting worked for all app notifications? \nAdditionally, I knew before purchasing (by watching tons of tech videos), that Samsung has heavy photo saturation. I heard from Youtubers that it was toned down for the S21, which incentivized me to buy the new Galaxy (the last Galaxy I owned was an S3!) The photo saturation was a big deal breaker for me since the camera is a big part of how I choose my phones. However, after testing out my phone, I think the photo saturation is still very heavy. I do like this phone and don't want to return it, but I'm wondering if the default photo can be less saturated in a future software upgrade? Or have some kind of option to turn it off and opt for more natural looking photos? I understand why this is done - for social media, etc., but if there was an option for more natural coloring, that'd be super great. \nOtherwise, love this phone. Glad to be back on Android!\nThanks!",

When im recording slow mo the device lags and force close the camera app and restarting all the apps including one ui home. I have reported this issue so many times in samsung members but just received auto reply. \n2. Everytime i take the phone out of pocket the biometrics are blocked because so many fingerprint attempts are been made. Every single time i take the phone out i need type the password. The fingerprints sensor should be turned off when the front sensor is detected dark area like pocket or bag. This is not why i buy this device. \nHaving this issue from april till now. Have done so many reports in samsung members, smart tutor, and twitter. Received auto reply to factory reset the device. So please dont tell me to reset the device as i have done more than 5times and also downloaded firmware from sammobile and flashed with odin.  Nothing helps. Also dont ask me to go to any service center. Because they wont understand the problem because it is a software bug. Please fix the software. Really frustrated from the day one till now i cant take any slowmo videos. Thanks\n ",

    "context": "I spent my whole speaking to customer service and I'm just so frustrated. I swear if I have to read \"I'm sorry for the inconvenience\" one more time I will cry. Haha. Just kidding. I already cried. Truly, I'm just so done with everything. And when I asked for a feedback link. Alli sent me here. This isn't what I meant but whatever. I'll tell my story once more.\nSo this morning I woke up and decided to check my phone. While I was reading something, my screen went black and never turned on again. I restarted it at least 5 times before using my old tablet to chat with the \"Experts\" and \"Care Pros\". They kept asking me to restarted it. And every time I was like, \"what now?\" We got disconnected and a new Expert come and tell me to restart it again. Until I got someone who said I have two options: Send it in and have it repaired or go to one of their repair shops and get it repaired same day.\nI choose same day, of course. I need my phone. I'm currently job hunting and I'm getting called in for interviews. Anyways, I go to where they sent me and the guy tells me that they can't fix it because I had the limited edition gold color.\nSo I come back home. I get back on my tablet and chat with them again. It was a nightmare. They started asking me to restart it again and I'm like, No, no. I tried that. Then ask if I would like to go a repair shop to get it fixed. Even though I had already stated that I had just come back from the repair shop.\nSo then the Care Pro said I had to send it in and it would take 9-11 BUSINESS days for me to get it back. So I took out my calendar and counted. If I mailed it out by tomorrow. I would get it back by August 12th. I asked, \"If I was supposed to go more than two weeks without a phone?\" And he legit wrote: \"Yes! Are you okay with that?\"\nI said no. And told me I would have to call customer service for them to help me and not to worry they would give me a Ticket ID so I wouldn't have to explain everything again. And when I told him that I couldn't call because my phone wasn't working and I live alone...Guess what happened? \nYeah, it got disconnected and a new person was there to help me. I had to give all my info again. I told the new person to give me a Ticket ID and phone number to customer service so I could use my neighbor's phone to call because I just couldn't type anymore. I was done. It was around 3PM and I had been chatting with so many different people since 10AM.\nSo I use my neighbor's phone to call. I spend ten minutes telling the automated voice system that I want to talk to a real person and it keeps telling me that they have a great chat service that I can use instead. So when I finally got a real person on the phone. She asked for all information and I was like: \"No, no. I have a ticket ID. I don't want to explain anymore.\" I give it to her. She put me on hold so she could get the information and read through it. When she got back to me, she said \"I see here that your screen went black and it hasn't work since. Have you tried restarting it?\"\nWhen I tell you that I started crying out of frustration I mean mean it. They did not send all my concerns in the ticket note. So I once again had to explain everything. So she told me that I would have to send it in since the repair shop couldn't do it. And yes, it could take 9 to 11 business days. Maybe even longer sometimes.\nAfter crying some more, I asked if that was really all she could do because I really needed my phone for job hunting. She was very sympathetic and said she would transfer me to a supervisor. She put me on hold for ten minutes and then came back and said no supervisor was available. That if I wanted, I could hang up and a supervisor would call me back when they were available. I said sure. I gave my neighbor back the phone and she told me she would knock on my door when they called. She lives right across the hall. Waited two hours, my neighbor knocked but only to tell me that they hadn't call. She said she would knock again if they did call. They never did call back.\nSo I went on the dreaded Facebook and decided to message support from there. It was just the same thing. If the repair shop couldn't do it. I would have to send it in. I would get it back in 9 to 11 business days.\nSo I have no phone until at least August 12th. There is nothing they can do about it. And I don't even have my old phone because I used it as a trade in. I shall never buy Samsung products again.\nI honestly don't know what to do. How will I job hunt? If someone calls me for an interview, I won't know. I've spent all day dealing with this. I was so upset at the end, I called poor Alli, customer support on FB, a horrible person. Sorry, Alli. I had a long day and you were the last person I spoke to. At least I didn't curse. I did call your job stupid though. Sorry.\nDude. Being poor **bleep**. I really can't afford a new phone right now. Idk. Sorry for the rant.\nTL;DR: My phone broke. I cried all day. And now I hate Samsung. Also, I called Alli a horrible person and said her job was stupid. I know it's not her fault.",

I'm about ready to give up on the S21 Ultra, and return it for an iphone pro max if these camera issues continue. Every photo that has any movement comes out blurry. The auto focus never stays focused on the moving object, burst mode is blurry and out of focus itself. Yes, the lenses are clean, software is updated, plastic removed, restarted camera, cleared cache/ data, tried safe mode, etc etc. If there's no motion the photos are fine but a hint of motion and the focus and detail absolutely suck. The auto focus tracking does not keep pets or kids in focus. Out of maybe 200 burst shots I'll get 1 or 2 that aren't completely blurry. The single shot that's supposed to let you select what kind of photos/ videos it captures doesn't work. It completely ignores what you don't want to capture, and then out of many good options in 15s it selects around 5-10 of the worst possible moments and adds ridiculous filters to it that I specifically removed as an option but it still does anyways. At this point it seems impossible to take any clear, detailed photos where movement is involved on the S21 Ultra. Please show me its possible and what you did to capture them. ",

Called Rode and they report that the S21Ultra (specificially, not other Samsung models) has problems with external mic not only with Rode but with other brands also. They think that it has to do with the high resolution the Ultra is designed to receive versus whatever is sent from external mic sources.\nDiscouraging because I specifically purchased the Rode Wireless II GO system to be able to record good audio, especially at any distance, that cannot be recorded without many undesired effects from the native mic on the Samsung.\nI haven't called Samsung directly yet, decided to post here first.

They recommended including my service agreement scan photo (I did), my proof of purchase receipt (I did), to call Telus and ask for other proof of purchase (was on the phone for two hours and had a very kind Telus employee manually write up an email with the company logo included and all the required information) and was still rejected. I called Samsung and explained and sent over all documentation. They told me they \u2018escalated my case\u2019 (?) but I never heard back. The promo ends tomorrow. Even went to my local store, and they said there is nothing to be done! Was the promo a scam? Does anyone have any helpful ideas?

My problem is that as I'm logging into accounts, my passwords aren't being saved at all actually.  I've set up my Google account but all I can seem to do with the password manager and autofill is have access to the info.. from what I can tell..  my phone wants me to use Samsung pass. I've tried disabling it thinking that then when I typed in a new password it would use my Google account passwords but it didn't work.  Instead , it asks me to download Samsung pass every time I type a password in.  As of now ..

The Android Auto team told us a fix was on the way as they had worked with Samsung and a fix was going to be part of the July Security update.\nWell many of us got the new July Update, and surprise! It doesn't work we still crash. At this point it is ridiculous. Outside customizing my phone's main screen and side loading apps Android is losing it's identity. All we ask for is software, that is developed by Google and Samsung, to work across all Android/Samsung devices. I have never been a fan of iPhone but if they release a phone with a 120hz screen I may call it a wrap and move over if Android Auto isn't fixed. \n Having solid navigation is essential in bigger cities and when traveling. Having Android Auto Crash because your spouse unlocks your device to reply to message is unusable. Support your software properly Samsung and actually work with Google to fix it. It's not just their problem it's also yours. If we cannot use a key feature many people won't jump ship to Pixel devices, they'll go to Apple instead. Which means we aren't in your ecosystem anymore.\n P.S. Don't respond about \"trying different cables\" a majority of us have tried a plethora of different cables. My wife has a S21 Ultra that hasn't been updated in a while, her Android Auto works without fail. My updated device does only works so long as the screen is locked. Clear cache, uninstall, reinstall, disable battery optimization, and you name it has been done. One you get a May update it borks it. Can confirm with my wife's un-updated s21 ultra.\n ",

    "context": "Anyone else experiencing this issue, and anyone come across any solutions?\n Since the May release I\u2019ve found that my unlocked snapdragon S21 Ultra 512GB has been experiencing significant focus issues on the main camera. It almost behaves like it already has a focus lock on something, and no attempts to focus on alternate subjects has any effect.\n If I switch to the Ultra-wide, the 3x tele, or the 10x tele, they all work exactly as expected and are in focus/can focus on other subjects with a tap. If I bring my hand up close to the lens and Focus Enhancer turns on (which I understand is just the phone switching to the ultra-wide), everything comes into focus, but then when I remove my hand it returns to the main camera and is out of focus.\nExample of what I\u2019m describing can be seen here\nThis has been happening on my phone since the May release, and so far I\u2019ve had three releases since, none of which has seemed to improve this behavior. Currently running G998U1UEU4AUF5\n Troubleshooting steps attempted thus far:\n Usually when this happens, I\u2019ve tried a handful of steps which inconsistently seem to help. The aforementioned step of holding my hand close to the lens so focus enhancer turns on and then pulling it away (so it switches back to the main camera) will often be enough for it to seemingly correct it\u2019s focus lock and then the main camera will begin focusing properly again. This is what I attempt most of the time \u2013 and sometimes it works but not consistently.\nI also force quit the camera app and clear the camera app\u2019s cache. This has had inconsistent results as well. I\u2019ve also tried wiping all data associated with the camera app \u2013 again with varied results in correcting the main camera focus issues. Most of the time I tend to just \u2018miss the moment\u2019 I was trying to capture, or if I\u2019m really in a time crunch, find a way to make it work with either the ultra-wide or 3x lens.\n Anyone else experiencing this issue with the main camera? Anyone have any more reliable steps for correcting the issue when it occurs?",

    "context": "I don't know why my previous post was deleted, but here it is again.\nI was a loyal fan of Samsung products, from appliances to cell phones. \nAs I always do when they release a new phone, I placed my preorder on Jan/21. The phones was working fine until this last Sunday 07/11 when I noticed my phone had no signal or was switching from Full to none,zero,nada. \nI went to ATT, purchased a new SIM card and nothing. Put my wife's SIM card on my phone and it didn't work, put mine on hers and it worked. \nDid a network reset and nothing. Performed a Factory reset and nothing. same issues.\nNext day, I decided to call Samsung and it was when my nightmare started. Talking to a Samsung \"expert\" care+, they suggested that I speak with Samsung Premium Care since I pay for the service. By afternoon my replacement was approved free of charge.  Around 7pm i got an email from Samsung Premium Care asking to contact customer service. I did and I was informed that they didn't have a replacement for my variant (S21 ultra 5G 521GB) or have been receiving this model from Samsung. They informed that the replacement could take 5~15 business days to arrive or could never arrive and they suggested that I contact Samsung to check for other options. I did, I called again Samsung Care+ and i was informed that I could take to a service repair center an get my phone fixed. I went to a UbreakIfix near home, after 3 hours I was informed that some parts were replaced and it didn't work, my phone was a no fix. Called Samsung again and again I was informed that I should try another UbreakIfix location. Well, I did, drove 50 minutes, waited 5 hours and the results were the same. The technician even brought me inside their lab, showed my phone open with all the new parts plugged into a PC and told me my phone was a NO FIX. They gave me a ticket number and mentioned that I should call Samsung my provide with the ticket number. \nSo, I called again, and again they said they couldn't do nothing but offer to send my repair to their Samsung repair center where (words used by Samsung agent) - Were our engineers are better trained  and could fix your phone- and wait 15 DAYS + 4 DAYS FOR SHIPPING or I should try again with Samsung Premium Care.\nWHY? Why would you do that with your customers Samsung? Why would you waste my time sending me to 02 UbreakIfix  \"if you think\" your engineers are better trained than the ones from your list of \"authorized\" repair centers? Why it has to be so difficult and time consuming with you?\nIt has been 6 days and around 5H33M on calls  going back and forth between Samsung Care Pro, Samsung Premium care and UbreakIfix and here I'm no phone working, no solution for my problem.\nI used to see a lot customers complaining about Samsung customer service and I always was like... Nah, this is not true... but now I see it is. \nA problem that any other company would resolve is hours or days, Samsung is turning into a nightmare. My phone is under warrant, I pay for a insurance from Samsung that does nothing besides charge my card every month and here I am.\nIs that fair? \nI look forward for help and resolution to my problem before seeking help from a consumer protection agency or other assistance.\n  ",

However, disabling that option takes effect on every touch related vibration of the system, like long pressing links in Samsung Internet or app icons, toggles in app/system settings etc.\nWhat I'm trying to do is to disable vibration exclusively on navigation buttons, but to keep every other touch interaction vibration activated. \nIs it possible? Already tried Good Lock NavStar module, but there's no option for this.\nMy phone is a S21+. One UI with June security patch.\nThanks.",

So my idea will be either come up with a remote control to control the ISO, the focus, or the shutter speed or a gymbal to take advantage of the main camera features. If I buy a DJI gimbal or any other third party gimbal I cannot control all its functions using the Samsung camera app. It come with its own camera app which I cannot use to the phone's full potential. From changing to different lenses like wide angle to focus or even most apps can't I shoot at 60 frames. I also like to shoot 120 frames in pro mode to slow down footage in post production which most cameras these days from third party does not support. I wish Samsung would make a gimbal specifically for our phones to take advantage of it's  features in pro mode. It will bring more professional photographers using Samsung phones.  It is very hard to use a cage rig or just using the phone Pro Mode and touching the screen to swipe up and down to focus or change the iso etc. ",

    "context": "Just hoping somebody else has gone through this and can help me fix it, before I get in to it this happened while sitting at home just after the latest major software update when I powered my phone off after. The phone was 100% fine before hand, has about half a battery left & there was no damage or cause to the phone that would have caused a hardware issue to trigger this situation. So I'm trying to avoid jumping the gun & mailing it in to Samsung for a service request because there are no local support locations near me.\n\nI did the latest Android Update for my S21+ in the late evening of 07/07/202. I was then going to optimize my apps in Galaxy Labs (Good Guardians) like you are supposed to do after a software update, but before that I powered off the phone so I could get to the boot loader via holding in Power+Volume Down but the phone would not come back on at all not doing that, not when I tried most holding on Power, not even when I plugged the charge cord in, nothing happened at all. I thought it wasn't even recognizing it was on charge but when I placed it on my Samsung Wireless Charge Pad the red charging light (ON THE PAD) comes on so it is recognizing the Qii charging in my phone even though the phone doesn't show it is being charged even though it's (luckily) being recognized by wireless charging pads which is the only good thread I have to hang on to that this can be fixed like most things online say about similar situations. I've tried all the troubleshooting steps I find online such as soft reset with Power+Vol Down (doesn't work), plugging in to charge cord (doesn't work), making sure the side button are NOT sticking at all, tapping around on the front and back to ensure nothing is loose etc. & nothing, it was completely random this happening and was immediately after the update finished but I'm not sure if it's related to that or just a weird coincidence.

    "context": "Hi all, first time here. Just jumped camp from iPhone to Android and chose Samsung to jump to. It\u2019s an S21 Ultra 5G. I've had it about 7-8 days at most. It has not been exposed to water or any liquid, been dropped or damaged in any way I know. I mention this because it was the first question the tech asked.\nProblem. My screen vibrates, all the time. I can't see it, hear it, or feel it, however, if I place something on the screen, (phone lying on it's back, screen up), the items or item, will \"walk\" across the screen toward whatever side is the lowest.\n\nFirst discovered this when I set a small lunch desert (3 cookies) on the phone screen. When I looked back up they had moved across the screen and were leaning over the edge. Put them back in the center of the screen and watched as they started to move off the screen in the same direction, again. A plastic \"Sharpie\" pen cap is a good example. I stand it up on the screen and it starts moving and usually starts to spin too, I assume the clip side it slightly heavier.\n\nTech had me turn off all vibration features, and I did a reset, neither made any difference. Take it back to Verizon was his advice. Said he had never heard or worked on this issue and I was the first time it had ever come up.\n\nAny thoughts? Hear of this before?\n\nThese phones are on back order and reactivating my old iPhone and waiting another 3 weeks for another S21 would be a pain.\n\nThanks in advance for any help. Gary F.",

My initial disappointment with the product is what everyone else is complaining about (no charger, earbuds, SD card slot, phone jack). My specific complaint is the included charger cord. It would be nice to have a USB A to USB C cord. I don't have anything USB C. So I had to buy a USB C charging block X2, USB C car charger,  USB A to USB C cable to connect to my computer, Bluetooth earbuds, two extra USB c cables for car and bedroom.\nFor a $1049.99 phone from AT&T, I think Samsung really cheaped out on the accessories in the name of profit. Samsung transferred the cost on to the consumer. Whatever the excuse/explanation Samsung gives, never forget it's about the money/profit. If Samsung really thought it was about consumer choice, Samsung would be offering their accessories at a significant discount to Samsung customers.",

My phone connects to the headunit via USB but the phone calls and some other features all go via Bluetooth - including phone calls.\nThe issue is that every time I am on a call it will randomly drop the Bluetooth repeatedly at various intervals. It will stay dropped for about 10-15 seconds then reconnect and continue as usual and then drop again a minute or two later.\nWhat's even weirder is that this only happens on phone calls. If I am listening to music or a podcast it continues to work fine with no issues. Only phone calls are causing this issue.\nI have done the following:\nRestarted the phone.\nToggled Bluetooth off/on.\nUnpaired Bluetooth and then re-paired it.\nCleared Android Auto Data and Cache. Then set up AA again.\nCleared Bluetooth System Protocol Data and Cache.\nReset Network Settings.\nTurned off Bluetooth scanning in location settings.\nChecked in developer settings to see if any settings might help - couldn't see anything relevant.\nWhat I have not done, and would like to avoid if possible, is a factory reset of the handset. Only because it will take me AGES to set everything back up again.\nI also did not have this issue on my previous phone which was a Huawei Mate 10 (ALP-L29) running Android 10 (Build 10.0.0.181) Kernel 4.14.116.\n Info on the phone:\nModel: S21 Ultra\nAndroid Version: 11\nKernel: 5.4.61-21282179-abG998BXXU2AUC8\nBuild: RP1A.200720.012.G998BXXU2AUC8\nOne UI version: 3.1\nSecurity Patch Level: 1 April 2021\n Does anyone have any ideas?",

    "title": "Overheating Problems on S21",
    "context": "I just got my Galaxy S21 yesterday and it is amazing, fast, and looks beautiful but there is one major problem I've been having with it. If I try to do any sort of multitasking, the phone heats up to uncomfortable levels and displays a warning that it is too hot and for me to try split screen or pop up view when it cools down. For a phone that is supposed to be great at multitasking, this is a major flaw. I believe that this can be fixed through software optimization but as of right now this is very disappointing. I haven't even been using 5G yet. On my old Note 10\u00b1, I could run so many things at once without the phone even getting very hot but this one overheats easily. Even when charging, my note charges without getting so hot. This really needs to be fixed soon. I can't even run a youtube video in pip while browsing the web because it will overheat the phone. And it's strange because battery life so far has been phenomenal! I've gotten 2 days on one charge. Also, I saw that they recommended using the phone in environments between 50\u00b0-100\u00b0 and my house is always at 70\u00b0 or so which means that the phone should be running fine.\n  Update: I have since found out that one of the causes of the overheating is due to the 5G on this phone. When my phone is connected to my home wifi but I don't turn my mobile data off, it overheats and is very hot to the touch but after turning off my mobile data, the problem appears to be gone though not really since you should be able to keep your data on with wifi without overheating your phone. So just a heads-up until Samsung decides to fix this, make sure you keep your mobile data turned off when using a wifi network because the data syncing in the background is too much for the phone. So much for a \"power efficient\" processor I guess. This is really sad to see because now it seems that the Snapdragon variant is the one with the overheating as well as the Exynos so it's not necessarily a chip problem but more likely a problem with the 5G modem sapping too much power. SMH Samsung please fix this.\ud83d\ude14\n  Update 2: After using my phone for a few hours, it seems that the problem has appeared again even with data off. I guess that using multi-window or picture in picture also causes the device to overheat. I had youtube in pip mode while staying g on the home screen and no other apps open yet, the phone still overheated. The image below is of me using pip on YouTube while browsing a website on Google.\n     ",

But to my utter disappointment, generic adapters available in the market didnt work at all. The phone simply threw a message 'connected device not supported'. I had to purchase exhorbitantly priced Samsung's adapter, but it's hardly good. Neither earphones sound good on it, nor does the micorphone record properly. Mic's gain is hampered a lot and recorded sound also sounds muffled. \nMoreover, when bought  USB Type C microphone, thinking it would solve the issue, THE phone again threw a message saying 'connected device not supported'.

I was thus using Google Messages as my texting app. I could participate in group chats of any number on the Messages app on the BLU phone - for example, I was able to participate in a chat of 17+ people (mix of android and imessage users) no problem.\n\nNow, with my S21, I have noticed issues with group texting.\nGoogle Message's App just straight up doesn't work for group texts of ANY size. If I am trying to text more than one person, it just hangs at \"sending...\". If I try to send a picture through text, it just hangs at \"sending...\". \n\nSamsung's own texting app does work, luckily, for group texting and sending/receiving pictures. EXCEPT Samsung hard limits their app to 10 people in a single group chat.\n\nI called Samsung Support who basically stopped talking to me halfway thru. I called my carrier, Ultra Mobile, who could not find anything wrong with my account and couldn't offer any solutions beyond \"Maybe it's just your phone itself.\".\n\nHas ANYONE else experienced this issue? Has anyone been able to resolve it in any way?\n\nI've tried a number of different things: third party texting apps - Signal, Textra, Chomp SMS, Pulse. All face the same issues as Google Messages: any group of any size hangs; trying to adjust APN; reseting my network internally; switching from 5G down to LTE; turning off wi-fi calling. \n\nI really don't know what's the problem - and it's pretty ironic that a $150 smartphone is able to handle texting better than an $800 one.

Vivid is awful...much too saturated and jarring, yellows are ridiculously popping and whites are still yellow. Natural is washed out and the whites are dingy. I bought this phone specifically so I could use the camera and lightroom to edit so the lack of correct calibration is frustrating. Is there any way I can fix this issue outside of becoming a developer and inputing adb commands to access other profiles?? Why are their not more advanced options to tweak color on an $800 phone??

I have reset the phone, the app, deleted everything, followed a few troubleshooting steps from other forums. Nothing has helped. I'm tempted to trade in for an iPhone.

Problem is, you have to contact TD Bank and that department is closed on weekends.  I got passed around to three different people who's first language is not English while trying to resolve this with Samsung.  Some chick I could barely understand named \"Grace\", I'm sure that's her stage name, assured me she had it taken care of and would email me with information to go forward with this transaction once TD Bank got their stuff together.  It never came.  I called TD Bank the next day to close my account and was passed around once again, though their English was much better.  They were cold, to the point and never asked why I was closing my account after one day.\nSo longer story short, I will never, EVER consider buying anything directly from Samsung in the future.

    "context": "So I've had MANY Samsung devices in my day. It's a bit of a love/hate relationship with the brand. Sometimes there are hits and other times there are straight up misses.\nI bought a S20 Ultra in 2020 and the camera glass cracked, developed a hole, and condensation eventually killed the device. Instead of paying the insane price of repair, I was so dissatisfied with performance of the camera in that $1400 device, I chalked it up to a paperweight and got a Pixel 3a XL. When I tell you that the $350 Pixel produce more consistent and better quality photos than my Galaxy S20 Ultra, I mean it. So I rocked the 3a XL for about a year until the S21 was announced. While the camera performance was spectacular, the device was slow and annoying. So, instead of going all in like I did the Ultra, I decided to get a S21 5G instead. \n\nWhile the 120Hz OLED is beautiful, performance is mega, and the hardware is gorgeous, the camera generally disappoints. The images are inexplicably blurry, the shutter speed snaps photos much later after you press the shutter button, and zooming in on photos only shows graininess and lack of sharpness. And don't get me started on the selfie camera. It still tries to \"beautify\" my face, even with the effects and filters turned off.\n\nI thought I was misremembering my experience on my Pixel, so I pulled it out for some comparison shots and turns out, I wasn't. The photos from the Pixel 3a XL were much more pleasing out of auto-mode than on my S21 5G. Not just sorta better, but NOTICIBLY better. I was also more easily able to whip my phone out of my pocket, take a shot, and assume it was fine, than immediate reviewing it on my Galaxy to see if I needed to take it again, and maybe again, to finally get a usable shot.\n\nIt is frustrating listening to the marketing hype and show that Samsung puts on every year only to be outperformed by a $350 device in this area ESPECIALLY since Samsung likes to use marketing photos that are seemingly DSLR-like quality.\n\nThat's all to say, what am I doing wrong with my S21 in auto-mode to make the photos experience so challenged?",

    "context": "Anyone know what's up with this article I just came across?\nThe Samsung Galaxy S21 range is OFFICIAL. But is it waterproof? And if so, how waterproof?\nThe answer is, yes, well\u2026 kind of \u2014 here\u2019s what you need to know.\nWhat IP Rating Does The Samsung Galaxy S21 Have?\nThe Samsung Galaxy S21 has an IP68 rating; where, IP stands for \u201cingress protection\u201d and by ingress, it means protection from stopping small particles and water getting inside the phone\u2019s important bits and breaking them.\nWith an IP68 rating, you\u2019re basically covered for submersion in water, water that is around 1.5 meters deep, for around 30 minutes. Any deeper or longer can result in the phone breaking, so as always it is best to NOT get your phone wet, even though it\u2019d probably be fine.\u2077\nThe Samsung Galaxy S21 is Waterproof\nThe Galaxy S21 has its IP68 rating, and so too does the Galaxy S21+ and Galaxy S21 Ultra. But Samsung\u2019s cheaper phones, like the Samsung Galaxy A51, are not IP rated and, officially, are not classed as waterproof.\nHowever, as you can see here, the Samsung Galaxy A51 is actually waterproof.\nAgain, you don\u2019t want to mess around with water and your phone too much, it is still a piece of electronic technology after all. And in the case of the Galaxy S21 (or S21+ and S21 Ultra), a very expensive one at that.\nStill, if the worst does happen, and you drop your Galaxy S21 in the pool or the ocean, it will be fine. **bleep**, with an IP68 rating on it, you could even use it to take underwater pictures, so long as you\u2019re not going too deep.\nMy advice, as always, however, is to treat your phone like it isn\u2019t waterproof even when it is. I learned this the hard way with an iPhone XS Max a couple of years back. I got it ever-so-slightly wet and it fogged up the FACE ID camera and basically ruined the phone.\nDon\u2019t be like me. Don\u2019t assume just because your phone has an IP rating you can do whatever you want with it. If you\u2019re going to spend a ton of money on a phone, even if it is waterproof, I would always do\nmy best to keep it\nsitting next to your beer, in the safe space that you've already learned long long ago to have provided for such a fine beverage, 'cause you also have learned long long ago that you're worth way way more than all that cheap **bleep** bottom barrel water-like brew, bro! You know, **bleep** the ho, 'cause she ain't **bleep** eitha, she'll be gone soon enough any ol' ways, and there ain't no cash redemption values and cheap **bleep** bitches like that, 'cause nobody ever wants a second hand **bleep**. Throw her out the window, then drive back by a few minutes later, and see if you can wing an empty upside the head, 'cause you also learned some good aim long long ago, and that those fools in Antioch, CA, that nearly hit you with an empty while riding your 10 speed over on L Street right in front of the Speedway, needed just a little more practice.

Even a separate option in the Phone to have a different Call Background for SPAM Calls and Unrecognized Callers.\n\n3) MultiApp View Rotation\n--- Could you please add the ability to rotate the MultiApp View on supported devices (Tab S6, S6 Lite, S7/+, Z Fold 2) so when 3 apps are visible, they can be rotated enough so you can have the wided section be on the top of the screen or on the right side.

Later I found out that the technician left some fingerprints inside the camera sensor, and I was not able to clean it from outside.\nSince I do not have tools to open the cellphone back cover, I went to their store again and ask them to clean the fingerprints for me. The store staff refused to admit the fingerprints were left by their technician, and instead would charge me for the cleaning labor. When I refused to pay the amount she demanded, she asked me to leave the store.\nThe cost of cleaning was not the issue. If the staff at least admits their mistake and gives an apology, I actually don't mind paying the labor since I understand it will not be covered by warranty. However the store staff was rude and keeps implying I opened the cellphone up myself and left fingerprints on camera sensor.

It's actually a nice change of pace, which looking at this fully featured device I'm getting (the ultra version *Samsung what's with the names seriously, cmon*) has a glass back plate. Which I'm not exactly thrilled about. I'm really not. Nonetheless as a tech repair person who runs his own business, Its just apart of my gig to know about what's what and to get a hands on experience with the latest and greatest, so that when others purchase and eventually have problems, I can diagnose and have a complete understanding of what's under the hood and what to expect as more and more people get these things, it's a good opportunity to keep up with the technology and environment. \nI am writing this because I wanted to take a moment of my time to just appreciate the craftsmanship and engineering that went into this s21. It will be loved in my heart. Sadly s21 ultra -_- here I come... begrudgingly, knowing at some point in the near future that device will fall and crack, and I will look back at the s21 and ask \"Why?!\" ",

Here is my story...\nI applied for samsung finance and was able to get it approved immediately. I was given a virtual card with TD bank with an available credit of $3200. I was very haapy. So i went to samsung.com to purchase galaxy s21 5g. I was able to include the phone in cart and do the checkout. In the checkout screen, i was given samsung financing as an option which showed my available credit and rest of the payment options like credit/debit card etc. \nwhen i selected samsung finance option it always threw an error \"Invalid card details entered\". So i checked my TD card online to see if the card was active and it was active. TD customer support also confirmed card is ok and has sufficient balance, but i was still unable to check out using samsung finance option. So i reached out to samsung ecommerce support regarding this issue. I emailed them the screen shot of the issue and after a week they sent me this absurd reply ...\n\"  Greetings from Samsung!\n\nThis is in reference to your recent contact with us regarding placing order. As per the update received from our dedicated team, the length of name cannot exceed 35 characters and also we request you to try placing your order using other payment method. Hope this information helps. \"\nAt first when i saw the reply i thought it was a joke, but no, they are very serious and sent the same reply again. \nThis is the first time i have heard i cannot use a credit card/financing option that was provided because name was too long. If name was too long, then why approve a samsung finance card ?\nMy advise to anyone who is planning to apply for samsung finance - check with the customer support if the card will be allowed based on your name, race, skin color, your pets name etc, because samsung's techonogly has discrimination at a different level and save yourself from an hard inquiry on credit history.\nHope you all enjoyed this story. I will be closing my \"good for nothing\" samsung finance card soon. Lets see what CFPB says about this.\nThank you.",

The video will stop, and it looks like it's buffering, and then after up to 30 seconds or so an exclamation point next to the wifi icon in the status bar will appear. Then it takes another 20 seconds (or more, if ever at all) before the video picks up on cellular data, and eventually wifi reconnects. It's incredibly frustrating, as it happens every 5 or 10 minutes sometimes. I've tried getting a new Sim card, resetting the network settings, switched off mac randomization. I've tried the different network configurations in developer options, like keeping the mobile data active, or choosing stability over performance, etc. Nothing resolves the behavior. My home internet/wifi (100mb/s) is through at&t, and my cell carrier is Verizon. I've even had my router replaced by at&t. My phone has all the latest updates too.\nA Google search shows that it's not an uncommon complaint with samsung phones, and even my old s9 exhibited this behavior. I wish samsung could get this sorted, or give an explanation as to what is causing it. None of my other devices on my home wifi network lose connection like this. I don't know if something happens when the phone is switching between the 2.4ghz and 5ghz bands on the widely distributed at&t ac router.

    "context": "I've been realizing that my S21 has been under preforming in the battery compartment. Actually it's been TERRIBLY preforming when it comes to battery life. For example my 4 year old NOTE 9 has been preforming just as \"good\" as my NEW 5 months old s21. With the note 9 lasting me 5 hours of screen time before needing to charge again, knowing that my 4year old phone's battery has been getting old I could understand why it's not doing as well as it used to, but when my s21 gets 5 hours of screen time this drives me insane considering it's battery isn't old enough to be this bad. It's one of the main reasons why I upgraded to a newer phone, but finding out it's battery is not preforming well is just sad. I've realised that I'm not the only person with this issue, if you want me to keep on buying your products then they must preform at best. Hope you fix this issue with a software update, thank you for taking your time to read this have a nice day.",

Also personally for me I don't know if it's the lenses themselves or because the lense are too big but I feel like instead of Samsung adding more cameras every year, they should improve their camera software quality specially the Camera Lag and the Video. Let's be honest, the images look amazing and the zoom looks fantastic but the video software in the camera is really bad and I hope that you can fix these issues. If not the S21 line up then I hope you fix the issue for the upcoming S22 ultra or Note 22 ultra because I really love Samsung and I really want damsung to improve in all of the aspects. It personally pains me to see youtubers making fun of Samsung specially the video quality and I hope that they could fix this. Also I hope that Samsung would cooperate with app companies to optimize the Camera software such as Snapchat, Instagram, Facebook, Twitter etc. Because it also really lacks im these areas. \n Thanks",

Now I own Samsung S21 Ultra and I have same issue. When I got the phone and upgraded it to last firmware, I did wipes of data and cache and factory reset just in case, then installed my applications and copied my data to memory. \nThis is the brief explanation of devices I owned and how its not affected by dirty software installation. Problem is about bubbles and Facebook messenger program. Whenever I try to use bubbles (show all bubbles option) and I, for example have 3 bubbles with notification of new message (orange dot in upper left corner of it) and phone is locked, when I unlock it, first  or first 2 chat bubbles DISAPPEAR, alongside new message notification! Same story if its only one bubble active, after unlocking screen message notification disappears. Only workaround (kinda) is to use bubble option (only contacts I select) and open 1 bubble, that is only one that works correctly! If I use it for more than one person, same problem happens like described for (show all bubbles) option. This seems to me like Android or Samsung firmware bug and I am reporting it here.

I see that for some reason, a good amount of people seem to be requesting the opposite of what I want to be a feature on One UI for the S21 series. Coming from iOS, I am used to my phone screen waking briefly when I receive a notification, as this is a default setting. \nTo me, this is an awesome feature because it allows me to quickly look at my screen, without having to interact with it, and see what notification I just received. Because of my job, I always keep my phone on vibrate only and it doesn't make sense to switch back and forth so it can ring after work hours, since I may forget to switch back to vibrate and my phone might start going off while I'm in an important call or meeting. \nI also have a Galaxy Watch 3, and I was surprised to see that in the settings, there is an included option to \"turn on the watch screen when  Notifications are received.\" This only helps me when I am wearing the watch so when I don't have it on, I have to constantly check to see if I missed any notifications. If the phone is near me, I sometimes don't hear/feel it vibrate, but I'd the screen turns on, it immediately gets my attention. \nTo note, I mostly use Whatsapp for messaging and to my knowledge, the Messages app is the only one that wakes the screen when messages come in. \nIf this setting can be enabled for the watch and for messages, why not have it as an option for the phone itself? \nIt is clear that Samsung is trying to capture a portion of the iOS market and it will only help them more to have some features that people coming from iOS are accustomed to. Even if it is only enabled in vibrate mode, that would already be huge for people that are used to having this feature on their iOS devices.",

    "context": "I've been a Samsung Brand Loyalist since way back when Samsung TVs overtook the Sony Trinitron line of TVs as best in class and consumer purchase numbers. I'm not completely certain what the original appeal was beyond that or why the likes of LG or other equivalent brands of the day got no love from me back then. Fast forward to today, and I know exactly why. The second Samsung Galaxy smart phone I owned was the Galaxy S5, and that phone was a large part of why Samsung earned my loyalty. But the relationship would not be completely solidified until the company severely <edit> in the design of that iterations replacement. \n  When the Galaxy S6 line was released, I was beside myself with frustration, confusion, and basically severe disappointment. While the new S6 designs were the impitus of those negative reactions, the focus of my ire was squarely on the company itself for basically designing out the very features that compelled me to purchase the S5 in the first place. They decided to eliminate the removable/ replaceable battery back when carrying around an extra fully charged battery for your phone was commonplace. They decided to eliminate the \u00bc\" headset jack, doing so before quality Bluetooth headsets were hardly affordable and Bluetooth LE wasn't even a thing. And then they decided to eliminate the MicroSD card dock way before the concept of reliable cloud storage was anywhere near as widespread as it needed to be. \n  There were more features that were curtailed and/ or eliminated in the S6 series, but these were the three that I found to represent the common underlying offense which lead to Samsung choosing to make these changes, an error that is far too commonly committed by manufacturers and service providers across the economy. Samsung simply chose that the S6 series was going to be the pivot point where they would abandon the needs and desires of their core global customer base, and instead of offering hardware that met the needs of this customer base, they would now begin to mimick the designs of their most challenging industry competitor, the iPhone. The Samsung Galaxy mobile hardware division simply lost its way and tried to be something they were not, and which their customers didn't want them to be.\n  Life's most valuable lessons are almost always delivered in the most painful experiences possible. There isn't a company in existence that hasn't dropped the ball in some way or fashion. It's actually a healthy process to go through for most, assuming the after action review of the failure is analyzed and corrective actions are taken. As is the case with individuals and companies alike, there is no greater catalyst for improvement or the gaining of knowledge then that which results from a complete and total failure. It's all about how that failure is handled and leveraged.\n  Once the anemic S6 features, or lack there of, were released and those like me who had been excited to upgrade but quickly became resigned to keeping the older phones we had, it wasn't long before the magnitude of the design failures started to become clear to Samsung leadership. I was only one of probably millions of disappointed people who were ready to buy the new S6, but decided not to. While I'll never know how many were compelled to voice our frustrations directly to the company via a very terse, yet well crafted email, I'm willing to bet it was a whole lotta people. \n  We were Samsung customers for many reasons, one of the most significant being that Samsung was NOT iPhone. We chose Samsung because they didn't try to push it's customers into recent innovations in technology which were both excessivly priced and still unproven, something iPhone is always doing. We chose Samsung because they offered phones that were designed with utility and user customizable features that empowered us to make the phone work best for our specific needs, not a one size fits all mantra like iPhone. So what on Earth compelled Samsung to try and be the very company they were valued as not being? \n  My loyalty was cemented a year later when Samsung released the next iteration of the Galaxy line, the S7 series. It was one of the first times I had been watching closely enough to see what it looked like when a multinational corporation chooses to listen to it's customers' collective needs, and I was beyond impressed. They didn't bring back everything, removable batteries were never going to remain mainstream, especially as the technology becomes more and more capable with each iteration. But sure enough, they heard us, they listened to what we were saying, and they reversed course with the vast majority of features. The fact that I would quickly grow to despise my S7 Edge on account of the Edge feature, Samsung was back on track!\n  After beating <edit> the S7 everyday in my steering wheel everyday when the stupid Edge screen would come into contact with a part of my hand and erroneously do things to enrage me, I knew I would never purchase another phone with that utterly worthless gimmicky feature. The problem was, they decided to make that Edge thing a standard design feature with all of the following year's S8 series phones, much to my dismay. But patience paid dividends for me when I read about the mid-cycle release of the S8 Active model. \n  I had never really looked at the Active versions of the older iterations, and I'm not even sure I was aware of them. But this S8 Active had everything I could want, a bigger battery, no stupid Edge screen, and something I wouldn't realize about the phone until I had it for a few weeks. One of the many reasons I'm never going to own an iPhone as a primary cell phone is an experience I had with an older iPhone 5. I don't remember why I had it, but I do remember accidentally dropping onto a hardwood floor from a height no greater than 2\u00bd feet up. From my perspective watching the phone drop in slow motion, I still am amazed at how the moment the frame came into contact with the floor, the screen didn't just crack. No, the screen seemed to enthusiastically explode out as though it had been waiting to do so it's entire life, and in an instant, the iPhone went from useful to useless. Done. \n  I've dropped plenty of Samsung Galaxy phones throughout my life, all from differing heights, some faring better then others, but none exploding in glee like that iPhone. That said, the durability of that S8 Active was ridiculously high, and trust me when I say this, I tested that thing on more than once occasion. In at least one bout of ginger rage triggered by the phone not functioning how I wanted it to, it survived without a scratch after being overhand day pitched into a wall about 6 feet away, the sheetrock suffering all that damage (I've since repaired it because it wasn't the sheetrock's fault!). \n  I would be compelled to maintain that S8 Active for years beyond it's dated technology because Samsung, for whatever reason, decided to do away with all Active variants in any Galaxy iterations that would come after the S8. Why, why do you do these things Samsung? The S21 Ultra is a beast which almost has the feel of an Active model once tucked into the Spigen case I use for all my phones. But I bet there is plenty of demand for an S21 Active if you made one. No, the corporate rugged XCover model that sorta looks like an Active doesn't rate. My <edit> 3 year old S8 Active had a more powerful processor and better features than that underdeveloped model offered. I want all the Gucci hotness you guys stuffed into this ridiculously capable S21 Ultra offered in a <edit> housing that can easily shrug off an occasional overhand fast pitch into a wall because I know you guys can build it. If you do this and relaunch the Active models, I'll be a Samsung customer for life. If you don't do it, I'll still be a Samsung customer for life, so I'm really not in a position to negotiate. Do it to make the exploding iPhones screens look even more stupid!",

    "context": "Hey Samsung,\n  Like a lot of other people on the internet, I've seen the \"leaked\" images of the Samsung Virtual Assistant; Sam. I've also read that that was like a concept. Not something that was necessarily intended for actual implementation. I also know that there was a Project NEON that was in development. \n  Now I don't know if those two things are, or could be, related. But if we don't receive a NEON virtual assistant on our smartphones, could you at least make the Samsung Sam virtual assistant a reality? Even if it it were in the Tips and Help menu or on display devices. She could show the user how to perform different tasks; what they look like in the real world and on the phone. \n  For example, she could demonstrate how to use Single Take Mode. Displaying the screen of the phone and showing her actually tapping on the necessary buttons to get to that feature. Then you could zoom out and show her physically turning around or walking around, pointing the camera at a small dog doing tricks. Zoom back into the screen and showing the results in the Gallery.\n  Another example could be a video of her explaining how Samsung Knox works. She could explain it in a very rudimentary way, so that everyone that may not know, or understand, technical terms can understand how exactly it works behind the scenes. Because people still believe that Apple has the highest security in the mobile industry. \n  It would be a missed opportunity for you to not use something that could be very beneficial. A lot of consumers need that type of visual aid to understand their phones. Especially when they don't have a real person to go to in order to learn how to use their device. Samsung Sam could help a lot of people and could also be a reason they continue to stick with Samsung devices in the future.",

Like cutting grass, work areas whatever. The audio is so super low. \nI spent the last 90 minutes rebooting, turning off Disable Absolute Volume, using samsung good lock, samsung sound assistant. I tried 5 sound boosting apps. Something phone side is negating the boost. Sometimes you hear it turn up for 1/2 a second for it to kick back down.\nWe need a solution there is tons of people complaining. Booster apps are BS, it should be built in or the very least the samsung sound assistant should help me more. We get it, it's a safety thing. Give me 5 pages of click thru legal waivers saying not recommended. Then build in a bluetooth volume boost.",

I did not recieve email or notice of the promotion, so I did some research that went no where. I had to get help from Samsung via Text Chat.

They made it sound reassuring that this time someone would contact me after confirming the promotion. Just a few hours before I got an email. They said the promotion was online after my purchase was completed and that I was not able to redeem. Offered $25 credit for my troubles. I neither confirmed or denied the credit, just tried making it clear that there's no reason to deny me of the promotion. Clearly, the app recognized I made a purchase for the Galaxy S21 5G. I don't think the promotion would be on my homepage of the app if it didn't apply to me. Stills shows today. It simply says I \"bought\" the phone, register to redeem. I have registration proof.

    "title": "S21 frustrations",
    "context": "I switched from S8 to S21 a few weeks ago and although I like the hardware, I'm quite unhappy with the software. I'm hoping to learn about fixes or workarounds to the issues I describe below on this forum, but if not, using it it's becoming too frustrating and I'll probably have to return it.\n1. Smart lock (SL) is hit or miss - it used to work well at the beginning, then it stopped working altogether, now it works sporadically regardless of whether I'm connected to a trusted device, in a trusted place or when in my pocket (On Body Detection). I asked Samsung tech support for help with this, but after trying several ideas (restart phone, reset google account etc) they said to do a hard reset, which I didn't want to do even if it works - there is no guarantee that won't happen again, and I don't feel like having to set up my phone all over again each time there is an issue due to buggy software.\n2. Battery life is poor\n3. The fingerprint sensor (FS) doesn't work with the screen protector I bought, and based on various online reviews, I'm not sure if there is a screen protector that is guaranteed compatible with the FS.\n4. Navigating from the Always On Display (AOD) screen to the home screen (HS) is an arduous process: first I have to double tap, which takes me to the lock screen (whether the phone is locked or not), there I have to swipe and, if I'm lucky, the phone is already unlocked by SL, but most time I'm not lucky and I have to enter the pin or password and I'm finally on the HS. This gets quite tiring when I have repeat it each and every time I need to use my phone. This process can be circumvented by enabling the FS on the AOD screen, which would then take me directly to the HS, but FS doesn't work with my screen protector (see 3). Also, when the phone is unlocked, double tapping on the AOD screen should take me directly to the HS, no need to see the lock screen, just to have to swipe. In fact this whole AOD/Lock Screen functionality seems rather poorly thought out.\n5. The S8 has a virtual Home button, which when pressed hard takes me directly from anywhere, including from AOD, to the HS if the phone is unlocked due to SL. Since SL worked well on the S8, I didn't have the problem described at 4. This button has been removed in the S21 (not sure why, it seemed like a very useful feature) and replaced with the double tap, but that's less convenient than a simple press (to me at least), and it doesn't take me directly to the HS anyway.\n6. I would like the clock on the AOD screen to show seconds (optionally) for cases when I need a quick timer with second level resolution. Currently I have to unlock the phone through the steps described at 4. start the timer app, then start a timer. Having seconds on the AOD screen would be so much more convenient. Some say that this is not an option because it would drain the battery faster, but knowing how things work under the hood, I don't believe that's the case. The S8 didn't have seconds on the AOD screen either, but I could live with it since there weren't other major inconveniences. On the S21 that's one added frustration.\nAny ideas would be appreciated.",

They asked me to take the phone to a Samsung care center, I blocked an appointment and went to UBreakIFix Samsung care center in Bellevue, they said it is a motherboard issue and that they don't have to ability to repair it. They recommended me to call Samsung customer care again and said that they would replace the phone. \n When I reached out to Samsung customer care again and summarized my UBreakIFix experience, they said i will need to mail the device to Samsung and I won't be provided with a loaner phone in the meanwhile to use too for a good 10-15 days! \n I have a huge family of Samsung devices, and this frustrating experience makes me want to switch to Apple ecosystem.",

It also unlocks my apps very quickly.\nWhat I'm finding is that I have to 'retrain' the sensor every 5 - 7 days. By 'retrain' I mean that I have to remove all my thumbprints and set them up all over again. After that, for the next 5 - 7 days, the phone's fingerprint sensor works really well, until it gradually stops recognizing my thumbs and I have to setup everything from scratch once again.\nSetting up my thumbprints all over again isn't that big of a deal. It only takes 2 or 3 minutes. But it is an inconvenience to have to do it every week.\nIf this sounds familiar to anyone, is there something I'm missing? Could I be doing something wrong, or am I missing a setting somewhere in the phone? Why does the sensor seem to 'forget' my thumbprints? Thanks for your advice.\nAttention Samsung Moderators: I have already tried all the steps listed here https://www.samsung.com/us/support/troubleshooting/TSG01200322 including the other steps after the \"No, I need more help\" option on the page, including the video \"How to setup fingerprint security on Galaxy phones.\" I ask you kindly not to suggest these steps again and then mark my question 'solved.'

The last 2 months have really been a disappointing nightmare. \nI needed a new phone for my new job. I'm an artist and designer. The job requires that my phone has to be able to complete certain tasks. Two of the most important being that the phone can perform 3d scans and that it is S-Pen compatible (it must be able to use the pressure sensitive pen). I made this very clear to the salesman when I bought my new phone. Unfortunately, the phone I was sold perform NEITHER of these, making it very expensive mistake, and making me fall behind at my job. I was sold the Galaxy S21+ and was not aware it was unable to make proper 3d scans because it has no Time of Flight sensor. I purchased full coverage insurance with the replacement plan, and my phone bill is now a little over $161 a month, which would be OK financially if it was able to do what I purchased it for. At&t has not helped me remedy this and I have spent many hours now trying to have them switch me.for a different phone. I have now shelled out over $600 in two months. I asked them to let me.send the phone back and trade for a S20 of even an IPhone 12 ( and I can't stand Apple). Yet no help. I have no recourse I guess, other than to say that after this I will never buy another Samsung product again, my wife won't, nor will our children. All over a phone that cost Samsung pennies to make. I am actually shocked to have been treated so badly, and lied to during my purchase. It's a shame.",

This would be great for those who keep their phones for many years and don't want to have to get their battery replaced down the road. Also, it would increase the long term resale value of devices which would likely attract customers afraid of their device not being worth much after years of use!",

Samsung CLOCK app does not show the option until it is 5 minutes before the alarm goes off. Pretty useless.

I googled and did every possible things but still didn't work. Luckily i had other phone to look for solution otherwise my s21plus was almost not useable and Finally after 18 hours i decided to contact samsung and they told me to download one app and after that it started working again. That was a horrible experience\ud83e\udd75\ud83e\udd75\n\nSome apps are still crashing and need to reinstall again. Some apps like alibaba doesn't work smooth, when i search for the app in my phone, it goes laggy, the camara is laggy and takes blurry images most of the times, unless you put it in camara stand. The screen is laggy when i switched from photo to video to other camara option. And the camara won't let you capture things in detail. It has beauty camara like360 .\nSo many issues but i am still using hoping that samsung would fix these issue with software updates but still hasn't fixed one yet which is very dissapointing\ud83d\ude14\ud83d\ude14\ud83d\ude14 i am scared that the app crashing thing might happen again.

I just purchased the S21 Ultra, and was shocked to find out that it does not have the capability to create and add an automatic signature to outgoing text messages!  Whose idea was it to eliminate that function?  Ouch! That is a critical feature in my line of work, and something that I would also consider to be a primary \"common sense feature\" even for more casual users.  How many times have you wondered who sent you a message, because you don't recognize the number?  That happens all the time!  I found out that Verizon has Message+ that would allow me to add a signature.  That isn't an ideal alternative, though, for reasons I won't go into now.  Besides ...  doesn't it seem ridiculous to spend this kind of money on a device and then hope you can find an app somewhere just so you can add a function that should be considered a basic essential of the device?  Sorry to go on so long, but I wanted to be sure there are strong reasons for this request.  Everyone I have mentioned this to is shocked to learn that the device can't do that.  Can you PLEASE get that function added as an update to the S21 Ultra ASAP.  You had it on your previous devices, so the process should be rather quick.  Thank you! \nNOTE: I would like to make some suggestions on a couple of changes to the text message signature function when you add it. \n1) Previously it had about 30 characters available. I would suggest making it at least 60. \n2) Since many people need to use their device for personal use AND for work, I suggest creating a \"toggle\" that gives the user the opportunity to choose between 2 different signatures when they send a message.  That one might be more complicated and take more time to develop.  If so, I would suggest rolling out the first change right away while this one is being developed.",

    "context": "I am very pleased to say that my struggles with the Galaxy S21 fingerprint sensor are OVER  ...  and no visit to UbreakIFixit was needed. That may come as some relief to those who suffered through my anger and frustration in earlier posts. As a token of my appreciation to you all for putting up with me, I am glad to share what I learned.\nIt certainly could be possible that your fingerprint sensor is, in fact, defective. This is, after all, a new phone in its first months of production. But you should try these steps first, before making a visit to Ubreak.\nYou should watch a few videos of people who really know how to work with the fingerprint sensor successfully. Watch how they register their fingers; watch how they use the sensor to actually sign in. That was my big \"Aha\" moment. So that's the way you're supposed to hold your finger! That's the way you're supposed to press on the sensor! Who knew?\nAnd on the subject of your finger: Don't use your finger - use your thumb. You're giving the sensor more skin to read.\nOnce you have successfully registered your thumb(s) or your finger(s) don't stop there. Go ahead and practice unlocking your phone with the fingerprint sensor. Do it several times. The more often you do this (up to a point, probably) the faster the sensor recognizes your thumb/finger.\nNow that you're getting the hang of it, watch a video from a Fingerprint Master, like \"Jimmy is Promo\" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9v3H1dOyQc to learn secrets for making the fingerprint sensor work faster. This stuff really works.\nAt last, I have unlocked the secrets of the Galaxy S21 fingerprint sensor! Now, instead of using my middle finger to talk to my phone, I use my thumbs to unlock it.",

One UI has significantly improved over time with new features, but the animations and overall look and feel stay the same. At times they can be fast, but there are a lot of times where a quick gesture is made or if you swipe in a certain direction, and the animation lags or skips frames. The new Samsung phones have such great screens and they are capable of so much more than what they're given. Samsung has taken shots at Apple, such as the iTest website made to show off One UI on an iPhone. Adding faster and smoother animations would be another great way to bring One UI even closer to the top of the competition. And it's very likely that One UI 3.5 is coming soon, and I think it's a reasonable goal to make smoother animations by then.\n\nPlease, make One UI smoother and even better for us all!",

    "context": "Before the S21 line up was unveiled, the S9 and S10 series of Samsung phones were a few of my most favorite Samsung phones out there. The slim/sexy redesign of the S8 was a refreshing addition though the S9 was pretty much the PERFECT Samsung, refining the problems with the S8. The S10 however was the biggest refresh of all and generally way more exciting than the S9 announcement. I loved most things about the S10 series, the design, the bezeless like quality. It was a great phone for the year 2019.\n\nHowever, something about the S21 is deemed to be my new top personal favorite of Samsungs. The S20 was pretty cool but pricy at the 1k USD price tag. Also, the deisgn didn't really amaze me. I found the design to be underwhelming and the software of One UI 2 at the time was alright. But One UI 3.1 running on an S21 phone has been the best experience of a Samsung I ever gotten. Despite the less GB of RAM than the S20, the plastic build quality on the back compared to glass like the rest of the other phones, going from my S20 to my S21 felt like a minimal compromise experience. They have both run very smooth, I hadn't noticed any drawbacks with performance, and all in all, I love the sexy but clean design of the S21 way more than the generic lookin S20. With a new better processor, visually more appealing design with even slimmer bezels, this didn't feel like a downgrade at all! Plus, a flat display is a lot more practical than a curve!\n\nSo basically, I like the hardwarw design. Software wise? Probably the best of Samsung's software right now. Fluid and smooth especially on 120hz. Feels very modern and simple just like Samsung's software has been for a while! Definitely way better than the Samsung Experience OEM from 2017, those were some darker days. I think the S21 is a perfect candidate to new users switching from other brands of phones if they ever want to use a Samsung!\n\nIt has:\n-3 Years of Software Support\n-The best of Samsung's current UI\n-120hz and a great looking phone\n-Good performance and overall good battery life, not great but good.\n-Despite build quality, look at that camera setup, quite gorgeous.\n-Barely a difference in smoothness or perfromace than the S20 despite less RAM\n-Miminal Lag (at least for me using the US varaint)\n\nI believe it's a very good package and showcase of what Samsung has to offer in a phone. I've been loving the 120hz, the design, and the overall experience. Not everything is perfect, I can make critical points about Samsung's fesign choices, consistency, animations, etc. But overall, it seems to work pretty well as of right now. and yeah, the S21 is my favorite Samsung so far.",

I don't have wireless earphones so I bought USB type c earphones, music sounds great but voice recording quality is really bad with noise and crackling. It's not a headset issue cause I tried a couple of different headphones and there's always the same issue, I even tried an adaptor 3.5mm jack to type C to check with regular earpods but again didn't work.\nSo I'm wondering is anyone else facing the same issue and any idea how can I fix this?

I'm thankful you added the IF condition in Bixby Routines, \"Battery Equal To Or Above...\" so I can ensure I don't let my battery get to 100%. But can you please add a customizable kill switch into Battery Saving settings that stops the phone from accepting a charge passed a chosen percentage?\n\nAs you know, until you revolutionize these batteries, they can only accept so many charge cycles before they begin to steadily degrade. We are no longer recommended to let the batteries fully discharge and fully charge as to keep their \"memory.\" That's is harmful to the batteries nowadays. Since you are offering up to 5 years of security updates now, it would be highly beneficial for the customers (especially those that may not be able to get a new phone every few years due to very tight budgets and fixed incomes) to be able to have the phones charge overnight (as a lot already do) but stop accepting a charge at 80% - 90%. \n\nI'm assuming the reason you haven't implemented it is because Apple may have a patent or because of planned obsolescence. But I'm sure you could find a way to implement it in such a way that maneuvers around their patent. But as far as the planned obsolescence, so that customers will still buy your future phones, you could stop bringing current phone features to older phones. Like camera improvements and such. Causing customers to have to buy the new phones if they want those features. ",

I installed Facebook on both phones and Samsung took like 25-30 secs extra. \nSo is it a software bug or what...coz it's really frustrating when you need apps to install quicker.

    "title": "WiFi Calling Keeps Turning Off And Low Receive Signal",
    "context": "All,\nI had posted about my WiFi Calling turning itself off. For some reason after a Moderator replied to my post, I can no longer reply. It keeps telling me that either I didn't verify my email address when I signed up (I'm getting email replies when someone posts), or something else I can't remember. So here we go.\nThe Moderator was likely blaming my WiFi router, and telling me I'd probably need to buy an amp ($400 for a good one), or buy a newer router.  I'm not about to do that after spending money on an expensive S21+.  I shouldn't need to. According to US Cellular's maps, I'm in a strong signal area and should even get 5G. Nope. Never seen the 5G icon at my home. And someone I see \"No Cellular Service\". \nMy Asus AC66R is fully updated to the latest firmware and put's out a strong -35dBm signal. And I also have repeaters in the house where I need them. Oh, and I work at a large company that has about 1000 repeaters that are less than a year old, plus a state-of-the-art WiFi system in the building. My WiFI Calling turns itself off there too. There's several repeaters just in the lab I work in. \nFurther, he stated that WiFi Calling is a Carrier specific function and so it has to be a carrier problem, not a phone problem. NOT !  WiFi Calling \"ability\" is carrier specific. The \"function\" of being able to turn it on or off IS WITHIN THE PHONE'S SOFTWARE. The carrier has no ability to turn my WiFi Calling switch on or off. Strike two from Samsung Support.\nLast night while trying to turn it on, it kept asking me for my 911 info which I'd already put in a few days back. Every time I'd press on ACCEPT, it would loop back and ask me to put it in again ... over and over and over. It would never turn on the WiFi Calling then. That smells to me like a software issue.  But I'll admit, it could be a hardware issue too. \nI just got off the phone with US Cellular's technicians, and heard two very interesting things:\n1. The problem with WiFi Calling does not happen with ANY other brand of phone they sell ... only Samsung. He rattled off about 6 other brands they sell ... no WiFi Calling issues with any of them. Only Samsung. It is a known issue that they have talked to Samsung about many times according to this technician. \n2. The weak signal receive that is making me need to use WiFi Calling (never had to before with any other phone I used including a Samsung S8+) is ALSO a known problem with the S21 phones. They've also talked to Samsung about this.\nI wish I'd known all of this prior to buying a Samsung S21+.  And the other mistake I made was buying the phone directly from Samsung,  having to deal with support staff there that don't know what they're talking about, and shipping phones back and forth.\nOh ... I'm an RF Engineering Technician for a large Aerospace company. I don't know much about cell phones. But I do understand software and RF signals. ",

If I start playing the song on the speaker and then connect my Buds, audio cutting always follows. After clicking the song a few times, the song plays normally. However, these newly purchased songs are totally unplayable using Android Auto, as the audio cuts out every single time I select them.\nI have re-installed the Samsung Music app and re-downloaded the songs with audio issues from iTunes multiple times, to no avail.

I was hoping I can post about this here because my problem involves a Smart TV; I assume that those belong in the Smart Home category? Perhaps I should have asked this in the Samsung Apps/Services? -shrugs-\nAnyways, here is our issue:\nWhen casting a phone's screen (Galaxy) to a Samsung Tizen Smart TV using SmartThings and/or Chromecast causes the Galaxy phone to be unable to send or receive calls. Multi-tasking with anything else on the phone while casting media to the TV seems to be working fine - e.g. texting works & notifications pop-up on the phone even while casting media via youtube, SmartThings (Screen Mirroring) or Google Home.\nSo what is going on here? I went through most of the settings and did a little light google searching but was unable to fix this issue. I mean, like, shouldn't phone calls work while casting? I was pretty certain that there would be a notification popup on the phone/TV when receiving a call - especially if you can't talk on the phone while casting, but apparently I was wrong?\nI could have sworn that my iPhone (brother got it for me don't ask lol it's actually a decent phone ... but that's a whole different story that we just won't get into :D) was able to send and receive phone calls when casting ... or it would at least give me a notification so I know.\nAnyways, what am I doing wrong?\nAny advice on how to troubleshoot this?\nAssume I'm not a complete newbie and have done the more basic things already.\nEither way, any help is appreciated for the simple fact that time was taken to read/reply, :).\nA few things:\n- The phone can send and receive calls when it is not casting.\n- The devices in question include both Samsung devices: Samsung's Galaxy & Tizen Smart TV.\n If it turns out that this is something that is well known and phones simply are not able to send/receive calls while casting to another device then ... well... dang.\nI just assumed that such a possibility is incredibly unlikely in this day and age ... but I do always say assuming can be dangerous... \ud83d\ude1e",

For some reason, whenever I plug in a USB-C to 3.5mm headphone jack adapter (Samsung EE-UC10JUWEGUS) it changes the charging speed to a slower one. As soon as I unplug the jack adapter it goes back to fast charging. I tested my phone out with other Qi chargers that support 10W fast charging with and without the jack adapter and I get the same results. I then tried plugging in a normal USB-C cable (not connected to any power source) and the wireless fast charging worked fine. Therefore, the problem must be with USB-C to 3.5mm jack adapter. I tried using an older Note 8 with the jack adapter and the wireless fast charging worked fine.

    "context": "I ordered my S21 Ultra 128g titanium on Jan. 27. No where on the site or any notice from within the ordering process was I notified of any type of delay. I first started calling about 10 days after my order as it has been shown under the status from day one as \"expedited\". I spoke with a rep and they said because I ordered titanium that it would be longer since it was a special order. I was seriously unhappy with that response since NO WHERE on the site or within ordering process did it say that special color schemes (or the like) would take longer to process being a special order.\n\nThey couldn't give me a timeline, only that it's *expedited* in the shipping process order status. The add-ons were free but they have a ship date of March 31, but it doesn't say that the phone itself will be shipped on that date. Is the wording to upkeep hope that the phone will come sooner and the rest at the later date or that is the overall actual date of the phone shipment but they don't want to ward off buyers for taking so long? Who knows (I'll admit I wouldn't wait because the point of getting the newest release is that one gets it relatively close to that release date).\n\nAnyway, I tried to cancel three times and after the third time when a rep said it could be done, I received an email saying that due to manufacturing process it has to remain in the system, that I can just reject it when it gets shipped to me (this was said by the first two phone reps). Seriously, that is how one cancels an order, like they're making it appear that it's a carved in stone process. This is yet another way to get the customer to just take the phone upon arrival. So, I ask if I order a black phone how long that would take, they said about 2 weeks. But after reading how some here are waiting a month for just that color scheme, I am totally put off .\n Here's the real kicker; just got an email today (February 19) that my order is now delayed (remember what I said about March 31) and that my phone will ship no later than April 7 (or before). So this kind of confirms that my order wasn't going to ship until March 31 along with the add-ons. Just WOW, two and a half months after ordering this device will I get it. Darn, that will be pushing into the next Samsung releases of phones!\n tl;dr\n Ordered S21 Ultra Titanium on Jan 27, got email saying that it won't be shipped until no later than April 7, that's about 2.5 months! :grimacing_face:\n Edit update: having a online chat abt the delay the rep abruptly ended that chat. Now trying to get back has an even longer wait. This is customer service for you. I am just going to reject the phone when it arrives. Not taking a phone that's near halfway though a release cycle to the next release in August.\n ",

    "context": "Since the day after I traded in my Galaxy A50 to upgrade to my brand new out of the box Galaxy S21 Plus, I've been dealing with multiple issues beginning with inability to connect to Wi-Fi public Hotspot which I use for everything in my place for past nine years and no check issues even if I have several devices connected. the s21+ wouldn't even see the xfinitywifi broadcast like my other devices do, then it would see it and attempt connection only to get authentication errors. everyone I've ever talked to about wifi issues are robots that all say reboot your modem. I DON'T HAVE A MODEM because I use public Hotspot. sorry for yelling, my blood pressure rises thinking about this. anyway tech says factory data reset (I knew better), but I did it anyway, then it gets worse, lost contacts, important apps from my employer, important vm's, because my ringer refused to operate even, volume was erratically adjusting itself hi low hi low anytime I attempt blue tooth connection, then my messaging app would race my pandora app upon blue tooth connecting as well I would win that by fighting both apps but still my messaging app would stay on simultaneously with pandora. my s21+ I got brand new unopened $1k on payment plan. Verizon said too late for warranty is only good for 14 days after purchase. keep telling these people my issues began on day one and on day three I finally had time to call support the first time. the store I bought it from (go wireless), tried very hard to help fix it but they only knew what settings to check but they were all correctly set. magically they were able to get my ringer to work and called me a couple times while I was there to test. after I get home, my ringer magically would not work once again. since Verizon was trying to rip me off by telling me they can only replace the s21+ under their 14 day warranty with a certified pre-owned s21+ but at that time, it was beyond the 14 day warranty period. I so I got high blood pressure and said NOPE I will be receiving a brand new phone because that's what I am paying for, I did not purchase a pre-owned anything, so let me talk to whoever is in charge of making that happen. team leader put me on hold until his management went home for the day, he checked couple times to see if I was still holding (better believe I was), last time he asked I told him I'm calling Samsung direct then he tried arguing with me as I hung up. Samsung warranty is good for up to one year as is typical for anything aside from landscaping. well they want me to send my phone away with me paying postage and having no other phone, but they will fix it when it arrives in Texas?? why can I not just get a replacement from the store I purchased it from?? Samsung answer because it's most likely a software issue, if it is then it has to go to Google because they are the one's who developed the software. <edit> anybody have any clue how to fix this?? I'm thinking a 20lb. sledge, torch maybe, brick and the river?? but then I'm out $1k for a phone that never worked right out of the box. ",

    "context": "@samsung978531 New S21 ATT variant purchased from Samsung.com 1/27/21, activated on ATT network 2/3/21. ATT unlock database does not recognize IMEI as an ATT device. ATT claims data received from Samsung omitted this device. Samsung claims that unlock codes were provided at time of manufacturer and the issue is with ATT. While I was on the phone with advanced ATT support, they called Samsung support to request an unlock code per CTIA guidance. That request was denied. \n\nIn researching this issue online, it appears to be a common problem with carrier locked devices sold by Samsung.com. I have spoken now to 9 support people at ATT over 3 days. They physically cannot unlock this device without data sharing from Samsung. Meanwhile, Samsung CS pins the blame on ATT. I purchased this device at retail and it is under warranty. ATT agrees that it is eligible for unlock and are willing to unlock the device but cannot without updated data from Samsung. As a customer, I have been caught in the middle. I have sent details via Twitter messenger to Samsung Mobile US with no reply. I have spent hours on the phone with Samsung CS without being offered any solution, only finger pointing. I have provided enough detail for Samsung engineering to work with ATT to provide data necessary for a carrier unlock code for this device. \n\nIf I RMA the device back to Samsung, I will be out a phone and will be forced to waste half a day to set up a new device with no guarantee that it won't have the same issue. There is clearly a communication problem and/or inconsistent policy between Samsung and ATT. I have also read similar accounts with other carriers. IMO, there should be an option to purchase a carrier variant which is unlocked from the factory. There is zero reason for these devices to be locked since they are purchased at retail and not subject to ATT payment plan or other ATT subsidized pricing dependent on service contracts. The unbranded US factory unlocked variant of this device likely does not support ATT features such as HD Voice, Call Protect, wifi calling, etc. \n\nSimply because the IMEI of this device appears in the Samsung internal database does not mean that it appears in ATT's unlock code database. I see this as a database management and data sharing glitch that potentially impacts thousands of customers. Most will not realize that they have purchased a device incapable of unlock until their Samsung warranty has expired.\n\nPlease do not suggest that I contact ATT customer support which I have exhausted in spades. I am asking Samsung to contact ATT and provide a joint solution. This should happen seamlessly without involving the customer. I feel like I have been dragged into a bad marriage.",

    "context": "I just wanted to suggest feedback for the chatheads if at all possible. Right now they're almost perfect to me. The main thing here is comparing it to Facebook Messenger; while if I'm having a prolonged conversation, I'll keep the chathead up. However, often times I'm just replying quickly and will dismiss it immediately. \n\nThe problem here is that Messenger remembers where the chathead was before dismissal and will default to that location when the chathead comes back up after being dismissed. Unfortunately, One UI 3.1's chathead function will always come up on the left of the screen, which is difficult for a righty like myself.\n\nMy only other gripe is that I really LOVE the pop up conversation here. It's great to be able to reply, see previous messages and go over the previous character limit without needing to open the app entirely. I just wish we had that functionality without chatheads. Seeing somthing similar to iOS would be ideal; a quick reply through a button via the notification banner that brings up the same interphase introduced with these systemwide chatheads.",

What made you want to order it right away? Or are you still thinking about it? Do you have any concerns?\n I was thinking about it for few days, but finally placed an order today!\n S21 Ultra (The camera, screen and battery life are the most exciting features to me)\n128GB (I know, never enough, but I looked at my current usage and since pictures and videos are backed up to Google Photos, it should actually be plenty. 256GB for only $50 more was tempting, but it wasn't available in the color I want and the other color ships 3 weeks later too!)\nPhantom Silver (Just like silver or white phones)\nAT&T (Usually get my carrier model to take advantage of advanced network features)\nTrading in Note 20 Ultra (Yes, it's a tough call since the Note is an amazing device, but their pre-order offers are too good!

    "title": "Questions about the S21 line and OneUI Questions/Feature Requests.",
    "context": "While I doubt this will get any traction, I would like to ask multiple questions about the S21 line and OneUI while making feature requests. I would put the OneUI section in a OneUI section of the forum but it doesn't exist. If you agree with my thoughts and/or want one of the things that I mentioned to be changed too, please reply with +1 to the point(s) I make.\n  --Model Colors--\nThe S21 line is beautiful and they look great but I'd like to know why Pink, Violet*1, Grey and White are limited to base S21; Violet, Silver*2, Black*3 to S21+ and all of the Samsung Store exclusives (Gold and Red for S21+ and Titanium, Navy and Brown for S21U, I'm also not saying make these not store exclusives) are limited to their specific models. Each model should be able to get the same colors and be colorful.\n  --Heart rate and SP02 sensor removal--\nObviously this is for money but why did the heartrate and co sensors got removed from the S21 Line and S20 line, these are incrediblely useful sensors to have on a smartphone.\n  --MicroSD Slot--\nWhy has the MicroSD card slot been removed from the S21 line? You gave us 8K @24 FPS which eats up massive amounts of storage, \"8K Video Snap\" which takes 33MP pictures from the 8K frames and upgraded Single Take which also results in a lot of storage usage. The storage options you provide are large but not big enough for this. On the official samsung website*4, it is stated that 1 minute of 8K24 video produces a file of 600MB, per 5 minute videos this equals 3GB video files. A 128GB device gives 110GB *5 usable space which results in 36.3r Hours of 8K24 Video (r standing for recurring), this doesn't take into account any other storage usage from apps or files which makes the 36 Hour quickly shrink. Assuming that 18GB is given to the System across each model, a 512GB model gives you 164.66r Hours of 8K24 not taking into account other files or apps. 164.66 sounds like a lot until you spread it over 24 hour days and it becomes only 6.86 days. There are many users who take video very regularly and will burn through this local storage. I'll continue with this in my next point. There are also users who modify their devices who require persistant local storage for important files such as photos, music or movies for when they are reinstalling or moving to a custom build of Android. This hurts that community. Having a MicroSD card slot also provides the safety for said important files incase of a unforseeable problem occurs such as a major issue or bug in the OneUI build which results in the device or internal storage being rendered inaccessible which might need the internal storage formatted to fix the issue.\n  --Online storage push/soft requirement--\nI understand why online storage is getting pushed as an alternative to the MicroSD card slot but there are many negatives to this solution. The main one being users in countries where you can't get much Mobile data to use because it isn't avaliable or that it is too expensive. Users might not be able to get broadband due to it being expensive, the avaliablity in the area or that they aren't allowed to get broadband for other reasons. By the looks of things, you can't pick your provider so you are forced to go with Microsoft's OneDrive if you can completely disable this intergration, great. I'm also assuming that the provider can't be changed to another provider who provides cloud services over a common standard which obviously makes issues when a user already has a pre-existing cloud solution or if they don't like Microsoft because of privacy or for other reasons.\n  --Allow the user to change maximum clock speed--\nThis one will be the most \"yeah this isn't going to be addressed\" topic within this but I'm still going to say it. These should be put in Developer Options or something similar. I don't understand why there isn't a stock samsung solution to change the clock speed of the CPU/GPU, while this is very niche, there should be a way for users to change their maximum clock speed to a lower value than the pre-existing limit for saving much more battery. I saw a recent video*6 from MrWhoseTheBoss (no affiliation or connection in anyway other than I watch his content) where he did a battery test with the S21U (Exynos) vs 2 other Samsung phones and 2 iPhones and the S21U achieved 8 Hours and 41 Minutes which is impressive but this is a brand new phone which if used for a few years won't achieve the same SoT but if a user could lower their maximum clock speed, they'd be able to get more SoT out of their battery today and in years time. It would be nice to be able to change this on a per app basis. Users shouldn't have to root for this.\n  --Move the Sensors Off quick settings tile--\nWith the latest Android 11 aiming to put a bit more power into the consumers when it comes to consumer privacy and moving the Sensors Off quick setting tile from the Developer Options menu (About Phone > Software Information > Tap build number 7 times > Main Menu > Developer Options > Quick settings developer tiles > Sensors Off) to the Quick Settings menu would help to give more privacy back to the user. The Sensors Off tile for those who don't know, once enabled, stops the Camera, Microphone and all sensors from working until disabled. 2G phone calls aren't affected for some reason. Once disabled, the camera, microphone and sensors work like normal. There should be a box you have to tick in order to use it such as \"When you use this, the following features will be disabled until this tile is turned off\" so the user isn't stuck in wondering why these isn't working.\n  --Move non Samsung apps away from /system/app // /system/priv-app--\nThis one speaks for itself. Why is Facebook, Facebook App Manager, Facebook Services, Chrome, Duo, Gmail, Onedrive, Google installed in those directories, especially Facebook's apps?\nPlease give the option for users to uninstall Bixby, Dex and other Windows intergrations and other apps which aren't required for OneUI to function or stay stable. Example being the AR apps, Knox apps, the ones listed above, YouTube and other google apps (not including Play Store/Services).\n  --Give the user the ability to modify hosts--\nThis one also explains itself. The user should be able to modify the hosts file for the purposes of blocking ads and malware domains.\n  --Doze improvements--\nIt would be nice to have an option for Doze to be enabled after 5 minutes of the screen being off rather than hours that it takes while the phone has to be motionless. It would be nice that within this mode, motion detection is also turned off to save more power.\n  --Uninstaller improvements--\nPlease make the uninstaller remove all residual files and directories assuming they weren't saved by the user.\n  --Statusbar additions--\nPlease add an icon to the statusbar so users can see the total network activity.\nPlease add an option for seconds to be added to the clock.\n  *1 = Violet is on the S21 and S21+.\n*2 = Silver is on S21+ and S21U.\n*3 = Silver is on S21+ and S21U\n*4 = https://www.samsung.com/uk/support/mobile-devices/meet-the-unprecedented-8k-video-with-galaxy-s20-pl...\n*5 = Number from a 128GB S10+ on OneUI 3, It was 109.93GB total avaliable.",

    "context": "My s21 ultra (snapdragon, unlocked) wifi range is really poor. Mobile data works perfectly, but on wifi I have to be right next to the router to get anything over 2 mbps consistently. \n\nHere's what I've tried: \nReset network settings\nBoot into safe mode (issue persists in safe mode)\nFactory reset phone and opted out of smart switch after reset\nTurned off 5g\nTried with/without bluetooth\nTurned off Google Location Accuracy Restarted router\nChanged router frequency channel\nReset router to default ssttings\nChanged MAC address to phone MAC\n\nI do not see any messages like \"Connected Without Internet\". The connection just says \"Connected\". Very occasionally some apps will cause a message along the lines of \"WiFi unstable, waiting for stable wifi before continuing\"\n\nEvery other device in the home connects just fine, including my previous phone s7 edge. On my s7 edge, I can be on the complete other side of the house and still get reasonable speeds. \n\nWhen enabling mobile data tethering on another device, I can connect to that device's hotspot with a reasonable speed.\n\nWhen checking the speed directly next to the router, I see good speeds, as expected with any device right next to a router. A couple feet or more away from the router, and the speeds are abyssmal as described. It seems the WiFi range on my device has huge exponential drop-off after a couple feet.\n\nMy router is single-band (2.4GHz only). The model is MI424WR rev 1.0. I pay for 100 mbps, my s7 edge gets around 25 mbps consistently, but the s21 ultra gets around 1mbps on average, and very commonly even less than that.\n\nDue to COVID I will likely not be able to test my device on anyone else's router but my own anytime soon.\n\nIs it safe to say the device is defective? Do you recommend I RMA this device? Anyone else with similar issues have advice? Sure one can argue I have an \"older\" router but I would expect this device to at least match the network performance of my S7 edge. It does not make sense to me to say this is an issue with the router.\n\nI have submitted an error report through Samsung Members, just thought I'd post here as well to get more community feedback and discussion going.",

    "context": "As I wait for my S21, I thought I'd ask about the best way to use Smart Switch, especially after a recent not so stellar experience with it when I migrated my wife from an S9 to S20FE. I know there are lots of posts about smart switch but most of them discuss capabilities more so than process.  These are process questions (mostly). I will be using it to migrate from my S9 to a new S21.\n Is it better to run smart switch during setup of the new phone or completely setup the new phone (including Google account, Samsung account, and updates) before running smart switch?\nRelated to the previous question, I have read that there is already a system update for the S21. It is carrier dependent? I.e. do I need to insert my carrier (T-Mobile) SIM for it to download the system update? (I know there are separate T-Mobile updates that get provisioned when you insert then SIM. I ordered an unlocked/non-carrier phone).\nIs it better to manually install the apps on the new phone and use smart switch to migrate data, or let smart switch do it all?\nCan I expect smart switch to successfully migrate app logins, or will I have to re-enter them?\nWhen is it best to move the SIM card to the new phone? Before or after running smart switch?\nFinally, USB or wireless data transfer? Given both phones are USB 3.x, USB should be faster right? Current smart switch documentation shows using a USB A-C cable with a C-to-A adapter connected to the new phone. Does it work equally well with the C-C cable (and no adapter) that comes with the S21\nThanks!",

I remember seeing it on release day, but upon checking again to buy it, the $100 off isn't there anymore and instead other mobile carriers besides tmobile have that deal. I contacted Samsung and they couldn't find any proof of it, and of course I didn't think to screenshot it when I saw it..",

    "context": "This is what I know about 8k video recording. I use it frequently on my n20u. For 1 just a 1minute video uses about 1gigabyte of memory. Thats huge amount of data for 1minute of service. Next thing about he 8k recording is it will only load to internal memory while recording. That tripped me out when I was looking for the best memory card I could find. Fone stills records to internal memory. You can only record 4k 30and below if I remember correctly, directly to sdcard. \n\nNext my n20u gets real warm with 8k video recording for extended periods. \n\nHeat kills proessors and batteries. So anything that produces heat above ambient temperatures that you the human can feel in fingertips is not good for any sensitive electrical equipment. All you need is a thousandth of a millimeter gap and it breaks a circuit.",
