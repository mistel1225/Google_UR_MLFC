      " My fault, but I dropped my brand new Pixel 4 in the parking lot at work yesterday.  It was the first time I dropped it, but I knew I would drop it eventually as the official google pixel 4 case that I bought to go with it is slippery.  It fell only three feet but since the lower corners of that case are recessed, my screen shattered.  Of course I’m very upset about dropping my phone, but I am also of the opinion that the official pixel 4 case provides zero protection and I am wondering about the build quality of the phone if it cannot survive a three foot drop.  At this point my plan is to repair the phone and acquire a third party case.  I have bought every model of the Pixel as soon as it was available, and have never liked any of the official cases...fabric...way too slippery!\n",

In that week, they called me at 11:30 pm at night when I was asleep, and promised me on several occasions to call me back and they never did.

I use my fingerprint most often, but I also occasionally use the pattern, which is how I noticed it wasn't working. Fortunately, I could still use the pixel by unlocking with my fingerprint. So I unlocked my phone that way, and went to settings to try to reset the pattern or something. Of course, I can only do that by using the pattern itself. It didn't work there either. There are no problems with my screen or anything at all, my phone just no longer recognizes the pattern. Is there anything I can do? I haven't tried rebooting it because I'm worried that I'll end up permanently locked out when I'm required to input the pattern. I did just make sure everything on it is backed up, so if I need to, I could completely reset it, but that's honestly such a pain, and really, this could happen again anyway, so I'd like to understand what in the world is going on here and know an easier way to fix this. I have been really happy with the Google pixel so far, after switching from Apple phones that kept having endless problems, so I hope this can be fixed. Thanks.\n",
