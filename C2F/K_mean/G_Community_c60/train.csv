Pixel 3 Won’t turn on,I was gifted  a new charger from the Apple store (USB-C) which is suitable for a pixel 3. I charged it overnight as my battery was dead however it won’t turn on.

Issue in the developer options Bluetooth audio LDAC codec: Playback quality on Android 10,"Back in Android 9, the option would provide instant feedback as you selected an option and would keep your selected option saved until you disconnected your Bluetooth device.

"Bought used Pixel 4, and apparently it's got a known issue of incorrectly being locked to Xfinity.","Hi,

  I purchased a used Pixel 4, GSM unlocked.  In a complete coincidence, I was planning on transferring my number over to Xfinity Mobile.  I attempted to do so after verifying on the Xfinity site that my IMEI was compatible with their network.  Ported the number, but the service did nothing since I bought a GSM phone and Xfinity is CDMA.  After the days it took to figure that out, I then ported that number over to Cricket since they're GSM.  Successfully ported the number, I guess, but the phone still says ""SIM card isn't supported. Ask Xfinity Mobile if this device can be unlocked.""  I have spent hours with Xfinity Mobile veryifing that the phone is not locked, not was ever locked by them.  They stated the issue has to be with my new carrier Cricket.  Cricket states everything is good on their end, active phone number, no issues, and that since every time I insert the Cricket SIM it states to check with XFinity to unlock, it must be XFinity's fault.

I've tried a hard factory reboot, and it still gives me the Xfinity message with no service.

A quick google, and it shows many people purchased unlocked Pixel 4 phones directly from Google only to have them show up locked to XFinity.  Google recognized the issue and sent them new phones, and many people received another phone with the same issue. There are multiple threads on Reddit about this, and even an article on 9to5google specifically about the Xfinity locked Pixel 4 issue.

Considering Xfinity has verified multiple times the phone was never locked by them, and even a hard reboot doesn't stop if from saying it's XFinity locked, does it sound like I got one of these phones?  If so, buying it used and having spend 30 days troubleshooting this, is there any chance Google will take responsibility for a known error if it's on a used phone?

Overview/gesture support for third party launchers?,"Hello! I got my Pixel in October and I absolutely love it. There's only one flaw though. I've been a lifetime user of Nova Launcher, which has always been consistently up to date with gestures and the latest aesthetics to come to Android. However, I noticed that in Android 10 (and Android Pie as well) transitions and animations between the Overview menu and the home screen are very choppy. 

I've done some research and discovered that this issue is caused by Google integrating the Overview menu with the launcher, which is a fantastic idea. However, it cripples third-party launchers because the app has to have system permissions in order to modify the Overview menu. So, this makes the Pixel Launcher the only launcher that supports Android 10 animations and gestures properly. The only way to solve this is by rooting your device, which I don't want to do. 

I know that Google had a similar issue introducing the Android 10 gesture nav system and making it compatible with 3rd party launchers. My question: is Google going to eventually fix this, and allow third-party launchers to modify the Overview menu? I would really hate to see Android turn into iOS, with no options available.

"In Canada we have manual call screening on the Pixel 3 XL, but not automatic. Why?","How does a Canadian subscriber to carrier Telus Mobility activate ...

AUTOMATIC CALL SCREENING, and 
Emergency 911 automated automobile crash detection and automated dialing to 911 with conveyance of GPS spatial coordinates.

Google is doing some very remarkable things and not with the intention of making money.

So I have no objection to Google and their surveillance device on me as long as these features are available to me.  I'm very fond of their Pixel lineup of phones even though it would be great if they had a stylus.  If they did Samsung could go peel potatoes with its Notes.

I have to really bow in respect for what Google is doing now and I now have a very favorable opinion of them.  I thought their location tracking was an invasion of privacy and you know what? ... it worked to my advantage when some creep doctor denied that I was at his office on a certain day at a certain time and I shoved the phone in his face.

But what's killing me is that these new safety services are not available to me and my question is why and if there is a hack, a hack that Google will not object to.

Other questions

Who changed Voice 2 of the Google Assistant?
We have manual call screening in Canada and suddenly Voice 2 changes to one that is less pleasant.  Put the original back per favor.

Why is Wi-Fi necessary to activate Google Call Screen after a power off situation resulting from Battery to 0?

This cannot be a regulatory issue with automatic not available in this frozen Arctic tundra because we had a very similar feature called Who's Calling on wireline TWENTY YEARS AGO.

It was developed by Nortel on their Digital Multiplex System 100.

It intercepted all calls from unknown and private callers and asked them to state their names.

DMS would proxy the call to the end subscriber and offer him disposition options.

It later changed.  If you were calling private you had to press a key on a Digitone telephone to release the number ... the number is always transmitted regardless of whether the call is private or not ... there is simply a privacy indicator that is turned on or off.

On the unknown you would have to actually key in your number using a touch-tone set and then DMS would relay that number to the subscriber telephone with a greater than sign  on the name line to indicate that the call might be spoofed.

So then we called that person back at that number to verify that that was accurately entered as the true number.

There are databases out there that know which telephone numbers are wireless and which ones are wireline even after they've been ported and it would be nice if we got a call and we knew.  I don't want to send a text message to a wireline device if you know what I mean.

And one last suggestion ... why not include an integrated barcode scanner in the Google keyboard ... that would be so nice.","Contacts, Calls, Voicemail"

"Pixel Stand is draining my phone, rather than charging it","I have the Pixel 3 for about 2 years.

Every 1 or 2 days I have to reboot my phone. Why? Because if I don't, my phone heats up a lot when placed on the Pixel Stand and it starts to discharge.

Before some ""expert"" (or rather PR agent) of Google comes with a simple list of steps to help and then marks it as a solution... Here's why I think it's simply software. The phone is placed on the Pixel stand (straight). The phone heats up and then starts to (fast) discharge. This is something I can reproduce almost daily. Then, without moving the phone, so I'm not taking it off the Stand, or changing the position, I hold down the power off button and reboot the phone. After that, the phone is still hot, but starts to actually charge. So the problem is not heat, case, position, charging cable, or whatever. It's pretty sure the software.

I already did a full system wipe and side loaded the latest stock ROM on the phone. No effect. This problem is likely a software bug, which Google simply ignores. I've been sending feedback with the system details for months.

When a reboot solves it, without changing any other variables, my guess is that it really is a software issue.

It seems to rip/tear more when I pass vertical objects, almost like the stabilization has something to do with it.
If I have my ear near the phone, which is difficult to do, I can sometimes hear the optics clicking, this may mean nothing

Difference between CA certificate and VPN/apps certificate,"I have been provided with a CA certificate for a SIP telephony app. I think the instructions are based on old android versions; now the installation of certificates has changed and requires install through settings, which I have done.

However, I am only able to install this as a CA certificate, not an 'VPN and app user certificate'. Reading a little about the role of the VPN and app user certificates, it appears that this is what I want.  However, I cannot install the certificate here ('This file can't be used as a VPN and app user certificate').  I have installed it as a CA certificate successfully and it shows in the user certificates but I am not clear quite what this list is used for.  The telephony app is not connecting and I wonder if this might be the problem.

1) What does the CA certificate category do - how is it used by android?
2) What is required for a certificate to be installable as a VPN and app certificate?  Does the vendor need to create it in a different way?
3) If installed as a CA certificate will the telephony app be able to reference it / use it (I do not understand the mechanism by which the certificates are used)

Total newbie here and I'm trying to connect my Pixel 4a phone to my Windows 10 laptop via Bluetooth.,"Total newbie here and I'm trying to connect my Pixel 4a phone to my Windows 10 laptop via Bluetooth. I think my problem is the very first step - turning on Bluetooth on my phone. When I go into settings, it shows that Bluetooth is on but the Bluetooth icon never shows on the top of my phone (see 2 pictures). When I select a picture in files, I'm never given the choice to send the file via Bluetooth. I am given the option for nearby but Windows 10 can only do nearby with other Windows 10 computers. I turned off nearby and still don't have the option to transfer files via Bluetooth. I've rebooted my phone - no luck. I see the laptop in devices but cannot connect to it via my phone (see picture) although they are paired. I have the most recent Android version (see picture). Bluetooth is turned on on my laptop and you can see they are paired (see picture).

What am I doing wrong. Thanks so much for helping this novice!

Assistant and Pixel Ambient Services conflicting,"Enabling Assistant and Pixel Ambient Services (hereto as PAS) creates a conflict in which Assistant can't use the mic properly.

With PAS enabled, Assistant will still ALWAYS respond to ""Okay Google"". However, once the tray opens, Assistant briefly hangs while waiting for the ""What's playing?"" suggested action button to be sent over from PAS.

It appears that in that interval, Assistant is prevented from activating the mic properly, so it never ""hears"" my command and after the ""no command"" timeout interval elapses, and the app will just default to the generic ""There's a lot I can help with"" screen.

This issue occurs 100% of the time if the screen is already off (I use swipe to unlock). Issue is intermittent if the screen is already on and seems related to whether there's enough ambient audio nearby that PAS is actively attempting to identify it (even if that ambience is just noise).

ALL above symptoms are alleviated as soon as PAS is disabled.
ALL above symptoms immediately reappear if PAS is re-enabled.
NONE of the settings found under ""Settings > Google Assistant > Assistant tab > Assistant Devices > [phone]"" affect this issue to any degree and all above symptoms stay constant with any combination of settings.

"Can't manually increase brightness to maximum, when auto adjust is on","I have auto adjust brightness enabled, which works fine, except outdoors in sunny conditions.

When out in the sun I want it to be at maximum brightness. 

However, it only turns to max if I angle the phone directly towards the sun. When I hold the phone normally, it will reduce the brightness and make it harder to see. 

In my precious phone, I would just manually override the brightness, using the slider, to max. 

On the Pixel though, the slider is already at max, even though the brightness is NOT at max. I can only drag to make it even less bright. 

This is very annoying and makes the phone hard to use outside in sun.",Setting up and Personalizing your Device

Intermittent problem with automatic driving mode Pixel 4 XL,"My Pixel 4 XL has developed an issue where driving mode does not turn on automatically, even when the settings are set to turn on when connected to my vehicle.

Google Messages app in chat mode sends SMS when mobile internet is available but WiFi is down,"Hi, I would like to report a problem with Google Messages app.
Problem
When the chat features are enabled and the internet via WiFi is down but the mobile internet is working, the Messages app resends messages via SMS.
More specifically
1. Connected via WiFi.
2. ISP internet is down due to outage
3. Mobile internet is on however but the device is connected to WiFi without internet
4. Chat features enabled over WiFi or mobile data
5. I send a message to another chat message enabled contact
6. The message is sent via SMS without being alerted about it.
The remedy is to send the message via mobile data when the WiFi internet is unavailable. At least try 
I was under the impression that it would try WiFi first then mobile data before taking the recourse to SMS. Clearly the app jumps to SMS in the first instance itself.
I was billed £1.30 by my network provider for international SMS due to the above scenario. My internet via my ISP was down at the very time I was using the chat message.

Pixel 3a Bluetooth Audio Problem With Car,"My Pixel 3a will stop playing audio in my two Mazda cars with Google Play Music if I leave the car and return in greater than 4 hours, possibly less. It has consistently failed to play audio under those circumstances even though everything works fine if I leave the car for shorter periods of time. The music will then pick up right where it left off from with audio. With longer periods of time the track will show but with no sound. I can change the track on the car system and the phone will reflect the change but again with no sound. I can pause the music and that will also be communicated to the phone as well or vice versa. In other words the phone and the car are connected via bluetooth for everything but audio. This didn't occur with my older Samsung S7 Edge over a five year period with one of my Mazda cars and a 3 year period with another one.

If I restart the phone the audio will come back. If I force stop the bluetooth system app and hit play again the audio will start but will have drop outs and be of lower quality until I stop and restart bluetooth again. Clearing the cache and data from the music app does not fix the audio.

I have discussed this with Google support and am running the Pixel 3a in safe mode and will check tomorrow to see it the audio works when I restart my car. This might indicate a 3rd party app may be responsible for the problem. Beyond that, I would have to do a factory reset again and have diagnostic work done at an Ifixit store (hardware?).

I am not confident that Mazda would be of much help and doubt the cars are a problem based on my past history with my Samsung phone. I have spent a lot of time isolating this problem and determining the ""fix"" (restart or force stop bluetooth). I have also rebooted the firmware in both cars and could possibly call Mazda and also check for firmware updates for my cars but this as well as using the older Samsung phone are unlikely or impractical solutions as I don't want to keep using an older phone. By the way, I have also unpaired and re paired both cars with the Pixel 3a.

I know having a Pixel 3a and the Mazda cars narrows my chance of someone else having the same problem with the same equipment. I'm hoping someone else has also experienced this problem with either the same or another combination of equipment. So far, I have not found anyone else on this forum with the same problem.","Connectivity, Network, Bluetooth"

Pixel 3a photos disappearing?,"I have a Pixel 3a that is just 62 days old now. I gave it to my wife as a gift before our baby was born so she could take and store better photos of our baby.

This morning we discovered that the phone made all of our photos more than two days old completely disappear. They are not deleted, they are not in the trash, they are just simply gone.

I have gone through Google Support who tried to help but we weren't able to recover the photos nor we were able to confirm it won't happen again.

Here is all of the information that we can give up front:
- I have only the native apps on the phone (Google Camera and Google Photos).
- I did not do a backup to Google photos. I will do it in the future but realistically it shouldn't be necessary on a 62 day old phone. I'd like to keep my photos stored on the device so I can view them regardless of data or Wi-Fi connection.
- I have restarted the phone a couple of times.
- I have deleted the cache for the Photos and Camera apps, as well as I uninstalled the updates and reinstalled them.
- I have searched for the photos through the ""Files"" app and through ""Storage"". I found some of the old thumbnails but they were deleting themselves quickly as well.
- The photos were not in the trash. A bunch of photos that were supposed to be there (that I put there just yesterday) were there. When I went back in to make sure the photos I wanted weren't in there, trash had deleted all of the photos on its own, even ones only a few hours old.
- I have checked the app permissions and they are all good.
- So far Google's only advice is to wait to see how frequently our 62 day old phone fails. I am of the opinion that just once in 62 days is too often but apparently Google thinks that's acceptable.
- Both Photos and Camera had updates just 16 hours ago.

Has anyone else had this issue? Did you resolve it? If so, how? Can we expect it to continue to fail?

We have very little confidence in this product now.

Any help at all would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you,

Pixel Android 9 phone app cannot use SIP only when there is no SIM card installed.,"I have a SIP calling account setup so the Android phone app can use it to make a VoIP call over WiFi. That works perfectly to make and receive calls.

When/if I remove my phone's SIM I am not able to use my SIP calling account. There is a pop up that says 'chose sim for this call' with 2 options 'Emergency calls' and then another entry with my SIP call account details. Both options are greyed out.

I have a Samsung s5 with LineageOS 16 and SIP calling works regardless of whether I have a SIM card installed. If there is a SIM then the SIP call uses mobile data, no SIM the SIP call uses WiFi.

I'm looking to use my SIP calling account when traveling to other countries when my SIM would not be active.

Number Labels Problem in Phone App,"I noticed this about a week ago when I tried to use Google assistant to make a phone call from Android Auto.  The issue appears to be with the Phone app however because the number type is mis labeled in my recent calls as well.

When I open the phone app the mobile number is displayed as ""Other"" which is why the assistant isn't able to find it.  When I go into the contacts app there is no number listed as other for the contacts and the number that is showing up as ""other"" in the phone app is clearly labeled as the ""mobile"" in the contacts app.

Headphones cause Volume up/down + mic press + ok google - replaced headphone jack and didn't fix?,"Im having a interesting issue. Having a earbud headphone plugged in with a microphone on it results in the volume (most often) going down to mute automatically, sometimes up.....and with the ok google / google assistant being throttle triggered. This behavior persists with the phone screen off and with various permissions removed.
This issue is not the result of dirty or malfunctioning headphones and doesn't appear to be a faulty headphone jack either. Headphones work perfectly fine in mulitple phones including my wife's identical original pixel running the same exact OS version (android 10). I also tested with multiple different branded headphones all have caused the same issue. I went and grabbed a non-mic 99 cent pair of headphones (harder and harder to find) and the issue does not persist.

I ordered a replacement headphone jack that appeared brand new (ebay purchase) and replaced it and thought that would be the end of my problems. The issue persisted after replacing with a new jack.
Since I replaced the jack, as well as tested multiple headphones and confirmed the issue does not exist with a non-mic headphone, this must mean that there is some software confliction going on that is driving my phone crazy due to mic input.

I have spent the last week googling various situations (faulty headset, ok google randomly occuring, volume up/down during audio playback, etc) and tried a dozen + different solutions.
If I remove microphone permission from the ""google"" it does not resolve the issue. It does prevent me from using voice to text however, which to me is a essential function of the phone. This part confuses me. There must be a separate permission that handles the microphone through the headphone. I've looked up the various ways to disable the ""ok google"" function but none of them appear to stop the behavior.

Here are some screenshots showing exactly how annoying this issue is -
https://imgur.com/a/xwOayZU

The first two images are examples of what happens when I deny google microphone permissions. Instead of just blocking it, it just constantly nags me to enable permissions but not only does it nag in the notification pull down it also nags with audio....so it is impossible to listen to music. I installed volume lock to prevent audio volume from being changed thinking I was being smart, only to find out that the constant ok google nag interrupts the audio.

The 3rd image is what happens if I disable voice assistant from google > settings > assistant tab > assistant device (pixel)

It still does the same thing, except instead of giving me the standard ok google response it just pops it up and asks for me to enable permission. Such a worthless feature (permission management) if the same exact problem occurs when you refuse to give it permissions.

If anyone has any idea's for me to try, please advise, I've spent weeks on this now and im completely out of idea's. I love the phone. I love my headjack port. I don't want a new phone....I can replace this phone's screen for $25 if I break it, parts are dirt cheap and its a easy phone to repair. It works great and serves all my purposes and runs the latest android OS to boot.",Google Assistant and Voice Actions

Panning video is choppy,"When taking video in either 1080p or 4K, panning causes video to be choppy or ""stutter"". This only happened within the last few updates. I'm not sure if there is an issue with read/write speed to the internal storage or software issues within the Google Camera itself. It's becoming more and more prevalent recently and detracts from taking nice clear video of those special moments. Video quality has usually been quite smooth but not recently. 

To replicate, take video in either 1080p or 4K and pan slight to the right then left (or vice versa). What you see is what you get essentially. The panning live with choppy or stuttering is shown on playback. I'd expect there to be a fluid video picture as opposed to what I'm currently seeing.

"Pixel 5 Randomly Disconnects Data and Says ""No Sim Card""","I've had my Pixel 5 on T-Mobile for about 7 months and about a week ago it started randomly disconnecting from data and saying ""SIM Card Not Detected"" where my Data icon usually is.

- Restarting my phone
- Removing and re-inserting the SIM card
- Shutting down the phone for a few hours and turning it back on
- Resetting ""Wi-Fi, Mobile & Bluetooth Settings.""

^^^ Resetting is the only thing that has worked. It will reconnect me to Data on T-Mobile, but it eventually disconnects again. It will stay connected for anywhere between 2-12 hours. It is annoying to reconnect to my work and home Wi-Fi several times a day as well as my Bluetooth devices.

WhatsApp creates duplicates in Phone app,"Pixel 2 XL with stock Android.

WhatsApp causes in Phone app a duplication problem for contacts with a mobile number stored with spaces.
Please note that the problem is:

- only in the Phone app and NOT in Contacts app
- only for mobile phone numbers
- only for numbers stored with spaces between groups of digits
- only if WhatsApp is installed and contacts sync is enabled

Please also note that Contacts app is automatically adding spaces between groups of digits when creating a new entry.

So, if in Contacts app I create a new entry named JOHN DOE with a mobile number as follows

+39 xxx yyy zzz (with spaces)

and I give time for WhatsApp sync to kick in, it will show up once when running a search in Contacts app, like follows

John Doe
Mobile +39 xxx yyy zzz (with spaces)

but twice when running a search in Phone app, like follows

John Doe
Mobile +39 xxx yyy zzz (with spaces)

John Doe
Mobile +39xxxyyyzzz (without spaces)

The first search result (with spaces) is from Contacts app, the second search result (without spaces) is from WhatsApp: it's as though Contacts app can do properly the merge but Phone app cannot.

If I edit the John Doe contact entry so that the mobile number has no spaces, so from

+39 xxx yyy zzz (with spaces)

to

+39xxxyyyzzz (without spaces)

the duplicated search result in Phone app disappear.

The following recording
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1psydzk44ifNe2gXwAJ0ofAYrbMbYO2hI/view?usp=drivesdk

shows how a contact stored as

+39 xxx yyy zzz (with spaces)

creates two search results from Phone app (one with spaces and one without spaces) while in Contacts app I still get only one search result.

The following recording
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HtuAlE3DzhqL6dv81UXRTGk2UO7mDqHv/view?usp=drivesdk

shows that when editing the mobile number by removing spaces, the second search result in Phone app disappears.

It seems a combination of WhatsApp + Android stock because

- on my other Samsung and Huawei and Xiaomi phones, the duplication problem does not happen
- uninstalling WhatsApp, the duplication problem disappear","Contacts, Calls, Voicemail"

Phone stays active during calls - proximity sensor doesn't work properly,"When I make calls on my Pixel 3 the phone does not reliably lock as it should.  The proximity sensor works a little bit, but often allows the screen to be active while I'm talking on the phone.  My ear and cheek hit the screen and cause havoc.  It will open all sorts of stuff up, and the most frequent problem is that it hits the mute button causing me to cut out to the other caller.

I have seen other posts about the screen staying locked, but this is the opposite problem.

Here is what I have tried.
- I thought it was a hardware issue but this is my THIRD replacement phone and all three have had the issue.  I have NEVER had this issue with any other cell phone and previously had a Pixel 2 with no issue.  I don't have a weird shaped face, but I'll admit to having larger than average ears.

- I have tried resetting the proximity sensor, adjusting the sensitivity, and even installed 3rd party apps that adjust the proximity sensor.  This didn't work.

- I booted in safe mode and the issue still happened.

- I have tried moving to the beta phone app to see if the new version in beta fixes it.  It did not.

- I have installed every patch as soon as it's out and am currently on the latest January release.

- On my third replacement phone I didn't transfer anything over in case an app was causing the problem.  The issue still happened using the phone straight out of the box with nothing added to it.

I am at a loss.  I'd like to keep the phone but at this point I'm thinking it won't be fixed and I need to return it.  Any ideas out there?","Contacts, Calls, Voicemail"

Hence I can't check in at delivery destinations. Restarting the phone and re-running the app fixes this.

The same happens in other apps, when I switch from WiFi to 4G.

Example 2:
Completely randomly (as it seems to me), I'm told I have no network connection on apps like YouTube and Spotify when I clearly do have connection and can access the internet. I either have to wait a while or restart my phone to fix this.

I'm on Instagram or Facebook and I lock my phone while the app is still open. If I unlock my phone (back onto the app), the app doesn't refresh. I need to close the app and reopen it to get it working.

Pixel 4 unable to scan for LE Coded advertising on the primary channel,"I got a Pixel 4 to do long range testing for an IoT device, but unfortunately, it doesn't seem to be seeing any LE Coded PHY advertising packets when the IoT device is advertising LE Coded on the primary channel.

It sees LE 1M, but if I have to be close to the device to see the initial advertising packet---it defeats the whole purpose of having long range. The phone itself can advertise with LE Coded on both primary and secondary channels, I don't understand why it won't scan when it's LE Coded on the primary.

Other phones like the One Plus 6 and Samsung S10+ seem to be fine with scanning LE Coded on both primary and secondary channels.

0. Am I doing something wrong? Is there something I can do to force it to scan LE Coded on the primary channel?
1. Is this the case with all Pixel phones that support LE Coded PHY? I'll have to avoid them if that's the case.

Pixel 2 XL Camera Fails to open or Load,"OK so I've seen lots of posts about the Pixel 2 Camera failing after a recent update. 

I was one of the people affected by this issue. my camera on my Pixel 2 XL didn't suddenly stop working, it started to fail to load a few times and then it started to fail to load a lot of the time. Finally, after a few weeks, it got to the point where the camera failed to load at all.

 I contacted support and did all the normal tricks like try a different app, clear cache, uninstall updates, wipe phone none of these things worked. 

The only workaround I found was to wave a small neodymium magnet near the camera while opening the app. This would allow the camera to open.  Once the app was open you need to move the magnet away from the phone or the focus would go all wobbly. 

After a few more weeks of this, I found it really annoying to have to remember to carry a magnet around in my pocket. I logged a new call with google and they instructed me to RMA the device. about a week and a bit later I received a refurbished phone from google (which was actually pretty nice since the phone was out of warranty by about a month.) 

Now this phone was way behind in patches. So as a test I would update and then test the camera and update again and test the camera (all previous apps were loaded)

PIXEL 3A XL - Black and Green Lines on the top part of the screen when the phone locks,"Hello,
About 2 weeks ago, I charged my phone with a power bank and it turned off, however it was charging but it was off. Note: the screen wasn't on (like when you charge your phone while off and the battery sign appears, not it was off. I turned it on and noticed it was charging. A day later, the same thing happened (while using a normal charger)
The problem is my phone suddenly flashes lines, and it turns off (black screen) while charging or when the screen locks (screen timeout). Note: It doesn't happen everytime
Then, things went back to normal for a couple of days. However, it's happening again. About 3-4 times per day, my phone flashes lines on the top part of the screen, shaped like thunder (black and a little bit of green, direction: left to right)  In addition, it turns off sometimes, but this usually happens whenever I charge my phone. Also, I sometimes try to unlock my phone while it's charging, and it sometimes turns off. 

I'm afraid that my phone won't turn on someday.

Background: I've had this phone since July 2019. Never had an issue. My phone is in perfect condition, with no cracks. no major accidents, etc. However, I do believe small changes (speed, lagging) started occurring in July of this year, but nothing major. Unfortunately, I am thinking of getting the Google Pixel 4a 5G or maybe just changing to a new brand.

Pixel 4a crash and reboot loop when low battery,"[Pixel 4a, June 2021 security update for OS and Google Play]

When the battery starts to get low during active use (whether it's gaming, browsing, or messaging), the device will freeze without warning. Then it will crash and reboot constantly.
First it happened at 23% battery. Plugging in the phone to charge restored full normal operation.
Then after unplugging, the phenomenon occurred at 13% with constant rebooting. It also occurred in Safe Mode.

I was able to boot the phone into recovery, and when it's in in the bootloader, the device does not crash, freeze, or go into boot loop!

Thinking maybe I needed to calibrate the battery, I left it in the boot loader for a while to drain the battery for about 30 minutes. I rebooted to normal and after booting successfully it was at 9% battery but it froze while still in the lock screen and went back into boot loop until it shut down. Turned on the phone several times until I got the icon showing a battery with red on the bottom. Plugged it in and it started charging, but started at 9% still. Charged fully to 100% and used it normally.

When the phone got to 2%, the issue occurred again. This situation reminds me of two historical issues: The Nexus 6P (that I owned) battery failure that caused shutdown between 20-25% battery remaining; and the old nickel-cadmium ""battery memory"" plague.

I have already performed a factory reset.",Battery and Power

Pixel phones can't use VoLTE(Voice over LTE) voice communication in South Korea.

That's partly because South Korean carriers use a special VoLTE standard called 'TTA-VOLTE'.

And it's also partly because Pixel phones' firmware doesn't include the information for supporting Korean carriers' VoLTE.

The problem can be solved simply by adding a little amount of carrier support information, via firmware updates. iPhones and various Android phones are already supporting VoLTE in South Korea.

South Korean carriers (SK Telecom, KT) are reducing resources for 3G network so doing voice communication with Pixel phones in South Korea is getting harder every year. (Call drop, Low quality voice)","Connectivity, Network, Bluetooth"

Pixel 3 XL won't connect to WiFi or detect SIM after reboot,"For around a year, every time my phone is turned off/rebooted, it ""can't detect"" the SIM card anymore once it's turned back on. Although, when I check SIM status, it still sees basic details. It just says it's disconnected. Additionally, my phone won't connect to WiFi anymore when this happens which makes it difficult to try troubleshooting by updating system software or creating a backup (I know I could back up on my laptop, but I would really prefer not to) and factory resetting my phone. 

I know that it's not a SIM issue because I've tried the SIM in other phones and other SIMs in my phone with the same result. 

I have gotten it to work again a few times before with combinations of turning off and on, removing and reinserting the SIM card, and factory resetting. But I would like a long term solution. Since every time I turn my phone off, it usually guarantees I'll spend about an hour trying to fix the issue. This also leads me to avoid turning off my phone which I don't think is healthy for it in the long run. 

I've tried a lot of things that have been suggested to me and even went through the pixel phone support chat where I ultimately was suggested to factory reset my phone. I really don't want to have to factory reset my phone every time it turns off.","Connectivity, Network, Bluetooth"

I enter wifi password, it says ""connecting"" briefly, then reverts to ""Saved"".

Nothing worked. I tried:
Rebooted phone
Rebooted routers (I have two routers with different SSIDs)
Factory reset phone
Installed Android 10 via USB and ADB
Created open wifi network on router
Rebooted phone, router, factory reset again
Booted phone into safe mode

But then I took it to the library and it connected just fine to the open 2.4Ghz network.

Then I took it to a friend's and it connected to the 5Ghz, but refused to connect to her 2.4Ghz, just like mine. I don't want to use 5Ghz. The range is terrible and it drains  the battery.

Reading many forums, I am starting to think the phone refuses to connect to 2.4Ghz if 5Ghz is present.  Can this be a deliberate feature?","Connectivity, Network, Bluetooth"

Why are close-up selfies sharper on the Pixel 3 than the Pixel 4?,"Selfies taken with the Pixel 4 are not nearly as sharp as those taken with the Pixel 3. 

I've been playing around with this for hours now, and the problem seems isolated to just the front-facing camera. I haven't been able to test this outside with the sunlight, but I used all of the lights in my house and I still get the same result.

I'll provide two photos, the first being taken with the Pixel 3, the second with the Pixel 4.
You can easily see the detail in the facial hair on the Pixel 3 as you zoom in, but on the Pixel 4, all of the detail is somewhat lost and, for lack of a better word, ""blurry."" And it's no small difference, it's massive.

This has been consistent regardless of the use of portrait mode or facial retouching. 

However, as I pull the camera further away from my face, the pixel 3 does seem to lose its sharpness and the pixel 4 provides a close, if not better, image. Is this a software issue, or is this a hardware issue? How did Google not test these cameras out more, and why aren't there more people talking about this?

Either way, this is super frustrating. Just another reason for me to wonder why I even bothered upgrading.",Camera

Pixel 3 camera updates regarding zoom and panorama-- actually downgrades!,"It seems Google has pushed a few ""upgrades"" in recent ""security"" updates which have all been affecting the Pixel 3 camera's user friendliness.
One issue has been about the panorma feature now only available in vertical mode, even if you have auto-rotate function turned on. I only ever take horizontal panoramas, and now Google makes me take these using vertical mode, which is so stupid!

But the main reason for this post: before the recent ""upgrade"", the camera used to have a soft sliding key up and down with 7x the zoom. Now: depending on night mode or regular camera mode, you're only given two options-- 1x or 2x. How is this an upgrade?!  Not only that, there used to be another slide meter on the top side of the camera viewfinder which allowed you to maneuver light/exposure.  Now, that feature is hidden or not available.",Camera

"Original USB-C to USB-C chargers not working, but USB-A to USB-C works?","This is going to be long.
Three nights ago I plugged in my Pixel 2 while it was on with the 3-foot USB-C/USB-C charger from Google.  The morning after, I woke to find the phone, its buttons, and the screen completely unreponsive (including power+down button). I cleaned all my cables and ports thoroughly, and still nothing.   I looked for on this support forum and Reddit for answers and left my phone to charge between the 3-foot charger and the phone's original charger for around 30 minutes, with the red LED light flashing the entire time.

After 30 minutes, I pressed power+down button and was finally able the bootloader menu to appear and selected start. After this, the phone restarts or turns off immediately upon plugging in the 3' charger. Then, I plugged in the original phone charger but this only charges the phone for 30 seconds to 1 minute before the charging stops completely.  I tried both USB-C to USB-C chargers with several electrical outlets with the same results. The only way the phone keeps charging is with an old Google USB-C to USB-A connected to my PC. 

I called Google support and was told to re-try everything I've already tried before, the last part resulted in the phone restarting during the call because I plugged the 3' charger.  I was never contacted again from Google support despite assurances that I would be within an hour and despite having given the tech a second phone number to call.

I tried a factory reset yesterday and nothing's changed.  I tried using the phone's original USB-C/USB-C cable with an old LG Nexus 5X wall charger and was able to keep a charge so far, like with the USB-C/USB-A port on my PC.  I keep an old Anker USB-C/USB-C cable (Nexus 5X approved) with a portable battery on my car to charge the phone with sometimes, and this also works to keep a charge.  
It seems like this is only an issue with the new Google cables/chargers or my USB port is going bad.

"Enable Randomised MAC address on Pixel XL, Android 10","The option to 'Use randomized MAC' under Wi-Fi settings doesn't appear to be there.

I was under the impression this is a new feature of Android 10, which my Pixel XL is running.

Just looking to confirm if this setting should be there, or if it's somewhere else?

Does anyone with a Pixel XL on 10 have this option?

Documents online suggest it should be in the following place;
Open the Settings app.
Tap Network & Internet.
Tap Wi-Fi.
Tap the gear icon associated with the wireless connection to be configured.
Tap Advanced.
Tap Privacy.
Tap Use Randomized MAC

GOOGLE ASSISTANT BUG??,"So I just realised today that my Pixel 3s Google Assistant wasn't working, here's my issue:

It acts like my microphone is broken (Not recognizing any noise at all but it's working whenever im recording videos)

It just works if I change the ""assistants voice"" into another color ask it a question then it'll stop recognizing my voice or there's no sound reaction at all.

I can't retrain my assistant because the microphone doesn't ""work"" whenever i try to.

I tried rebooting/reinstalling google assistant and the issue still persist..

Any solutions for this?? Thanks!",Google Assistant and Voice Actions

"My Belgian Telco provider claims they enabled VoLTE and Wifi calling. However, both are disabled","Hi,

My Belgian Telco provider claims they enabled VoLTE and Wifi calling. However, both options are still disabled (*#*#4636#*#*). My Telco provider claims this is because my phone does not support VoLTE and Wifi calling.

Indeed, officially my Telco provider only sports iPhones and several models from Samsung and Huawei; not Pixels (which, I have to add, cannot be bought in Belgium; I ordered mine in Germany).

When I put my sim in my wife's iPhone, VoLTE indeed gets enabled but Wifi calling does not (which does work through her Telco provider which is different from mine).

The above - as far as VoLTE is concerned; we cannot draw any conclusions for Wifi calling - makes me wonder:  does a Telco provider know what phone you're using and can they enable features based on the phone you're using?
OR
Do I need any Telco specific firmware and/or config on my Pixel in order for VoLTE to work? And if so, what would I need to request from my Telco provider in order for that firmware and/or config to make it onto my phone?

Thanks a lot in advance for anyone who can provide any clues!

Pixel 2 not charging after random shutoff when charging,"My phone is inconsistently charging.

I turned it back on and attempted to charge again, the same thing happened. It now only charges if I clean the port with an alcohol wipe and/or thin card, but even then it's not reliable.

I've used both the original included charger and laptop on several outlets. The charging end works with my computer and both wall outlet ends are fine. I also used compressed air without success.

Google Contacts adds a phone number to the wrong contact,"Google Contacts insists on adding a specific phone number to the wrong contact.

I have two contacts. Let's call them Alice and Barry. Alice has a phone number +44 **** ******. I added this number to Alice's contact details some time ago, though I haven't used it until today, when she asked me to contact her.

But it got really confusing, until I understood why. Google has spotted Alice's number in one of Barry's emails (we're all friends), and Google has decided that this number belongs to Barry. I cannot remove the number from Barry's details.

I edited Barry's details (on the desktop) to delete the number.
On Android (after refreshing the contacts — I had to restart the phone!)
When I view Barry's details, it shows his correct number, but also Alice's phone number. When I edit Barry's details, Alice's number is mysteriously absent.
When I search for Alice's number, both Alice and Barry come up in the search results.
On the desktop
When I view Barry's details, it shows his correct number, but also the message, ""+44 **** ****** from Gmail"", with two buttons, ""Dismiss"" and ""Add"". Pressing ""Dismiss"" shows a waiting circle for a couple of seconds, but otherwise does nothing; the message remains there.
Curiously, when I search for Alice's number, unlike on Android, only Alice comes up in the search results.

On Android, this is confusing other apps such as WhatsApp.

What can I do to tell Google that, no, just because Alice's number appears in one of Barry's emails, it doesn't mean that it's Barry's number?

"Pixel 3a contacts search - cannot open, view or edit contact from results","Hello. I recently moved to Google Pixel 3a and have found that when I use the search function within the Contacts App I am not able to open the contact and see details. If I scroll through contacts I can press a contact and view the entry. When using search however pressing the contact only offers the options to voice call, video call, message and history. Long pressing the contact brings up a menu to either copy number or edit number before calling. 

Essentially it seems that the only way to edit or view contacts is to scroll through to the entry you want. Using search only allows you to contact the contact, not view the entry.

Phone Insists on Going to Slow SA 5G Rather than Faster NSA,"I am on T-mobile.  It seems that 95% of the time when there is an NSA and SA signal available, the phone will choose the SA signal.

This makes for a very significant speed degradation.  Doing a side by side test, with the Samsung and Pixel both using T-mobile postpaid SIMs, the Samsung speed was 154 mbps, and the Pixel was 12.3 mbps.  The Samsung used an NSA signal, and the Pixel used SA.

Multiple SMS messages grouped as unknown sender upon import,"I have recently upgraded from Huawei Mate 9 to a Pixel 3 XL.  I did the setup and data transfer between the two phones through the provided transfer cable and everything that could come over did.  The issue I have is that the SMS messages on the Pixel phone have multiple entries from a sender known as Unknown Sender.  When you view the messages, you see that messages from a number of senders have been grouped into this contact - you can see their profile pictures, their contact details when you press the messages info toggle, but they do not get grouped with other messages from the same contact.  All contacts and accounts have transferred successfully to the Pixel.  I tried a message transfer using SMS backup and Restore (has worked on perfectly on multiple android devices) - all the messages are in the generated backup file and they can be viewed in the SMS Backup and Restore app, and can be restored perfectly on my old Android device, but the Unknown Sender shows up again in Android Messages on the Pixel 3XL.

Phone routes incoming phone calls to bluetooth device when bluetooth device isn't being worn,"When making outgoing calls the phone correctly detects whether my bluetooth headset is being worn and selects the appropriate output (either ""Phone"" or the bluetooth headset).  However when receiving a call it routes the audio to the bluetooth device regardless of whether I'm wearing it.

My previous phone (Samsung Galaxy S8) handled this properly for both incoming and outgoing calls and the Pixel handles it properly for outgoing calls so I believe it's a bug that it's not being handled properly in the case of outgoing calls on the Pixel.

Pixel 4a issues with Assistant when in my pocket and triggering with Bluetooth ear buds,"I just upgraded from a Pixel 2 to a 4a, and I'm happy with it for the most part. But I keep running into one annoying problem on the 4a that wasn't an issue on the 2.

When I leave the house with my Bluetooth ear buds on to walk the dog or go for a run or whatever, I like to use the button on ear buds to trigger Google Assistant to do various things: lock the front door, close the garage door, play some music, etc. This was never a problem with the Pixel 2. However, I am frequently running into an issue on the Pixel 4a where Assistant quickly turns off without responding when launched from Bluetooth. The cause appears to be that launching the newer version of Assistant this way always turns on the screen, and with the phone in my pocket I believe something is touching the screen and canceling the Assistant. I never have an issue when the phone isn't in my pocket. 

Is there any sort of setting to tell Assistant to not turn the screen on when launched from Bluetooth? I shouldn't have to take my phone or if my outfit to launch Assistant.",Google Assistant and Voice Actions

Pixel Charger's Electrode Burnt Off,"This morning, I noticed that my Pixel 2 XL was charging much slower than usual. My deduction was right, when I locked the phone, on the bottom of the screen it says ""charging rapidly, 4 hours remaining"". 4 hours, that ain't right.

That's when I unplug my charger from the electric socket. 
Note: this is a new (used) charger I bought roughly a good few weeks ago, and they were in mint condition when they came in.

I currently live in Indonesia so I have to use an adapter to use this charger (first picture).
I noticed this rather apparent burnt marks on the tip of my charger's electrode (second picture). My guess it's the adapter not properly transmitting the current to my charger and onto my phone, thus the burnt electrodes.

They worked perfectly fine the first few days of having it, and I believe, continued to do so until this very morning. It's either the charger or the adapter, my guess is the latter. Although that is also rather baffling because this adapter came from a notable manufacturer company, Krisbow. 

I'm not looking forward to replacing my charger as it is still very new and costs a premium.

Where is the location of the mic? Relation to Live Cases.,"I recently received a gift. It was a stone Live Case for my 5"" Pixel 2.

Maybe this was Placebo, but the mic on my Pixel 2 did sound more muffled after I called myself vs a naked phone or my old case. Is the location of the mic beside the USBC port or in the speaker slot? Also, is it normal for Live Cases to not include this mic cutout? There is a cutout for the top mic and I know that the 2XL doesn't have a bottom mic so maybe that's a factor?","Contacts, Calls, Voicemail"

Pixel 5 Quick Charge (Charging Rapidly) with Google Pixel Stand,"Hi, quick question please.

I have a Pixel 5 and the official Google Stand.

When I sit my P5 on the stand it states ""Charging wirelessly"", I'm pretty sure it used to state Charging Rapidly. 

If I unplug the cable from the Stand and plug it directly into my P5, it states ""Charging rapidly""

Has something changed that I'm missing ?

I'm pretty disappointed  if the Pixel Stand does not do some sort of quick charge (anymore) !

"Pixel won't charge until change USB to be controlled by ""This device"".","I have been using Pixel 3XL for 3 months, but I have been struggling with charging in the last 2 weeks. I bought some wireless charging stand which only give me a slow charging, so I don't use it that much.

Firstly, My Pixel won't recognize the power from the USB-C cable, then I accidentally place it on the charging stand and It magically fast charging by itself even though I put it out from the stand afterward. So, I have to use this trick every time to revoke and charge my pixel.

After I using that trick for a week, I can't use charging stand to revoke the charging anymore. So, I have to use the slow charging stand instead. Then, I found that there's a USB Preference setting in the notification bar. After I toggled the USB Controlled by: ""Connected Device"" to ""This Device"", I can use the revoke-by-stand charging trick again. but I have to toggle that option every time I connect the cable.

3 days ago, the problem is getting worse. I can't use the trick anymore. So, I have to stick with this slow charging stand. Then, I ordered USB-C to USB-A cable and another wireless charging stand. To see if the problem are due to my current cable or the outlet. Unfortunately, the new cable and stand don't charge normally. I have to toggle USB control option in the USB Preference to let the power come to my Pixel.

I tried connect it to my PC with the new cable and my PC didn't recognize it, I can't even charge the Pixel with my PC properly. I need to toggle that option in the USB preference to charge my phone. And all the options in the ""Use USB For"" are grayed out.

Now, I have to change that USB preference every time I connect with any cable to charge my Pixel. And, I don't know will it getting any worse. It have been auto-update to Android 9 last few weeks, I don't know if that is the reason. Please help me out.",Battery and Power

Pixel 2 battery drama- drained extra quickly when plugged in and now dead and unable to charge,"In a nutshell, my phone said it was charging when it wasn't actually plugged in. Then when I plugged it in it started losing 1% of battery every 30 seconds or so. Now it's totally dead and I when I plug in a charger it doesn't work. 

Here's the long version... 
- I plugged it in to charge when it was at 16% battery
- I came back about 15 minutes later and it was down to 13%, even though it was plugged in and the lightning bolt symbol in the battery icon indicated that it was receiving a charge
- I unplugged it & plugged it back in a few times, and even when it wasn't plugged in the lightning bolt symbol remained. At some point while I was doing this, the battery display started going backwards even faster, losing 1% every 30 seconds or so
- I've tried 2 different cables and 2 different wall plugs and also 3 different wall outlets with no luck, also have tried with both cables into my laptop. There is no external battery case. 
- Now it is totally dead. When I press the power button the battery & lightning bolt symbol come on, and the red light is always on. This is whether it's plugged in or not.

Frustrating Issue with Pixel 2XL Camera,"Hi, a few weeks back the camera on my Pixel 2XL stopped working, the app closes instantly and on the off-chance that it does open, I cannot get focus. I did the following:

- Cleared storage/cache and uninstalled the camera updates
- Installed Android 10
- Updated to Camera 7.0 Beta
- Booted into safe mode.

None of these actions solved the issue.

I then resetted my phone (2 days ago) and that seemed to have solved the problem. However, starting a few minutes ago and while I was taking photos, I again lost focus in the lens and the app crashed.

- changing sims
- the reset WiFi, mobile and bluetooth function
- restarting my phone in safe mode
- full factory reset of my phone (I am devastated because I have lost all my recent photos - since the phone couldn't connect to backup).

Pixel 3 battery life plummets,"My pixel 3 is about 1 year old. From 100% charge to about 70% it drains at an expected speed for a phone as old as it is. However, after 70% it starts draining about one percent per second until completely shutting down. Upon plugging it into the original pixel charger it now charges back to 100% faster than ever, but that doesn't make up for how quickly it drains. I'm getting less than an hour of battery life after a full charge and considering Google has boasted about the extended battery life on it's devices this is disappointing. I've also recently experienced multiple instances of my phone restarting over and over again until it's put on the charger even when it's charged to about 80%. 
Since encountering these issues I have gone through all the troubleshooting tips on the Google support forums including only using the original charging products, checking and deleting problem apps, restarting in safe mode, and even factory resetting my device.

Google Pixel 1 will not charge or reboot. Could this be a firmware issue?," I tried plugging my pixel 1 phone into the charger today and it did not show the battery indicating that it was actively charging...just a black screen. So I took the following steps to troubleshoot the issue (with no luck):
Unplugged the charger from the wall, plugged it into another outlet that had a lamp that was working (to rule out that the outlet was the issue)
Tested the phone with another charger that I had to see if the charger was the issue.
Inspected the charging port to ensure that there was no dust, and that the charger was correctly holding in place.
Plugged the phone into the charger again and tried a forced reboot (hold power button down for 10 seconds)
Tried another form of the forced reboot (hold the power button down button for 30 seconds)
Tried another form of the forced reboot (hold the power and the volume-down button for 30 seconds)
Plugged the phone into a powered-on computer for 15 min, unplugged briefly then plugged back in to see if a red light or anything showed up...nothing
 I thought maybe it was my screen that was the problem, so I called my phone from another phone... no rings, straight to voicemail.

Pixel (1) WiFi connection issues,"Hi,

I bought a first Pixel in US in December 2016. Due to the bug with constant restarting I had to replace it and I got a new device in January 2018. Since then it was working perfectly well until recently when it stopped connecting to WiFi (no matter it is opened public one, private at home or tethering from other mobile).

I've tried all the solutions found in HC and on the web (changing WEP to WPA, frequency of wifi's, etc.) up to factory reset. I've done all the updates up to android 10, but nothing helped. Whenever I try to connect I receive either ""password is incorrect"" or ""wifi is saved, but can't connect"" meanwhile my Pixel 2 and 3 works fine with those networks.

When I reached to support over the chat I was redirected to send it to US/UK for repairing and this would cost me the same as a new phone (I'm based in Poland).

Question: Is there any way to fix it at lower cost or myself? 

I'm quite annoyed with this situation that I have a phone in perfect condition, that could be used for another 4-5 years, but can't do it due to hardware/production issues, not even my fault. And it's the second time that happens...

Issue 2: Phone won't maintain a 5G connection. All correctly configured on network side. Phone will connect to 5G (five bar signal), but will drop back on to LTE within about 5 or 10 seconds. Can force it back onto 5G or a further 5 or 10 seconds (most of the time) with an on/off of Airplane Mode, but phone will then drop back to LTE again. In the Networks > Mobile Networks settings it defaults to 5G preferred but, if you open the setting, only LTE, 3G and 2G are available for selection??? Setting it to 5G only (via *#*#INFO#*#*) displays similar behaviour, except connection drops out entirely without dropping back to LTE, naturally.

Issue 3: Neither VoLTE or VoWiFi are available to turn on via *#*#INFO#*#*. Both are supported for the phone on my network (Vodafone Ireland)

I'd have this straight back for replacement but, considering I've managed to get one WITHOUT a screen gap, I'm hesitant (though the battery issue concerns me, it could be software, but...).

Google Phone App Latest Update: Dialer will not show up during call,"Latest update (December 7, 2019 update) broke the phone app, specifically I cannot use dialpad only while in a call. I confirm this issue is isolated to the latest update of this app, because when I factory reset the phone app the dialpad is able to appear again while in a call. 

To describe the issue in detail: During a call, the icon to toggle the dialpad is there, but tapping on it just highlights the dialpad icon and the actual dialpad never shows up. For example, this means I can't key in an extension or the passcode to access my voicemail while in the call. Other google phone users have reported the same experience under recent reviews for this app on the play store, presumably after having updated to the latest version of the phone app.

I'm on a Pixel 2 running Android 8.1.0. The issue could be limited to this version of Android, but phone users who are stuck with Android Oreo, e.g. Nexus 6P users, would have no recourse to fix this unless they are able to factory reset the app.","Contacts, Calls, Voicemail"
Pixel 2XL shows zero signal bars on 3G (only),"Pixel 2XL shows zero bars reception on 3G (4G is fine) since November OTA update. 

No change following December update. Google Support replaced the device in January which worked fine for one week until catch-up November OTA reduced 3G reception again to zero bars. All other functions appear OK (except for dropped and missed calls). 

On ""3G preferred"" setting phone connects, shows applicable number of bars (signal strength) for location but reverts to zero within 1 or 2 seconds & remains at zero bars ""hunting"" continually for a better signal. If it finds another cell, it connects as above then reverts almost immediately to zero bars. Cell Info app confirms both initial connection strength & the reversion to zero. 
   Google Support has offered to replace the device (again) but it seems highly unlikely given the sequence of events that a replacement device will fix this.

Pixel 2 front camera on/off malfunctions,"I have a Pixel 2 (128GB) that I purchased about four months ago in almost-new condition off a corporate program. Like many, the front camera began to crash a couple of months into ownership, and I tried all the suggested avenues:
Force stop the camera app, clear data/cache
Restart in safe mode
Look at update rollbacks, try different camera apps, etc.
Reset the device to factory settings

None of these worked, and because I didn't have time to send in the device for repair, I resigned myself to not having a front camera. However, when the device received the PQ2A.190405.003 update, the camera started working again.

Imagine my surprise.

I was equally surprised, however, when I tried opening it this morning (4/14/19), and it's back to not working. I've again tried all the steps that are suggested, but nothing has worked.

What's interesting is that this time the app doesn't crash. When I select the front camera, the app pauses for a second or two, then simply acts like nothing happened and I'm taking a picture with the back camera.

Accidentally answering calls when retrieving phone from pocket,"When I receive a call (or text) on my Pixel 3a while in my pocket, the screen activates and responds screen interaction, while still in my pocket.  The problem I have with this is when I receive the call and I reach in my pocket to pull out my phone, often my finger will touch the screen and send input, which has caused unintended actions, such as accidentally answering a call before I even get my phone out, accidentally using the screen call feature, or accidentally denying the call.

I believe the Pixel 3a must have a sensor on the front of it, so I think it should be able to use this to determine if it's in a pocket, or face down on something, etc, like for the do not disturb feature.

The solution that I'm looking for is to receive the call or text, but the phone not respond to any screen interaction as long as the sensor believes the phone is in my pocket, then when I retrieve the phone from my pocket, I can then interact with the screen.

I am not interested in any third party apps to solve this issue, as I do not trust apps.  That is correct, I use smartphones and I've only ever used probably less than 10 apps from specific developers that I trust.

OIS / Auto focus makes noise,"Hi everybody! 
I have my pixel 4xl since the beginning of the year. Actually I am quite satisfied. However, I noticed the other day during a video recording in a quiet environment that auto focus or OIS make a quiet noise when you turn the phone around the vertical axis with short movements. Either auto focus/OIS corrects the movement or the mounted lens swings. If the camera app is closed, you won't hear anything.

A user has already written on reddit. Since it is only perceptible in absolutely quiet surroundings, probably not too many have noticed this phenomenon. But unfortunately you can hear it on the video.

Is it a HW issue or just normal beahviour? I assume it's the OIS is moving the lens.

Here the video on reddit, with me it is absolutely identical. Another one has probably confirmed it:

Pixel 3 battery melted damaging the motherboard,"One day my phone suddenly started showing remaining battery capacity stuck at 6%. The phone did get charge and was working fine but the battery indicator was completely broken. After a week or so, the indicator slowly went down to 1% and the phone started to reboot randomly. After talking to Pixel support, they recommended that I take the phone to a Google certified repair shop.

The repair shop diagnosed the issue and determined that the phone battery had been melted and damaged the motherboard! There is no way to repair the phone and it needs to be replaced. 

This seems like a major manufacturing flaw and a safety risk to me. The day that the issue started, I wasn't even using my phone. I was just carrying it in my pocket. I think Google should investigate and fix potential software or hardware problems causing this.

Mobile Network doesn't come on after any Android Updates,"Weird one here.  After ANY Android updates (been happening for over a year now), my Pixel 3 XL appears to work just fine until I need to 'switch' over to 'Mobile Network'.  It won't switch over, meaning that when I leave the house (and wireless), I don't have a connection to the Internet (or anything).

I go into the Network and Internet settings, click on the ""Mobile Network"" (which says Google FI under it already) and it shows that it is ""Off"" - so, I try to turn it on again.  Says ""Switching to Google Fi, but then goes back again and no connection.

So far, the ONLY way I can get it to work again (which is weird also) is to tell it to 'erase sim'.  Then, it actually gets an error message saying I can't erase it and it goes back to the ""Network and Internet"" setting page whereupon I go into the ""Mobile Network"" (which still says Google FI), and  tell it to ""Turn on"" again and then it works...

I am just kind of tired of having to do this whenever an Android update comes out - especially frustrating if I just grab my phone in the morning and head out only to have to pull over to the side of the road after realizing I have no 'Mobile Network' connection.

VERY strange.  When it first happened, I called support, worked with them for over an hour trying to get it to work and they said I could also swap the phone out (if was new), which is what I was GOING to do, but I thought ""better erase the SIM card before I do so""... that's when I found this 'jury rigged fix'...

Pixel 2 not making/receiving phonecalls,"When attempting a call from this Pixel 2, device is quiet for a while (no ringtone) and then just stops the attempt. When calling this Pixel, phone can't be reached (meaning switched off or outside of mobile network coverage). SMS and mobile data work fine. It is only about traditional calls.

Have restored factory settings, reset network settings and tried safe mode and hard reset number of times without effect. Have also experimented network settings behind *#*#4636#*#* without effect on functionality. Only difference is that if I restrict network only to for example GSM or LTE, other devide calling this Pixel gets fail response faster.

How do I contact Google for technical support for my Pixel XL.Appreciate your help.,"Recently, I purchased a used pixel XL, that was officially certified refurbished. When installing and personalizing my pixel XL via my carrier, there was a problem getting the MMS downloads in my messages. When I clicked the blue icon with a downward arrow  to access a download, it would act as though it was 'working on retrieving' it (actively circling w/I icon) and failed to retrieve the download. The active circling within the icon continued endlessly without any results. I literally had to close page to get it to stop. My carrier said that the SMS is working properly but whenever we try to download MMS it was unsuccessful. I must have called five different times to get help on how to correct the problem and no one could figure out how to make it work. My previous phone, Samsung Galaxy 7 edge, was stolen so I had no way of transferring my contacts, photos, etc from that phone on to my pixel XL. Fortunately I had backed up everything onto Google so I could restore all my info in case my Galaxy 7 edge was ever lost or stolen. When it came to retrieving all that info, some of it was not retrieved. I originally had 173 + contacts and only about 70 we're actually retrieved. Things just got more screwed up from there. For some reason they had me sync my partners contacts in with mine (that's a long story) but basically what happened is all of his contacts were deleted, I guess during the syncing, and that's when I lost over a hundred of my contacts as well. So here I sit after 5 calls for technical support from my carrier and I am left with a partial list of my contacts, my partner's contacts are nowhere to be found along with the rest of my contacts and it's still can't download MMS messages. My phone still processes SMS texting in message without any problems. Finally the last few people I spoke to told me I needed to contact Google to correct the problem. I don't know how to contact Google, technical support and I'm at the point that I'm overthinking everything and very little makes any sense right now. I think that's called burnout and I've only had this phone a week.
I'm hoping to at least get a phone number for Google technical support. Ideally there might be a miracle worker out there who can guide me through the process of locating the problem correcting those things that need fixin and retrieving all of the lost contacts not to mention photos, etc plus a large amount of journaling & lots of otther notes. 
Can anyone out there help out...I'd be grateful for just a Google # & delighted if they could guide me in fixing anything. I was so excited to get a Pixel.

Pixel 4a no longer connects to the WiFi guest login. Port 10080 blocked by Google.,"I have a Pixel 2 which over a week ago refused to log into the guest wifi due to ERR_UNSAFE_PORT. 
As there was nothing I could find online about this issue with a Pixel phone, I bought a Pixel 4a and found the exact same problem.
Also, Samsung users in the house have the same error and are unable to connect.
Over the weekend, Google Chrome PC has also thrown up this error and refuses to let me log in to the guest wifi. 

From my understanding, this is not a router issue, as Google has blocked the port, and so far the only solution is to have a Google Enterprise account in order to request unblocking the port on my devices. 
This prevents using either phone and so far the only solution viable is to switch to PC and use Firefox that can unblock the port, or switch to iPhone which does not block guest logins. 
We do not have any control over the port number that the router uses so it is not possible to change it therefore money is being wasted on WiFi and Google devices. 
I've just received the June update on my Pixel 4a and the issue is still not resolved.

This is just unacceptable to be forced to pay for 4g while paying for WiFi that is blocked by Google without a workaround that doesn't require a Google Enterprise account.","Connectivity, Network, Bluetooth"

Pixel 3a having multiple charging issues...,"UPDATE: My port was damaged and had to be replaced. It's fine now. 

Looked around to find someone with a similar problem, but no dice. My pixel 3a has stopped responding to chargers for the most part. I have about 5 different cords and cables and the only thing I have found that works is an Amazon brand USB-C to USB cord connected to a power bank. 

BUT even then it only works when the phone is off.....and even THEN it only works occassionally.

When it's on it sometimes says ""Android System - Charging connected device via USB"" as if I'm using my phone to charge the power bank? I'm basically surviving by getting lucky that it decides not to turn on again after I plug it in. If I shut it down while plugged in, it also won't charge.

Motherboard issue after Android 10.0,"I was facing charging issue in my Google pixel device. As suggested by one of the google-support team members to update that to Android 10.0, I did that.
Again, I was facing the same issue and it got switched off and stop charging. After informing again, someone came and picked my device for Diagnosis. 

And then Google service engineer from B2X(official service partner) in India said the issue is with motherboard. As my pixel is out of warranty for the replacement so got estimate to repair is around Rs.22,000/- (~$310). My phone did not completed 2 years till and I am facing this motherboard issue.
This is so sick from Google side for not having quality checks on the defective motherboards.
There was a program of free replacement of motherboard in USA under ubreakifix center. 
But no such program in India.

This is the last time I have bought Google products. 

And when I discussed with senior Manager, he was not ready to listen and I told him, if I plan to purchase next pixel device in future then the same thing can also happen after completing 1 year of warranty then he was saying it is up to you but we will charge if any issue occurs after one year.

Cellular Network connection issue - Pixel 5,"My wife and I got 2 new Pixel 5 phones when they came out.
Have had no issues until yesterday, when all of a sudden my wife's phone lost her connection to the cellular network. My phone continues to be connected and have no issues conncting.
We are in Kelowna, BC on the Shaw mobile network.
We have a weak signal in our area, and often are in Wi-Fi calling mode.
If I turn off ""automatically select network"" on that phone, it can see 6 networks (2 Shaw LTE & 3G, and 4 others)
However, it will not connect if I try to connect to any of them.
Shaw support up to this point has been useless - they are saying someone will get back to us in a few days.
In the meantime, my wife's phone can't receive phone calls (goes straight to voicemail) - even with Wi-Fi calling turned on. We can exchange SMS messages between our phones, but she can't send to anyone else?
Could this be a hardware issue, or are we at the mercy of Shaw at this point?
We were going to head to the store for a SIM swap to see if that helps.

Pixel 4a loses 70% battery overnight,"So my brand new Pixel 4a seems to have developed a serious problem with its battery.

This is a new device purchased for Christmas about 4 weeks ago.

A few days ago I noticed that with 40-50% charge, I would wake up to a dead phone after 8 hours of sleep.

Last night I tested this problem by doing the following:

Uninstalled Facebook and about 10 other unnecessary apps which might be draining battery.
Enabled extreme battery saver, adaptive charging, checked battery optimization is on for all possible apps, and enabled all possible adaptive battery settings.
Charged to 100% before bed then unplugged it.
Closed all open apps, activated do not disturb and airplane mode, turned off location services and WiFi and Bluetooth.
The battery then drained, on phone idle, from 100 down to 34 percent in less than 9 hours. That's a loss of nearly SEVENTY percent battery overnight on idle.

What the heck is going on? Is this just a faulty battery?

Evidence from my Battery Usage statistics - the phone detects zero apps used overnight other than Idle, and claims that Idle only used 1% battery while it was draining the entire time:



A couple of potential causes I can think of:
I have been playing a mobile game Legends of Runeterra for several hours per day, maybe this is too demanding for a Pixel 4a and has messed something up internally?
I bought the phone in the UK but am now living in New Zealand. The charger is being used through a cheap plug adapter (and obviously different voltage etc) which has fried the internal battery components?


Any advice would be massively appreciated...

Why is my Pixel 4a(5G) intermittently disconnecting from my mobile network.,"Hello, I recently upgraded from the Pixel XL 2 to Pixel4a (5G). The problem is that the phone keeps dropping its connection to my mobile carrier. Its happening throughout the day intermittently. I know when it happens as I can see the mobile symbol at the top of the screen flicker off and on again .  When I'm not using the phone  I know its happening because the phone makes a sound indicating its not connected to mobile. Also it happens when I try and make a phone call. Basically when I attempt to make a call it fails the first time and immediately afterwards when I try the second time it works.  The same goes when I try to text somebody using Google Message app. When I try and send the text message it immediately fails. If I tap the message it will try and send the message again resulting in it working the second time.  So same pattern is occuring when I try to make a phone call or if I try and text using standard SMS. Basically fails the first attempt and works on the second attempt.  I have contacted my carrier Rogers and they say the problem is not on their end. They are now recommending I contact Google so that is what I'm doing here. So any help would much be appreciated. 

Up to this point these are the things I have tried to do in order to fix this issue. None have made any difference as the problem is still occuring.

considerable lightening of skin tone

The result, after processing, is a photo that often looks unnatural, waxy, and overcorrected.

In my own testing, enabling retouching caused the same changes listed above, but moreso. I've also determined that this is not due to the portrait lighting feature, since turning this feature off in google photos produces the original retouched photo.

In addition to feeling like unintended behavior, since the change is highly noticeable and fairly drastic,  it also flies in the face of Google's recent, highly-publicized decision to disable retouching by default on its devices. Unwanted facial retouching can be highly damaging to users' self-image, and it's also causing a general lack of image fidelity—my face looks less detailed, as if the image quality has been downgraded by the device.

I'm including some samples of my testing here:

The first photo is a side-by-side comparison of the before and after images. The top photo is the original image, pre-processing (Screenshot taken from the gallery). The bottom image is the retouched selfie.

This is the processed and visibly retouched image, by itself:


Note the general lack of fidelity when comparing the final image to the original.

Finally, I have attached a recording of my camera app, documenting the process of taking a photo, viewing it in the gallery app, and the image dramatically changing when processing is complete. Note that my face is a completely different tone.

I've discussed this with other pixel users, who have described similar results with their own photos: a loss of image quality, unnatural looking photos, feeling like a mask is being applied to their photos taken with the front-facing camera. This is a worrying trend for me, and for these other users, because it suggests google has incorporated facial retouching directly into its HDR+ image processing where it cannot be disabled by the end user.

Is this behavior intentional? It seems antithetical to google's own public positions on facial retouching. I'd appreciate feedback from other users about this.",Camera

NR in Google camera (Mark Levoy or IsaacOnCamera),"Hi, Mark! First of all I wanted to say a huge thank you for all the hard and tremendous work you've done! Especially considering that there aren't too many people at your Pixel photo team (there are around 12...18 people if I am not mistaken and I thought there were like 100 to 200 people who made this Hdr+ mode come true). There is an issue, however, related with current pixel processing. I remember you once said in your interview that pixel's processing is very tolerate to noise reduction process. I do not know whether you are aware of that or no, but pixels' noise suppression has been becoming more and more intense and now has become one of the strongest in the industry. I'm using the Pixel 1st gen by myself and recently discovered a modded app which allowed adjust the NR processing for one's liking. I was shocked. Photos became like 3 times better with only colour NR turned on. Altogether I understand that there can be some problems with the marketing department which very well may insist on making this NR process that heavy. But still. Maybe there will be a way to add a hidden toggle, like the one with the raw feature somewhere deep in the menu. Because this noise adds professionally edited look to the photos (photos taken in RAW with ,,adited to taste,, label on DPreview often has the similar look as the ones I got with this modded cam app) Thanks for your time and thank you one more time.

Is anyone else experience an extensive amount of issues with their pixel 3 camera/photos/videos?,"Over the past couple of months, I have noticed that the camera on my Pixel 3 has been having a lot of issues. 1- The front-facing camera distorts photos after it goes through the ""processing stage"" making everyone's faces look squished, making the photos pretty much unusable. 2- Pictures are coming out fuzzy, and even when I log onto Google Photos on my PC, they are fuzzy and look like they were taken on a phone 10 years ago. 3- Videos are also insanely blurry both on the phone and when I try to view them on my PC. 

The main selling point of this phone when I bought it last year was how exceptional the camera was on it, however that quality has seemed to change for some reason. I have tried reaching out to Google and have tried all of their recommended ways of fixing this issue with no luck, other than them offering me a new Pixel 3 (which I would have to wait 15 days for once they received my old phone).

"Phone connected to headset via BT, but tones and icon indicate phone speaker until connection","tl;dr: Phone should gives some indication of BT-connected call *before* it begins dialing.

I find this maddening. 

1. My phone is connected to my headphones for calls (but I don't necessarily know that for certain).

2. I begin dialing, but dialpad tones sound through the phone speaker, which makes me think I may not be BT connected. 

3. The icon that shows upon completion of the dialing shows the Speaker icon for a second before switching to the BT icon. 

4. So every time I dial, I have a heart-stopping moment of Uh oh, I'm not on bluetooth, I better rip these headphones off before someone answers!

Sounds trivial, but my headphones (Bose 700) are multi-device and switch from one sound source to another, so it's possible it's not a BT call. I'd like the dial tones to sound though BT (so I'm reassured my phone is actually using my headphones), and I'd like to see some visual confirmation *before* the call actually connects. I know I can check ""Connected devices"" before initiating each call, and that's what I end up doing because I'm paranoid. Often I start dialing, hear the tones issuing from the phone speaker, and see the Speaker icon, and hang up, check that I'm connected to my headphones (I usually am), and initiate the call again.","Contacts, Calls, Voicemail"

"Do not Validate Enterprise WiFi option no longer available, Will this feature arrive on all androids","I recently switched from Pixel 2 to the new Pixel 4a. It got updated to Android 11 quite early but then this weird nightmare started. After installing the December update (Build ID: RQ1A.200720.009), Google made an official policy that it would not allow users to connect using the DO NOT VALIDATE option in the wifi settings (link for this information: https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/2844832?hl=en scroll to the bottom to see this) because of security reasons mentioned in the aforementioned link. I want to know that will this change be brought to ALL android phones that have OS update support?
This request may sound absurd but there’s a very valid reason for this. In my country, a lot of people on samsung’s, and that applies to my university as well. The IT dept. at my uni was not ready to make such a big change to their enterprise wifi because only 2 people owned a pixel in the whole place, the rest own samsungs, which aren't running the latest pixel updates yet, and iphones which don't have this problem. Now before I change my phone, which I bought from my hard earned savings, I want to know whether if Samsung phones, and other android phones, have or will likely receive that particular update, because if that’s the case, I can wait till this becomes a widespread update and my university is forced to change their wifi system. After all, this is the very reason why google released this update: to push organisations to push for higher security measures. I would be SO GRATEFUL of someone can help me with this.
I want to know that such deeply embedded system changes in android APIs, do they always arrive on other android phones which receive the latest updates? Sooner or later?

As soon as I navigate away from the page, it will still show that Wifi is turned off.

I've also noticed it has started to have charging issues when it turns itself off and won't come back up; it will say it's charging and when it actually allows me to restart it after an unnecessarily long wait time there is only 12-15% of battery even if it's been connected for over an hour.  Previously charging this phone was amazing and was usually fully charged within an hour or less no matter what it was plugged into.
I had it run a battery test multiple times and it says it's fine. 
I tried installing a Kernel to help with battery power/tracking and it's saying that it's using about 13% of it's battery capacity.

I am not sure if they have actually started repair or bluffing with me because it has been 6 days and status shows the same. 
I had just simple connectivity issue as device is not getting connected to PC otherwise perfectly well maintained device. Should it take 6 days after starting repair on the device on the same status??
They have not responding to email except pre-drafted, automated kind of replies.
Each time you try talking to customer support, there is a different agent other side which assures same thing- to get back with status in 24-48 hours. And they never respond until you have the next follow up.

Google Pixel 3a XL has issues with apps functioning properly on 5 GHz connection,"So this was a problem I had with my Google Pixel XL, and now I have it with my 3a XL. For the first few months of using my phone with my 5 GHz wifi, I had absolutely no problems. Now, many apps won't start unless if I turn off my phone wifi. Some apps work without an issue (YouTube, Chrome, Facebook, Reddit). Twitter will load the app but not multimedia. When I reached out to tech support the last time, I was told to switch to 2.4 GHz, which worked, but I would prefer to use 5 GHz if possible. I don't remember the issue arising after an app update, and I've searched endlessly for a similar question, but I haven't found any. Are there steps I can take on my phone to help improve my connectivity?","Connectivity, Network, Bluetooth"

Strange to notice that Pixel 2 battery price is significantly higher than any any other model.,"The battery started to degrade on my Pixel 2 and was looking for a replacement.

Android 10 swipe gesture for Home,"Installed Android 10 the day it came out (I know, I know...wait for the bugs first...) and mostly like it.  Issue I have is with gestures.  

Prior to gestures, tapping the Home button would minimize an open app and return you to the Home screen (whichever Home screen was last open, primary or one of the secondaries).  Tapping it again would take you to your Primary Home screen.  

Using gestures, swiping up from the bottom of the screen with an app open returns you to whichever Home screen was open, but I haven't found a way to return to my Primary Home screen without having to manually swipe through the pages to get there.  Swiping up from the bottom of the screen without an app open just opens the app drawer, or, if you do it right, gets you to the list of open/recent apps (and that gesture is a whole 'nother issue and topic!)

Pixel 3/4 December 2020 update & WPA2 Enterpise. Can no longer connect. Android System update 11,"Now that the December 2020 update is here, on the Pixel 3 and 4 phones, google has taken the option away to ""DO NOT validate"" the certificate for the WPA2 Enterprise SSID, in preparation  for WPA3,  while forcing the user to ""use system certificates"", and only allowing Android not to validate under the  Online certificate status. I received the update on Dec 5, 2020, and could not connect to WPA2 Enterprise wireless after that, while happily doing it before the update. The problem happens with the new Android System 11 update and support for WPA3.  Our School Enterpise Network does have a certificate on it's NPS server, and all Apple iOS, Chromebooks and windows devices, connect to the system no problem and support certificate pinning.  Android does NOT support certificate pinning.  So the question is, what new combination of settings for PIXEL 3/4 do I need to Validate the SSL cert on Android System update 11, and connect to or WPA2 Enterprise Wireless?

I tried SEVERAL combinations, of old settings that worked, and new settings, with the DOMAIN section (which should be the DNS name of the CERT) to try and validate the certificate and get on the network.  ANy suggestions.  The NPS certificate is issued by the WIndows DC, and signed by it for the NPS server and is good until May 2021.

"Can't turn off sound for ""missed call"" notification","New problem that just showed up in the last day or so on my Pixel 3 with Android 11:

It plays a sound every time there's a ""missed notification"" call. I get a lot of these because of spam callers. The phone isn't ringing or anything because I have it set to screen them.

When I slide the notification to the side and click on the gear, it says ""These notifications can't be modified"":

I can go into the notification settings and go into the detailed settings for ""Missed calls"":

 
""Sound: None"" would seem to imply that it should play no sound.

The ""Silent"" button at the top is disabled.

It's also not possible to disable all phone notifications, if I go back out one level from this screen.

I've looked at settings within the Phone app, and can't find anything relevant, except I guess ""Ring & notification volume"" (I don't want to silence phone rings all the time) and ""Do Not Disturb"" (same). There's a ""Default notification sound"", but that's set to a completely different sound than the one I'm getting.

Pixel 4 GPS Issue - GPS puts me all over the country - The phone travels upwards of 17K miles a day!,"Most of my location based apps have me in the incorrect location.  I have to open google maps to force the phone to realize that I'm where I am.  It takes a few seconds for the phone to realize that I'm not in Florida, Arizona, Texas, Pennsylvania (all places that I've spent time in the last few months) - then put me where I am actually at.  Then I have to re-start the other apps to get them to recognize the new location.

I have screenshots of my location history traveling over 17k miles every day from the GPS error.

I've called tech support, and they say I need to take it in to a service center and they will attempt to repair the phone but they are not replacing Pixel 4 phones and repair is the only option that they will be able to offer me.  She would not even discuss going through the settings, checking things, or even admitting that the phone was faulty - just take it in if you think it's broken.

I've tried turning on and off wifi and bluetooth scanning with no luck.
Wifi scanning is currently on and bluetooth scanning is currently off.  Use location is on.

"Stream direct from data plan, not from WiFi or hotspot","I discontinued my internet at home. I'm tired of high cost internet. I only have 1/2 gig of hotspot at 4g speed. I have to turn on hotspot to connect to my Chromecast, but if I steam from an app, it uses the WiFi access that my phone is providing and uses up my hotspot data on no time. After 30 minutes I can no longer stream with this method because hotspot gets reduced to 2g speed. I understanding that if I cast my whole screen, it forces the Chromecast to use my data connection instead of my hotspot. However once I start streaming from Netflix or Google Play Movies and TV, it gets just as slow, which makes me think the Chromecast has started pulling via hotspot again. I download a whole episode and try to cast my screen. Then I get an error saying I have to delete the downloaded copy in order to cast.

Why can't I stream a downloaded file? Why can't I cast to my TV using my phone data plan instead of my hotspot? What other options are there to send a video file from my phone, using my phone data plan instead of my much-more-limited hotspot? I've found that USBC to HDMI doesn't work already.

Devices tethered to Pixel 3 XL can't use OpenVPN via UDP?,"Hi all, discovered a strange bug with the Pixel 3 XL.  I use OpenVPN to connect back to my home network when I travel.  Usually this is done via the 4G hotspot provided by a mobile device I'm carrying.

Recently upgraded to the Pixel 3 XL and found that when tethered to that hotspot, I cannot connect to my OpenVPN instance at home if I use UDP.  The initial handshake packet doesn't even reach the router (looking at packet captures).  Where as if I put my SIM card into an iPhone or a Nexus 5X/6, it works just fine.

When I've tested other OpenVPN connections, I get the same results if using UDP.

Now have to resort to TCP, which makes Windows RDP completely unusable because of the overhead via TCP.

While trying to charge my phone with the OEM charger today, it wasn't charging at all, so I had to let the phone die. Now, I've replugged in the phone and the following loop happens

1. Charging logo (Bolt and white battery) pops up for 1-2 seconds 
2. The lightning bolt disappears and the battery greys out, making it seem like the charger was disconnected (it isn't)
3. At about the same time, a white bar appears at the top of the screen, about halfway across. Then it quickly 'loads' across the screen, and the screen turns black for about 10-15 seconds, and the cycle repeats.

I've waited a bit, and when I try to turn on the phone, it boots to the G logo, then turns off, presumably it doesn't have a charge. I've tried another charger and the same loop happens. 

This all seems like a charger issue, but this only happened when upgrading to Android 11, and the loop sequences makes it seem like a software one. Any ideas? My phone is 100% unusable as is.

Cannot hear incoming caller when answered on phone....,"Using a Google Pixel 2 XL. 

When I answer a call on my phone, I often cannot hear the other caller, but they can hear me and complain that the audio quality is very bad. I have learned that I can switch to a Bluetooth headset and so far every time that works. So I am using that as a work around in the meantime.

This is a new issue that has recently started after doing a factory reset of my phone in an attempt to resolve another issue. Calls for some callers on the same carrier will always present the issue, and for other callers it is an inconsistent issue (yet to be seen if it is a consistent issue once it starts).

What I have tried so far: I have already done a factory reset (but can do again if I must), I have cleared the phone app cache and storage, tried turning Bluetooth off (issue still present), removed all Bluetooth devices and then reconnected, and removed any app that I could live without. The only Bluetooth devices that are paired now are my Plantronics V5200 headset and a Garmin Fenix 5X.

Next to try is to answer and switch to speaker phone as a test.

Any ideas or suggestions are welcome. Hoping to resolve this and upgrade to a Pixel 6 later this fall but if it cannot be resolved I may need to purchase a Samsung device before the Pixel 6 is released. My phone must be reliable as a phone above anything else and right now it is not.

Thanks!

"Pixel 2xl Charging Bug- Won't charge, strange behavior when powered off","Previous owner of the phone reported that the phone would no longer charge. He booted it up sometime later and it was functional.
9 months later, I'm getting the same issue. The phone suddenly would not recognize that it was plugged in. Turned the phone off and plugged in.

Then the top of the screen would fill with multicolored white (ranging from green to pink) pixels, and the symbol would turn to a grayed out solid battery (no lightning bolt), approximately 3 seconds. Then the screen would turn completely black, and it would begin again.
Backed up data, performed a factory reset, but the problem remained.
When I swapped back to the OEM cable (two months ago, phone had refused this cable (full charge in 6 hours), and swapping cables returned it to normal charging habits) The phone recognized the charger, gave haptic feedback, and began charging. 30 seconds later, it powered off and reverted to the strange symbol behavior.

I cannot cancel the Google Assistant reminders.,"Pixel 2 XL

A couple of days ago, I asked Google Assistant, ""Hey Google, remind me to [task] at 11 o'clock tomorrow."" I later added a second reminder for a different task.

The next day, Google reminded me on my phone at the right times, which was great.

However, since then, Google keeps on reminding me. It happens without fail every time when I restart the phone, and at arbitrary other times. The notification shows both of my old reminders. (See the attached screenshot of my notification.)

Here is what I've tried.

Tap the notification, which opens the Google Assistant and shows me that there are no reminders.
Press ""Done"" on the notification, which closes the notification.
Swipe the notification away.
As already mentioned, restart the phone (several times already).

But still, I keep getting reminders.

Pixel 3 Camera Not Focusing,"I am having a problem with the camera on my Pixel 3. It was working fine yesterday, and all of a sudden, this morning it would no longer focus when taking a picture. At first I thought that this was just a random fluke, so I rebooted the phone, which didn't fix it. I went on to clear the storage and cache folder of the Google camera app, restart the phone in safe mode, force stop any apps that may have been using the camera, none of which worked. 

I thought at first that this could be related to the April security update I received late last night, and began talking to my friend who has a Pixel 3 XL. He mentioned that this morning, his camera also would no longer focus. However, he has had the April update for quite a while longer than I have. We tried ruling out apps that were updated or installed since last night, which included Android accessibility features, Android System WebView, and the device customizations app -- we tried uninstalling updates to these but that did not fix the issue.

I was about to throw in the towel on this being a hardware issue until my buddy mentioned his phone having the same exact issue, at the same exact time. I am wondering if anyone else has experienced this issue. Unfortunately, Google Support is not exactly helpful in this scenario -- the best piece of advice they could give was to just send the phone into the repair depot or buy a Pixel 4 and trade this in.",Camera

Pixel 3 camera keeps crashing then not working at all,"Hi folks, 

I have a pixel 3 phone that is just over 1  year old. Recently the camera stopped working during use and refused to work at all afterwards. After a restart it was working again, but only allowed me to take 3 or 4 photos (with the rear camera) before it stopped again. If I took a video it would crash at around 15sec. After this only a reboot could potentially get the camera starting again. Since this started happening the camera never works for longer than this and rebooting only gets it working again, allbeit for limited periods, maybe 50% of the time. 
I have reviewed lots of threads and tried uninstalling camera app updates, clearing cache, rebooting in safe mode, and even factory reset twice. Nothing fixes the camera issue. On the last factory reset the camera worked for 4 or 5 pics and now the issue is back. 

What on earth do I do Google? I have tried contacting you through the pixel phone help and when I get to the point of raising an email to you, I get an error on my PC advising that I cannot email you and there is no phone number (I live in Australia).

It's developed this issue in the past couple of days and I think it's some kind of operating system issue - if anyone has any suggestions I would appreciate it!
It's not the phone hardware itself: the charging port isn't loose, and it's not clogged with debris. When the issue happened yesterday, the charging symbol would show for a second and then vanish, indicating the phone was detecting the charger
It's not an app causing the issue:  I restarted the phone in safe mode and tried charging and it made no difference.
I've also tried it with another identical google pixel charger from a friend's phone, and with the fast charger that came with my Pixelbook (which works on the Pixelbook) - no charging. Tried connecting the cable to the Pixelbook to draw charge from the computer, that didn't help either. My phone's cable will work on my Pixelbook, so it's definitely an issue with my phone.
However I it will take charge from a generic cheap USB-C to USB-A cable stuck into a socket - but only extremely slowly (much slower than this cable used to work). 
I really think that all of the above means the issue is with some software. It's running Android 9. I could update it to 10 (once it has enough battery, which will take hours at this rate!) if anyone thinks that will help!

Music app in background auto-plays when Bluetooth headphones turned off,"After turning off Bluetooth headphones the Pixel 4 starts to play paused music out of the speakers from an app that was in the background.

These headphones can connect to both a PC and the Pixel 4, but when the headphones are powered down the phone will start playing music even when the phone was not actively being used.
Sometimes the headphones were just immediately being used with the PC before being turned off, yet the phone will immediately start playing music from the speakers.

It seems like a ""play"" command is being sent to/interpreted by the phone when the headphones are switched off which begins playing music from the speakers.

The app in question is Youtube Music and the headphones are Bose Quietcomfort 35ii, I am not sure if its an app specific issue since I haven't seen any other apps doing this on my phone.

Has anyone experienced a similar issue or know how to resolve this so the app stops auto-playing from the speakers when the headphones are turned off?","Connectivity, Network, Bluetooth"

Vertical line of white pixels on pixel 4a.,"Three weeks ago a single vertical line of white pixels appeared on my pixel 4a, though I managed to fix it through shutting apps and restating, and waiting. If I close all apps eventually the display fixes itself though it is inconsistent and may be getting more stubborn. The line returns within hours everytime I manage to remove it.

I haven't been able to identify which app may be causing it though for a while I thought it was MS Outlook. I don't use many apps though so hope it's not an incompatibility.

It doesn't act like dead pixels, rather it acts like a white line superimposed on the screen. It appears to scroll up and down with the images on screen.

I opened a chat session with Pixel Support, and they told me this is normal because a first time caller is considered a possibly fake number....I'm not sure I buy that explanation.  Why would call screen have a separate option on how to handle first time callers if first time callers are caught by the ""Possibly Faked Numbers"" category?

Pixel 2 XL is not recognized as a USB device (no file transfer) & Headphone dongle not working.,"Pixel 2 XL connector issues.

It was working just fine only a week ago.

2. The headphones dongle from the box have stopped working with the Pixel. While connected, the music is played through the speakers. It does work when connecting it to my Windows laptop.

3. The phone is not being recognized anymore as a device while connected to any kind of computer. It does charge it with the original cable, but nothing more than that. It also did work just fine about a week ago. Nothing appears in the Pixel, except that it is being charged. Also, nothing appears in the PC.

What I already have tried to do:
1. Switching cables, chargers, ports, OS and PC, in order to decline the option for a problem with a specific accessory.
2. Turning ON/OFF the Pixel and the PC while being connected/disconnected.
3. Reset the pixel 2 XL to factory and erasing all the data & settings.
4. Enable and disable the relevant developer options and trying again after rebooting (Relevant options: USB debugging, default USB configuration set to file transfer, etc).
5. Reboot in Safe Mode and try again.
6. Cleaning the USB port.

Bluetooth issue after April OS 11 update,"After the April OS 11 update my Bluetooth is not working as it should.  What I mean by this is my devices are connecting and are showing in the connected devices under the system settings.  However I cannot use them to make or receive calls.  For instance my pixel buds are connected, I dial a number I can hear the numbers being pushed through the buds.  When I go to make the call, the call is through my Pixel 5 not the ear buds.  Now when I do have the option to play on headset, speaker, or buds.  The headset and speaker work just fine.  When I select the buds, nothing...  Same thing is happening with my head unit in my car for hands free calling.  I was really hoping the May update would fix this, but it has not.

I have tried clearing the cache for my Bluetooth devices, that seemed to work the first time that I did it but has not sense.  I have also tried to reset my Wi-Fi, mobile & Bluetooth.  That worked at first but now I am right back to square one.

Unable to make or recieve calls over Wifi,"In my home, I have no mobile service. I've recently been re-assigned by my work to work from home, and need to be able to make and recieve calls to do so. I have been unable to get calls over Wi-Fi to function on my Pixel 2, which should natively support it. 
I have contacted the Google Fi support team and worked through the following troubleshooting:
Confirm the OS is updated
Confirm Messenger, Phone, Carrier Services, and Hangouts are updated
Confirm the Wi-Fi connection is functional by using the web browser
Making calls over Wi-Fi while Airplane Mode is enabled
At this point, a technician was able to do a remote Opt-in for Wi-Fi that allowed me to make/recieve calls for approxemately 36 hours. When I was unable to make calls again, I worked through the previous troubleshooting in addition to:
Restarting the phone in Safe Mode and attempting calls
Restoring the phone to Factory Settings
Installing Hangouts Dialer (no longer supported) to make calls.
With Hangouts Dialer, I was able to make calls through that app, but no through the phone app. I was not able to recieve calls. After installing Hangouts Dialer we worked through all of the above troubleshooting steps through Safe Mode, as well as uninstalling and reinstalling Hangouts with no success.

I was then advised to post my problem in the Hangouts Help community as well as here, and that a technician would be with me in a few minutes.","Contacts, Calls, Voicemail"

Can't transfer files to and from PC anymore on Pixel 2XL.,"Since updating to Android 9, lots of users faced this huge problem. Unable to transfer their files/photos/videos to and from their PC. I'm one of them. Now, this is a big issue for Google doing this. Because Google is preventing us to have the freedom of how we want our files to be transferred. Not by telling us or recommend us using Google Drive or some other Cloud services. What's the point of doing this latest update for a thousand dollars phone? Do you really know how slow it is to transfer thousands of files to Drive or Cloud?
I've tried to use other cables, messing with USB settings/configurations and Developer option, reinstalling drivers, tried on other PC and laptop and went as far to factory reset. But none of them resolve this huge problem. Very frustrating and disappointing. What's wrong with the pic attached below? I can't even press anything on it when connected to my PC. As you can see, it is greyed out. And the biggest problem of all is Windows no longer recognized USB device even after installing new drivers, it always popped up whenever I connect this phone. Why do you need to disable this, Google?  I really believe this is a software issue that you have done, no other explainations needed, which is such a shame to be honest.
OK Google, now I would like to request on how to downgrade to Android 8 or any other earlier versions of Pie. Are you able to to show me the steps and requirements on this? Are you able to make the transferring files possible again? If you can't help on this and say that the phone is unable to roll back because of software issue, then this phone will either go to the drain or I will sell it away. There is no point keeping this phone for much longer. There is no point for Pixel users to have this phone.

How I can turn on VoLTE Provisioned when calling *#*#46363#*#* if the option is grey in phone info,"Hello all.
  I bought a Pixel Phone last year in the US (unlocked version) during the summer and when i got back to my country (Colombia) decided to use it here and when I am on the internet everything is perfect, it connects to LTE networks and let me browse on it at high speed. The problem comes when I want to make a call, the phone changes automatically from LTE network to HSPA+ network (sometimes only HSPA) and the call is not over LTE. In my local carrier I have voice over LTE (VoLTE) but since I am not able to enable it by calling *#*#4636#*#* and go to the ""Phone information"" tab I am not able to turn it on by myself. My question is, Should Google enable it in order to make this work or this is something to do with my carrier? 
  To be clear, when I was in the US, I used Google Fi and had VoLTE calls (it showed the HD message) and also Calls over Wi-Fi and many more features and in my country I can't have VoLTE.

The answer there is marked as an answer, but it doesn't fix our problem. Answer says symptoms point towards a hardware problem, but given the additional information from multiple users it does not seem to be a hardware problem.

After an update this summer Camera won't start on Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL for some users. Sometimes it may start (just after reboot or if you hold phone upside down a few times while starting camera), then it will not focus. This only applies to main camera, and applies to any application attempting to use camera.

This is clearly not a hardware problem and it affects multiple users. And it came the same day as phone was updated. I assumed a fix would follow soon, but it did not.

Reboots, clear cache, uninstall and reinstall camera, resetting phone, etc has not helped.

Android 11 and Wifi dot1x Certificates,"Has anyone here attempted to connect to a dot1x authenticated Wifi network and had it work reliably since upgrading to Android 11?  This is typically the sort of authentication you would find in a corporate network and not at home.
I have a dot1x authentication setup with EAP/MSCHAPv2 backended to AD, working just fine with Android 10, but after upgrading to Android 11 the setting to either ""Do not validate"" the certificate or to select the certificate never saves, and the Wifi setting for selecting the certificate to use always reverts to using System certificates for the dot1x.
This inability to save the settings completely breaks all dot1x on Wifi, and as far as I can tell this is going to be a massive showstopper for anyone using Android 11 in a corporate environment.  Basically it won't work and Android 11 devices cannot be used.
I have a Pixel 2, Pixel 3XL and Pixel 4XL all experiencing the exact same thing.  All worked perfectly with Android 10 and earlier using the exact same settings.
If I change to another SSID with WPA2-PSK everything is fine, but this is not ideal - really need to be using the dot1x SSID not the WPA2 SSID.
I logged a bug report on this during the Android beta and after the final release, but it was rejected on the basis of this being a support problem even though it is clearly a regression from Android 10.

Greenish bars in product photos -- CFL lighting issue? Camera setting?,"Searched the posts, but all the hits seem to be for different issues. I'm a bookseller using my phone for product photography. In my photos I'm getting three or four greenish-brown vertical bars of discoloration. Sometimes they move horizontally while I'm waiting to take the shot. I experienced this once on an older Galaxy phone (7?) while using a 3rd party camera app but it went away when I switched back to the regular camera, so wondered if there's a setting I'm missing in the Google camera or a different camera app that would process it differently?

I'm using CFL desktop lamps in a flourescent-lit warehouse space, same as I was with my previous Galaxy S9 that didn't have an issue with it. All my other photos elsewhere look great.

Draining and charging it while off (it reaches 100% and never drops that way, that made me suspect it could be a software problem), after turning it on it happens again. 
Charging it in safe mode, the same happens.
Cleaning the charging port.

(Attached is a screenshot of my charging status, the light green bar in the left shows the phone was plugged in and ""charging"" but as you can see at 10:17:56pm it dropped to 99%)

PIXEL 4 bluetooth connection problems with car bluetooth,"I have a pixel 4 purchased over thanksgiving, started using around christmas,

Pixel 3 (blueline) VoLTE Vodafone CZ,"I need enable VoLTE on Google Pixel 3 (blueline) phone for provider Vodafone CZ. I make some investigations about it:
1. My operator (Vodafone CZ) provisioning VoLTE and VoWiFi without device/phone/vendor filtering.
2. My sim card inserted into other phone (Nokia 4.2) registers into ims and on this phone VoLTE and VoWiFi works like charm.
3. My sim card inserted into Google Pixel 3 do not register device into ims and VoLTE and VoWiFi do not works.
4. If i extract content of current factory image for Google Pixel 3 there is partition vendor and on this partition is something what will be ""Qualcomm profile"" (configuration of phone part) for my operator (Vodafone CZ) and it is VoLTE configuration. Path to this file on vendor partition is: vendor.img/rfs/msm/mpss/readonly/vendor/mbn/mcfg_sw/generic/EU/Vodafone/VoLTE/CZ/mcfg_sw.mbn. I think that my Pixel 3 only do not know that there is this configuration file and do not load correct configuration for my operator.

My questions is:
It is possible that Google modify firmware for Google Pixel 3 (blueline) to enable VoLTE and maybe VoWiFi for my operator?
Is there something what i can do for asked modification? Ask operator or anything else?
Is there some reason why asked modification is not possible?

Thank You for any answers.

"Compatibility among Pixel, Pixel 2 and Pixel 3 cables ...?","I am interested in knowing if:

The cables USB-A to USB-C    and  USB-C both ends,  that came bundled with a brand new OG Pixel  XL (1st generation)  as well as the original Pixel XL charger that came bundled with it,  can be used with the 2018 Pixel 3 XL phone.

I kept those cables from the OG Pixel XL when that phone broke.  So, I want to use, specially the USB-A to USB-C to connect my phone to my computer and transfer files and use Android's ""adb and fastboot"" utilities.   Can that cable be used safely with the Pixel 3 XL ?

What about the OG Pixel XL charger ?  It seems to be also a 18W charger.  Is it functionally identical to the charger that comes bundled with a brand new Pixel 3 XL ?  Can it be safely used with the Pixel 3 XL ?

Lastly, the OG Pixel XL  USB-C to USB-C  charging cable... same thing,  can this be used with the PIxel 3 XL ?

Of course I am interested in engineering/science grounded answers,  not on beliefs or ""I think that"" answers... we need truthful info here as to not fry a brand new Pixel 3 XL !    Guess, that makes sense, right?

The reasons for asking this is that with (my) previous Google phones,  namely Nexus 6P,  it was absolutely NOT recommended to even exchange cables with the Nexus 5X ... due to some (lots?) of incompatibilities.  This was advised by Benson Leung  from Google.   https://bensonapprovedcom.wordpress.com/   back at the time.

Anyone else having issues connecting to LTE and receiving MMS messages with Pixel 3 on ATT?,"I've had a Pixel 3 on ATT essentially since launch. Everything was working find till about 1 month ago when I started having issues connecting to LTE and receiving MMS messages. 

For the LTE connection, this issue is in initial connection eg after turning off WiFi, or leaving wifi range, or leaving a dead zone (underground garage) the phone has difficulty connecting and shows ""No internet"". Sometimes it reconnects in a few minutes but sometimes it takes 30+ minutes. I havent found any solutions to get it to reconnect quickly: not toggling airplane mode or mobile data on and off, not restarting, not resetting network connections...nothing.
Once the phone eventually connects to LTE the data connection works fine and stays stably connected until I either go into a dead zone (eg underground parking lot) or connect to WiFi -- so the trouble really just seems to be with the initial connection.  Also, when the LTE isn't connecting i can still make and receive phone calls without any difficulty.

For MMS messages, I apparently have been missing missing a bunch of messages and even when i get them they are extremely delayed.  This issue started at the exact same time as the LTE issue, but seems to be independent of the LTE status--it happens whether or not the LTE is connected.  I seem to be able to send MMS messages without issues and send and receive SMS issues without any issues.

Both of these issues started at the same time. I live in a large urban area with good ATT signal. My wife does not have any of these issues in the same areas on her iPhone. I have found posts on Reddit and the ATT community forums where people describe similar issues. 

Unfortunately, both AT&T and Google support have been of little help.

Google support asked me to:
--Install the latest system updates (I was already updated to May and since the problem has been going on for so long I have subsequently installed the June security update)
--Reset network settings
--Uninstall updates to a variety of system apps including google connectivity services, pixel launcher, pixel ambient services (I don't remember the complete list anymore but I followed their instructions precisely)
--Check APN setting with my carrier (were already consistent with recommended settings).

AT&T support:
--Checked that my IMEI number matched (it already did)
--Manually re-provisioned my IMEI (I think multiple times now)
--Re-verified my APN settings again
--Some AT&T support agents have suggested replacing my SIM while others say this would not help (I haven't done this yet but supposedly they are shipping me a replacement SIM -- but I really don't see how this could be the issue)

Based on Reddit/AT&T community forum posts i have also tried:
--Disabling developer options
--Disabling enhanced 4G LTE mode
--Switching between 3G and LTE (as the preferred network type)

I think at the heart of it neither AT&T nor Google will truly acknowledge this issue -- they both act like I am the only one having this problem even when I point them to the articles, reddit posts and ATT posts. This is extremely disappointing when they have both advertised compatibility between the Pixel 3 and the ATT network.

Google has now offered to replace my device under warranty, but of course they only offer a refurbished replacement and its not even clear to me if its a hardware issue -- some people seem to report ongoing issues even after getting replacements.  Has anyone else here experienced the issues that I'm having?  If so, did a replacement solve the issue?  Maybe if enough people report this problem on the google boards we can draw their attention to the issue and get some response (when i point to reddit they say they are not ""able to comment on the content and issues specified on the third party websites"").","Connectivity, Network, Bluetooth"

Bluetooth media controls problem (volume/play w. Bose Soundlink),"Since I got my Pixel 4 (about a month and a half ago), I 'm having problems using the media controls of my Bose Soundlink Mini II.
Each time I turn on my Bose speaker, I will have separate controls for the volume (I need to adjust the volume on both the Pixel and the speaker) and the play/pause button won't work.
To temporarily fix the problem, I need to turn off then turn on the bluetooth in the Pixel settings, and once the Bose speaker is connected again, the controls will (more or less) work properly: the volume on the speaker will be linked to the phone volume (no need to adjust the volume on both devices) and the play/pause button will work, though very ofter I will have to press the button twice so that the action is registered  (my BT headphones have that problem too and I often need to push twice to play/pause ).
If I turn off the speaker and then turn it on, to get it to work properly, I have to start the forentioned procedure all over again.

How to change the default account for new contacts and new events?,"Hello all,

I am a happy user of Android 11 on a Pixel 3a. I decided to host my contacts and my calendar events on my own Nextcloud server using the davx5 (CalDAV/CardDAV provider for Android).

So:

- I deleted all my contacts on https://contacts.google.com/

- I deleted my events and calendars on https://calendar.google.com/calendar. Unfortunately, it is impossible to delete the ""Reminders"", ""Tasks"", and my name calendars (I imagine these are default mandatory calendars)

- I synced with my Android

- I disabled the sync of ""Calendar"", ""Contacts"" and ""Tasks in Calendar"" for my google account in the ""Accounts"" settings

Now, my Android is clean from any google contact or event. But when I create a new contact or a new event, they are added to my google account by default... So I need to be careful to chose the davx5 account each time.

So my question is simple; how can set my davx5 as the default account for my new contacts or events?

Astrophotography mode no longer turns on on Pixel 4 XL,"Astrophotography mode no longer turns on on my Pixel 4 XL.

When I leave the phone perfectly still on a tripod in the dark at night, and switch to Night Sight mode in the Camera app, nothing happens. Astrophotography mode doesn't turn on automatically, no confirmation toast messages are displayed, and there's no indication the mode is active. Tapping the shutter in the app just takes an ordinary Night Sight mode shot.

Here's how to reproduce the issue:

when the sky is dark, bring a photo tripod at a place facing the night sky
clasp the phone to the tripod
point the phone to the sky
on the phone, open the Camera app
in the Camera app, switch to Night Sight mode

At this point, nothing happens and Astrophotography mode doesn't turn on.

Trouble with Bluetooth compatibility and functionality.,"It seems that latest versions of Android are dismissing some Bluetooth functionality and/or compatibility with older Bluetooth standards. 

I've been using Bluetooth with my car stereo and car phone utility for years (like 7). ALL my smartphones worked great so far (including two Nexus devices I've had) BUT my Pixel XL with Android 9 and again now with 10 it's failing to fulfill some functions.

For starters there's no way to make the stereo show Song ID Tags, anything.  I've tried tenths of Music Player apps, including the ones that worked correctly in elder phones, also I've re-reviewed phone and stereo settings repeatedly.

Furthermore, when you try to make phone calls, some phone information cannot be retrieved.  It's not possible to navigate thru call history using stereo dash (nor missed, neither recent) even if you make the call from the stereo... Nothing never appears on any registry. It's possible to navigate the address book, and see names and numbers (since I've correctly set address book permissions on both devices) but that's it so far... Can't retrieve anything else.

Hope someone can help, also hope this is not a case of ""ceased for good"" compatibility thing.

"Faithfully stuck on ""preparing system update"" every month for the last 10-12 months.","This happened to me when I was using the Pixel 2 XL years ago, then the Pixel 3 XL, now the Pixel 4 XL .. with no definite solution at hand.

Toggling between networks, toggling airplane mode, device reboot, all the jazz. Never once seen this feature work. Even after 2hrs of inactivity letting it run in the background - which I'm pretty confident it's not running at all, given there's absolutely no way to see progress of any sort.

The only way is either to flash manually or via pixel tool, either way, both requires me to be at home and I'm mostly working. And not everyone has access to adb 24/7. What if there's a critical patch that needs to be pushed? 

Does anyone have a solution? Tried and tested?

Not using the device update OTA feature altogether seems to be the most popular ""solution"", which doesn't really fix things to begin with, rather, it avoids the broken feature altogether.

I hope mandatory manual flashing isn't gonna be a thing for the next 3-5 years with no end in sight. I think it's only reasonable to expect a basic, core function to work flawlessly.

How fast does a Pixel 4 XL battery charge?,"I've been trying to determine if my Pixel 4 XL charges at a ""good"" rate.
In the 10-50% charged range, it charges pretty consistently 1% increase per 36-38 seconds.
Is that ok?  Good?  Bad?

The battery is documented as 3700 mAh.
I assume that number is for 3.7V.

I hope I'm not publicly embarrassing myself with a simple error in my arithmetic...

I did a naive calculation based on above and arrive at,
if the 18W charging was 100% efficient,
charging would increase 1% per 27.4 seconds.


Comparing with my 36-38 seconds instead,
I'm getting only 13W effective results.

Or said in terms of efficiency, I'm getting only approx 72% efficiency.

Pardon my geeky question.  But I'm wondering.
Is 72% efficiency reasonable?
Is 36-38 seconds to raise battery charge by 1% pretty average for this battery+phone?

Maybe some readers will time their phone battery charging and post their results, please.

Pixel 3 overheating and drains battery quickly. Now it won't turn on.,"Hi,

I bought a Pixel 3 three months ago.
Yesterday morning when I woke up, I found my Pixel 3 was overheating and the surface was too hot to touch. The phone was automatically shutdown. 
When I tried to turn on the phone, the phone turned on for a bit and then turned off again. Eventually I booted the phone into the save mode, but the phone continued to overheating and won't cool down. So I turned off the phone.
After an hour turning off the phone, the phone was completely cooled down and I was able to boot into normal mode. However, after I booted the phone, it had 50% of battery left, and within 10 minutes, the phone battery reduced to 5% and became too hot to touch again. So I decided to shutdown the phone and refrain from using it.
Then I charged the phone overnight only to discover that the battery remained at 5%.
Now the phone won't turn on.

5G problem..

Other devices are not intended for Greece, but they have made sure that all their functions work, and in communication they make sure that they have an immediate solution and not an excuse, It's racist for other countries to have support and others not, as the Czech Republic is not in them, another has been resolved and they normally have 5g.

Turn on Wifi

Camera focus problem on Google Pixel 3,"Hello,
I am looking for a way to contact Google other than through https://store.google.com/gb/repair

My Google Pixel 3 camera has problems fixing focus on anything - autofocus is erratic, which is especially visible when shooting videos. The focus oscillates back and forth, but the objects are never sharp. The same happens when taking photos - my photos are out of focus, no matter what I do (even when touching the viewfinder to tell the phone which objects to focus on). I tried clearing the camera app's cache, but it did not help. I have a strong impression that it's a factory fault.

This is disappointing considering I bought this device specifically hoping for superior camera experience. I've found there are many other users with the same problem.

What makes things worse, Google support is simply non-existent. The site clearly says my device is covered by manufacturer's guarantee (see attached screenshots), but there is no way to send it back to Google - neither call nor chat are available at any time of the day for me.

Ironically, the Made By Google Twitter uses the slogan Help Done the Google Way. I even tried to contact them over Twitter, but they are not able to help.",Camera

I applied for the Android 12 beta program, and everything was working perfectly for about 3 weeks. Recently when switching to the recent apps menu, the phone froze, and a message stating that the Pixel Launcher had stopped working error message popped up, restarted the phone, and the error popped up again until eventually stating that a factory reset was necessary, so I went ahead.

Pixel 4 XL not responding to 'OK Google' when idle for a while,"My Pixel 4 XL has stopped responding to 'OK/Hey Google' commands when it's been left idle for a while.

Once that's been done it works fine again for a while until the phone has been idle again.

I've tried the following:

Clear cache and data
Uninstall and reinstall Google app
Delete and retrain Voice Match
Reset all settings in the app toggles

I don't think it's a hardware issue as once the Assistant is manually 'woken' it works fine again for some time.  None of my other devices have any issues (I have 3 Google Home Max and a Sony Android TV) so it's not a Voice Match issue.

Right now the Pixel can't connect more than 1 second to my Nexus 5x, Moto X4 or the Chromebook.
I believe this is just a software issue, otherwise why would it connect to Ubuntu yet not any of my Google devices?

Pixel 3a Bluetooth issues,"Ever since I got the Pixel 3a a few months ago I am having Bluetooth issues. I had the original pixel and I did not have any of these issues. It does not auto connect to my car like my old phone did, so I have to re connect it every time and even when I reconnect it , it sometimes just connects for media and not for phone calls, making me need to talk via the speaker of the phone. (Completely defeats the purpose). With my Fitbit, I keep finding I have to delete and reconnect it occasionally to keep it connected. I have tried resetting everything. Multiple times deleting and forgetting the connection and resetting it, for all devices, but the issue keeps happening. Also, this phone keeps turning on driving mode and do not disturb after I have deleted that rule multiple times. I have always used nexus and pixel phones because of its clean android features, but this is very frustrating.  Does anyone have other ideas of what I can do?","Connectivity, Network, Bluetooth"
Pixel 2 noise cancelling during phone calls not working.,"Hi, everyone! So this isn't a question so much as an answer that I hope Google takes notice of, or at least will allow to stay up for others to reference, because I believe it's the source of a variety of audio issues users are experiencing.

So after a couple of years of apparently annoying all my friends and family with my painfully loud and unfiltered phone calls on my Pixel 2, I finally figured out why: those tiny holes on the top and bottom of the phone are ambient mics that WORK TOGETHER to cancel out background noise.* My phone case has openings for the mics, but apparently the HOLES IN MY PHONE CASE WERE TOO SMALL for the mics to work properly. 

So basically I've been calling people with no noise cancelling functionality, and the tiniest of sounds were apparently getting picked up and amplified by the Pixel 2's impressively sensitive front-facing mics (they could literally hear me swipe on the phone, no matter how softly I touched it).

So tonight during a phone call with my long-suffering BFF, I took my phone out of its case. She immediately noticed a difference. She could no longer hear my shoes on the pavement, nor the boxes I was moving, nor the tap-tap-tapping on my phone. And for reasons unbeknownst to me, it even improved the audio when I used the mic on my Bluetooth headphones. I suspect the Pixel continues to do noise-cancelling through its ambient mics even when using an external mic.

So if you're having a problem with your end of the phone conversation being garbled, try removing your phone from its case and see if it helps.

I'm gonna need to try and drill bigger openings in this case...

*So this is just a hunch, but I think the way it works is since there's two front-facing mics next to the top and bottom speakers, those tiny holes filter out ambient noise for the adjacent main mics. Which is why you need to make sure both are clear of obstructions.","Contacts, Calls, Voicemail"
Pixel 2 Phone Settings Needs Camera permission to operate???! Suspicious much??,"I'm utterly confused as to why the settings app requires  the use of camera while on the app. Is there a reasonable reason for this?

Additionally the Google app won't let you choose the option of ""Use microphone while app in use"" and only lets you pick either use ALL The Time or Deny. Another fishy example. Does anyone know the reason for this or has anyone found a workaround to not allowing the Google app to use microphone at all times and only when using Google Assistant or the app?

Pixel 3 XL Verizon variant with Google Fi,"I have recently received a unlocked Verizon model of the Pixel 3 XL. After discussing with support, I initially came to find out that esim functionality was not available but I could utilize a Fi sim card on the device without losing any functionality. Specifically asked if carrier switch functionality would continue to work - was advised that it would. 

I have come to find out that carrier switching is not working on the device, and currently I am only able to receive T-mobile tower coverage.

"Google Pixel 4 XL won't turn on, displays question mark on battery symbol; Delays with GoogleSupport","Hi there,
A few days ago my Google Pixel 4 XL turned itself off and now won't turn on. It displays the battery with a question mark symbol. This is the second time the 4 XL has stopped working properly for me -- I bought one originally direct from Google in April 2020, then had to get it replaced once in July 2020 when it started switching itself off in my pocket. That one was replaced in July and now this issue has started.
I've chatted with Google Support, who said that I bought my phone from a retailer (I didn't -- bought it direct from Google), and I keep being told the issue is being investigated and they'll have an update 'soon'. I've been waiting three days now, and have this morning emailed through the original email receipts for the original purchase, then the replacement purchase in July.
In the meantime, I'm using an old backup device with a dodgy battery. In short, I totally regret purchasing the Pixel 4 XL and want to know what my options are. I've paid more money than I ever have before for this phone with which I am totally dissatisfied. 
Cheers,

I looked back on my previous phone (Huawei Mate P20), and the birthdays still show just fine on both of these widgets.

Pixel 3a XL Bad reception and more use of 3G than 4G,"Hello people,

I recently bought the 3a XL which is a solid phone but I am running into some connectivity issues.
I am using the phone in Germany with o2 (Telefonica) Provider and the phone's reception isn't the best.
For example at home my phone constantly uses 3G instead of 4G. My previous P20 Pro connected to 3G on the parking lot but as soon as I was entering the house it switched to 4G+ and stayed there. The signal strength was around -100dbm
My Pixel however only uses 3G. As soon as I drive away from home, it switches to 4G+.
Same at work. Stays at 3G all the time, as soon as I drive away from that place 4G+ again.
Yes, I am 100 percent sure, that there are no issues with the 4G towers nearby because it simultaneously double checked it with an other phone.
It's not like it doesn't connect to 4G at all, but it is still strange.
An other thing that cought my attention is that the 3a XL has a lower signal strength in general to my P20 pro, there is a constant difference between 5-7dbm.

My assumption: I guess the pixel connects to the stronger network by default and doesn't care about if it is 3G or 4G. At home there is a difference of 25dbm between them (3G has -75dbm and 4G around -100dbm). The -100 at 4G hasn't been a problem at all for the Huawei, while the pixel only sticks to 3G and I can't force it to stay at 4G.
Even after enabling and disabling the airplane mode, as well as restarting the device, the pixel stubbornly stays at 3G.
And as I have mentioned the signal strength is a bit more bad than on the Huawei.
I'd like my phone to be connected to 4G more often because of VoLTE.

Anyone else facing these ""issues"" or has some suggestions?

- I cannot hear any callers unless I'm on speaker, in any apps (e.g. Phone, Line, Grab, etc.) Starting few days ago.
- when connected to wireless audio gadgets, airpods, bluetooth speaker I can still hear anything just fine.
- At first two days, rebooth the phone solved the problem, even though after that the issue still persists.
- Today, reboothing doesn't save it any more. The issue seems to persist permanently.

"Wifi toggle button turns off randomly, and cannot turn it back on (Pixel 3).","The wifi function on my wife's Pixel 3 turns off randomly, ie, the 'Use Wi-fi' toggle button turns off. When we turn it back to 'on' wifi does not in fact turn on. Exiting out and going back to the Wi-fi area confirms that the toggle button is back in the 'off' position. 

Her phone has the latest Android version 11 installed. We have tried restarting the phone, and restarting in safe mode. We have also 'reset wi-fi mobile and bluetooth' settings. None of these steps work. Nevertheless, if we persist at turning the phone off and on then eventually wi-fi can be turned on. But the problem will occur again before too long, and without warning, so that my wife uses a lot of mobile data before she realises the problem has occurred. 

Another thing that happens when we are working with the wi-fi function (as we try to troubleshoot this problem) is the phone sometimes displays an error message 'UI System isn't responding', and we have to click 'close app' to return back to the previous screen and continue using the phone. 

My Pixel 3a is fine, and we have no connectivity problems. The issue is definitely with the phone, hardware or software. I have read online about this problem, and other users have found that a factory reset does not help, so I am loathed to try this due to the inconvenience involved.

Pixel 4 XL randomly shuts down and won't stay on for longer than a few minutes (battery is 100%),"First some information about what's happening.
Yesterday I received my phone and it was working perfectly. Played with it all day and installed my apps.
Then I went to sleep at night and it had about 13% battery percentage left and I put it on the charger.
This morning the device was turned off and when I pulled the charger out and plugged it back in it said it had 0% battery. But I could turn it back on again and then it said it was 100%. So I left it in the charger while it was turned on for a few minutes and when I came back to it, it was turned off again. If I removed the charger it wouldn't even start up. It would at first give me an icon that the battery was too low. And if I waited a few minutes it doesn't show anything on the screen. After that I put it on the charger again and when I booted the device it immediately shut down when it was on the lockscreen. I even had it shut down while booting. Also every time I wanted to boot the phone I needed to pull the charger out and put it back in. After this I tried booting it in safe mode, but the same story here. It turned off after a minute or so. So I went to work and left it off for about 45 minutes. I put it on the charger at work and turned it on while leaving it still on the table and it stayed on for a few minutes. A colleague suggested to shake the device to see if it would shut down suddenly and it did. He thinks it is a battery connector issue.
So I tried the last thing I could do, a factory reset. It shut down when the device wanted to start erasing all data. Then when starting it up again it erased all data and I was in the welcome screen. The battery was 100% and I pulled out the charger and it turned off again.

To sum up what I tried:
Boot without charger (doesn't boot up at all)
Boot with charger connected (shuts down after a minute or so)
Boot in safe mode (shuts down after a minute or so)
Factory reset (shuts down in start screen as well)

I really don't know what to do right now. I just received it yesterday :(. Also I ordered it from the UK and I live in the Netherlands, so if there is anything I can do without sending it back that would be awesome.
If I do need to send it back, how will that work? Do I need to send it back to my friend in the UK which will send it back to Google? And how do I start the send back procedure?

I hope someone can give me some more information about what's happening. Thanks in advance!",Battery and Power

Pixel 3 XL reflects incorrect battery percentage,"Hello, 

I have had a Google Pixel 3 XL for about a year and a half now. 

A couple months ago, my Pixel died and wasn't charging or powering on. After about 48 hours on the charger, it turned on. Everything worked fine. 

A few weeks after the phone died and turned back on, the phone shut down again, but this time I was able to power it back on after a few minutes of charging, which brought it back up to about 75% (oddly swift). Shortly after powering up the phone and pulling it from the charger, I watched as the percentage dropped from 75% to 1% in only a few seconds. 

After some charging and use, I realized that the battery itself is actually fine. The phone remains functional through my regular use, and for about as long as it always did, before the percentage drop issue. 

I've done all of the troubleshooting steps, including an FDR. I've noticed that the percentage begins it's cascade any time I receive an in-bound notification. I tampered with notifications a bit, including turning off notifications entirely. I had my lady send me a few messages, and even when I've got notifications off, the percentage drops.  

I'm happy the phone is still functional. However, it's frustrating that I never actually have an accurate reflection of the battery life. I've tried some battery apps, and even searched through apps and services to make sure nothing fishy is on the phone. 

Any advice or information would totally be helpful, and appreciated.

Android devices having issues with new WiFi router/modem,"I have three android devices (Pixel 5, Galaxy S8+, Google Chromecast with Google TV).

"Can you stop removing features on Pixel phones, please?","I bought a 3a pixel a couple of months ago and since then I've only seen the features decrease:
- Instead of the ringtone/notifications the volume keys change the multimedia volume even when you don't use any multimedia. 
- The ambient display could be set to appear only when the device was raised, shortly after this feature was replaced by the full display which blinds when the device is raised in the middle of the night.
- Recorded videos have a very loud hiss that makes them horrible. To be able to remove this whistle is necessary to disable the Now Playing function or the Voice Assistant (both features that I like.)
- In the latest version of the camera you have removed:
    - burst photos (one of the best features!)
    - the possibility to choose video resolution
    - the astrophotos added with V7.2 and removed immediately (I was very keen on it but I didn't had time to test it)

Selfie Camera Quality Reduction Pixel 4a,"I bought my Pixel 4a in October, when it was launched in India. The main reason for buying the device was it's camera. And I was super happy about it at the beginning.

Since the camera used to take splendid images earlier, I feel it is a software issue rather than anything to do with the hardware. Just look at the attached image, the one on the right was taken the very next day I bought the phone while the one on left was taken today. 

I understood that I'm not the only one facing the issue as couple of my friends who own the phone also told me the same. There are also numerous posts about it in this forum too. And if we google it, you can see a lot of people have the same issue.

Why does my Pixel 3 generate hundreds of thousands of DNS queries per day?,"I am using a Pixel 3 with an eSIM from T-Mobile in Germany. The phone itself is running Android 9 Build PQ3A.190705.003
Since I started using this phone I am seeing literally hundreds of thousands of DNS queries every day to the following addresses:
- pcscfhost1.ims.telekom.de
- pspcscfhost2.ims.telekom.de
- _sip._tcp.pcscf2.ims.telekom.de
- _sip._udp.pcscf2.ims.telekom.de
- _sips._tcp.pcscf2.ims.telekom.de
This query volume is a factor 100 higher than any other device on the network (including several non-Pixel phones with T-Mobile SIM cards). The queries occur whenever the device is unlocked. During that time the addresses above are being queried multiple times a second.
Switching off Wi-Fi Calling and the extended (?) LTE support functions in the provider settings seem to have no effect. Only disabling the eSIM profile curtails this request flood.
Initial queries via the T-Mobile support forums have not brought any major light to this topic, except that the servers mentioned above are used for configuring services like SMS over IMS, WiFi Calling, VoLTE etc. Why however this leads to a barrage of DNS queries is a mystery.

Why does Pixel 4a camera scale down panorama images to very low resolution ?,"Photos taken using the panorama feature are always scaled down, so that the short side is around 1600 pixels long. It makes the panorama feature useless, as the images can't be blown up or cropped .

Pixel 5 battery drain and huge drop in remaining percentage after reboot,"My Google Pixel 5 battery percentage sometimes drops suddenly from wherever it is at to a much lower value after reboot, or earlier today, even while using the phone.

Some of the threads seem to suggest that turning off 5G makes it better, but my phone is usually on Wifi at home, and yet it still happens.

This is totally ridiculous because I have had this phone for only a couple of months now, and cannot trust this device to last: the only reason I bought it was that Google wouldn't provide any more security updates on my Pixel 2XL, which still performs like a champ, otherwise.

I cannot change or add ANY custom notification sounds in Android 10 on my Pixel 3,"Title says it all. Please note that before I updated to Android 10, this worked just fine with the exact same custom tones.
Pixel 3, Android 10, latest security/Play patches, all apps up to date

I already know how to make and add my own ringtones and notification tones, have been doing it on every Android phone I've ever owned going back to my Moto Droid. Adding custom ringtones works fine, but I cannot change a single notification tone (Messages, GMail, etc.) away from the default; even the builtin sounds don't work, only the single default one (which is Popcorn on my phone).

I can create and add custom notification tones to the phone itself, and they even show up under ""My Sounds"" when going to change the tone, but when I tap on the new sound, nothing plays (should play a preview of the tone). Moreover, if select any of the builtin Google tones, same result: no sound. If I tap back to the default, it plays the preview sound. If I leave it set to my custom sound (or another builtin that isn't the default), I simply get nothing when that particular notification comes in. I tested this in Messages, GMail, Outlook, and Discord, so it is also not specific to only GApps.

It seems like the issue is with the new Notification system in Android 10.

What I've already tried:
Factory reset, whereby I immediately tested this before restoring anything, so none of my apps can possibly be causing this. This should have fixed if it was an issue I caused; this points me towards Android 10 itself as the culprit
Prior to my factory reset, I tried the following:
I've tried .mp3, .ogg, .flac, and .m4a formats for the custom tones, all the same result
I cleared all cache/data of every app I could think of (Messages, GMail, Sounds, etc.)

Any help is greatly appreciated....having custom notification sounds for the different apps has always been one of my favorite things about Android, and now that every app has the same notification sound...ugh.",Setting up and Personalizing your Device

"Need to know why the process of detecting devices on a network has changed, and how I can solve it.","I have a network setup (a digital audio mixer attached to a wireless router through ethernet cable, i do NOT need internet access on this router's network, it just allows me to control the mixer wirelessly from my pixel 2 (Android 9, latest update) or any other android/ios/pc/mac device that can connect to the router's wi-fi with help from the mixer's android/ios/pc downloadable app). Again I DO NOT and WILL NOT have any internet access with this network because it is not needed.

Here is my issue: when I connect to the network's wi-fi from my PIXEL 2, I type in the password and it connects to the network fine, but it does not recognize the device (mixer) on the network UNTIL I press ""yes"" when it asks if I want to ""stay connected to the network since it does not have internet access?"". That wouldn't be an issue, but when i disconnect the PIXEL 2 from the wireless network or the connection is interrupted, I will connect to the saved network for the second time but the notification for ""stay connected?"" never pops up, EVEN THOUGH I left the box for ""don't ask me again for this network"" UNCHECKED because I WANT it to ask again. It seems the PIXEL 2 does not look for devices on the network until AFTER I hit ""yes stay connected"", however when I connect to the network using my NEXUS 5X running android lollipop, it recognizes the device on the network RIGHT AWAY before the ""stay connected?"" notification even pops up. This is how I KNOW it is an issue with the PIXEL 2 SPECIFICALLY. Either that or there was a change to exactly WHEN android recognizes devices on a network that is not connected to the internet. (The Pixel 2 on Pie recognizes devices AFTER I hit ""yes stay connected"" as opposed to the nexus 5X on lollipop recognizing it BEFORE the pop up.) All I want is for the PIXEL 2 to do what my nexus 5X does. Look for devices BEFORE the ""stay connected?"" screen. Either that or actually ask me everytime I connect to the SAVED network. I was not able to get help from Pixel support and it should not matter that my mixer is a third party product because it is just a device with an IP address connected to the router through an ethernet cable and this all works like it should only on the PIXEL 2 I keep having to ""forget"" the network and reconnect with the password to get the ""stay connected?"" notification to pop up so I can hit ""yes"" and it finally will recognize the devices on the network. Both Google PIXEL and NEXUS 5X can see the device, but the Nexus 5X sees the devices on the network BEFORE it asks me to ""stay connected?"", while the pixel looks for it AFTER I hit ""yes"" which is a problem because it only asks me when I connect for the first time, never again unless I ""forget"" the network and start over. I would SO GREATLY appreciate some info on why this is an issue on the Pixel 2 and not the Nexus 5X, it is the same OS (stock android), just a different version.

For half a decade I have enjoyed no problems making calls this way through Google Contacts and Google Maps with Hangouts on my LG Nexus 5X :)  How do I now enable my new PIXEL to do the same thing????? 

I just want to click a phone number and make a phone call.

Struggling to get right support for More than 1 Month (Case ID 3-4489000031425),"Dear team,

This is regarding my case ID 3-4489000031425 for which i am following up for more than 1 month. 

Issue : Facing coverage/Network issues in the new device and google support picked up the mobile for repair service. After 10 days, received the device without a fix and still having issues.
I have been following up with the support team for more than 45 days and seems they are lethargic  about the case.
Finally, they gave a feedback that in India, they don't have replacement/refund options and they can only provide repair service. Now again they are requesting to send the mobile for diagnosis after 45 days of follow-up. During this pandemic situation and being at work from home, i am more dependent on mobile and how can i again manage without a mobile again?

Buying a New device, expensive and renowned brand, but when so much of functional issues happen, the support is very disappointing. I am stuck and Can someone please advice on the solution and how to take this further?

Regards,
Jk.","Connectivity, Network, Bluetooth"

Bluetooth connects but more often than not doesn't send media audio.,"I have searched through the forums and not found a thread or solution exactly to my issues with my Pixel 2 XL (though I'm sure it's out there somewhere). My Bluetooth will connect perfectly fine with devices, no problem there. The problem is that media-type audio (most of the time) will not come through, and yes I obviously have the device (my Bluetooth earphones in this case) set to media in the settings. The audio will cut out from the phone as if it's sending it to my devices, but NO SOUND will come through. There is even some white noise on my earbuds like normal so I know the device is working and ready to receive audio. The weird thing, is that when I make calls I get audio perfectly fine!! Example, I can make calls back and forth through my headset with NO ISSUES, but I'll jump to youtube to watch a video and I get NO SOUND.

PLEASE HELP!

I have tried:
-Turning phone and device on and off again
-Unpairing and re-pairing device
-Clearing Bluetooth cache and storage data
-Updating to the most recent OS update
-Using different Bluetooth devices
-Resetting phone to factory default settings

Missing Contacts on Pixel 2 XL Android 10,"Yesterday, I noticed a contact was missing from my phone. I thought it weird, but I just added him back in. Today, I found another contact was missing from my phone. I checked online at contacts.google.com and they were no longer listed there either. I'm certain that I didn't delete them, and I'm a bit concerned as to why my contacts are randomly disappearing.

"Pixel 4, Assistant No longer works.","Chaps,

Assistant no longer recognises or responds to my voice. It seems to have started some time after the January Patch, and the February patch (2020). (Maybe an app update in between?)

I don't use assistant often, but when I do, it's a must. And I've never had an issue with it until now.

I have followed the online help article, and deleted and retrained the voice profile, which makes it work temporarily, but after locking my phone, and leaving it sat for half an hour or so, when I try to command the assistant, it fails to respond.

Anyone else getting this?
How do I solve it once and for all?

"Pixel 3a, fully patched, Google Fi stopped talking to my Bluetooth Panasonic 5 headset station.","I've had this happen once before.  I updated the Android software, and I had to move my Panasonic base station 3 feet away from the phone, rather than 8 feet away.  The 'update' made the bluetooth Less reliable.

I's 3 feet away now.  Just stopped working again even though it shows up as a connected device.  No updates on the Panasonic, Ever. So the only thing that changes are software 'updates' on the Pixel.

And the whole point of a Pixel, is that you get the updates faster, which end up killing Something each time.

And then I restarted the Pixel, seemed like a good idea?  NOT

My Call Screening stopped working AGAIN after the restart.  No more call screening.  Worked fine while trying to debug the bluetooth issue (but, Call Screening REGULARLY just disappears).

With the Pixel, something it going to just stop working every day, it's the worst phone I've ever owned, and I have several iPhones, which can be problematic, but their BASIC FEATURES work.  I can use the iPhone as a Phone.

I can't do that with the Pixel.

Tried forgetting and re-pairing,   Tried turning Bluetooth off and on.

Spotify mobile streaming stuttering in WiFi and Data,"For the past several months I have noticed an increase in excessive music streaming stuttering no matter if I am connected to WiFi or driving around using data, I noticed it seemed to clear up momentarily if I touched my phone(usually when I am streaming through mobile, my phone isn't being held, it's just set aside). I first assumed it was a Pixel problem and reached out to support(chat) and after me telling them that I had tried reinstalling the app after clearing all the casche and also doing a full factory reset, since I told them it was only happening on Spotify, they told me to contact their customer support. I have been in contact with them and doing extensive I.T. problem solving, they have now deemed it a Pixel problem so I am here again begging for help to fix an unusable app. I mentioned above some things I had troubleshooted, but here's what else I did: logged into a friend's account on mobile to see if it was account based(it wasn't), tested other phones in the household(pixel 4A) for the issue(none), tested our home computers(no issues). With that I deemed it not a Wi-fi issue. I then downloaded a playlist to see if having the files on my phone would help(it didn't), I used a jitter test to experiment with jitter when I held or touched the phone(the number stayed constant) so jittering wasnt an issue. While doing that jitter test I did find something interesting though. I turned my screen timer from 1min to 30min. Whenever I had tried to do a speed test in the past, since it takes me a bit to unlock my phone(and touch it), the issue would always clear up by the time I initiated the test. What I did notice is that I had zero stuttering when my screen stayed on, the minute it timed out, it went right back to stuttering. Definitely not expecting that, so there's something there. I also experimented by turning my phone on airplane mode while I played that downloaded playlist, to see if it was some kind of data leak(still stuttered), I streamed an hour each of Pandora and YT and neither stuttered. This happens when I'm playing it just through my phone speakers or connected to Bluetooth. I tried giving the app all permissions, changing the battery settings(unoptimized and background app refresh). That's about it, this seems to be a phone issue, not an app issue. Is there something else I can do or try to help you guys solve this issue?","Connectivity, Network, Bluetooth"

"I get error on Google Maps ""This device is not sending location updates"" (Pixel 4 XL)","I bought Pixel 4 XL and activated sharing of my location on Google Maps. I was pretty sure that everything is working till I received a feedback that I've been offline since then. I went on Google Maps app and see there an error ""This device is not sending location updates"" and a ""Fix"" option. When I click on Fix, I see a loading circle but nothing happends, in few seconds ""Fix"" appears again.

I assumed the problem was due to the fact that I was transitioning from my other phone (Samsung) and Google Maps got confused that I was at 2 devices. So I manually deactivated location sharing on the old device just in case. It didn't help.

I've read other posts on this topic, tried turning off and on this feature, changing settings, even uninstalled the whole app. Nothing helped.

Unable to send or receive messages through the Messages app on Android 10,"I installed Android 10 on my Pixel 3 on Sunday, and it was functioning just fine for a while. I was able to send and receive SMS messages through the messages app.

Yesterday, upon sending a text, my phone shut off and went into a boot loop. I was able to get the phone back on by booting into recovery mode. This happened a few more times when trying to send texts, but it eventually stopped. Now when I attempt to send a message through the Messages app, it disappears and does not send.

If I have the Messages app set as default, I will not receive texts whatsoever.

If I use the Verizon ""Message+"" app, I can send and receive SMS and MMS messages just fine.

Troubleshooting steps I have already tried:
- Delete app cache and app data for Messages app
- Delete app cache and app data for all SMS/MMS/messaging related apps
- Rebooting the phone
- Removing and reinserting my SIM card

I feel as though this issue might be related to chat features, because the settings sometimes says ""Chat features are not available for this device."" If I switch my default sms app to Message+, then back to Messages, I can enable chat features and I can send and receive texts for about 30 seconds. Then the app goes back to not allowing me to send or receive anything. 

Kind of bummed that I can't use such a basic smartphone application on Google's latest phone on their latest OS. But at least I can work around this for now with a different default SMS app.

Then when I save it the phone number appears as xxx-xxx-xxxx. If I want to save the number as (xxx) xxx-xxxx I figured out I have to save the contact with the +1 included, then edit the contact and remove the +1, now it will appear correctly.

The problem is when I try to download eSiM. As you can see from attached screen shots, there is a + sign next to a Mobile Network, if I press that and choose to download eSIM instead, camera activates and it's ready to scan a barcode provided by network provider, but after scanning it just hangs saying ""Checking network info"" and that's all (I even left it for a night). I've a good wifi signal during the process, also tried to repeat the process with removed physical sim, still no luck. 
The strange thing is that, when I call to my network provider support they say that somehow a number is already registered and shows a status as activated. It means that my phone somehow has ""downloaded"" eSIM but I cannot see or use it. 
Then after some googling I've found this article:
Pixel 3: Phones bought with service from any US or Canadian carriers other than Sprint and Google Fi don't work with eSIM. Phones bought in Australia, Taiwan, and Japan also don't work with eSIM.

How abruptly this stopped working, I'm thinking it must be related to the Android update. Probably some super stupid power savings feature that nobody wanted to begin with (just 2 weeks ago, I would run the hot spot on battery for 8+ hours doing video calls for work and Pixel 5 battery would still have 50% charge).

Pixel 3a - intermittent Bluetooth connectivity,"Whenever listening to Audio on my phone via Bluetooth, it starts out great then after a few minutes it starts stutter and then cutting out. And then totally cuts put when the phone is locked.
This happens on Bluetooth earphones, speakers etc. This has only started since the android 11 update!

This whole 3rd-party-app-blaming is rubbish.

If so many people are reporting an issue with stuttering Bluetooth connectivity after updating the OS, then it must be a software problem!ki

Google needs to take responsibility and fix these bugs. I cannot factory reset my phone and have 3 apps on (including Spotify) but the issue is still third party.

If the update isn't compatible with some of the world's most popular apps, then in my opinion the fault lies is the OS.

1st Gen Pixel: Can't Make or Receive Calls,"Hi,

I have a 1st generation Google Pixel. I have been having problems with the phone for months now. I can't make or receive calls. When I receive a call, I answer and then the phone freezes and I have to restart the device by holding the power button long enough. Sometimes I answer it and it just returns me to the call menu (I don't know what its called, the menu when you receive a call where you can accept or reject the call). Sometimes it does successfully accept the call but there is no sound. And very rarely I accept it and I can hear the other person but the sound cuts like 20 seconds into the call. Same problems when I try to make a call as well. And not just with the Phone app, same problems occur when trying to use WhatsApp call. I have tried disabling some services, tried deleting the updates for the Phone app, tried deleting some apps and then all apps, tried Safe Mode, Factory Reset with my apps restored and Factory Reset with none of my apps/settings restored. None of it worked so far. The screen is cracked on the top left corner (I don't know if its related). I would like to know, is this a hardware issue or a software issue? Because (as I live in Turkey), there won't be much I can do in terms of repair if it is a hardware issue. So depending on that I will buy a new phone.

Thanks in advance.","Contacts, Calls, Voicemail"

·Install latest updates (was already on the latest update)

·Check battery usage report for apps draining the battery (there were none, and the report did not add up to the amount of battery drain)

·Reboot in safe mode, to disable all 3rd-party apps

·Factory Reset

Pixel 2 XL thinks it gets connected to a charger every few seconds,"My phone randomly notifies(vibrates\beeps) as if it was connected to a charger when it's actually not.
I could even see that for a split-second the battery icon changes to being charged. (It immediately goes back to indicate that it's not connected)

It happens about 2-3 times a minute, and besides being annoying, i've also noticed that my battery drains much faster now, and I think that it might be because of that.

I have no problems with charging my phone, it works fine and that's the only time when I don't get that constant random notifications.

I've tried booting in safe mode, and the problem persists so it's not a 3rd party app.
I think that it started when I update to Android 10 but i'm not 100% sure.

"Pixel 4 XL - Battery will not charge while powered on or off. ""Plugged in, can't charge right now""","This issue started after the November update that brought Adaptive Battery to the Pixel 4. At that point, the device would not charge on occasion, but would again after a restart. In the last 2 days, the issue has progressed to the point that it will not charge at all, even after restart or when powered down. When plugged in it displays ""Plugged in, can't charge right now,"" under Settings -> Battery.

This is using the cable the device was shipped with, and after trying all suggested troubleshooting found on this site (including plugging into a PC for 10-15 minutes, and all the way to a factory reset). Google support was unhelpful, stating the device was 1 month out of warranty and I was free to try a repair location or buy a new device.

For others having a similar issue, the workaround that is working is shutting the phone down and starting into Fastboot mode. To do so, power down, and then hold the power button and volume down button together for 5+ seconds until it powers on. Do not select any of the following options (Rescue, Recover, Start, etc). The device charges while in the Fastboot state (with the screen permanently on), but only in that state.

Google Pixel 1 - GPS Drifts up to 1 mile away (Not on Android 10),"Since 3.5 weeks ago, my GPS dot suddenly started drifting around the map (sometimes up to a mile away) when driving OR simply just sitting at home, using Google Maps.

I can easily reproduce the issue by just sitting at home and trying to navigate somewhere on Google Maps, and watching the dot jump around.

Aside from Factory Data Reset, I've actually replaced the phone with not one, but two like-new refurbished phones. I am still experiencing the same exact issue.

I've double-checked enabling all location services/accuracy (I always have them enabled in general). Tried the usual ""turn it off and turn it on again"" of course.
One phone I tried testing with the Android 10 update. The other phone (that I currently have), I *did not* update to Android 10. Both phones have the same issue.
I've tried clearing Google Maps data/cache
Used a GPS repair app to clear GPS cache/recalibrate it.
Replaced the SIM card with a brand new card (twice)
My wife has a Google Pixel of the exact same model (Pixel 1) as me, but a different network (she is on AT&T, I am on Verizon) and has no problems at all. So I don't think it's our environment (walls, vehicle) causing problems.
Also, this problem only started happening recently, after working fine for 2 years.

To summarize:
Phone 1 - Google Pixel - Android 10 - Verizon - GPS drifts (after working fine for 2 years), bought in 2018
Phone 2 - Google Pixel - Android 10 - Verizon - GPS drifts, ""like-new"" refurbished by Asurion in 2020
Phone 3 - Google Pixel - Android 9 - Verizon - GPS drifts, ""like-new"" refurbished by Asurion in 2020
Phone 4 - Google Pixel - Android 10 - AT&T - GPS works fine, bought in 2018
Edit:

Also tested swapping the SIM cards in Phone 3 and Phone 4. After swapping the SIM cards, Phone 4 reproduced the issue and Phone 3 worked perfectly.

Verizon insists the issue isn't on their end (I contacted technical support).

"Pixel XL (Gen 1) dead after Android 10 Update (Not powering, No indication)","Hi All,

What Happened:
Updated my Pixel XL (Gen 1) with Android 10 software on 20th Sept 2019. 
Directly after the update the phone did turn on but it reset itself 3 times when I went to use it. 
I left it overnight on the charger and when I woke the phone was completely dead. 

Symptoms:
Phone will not power up.
No battery low indication when phone turned on or in charger (Screen completely black). 

What I have tried:
- Every button press configuration (power, power+volume, all buttons) - (no change)
- Different charger/cables (no change)
- Connected phone to computer. Computer gave the sound like a device was connected but could not see phone in windows explorer and still did not get any indication on the phone. 

Questions:
- Has the software bricked the phone?
- Has the software stopped me from charging the phone?
- Am I supposed to just accept that after the Android 10 update my phone is now dead and I need a new one? This is completely unacceptable.

If other Pixel XL (gen 1) users that haven't updated to Android 10 yet, then I would be very careful. I waited 17 days before updating and still had issues with some sort of bug. 

Can the Google Pixel team please register this as an issue and help the community to resolve.

Really poor wifi compared to other phones,"Hey guys,

I got a new pixel 3xl and it's performing very poorly with WiFi.

I have a Samsung Galaxy S7 and an iPhone 6 right next to it, on the same wifi network: the galaxy & iphone get moderate network strength and no connectivity issues.

Pixel 3 is showing poor signal strength, keeps dropping the connection on and off. It's quite annoying to work with.

What gives? Why is pixel struggling when 3+ year old phones are having no problems?

I can't do anything with the router, by the way. I'm in a university residence and we get one master connection. The point is that the pixel underperforms compared to other phones, not that the connection is bad in and of itself.","Connectivity, Network, Bluetooth"

Adding eSIM to Pixel 3a,"I have a Pixel 3a XL. Glad that DSDS was activated/ official for Pixel 3a series. After updating to Android 10 on release day, I tried to add esim to my phone to use 2 SIMs. 

OK, I tried using an esim from a carrier that specifically stated that they did not guarantee their eSIM will work with Pixel phones as they only supported the fruit phones. So with that in mind, I went ahead nevertheless and obtained the eSIM QR code from the carrier (""Carrier 1""). Followed the usual process to add eSIM: -
Settings -> Network & Internet -> ""+"" Mobile Network -> ""Don't have SIM card"" -> ""Checking network info..."" -> camera automatically fired-up to scan the given QR code;
scanned the QR code of Carrier 1; and
received error message ""Networks not activated"".

OK, fine.... Carrier 1 already said they did not guarantee their eSIM will work on Pixel.

And after some forum discussions with fellow users in the same country who succesfully added esim to their Pixel 3 (not 3a) using other carriers who also specifically stated that they only supported the fruit phones, I decided to instead try another carrier's eSIM (""Carrier 2"").

Prior to trying to Carrier 2, these were the intervening matters: -
network settings (only) were reset, including checking the box to reset ""downloaded sims""; and
updated apps - including ""SIM Manager"" by Google [current version D.1.5.73-google (5793666)].

So went to Carrier 2's store and requested their eSIM. Again, followed the usual process to add eSIM: -

Android Auto doesn't work on Pixel 5,"Android auto on my Pixel 5 does not work on my 2021 DMax.  I contacted the Android Auto team and they advised to contact Pixel support after I provided a debug.  Advice was it was an issue with the phone, not the application.  What I know:

- The phone does charge successfully when connected
- All other devices (about 10 tested) work across different manufacturers although I haven't tested another Pixel 5
- Pixel 2 works fine with the same cable
- Phone has been wiped of its cached, updated etc following standard support advice with no success

Apps and latency around 3rd party apps,"Both my partner and I have had Pixel phones since the original Pixels came out. We recently moved into a new house and we're using the exact same modem/router setup from the old house (Cox). Now, we are not able to open certain 3rd party apps on our phones, which appear frozen but if you wait 1+ minutes, it will load. I have tried all the usual troubleshooting; forced re-start, reset all WiFi/Network/Bluetooth setting, restarting modem/router, system/security updates, speed test (350 down, 48 up) etc. If I turn WiFi off, I have no problems at all. In fact, everything works perfectly on other WiFi's, just not my home WiFI. I have dual band, I have tried both 2.5 and 5 channels with no difference. The Wifi works fine on my other devices, such as home computer, tablets, and TVs. I can't seem to find any answer. Interestingly, I pulled out my original Google Pixel and it has the same issue with latency around 3rd party apps as our 3A's? Could it be the Pixel OS and compatibility issues with my modem/router? And why all of a sudden? Any ideas or support would be awesome, thanks!

Android 11 on Pixel 4 has a bug that impairs launch of Assistant,"I have a Pixel 4 and recently upgraded to Android 11. It turns out Android 11 has a bug on the Pixel 4 and once you upgrade the OS you can no longer launch the Assistant by voice. The Google Assistant will instead keep saying ""can't reach Google at the moment"". I have tried every normal fix and have tried a session with Google Help chat including a factory reset. The problem only occurs when starting the Assistant via voice. However, when I click in the search field in the Google app and then ask for a search via voice, it works fine. So the problem is in the handoff from saying OK Google to getting the Assistant to listen and respond. You might say this is Not OK Google! And it’s not the account, as the same account on my older Pixel with Android 10 is fine, so it’s only after upgrading to Android 11 on the Pixel 4 that I’ve had this issue. So I’m 99% sure there’s a bug that Google needs to patch here. This should be elevated to the respective device and product teams ASAP.

My 1st Gen Pixel XL reading no SIM card now?,"I purchased a second-hand 1st gen Google Pixel XL 'Really Blue' (such a beautiful phone btw) about 1.5mo ago and everything was working 100% when I purchased it. I was primarily going to use this phone simply because of the camera, which 1000% better than my Note 8 daily driver. However, after a week of reminiscing of when I owned the smaller Google Pixel in the same color. The UI, the quality, honestly the overall everything of the phone is just so pure and far more enjoyable than any phone I have used to date. This meant going back and forth between using my Note 8 and the Pixel XL as my daily drivers, which meant I would be able to use the phone for calls, text messaging, and data. All of that worked good and fine up until about 2 weeks ago now. It is tragic to say the least, but it is far worse: now I cannot use the phone period anymore since having the issue aforementioned as my title.

I have literally tried everything under the Sun for troubleshooting, even going as far to unlock the bootloader, flash previous versions of Pie and I went as far as flashing 8.1 Oreo. I figured it was a software issue hence why I went that far and the reason I went that far is because the other day, I inserted my Verizon SIM from my Note 8 and I say the service icon in the status bar show up for a split second, and then disappear as soon as it popped up. So, something is sort of working, but not. It could be hardware; it could also just simply be software. Oh, no water/moisture damage and I have not dropped it since I had it. The previous owner did, but again, it worked fine even so.

Again, I purchased this second-hand as a private sale, not through my carrier. Going to them would be futile in essence simply because Verizon enjoys making their customers jump through hoops. I digress... I have referred to XDA and Google Search in an attempt to find someone with the same issues I am having and then I stumbled across the Pixel Community Hub (this wonderful place) and found that my issue is apparently a big issue. I am posting another thread simply because I was not satisfied with the answers I was reading. I am looking for a somewhat more advanced answer I guess, if I can even get one. I am considering to root my device and see if that helps and try to dig through system phone/modem apps and sort out the issue (if even possible). Honestly, the SIM reader could just be broken, but this was a last chance effort before I give up 100%.","Connectivity, Network, Bluetooth"

Pixel 2 freezes when connected to any charger,"Shortly after the April update, I noticed my overall battery time drop from a projected 11 hours, to about 7 with the percentage dropping rapidly during normal usage.

Solved (for me) Add eSIM to Pixel 3 (problem was I could not find Add Carrier option),"Pixel 3 purchased from Google store. Should be fully unlocked and unassociated with any carrier. I wanted to add an eSIM by scanning a QR code. Running updated Android 10 (to Oct 23, 2019) I could not find the option to Add Carrier. Ivy at Google support went through her support documents and found one reference that ""in Canada, can only have one SIM card in the phone"". This was ambiguous as the phone only takes one sim card. But on a hunch, I turned the phone off and removed the physical sim card. On starting the phone without the sim card, I was able to add a carrier. I scanned the QR code and the eSIM installed. I powered off the phone, re-installed the physical sim card and now I have two carriers available PLUS the ability to add more carriers.

So try powering down, remove the physicals sim card, power back up and see if you can add a carrier. If so, the camera should activate and you can scan your QR code to add the eSIM. Power back down and re-install the physical sim card. You can get a free QR code for testing from Orbixi.com.

1st Gen Pixel Can’t Make/Receive Calls,"Hi,

I have a 1st generation Google Pixel. I have been having problems with the phone for months now. I can't make or receive calls. When I receive a call, I answer and then the phone freezes and I have to restart the device by holding the power button long enough. Sometimes I answer it and it just returns me to the call menu (I don't know what its called, the menu when you receive a call where you can accept or reject the call). Sometimes it does successfully accept the call but there is no sound. And very rarely I accept it and I can hear the other person but the sound cuts like 20 seconds into the call. Same problems when I try to make a call as well. And not just with the Phone app, same problems occur when trying to use WhatsApp call. I have tried disabling some services, tried deleting the updates for the Phone app, tried deleting some apps and then all apps, tried Safe Mode, Factory Reset with my apps restored and Factory Reset with none of my apps/settings restored. None of it worked so far (after all that I am convinced this is a hardware issue, not a software issue). The screen is cracked on the top left corner (I don't know if its related). I would like to know, which part of the phone needs to be changed/repaired, which hardware component is the cause of this problem? I love this phone, and if this problem is fixed I want to keep using it. Since I live in Turkey, I cannot send it abroad for replacement because the tax I would pay for the replacement device is just unbelievably high. And since Google left the Turkish market I have no place to go in Turkey as well. If you could tell me what is the problem, what needs changing, which parts are the cause, if you could tell me the solution I might get it fixed through a 3rd party repair shop, and keep using this awesome phone.

Thanks in advance.","Contacts, Calls, Voicemail"

Battery Status % permanently incorrect,"This seems similar to that asked by others, but I have a PIXEL 4 that currently permanently just displays 1% Battery.

This is so frustrating and I lost all my patience .. tried talking with customer support team .. for around 60 times in this month .. but no proper resolution yet.. for third time gave the phone on Sep3.. issue resolved

I have a strange problem. My Pixel 5 seems to use an extraordinarily large amount of data via its 4G connection (even at times when I'm quite sure it was on WiFi).

I'm getting the data usage from my phone service provider and I know the data usage page says ""Operator data accounting may differ..."" but right now my phone thinks it has used ~600MB data but my phone operator says I have transferred +3GB that seems to be too big a difference to attribute different ""accounting"".

Pixel 3 camera focus hunting issue," I have a Pixel 3 phone that started exhibiting the dreaded camera focus hunting problem on the rear camera a few months ago but I didn't realize it was such a persistent problem until recently and of course, lo and behold, the warranty period was up at the end of April so I'm about a month out of warranty.

To make matters worse, I used the online support chat and got some 1st level support person walk me through all the usual steps, install/reinstall Camera app, clear app cache, reboot in Safe Mode, and finally doing a factory reset.  Having done some research before asking for support, I knew these steps were very unlikely to help and it is a hardware fault on the phone but to appease this support drone who was clearly just running through the help desk scripts, I dutifully went through all the steps again.  

When we got to the factory reset step, I was hesitant because a) I knew this was almost assuredly a hardware issue that a factory reset would do NOTHING to correct and b) even though I had my phone backed up, I figured it would still cause issues afterwards.  Well wouldn't you know it, factory reset did NOTHING.  The support drone directed me to getting out-of-warranty service on it from ufixit.  I assume this will end up costing me a good chunk of change and they'll probably just give me a refurb phone that I'm guessing may be prone to the same camera focus issue somewhere down the line.  

And of course, after restoring the phone, I discovered all my 2FA apps didn't restore settings (by design) so I'm trying to deal with getting those all set back up, which is a total mess... google authenticator, microsoft authenticator, mobile duo, last pass authenticator, etc.  In many cases this requires getting tech support from website that I had 2FA turned on for to get working again.

All-in-all, it was a very disappointing experience with both the online chat support and with google's lack of acknowledgement for this hardware issue.  It reminds me of the sour taste in my mouth when I ran into google's lack of support for the dreaded Nexus 6p battery drain issue, which is why I had to upgrade to the Pixel 3.  

If anyone has had any luck getting their ""out of warranty"" Pixel 3 camera focus issue resolved, please share.",Camera

Pixel 4 a charger protocol (quick charge? Power delivery?),"I am looking for an alernate charger for my Pixel 4a. Being imported to the Netherlands, my Pixel came with a US adapter and the store enclosed a world adapter to make it work. Nice ofcourse, but the result is a clumsy solution.

The original charger is rated at 5V/3A or 9V/2A.
That's the only information I can find.

Does the Pixel 4a support Quick Charge? Or Power Delivery? Both? How can I determine if a charger I'm looking at will be supported?

Browsing my local shop, I have found 2 contenders with the following specs supplied (All USB-C ofcourse):


Trust Summa: 3A, 18W Power Delivery 3.0

Always use a specific SIM Card for contacts from specific Google Account,"I am the proud owner of a Pixel 5 now. I am using the Double SIM function as well. So I was wondering if there was a way to set my phone app to always use one specific SIM Card if I want to call a contact from one specific Google Account.

For example: I set SIM Card ""1"" for my ""Business"" Google Account and ""2"" for my ""Private"" Account. If I call Lily, who is saved into my Business Account, the app automatically uses SIM Card ""1"". If I call Boris instead, who is saved to my Private Account, the app automatically uses SIM Card ""2"".

New Pixel 4a5g charges slowly or not at all,"Hello,

I believe this charging issue is different from the Android 11 update battery issue which is a known issue.

About a week ago (so 2+ months from the Android 11 release), my Pixel 4a5g began showing a number of charging issues:
1) It sometimes becomes very hot while charging
2) It charges very slowly (e.g. 6+ hours to reach ~50%)
3) It refuses to charge past 50% to 60%
4) Sometimes, it will not charge at all (e.g., leave it plugged in all night, and it is at the same battery percentage (e.g. 16%) as it was when I went to bed
5) It consumes battery rapidly (i.e., the phone has gone from lasting for two days without a charge to about 3-4 hours from 50%)

I have checked the battery settings and it does not look like any one app is causing this issue.

However, I have found that the phone regains its previous charging speed if I charge it while powered off, or charge it immediately after a power off/restart sequence.

Does anyone have any suggestions for diagnostics I could perform to try to figure out what is going on? Thank you!",Battery and Power
Unable to set Ringtone using My Sounds,"I've encountered what I can only think of must be a bug.

So when I first started using my new phone, I could set up custom ringtones with ease using the Sound settings and adding ringtones to 'My Sounds'.

I deleted the ringtone maker after some time, which has essentially locked my phone from using any other ringtone than a generic one (labelled 554). I can't set it as any built in track, nor a custom.

Reinstalling that ringtone maker allows me to use it to set my ringtones. It appears to be the only way I can set a ringtone now.

Is it possible that the Pixel 1 phone has something defective other than the battery?,"Hello all, so the original battery on my Google pixel, almost 3 years old, went to complete hell. It turns off in about a minute once unplugged, despite 100% battery life. So I went and replaced it with two Amazon bought batteries. The first one (definitely not OEM) had the same issue but my pixel would at least last about 10 minutes of regular use, unplugged, before shutting down. So I thought it might be a defective battery but the second one has the exact same issue. The second one at least looked like OEM with the exterior but since it came from Amazon, it's not 100% certain.
Is it possible that it's not a battery issue but maybe a different issue--perhaps motherboard? The Amazon bought battery charges unusually fast and discharges just as fast.
I know that a recent google play store version was found to be the culprit for the extensive battery loss. Could this be the main reason?

Refurbished Pixel 3 not switching Google Wifi points smoothly,"Refurbished Pixel 3, running Android 11 beta 3.
Just got it about a week ago, not from Google.
Noticed that when I move from room to room, it switches from Google Wifi puck to Google Wifi puck, but not smoothly at all.  A lot of times it'll hold onto a signal from a puck far away as I walk across the house, then switch to LTE only, and then about 10 seconds later pick up the newer, closer Google Wifi puck.
This is my first Pixel 3 but we have other Pixels in the house (3a, 2, OG) and they all hold onto the Wifi smoothly from room to room across the house.

I already assigned a static IP.  Didn't seem to help.

I tried it in safe mode.  Also didn't seem to help.

I don't have any weird apps on it -- the exact same ones I had with my previous OG Pixel, which didn't do this.

My guess is that I have a wonky wifi unit (i.e., hardware problem).  In the grand scheme of things this is a minor annoyance and the world won't end.

And as the other phones don't do it and my Google Wifi setup hasn't changed in 2 years, I don't think it's the Wifi.  I ""turned off and on again"" all the google wifi pucks just in case it was acting funny after an update or something.  No difference.

Could this be a known 11 beta 3 bug?  (did it in 2.5 also).  I didn't really use this in Android 10 -- as soon as I got the phone I upgraded to 11 beta 2.5.

I don't want to factory reset the phone.  Not worth it.  Especially since I just got it (have had it for about 2-3 weeks) and the apps are exactly the same as on my OG pixel.

Any thoughts/ideas welcomed.  Not expected anyone to solve this.  Just wondering.

It seems no one understands my issue. eSIM does not work! It’s not only that it doesn’t work, it’s that it has disappeared as an option completely, with the only option being to use a physical SIM.

Pixel 2 not charging even though the charging indicator indicated that it is.,"Before I begin, let me say that I have, in the past, experienced a dirty charging port. This is not one of those times.

I will frequently experience an issue, where my phone is plugged in, and the battery indicator makes it appear that the phone is charging, but it isn't.  In fact it will even say ""charging"" on the lock screen, but the percent battery will go down instead of up. 

Under normal circumstances, when I first plug in my phone, the lock screen will only say charging. Then after a few minutes there will also be an estimate of the time until full charge. On those occasion when it really isn't charging, the time estimate will never appear. If I go back to my phone's lock screen, a few minutes later and see that the estimate hasn't appeared, I can unplug it and plug it back in, and sometimes that corrects the problem, but I still have to wait and see if the estimate appears to be sure. The worst times are at bedtime, and I wake up to find my phone hasn't been charging all night.

Why would the phone indicate it is charging when it isn't.",Battery and Power

Sudden internet connection drops,"My partner and i have both the same issue:
Partner: Pixel 4a en i have a Pixel 5.

So far we really love the phones but this problem isn't something you can live with.

On both phones the exact same thing happens and that is that the internet connection suddenly drops.
it does it when connected to wi-fi and as well on mobile data, i checked home wifi but it is running perfectly and other devices (tablet, other phones and every other device in house) works without issues.
but as i said, when we're outside the same issue occurs when we're on a mobile data connection.
on a full day the connection drops about 20 times!
strange thing is that every app that needs a internet connection will stop working and say that you don't have a working internet connection. but the icons in the notification bar don't indicate that there is a problem.

activate and deactivate airplane mode or a device restart immediately solves the issue but it's not funny when you need to do this 20 times a day.. :-(","Connectivity, Network, Bluetooth"

The problem after 6 months is still here. The back and home buttons stops to work, using 2 buttons navigation bar, every time i switch from 2 apps using the slide gesture. In the bug tracker there is a video, which is more than explanatory. In addiction, since the 01/2021 patch, the back button randomly starts in loop to reopen apps instead of go back, closing app and go home.
I tried safe mode, a factory reset, switch from the differents navigations system and then re set the 2 buttons navigation, but nothing solve the problem.

IPv6 Issues (Neighbor Discovery),"I've been having intermittent with IPv6 connectivity on my Pixel 4 that seems to be isolated to the Pixel only. On some circumstances, the Pixel seems to refuse to response to IPv6 Neighbor Solicitations, from my router/other network devices, so devices are not able to send it packets.

I have taken packet traces from my WiFi AP and from other WiFi devices which show the broadcasted Soliciations, but the AP never sees a response from the Pixel. Sometimes this seems to clear itself up, while other times it will go on for hours or even days.

This manifests itself as terrible performance in apps, as things attempt to communicate over IPv6 until it eventually times out since it cannot receive any packets in response.

Well, long story short, I went to AT&T to get service for the phone. I signed up for their prepaid 8gb plan. The guy set me all up and everything.  But the problem is, the phone will not connect to the network. It says I have no bars,  and when I try to make calls it says to turn off airplane mode, yet airplane mode is not on. 

Things I have tried : 

Taking the sim out and cleaned it. No fix.

Using a different sim from a boost phone. This worked, of course it wouldn't let me use the service because my IMEI wasn't on the boost account.  But it read the sim and tried to configure network. So I know it can read sim cards. I did try to put the IMEI on the boost account and it said ""this phone isn't eligable for swap"" or something like that. Hmmm.

I have tired factory resetting. Wiped it clean. Still no luck . 

The att worker said the IMEI and the apn were correct, but I suspect he may have made an error. Because this doesn't make any sense.

I have done *#*#4636*#*# and checked mobile radio on. It didn't change anything. I have also looked at preferred network type and it says unknown.

If I go into sim status, it says :

Network unknown

Phone number on sim unknown

Mobile network state disconnected

Service state radio off (even though I've checked mobile radio on)

Signal strength 0

Mobile voice network type unknown

Mobile data network type unknown

Roaming not roaming

EID unknown.


There is also no option in the phone for Wi-Fi calling. 

If I do *#*#4636*#*# I get this info:

Set preferred network type : it gives me dozens of options, but when I restart the phone to apply the change it just goes to unknown.

If I run a Ping test all 3 categories pass.

Smsc refresh and update both bring up refresh error.

There is a button that says toggle DNS check and next to it it says 0.0.0.0

Call info refresh rate just goes back to disabled no matter what I set it to.

battery use airplane mode vs. shutdown/power-up,"This is more a question than a problem: is there any data on the battery use trade of going to quiescent airplane mode vs. the mAhr used to shutdown and then power back up (boot)?

I've always figured for 5 hrs or more of flight time (US transcon or mainland-Hawaii) I'd power down but for less I'd just go airplane mode. I have no idea if that's a good trade. E.g., let's say it takes 1 mAhr per hour of airplane mode sleep and 5 mAhr to shutdown+reboot, that'd be the five hour trade.",Battery and Power

What algorithm filters the exhaustive Call History list down to the not-so-exhaustive Recents List?,"New Google Pixel 4, purchased from Google, using T-Mobile network.
Upgraded from a Samsung Galaxy S7.
Upgrade went smoothly (all call history transferred OK).


Confusion regarding the Recents list in the stock Google Phone app.

1. During early use, when tips & hints were popping up occasionally, I noticed a blurb that commented on what was expected to be seen in the Recents list. I dismissed it too hastily to grasp what it said.

2. Shortly after, I made calls to 2 back-to-back service providers found in Yelp. Looking at the Recents list a short while later, Recents showed my call to only 1 of those 2 companies. One call wasn't in my list of recent calls. Odd.

3. In the Phone app menu at top right, I found Call History, which shows an exhaustive list of every made/received/missed call (including that 2nd company I'd called earlier).


Questions:

a) What algorithm does the phone use to filter/shorten/modify the Recents list relative to the comprehensive Call History list?

b) If a) doesn't provide an obvious answer, *why* is the call history trimmed when displayed in Recents?

c) Can I set my phone to show Call History in place of Recents, as my preference is that the default list should be comprehensive, not filtered?

Snapchat Mic Issue,"Hi

After speaking to Google Live Chat it seems as though Google are not ""aware"" of the Snapchat Mic ""Chipmunk Issue"" that occurs while recording a Snapchat. 
My other apps that have built in cameras E.G - Facebook, Instagram & more don't have this issue also the Camera doesn't have this ""Chipmunk Mic"" issue.
So it all relies on Snapchat's update they did a few days ago. It has been messed up since then.
Google are also not fixing this issue as it isn't they're ""Problem"" it's Snapchat's.

Steps I've taken to fix the problem
- Uninstall and re install the app over 20+ times (No Result)
- Reported this to Snapchat (Won't ever get a reply)
- Reported it as a bug to Snapchat (Won't still ever get a reply)
- Reported to Google which they can't do anything as it isn't they're problem and they're ""NOT"" aware of it even though the community is flooded with this issue.

Whoever also says Uninstall and reinstall ur wasting ur time.
The more community posts the more Google will notice what they're customers are facing as they're currently blind and can't read what people are having the most issue off.

Pixel 3a auto-selecting options in dialog boxes,"TL;DR: Phone displays permission request dialog and auto selects an option. I need to manually select these options instead of having them auto selected.

Hello all!

In using my pixel 3a, I have noticed that it will automatically select options in dialog boxes for me. For example, when an app will ask for access or permissions, the phone will select an option without me touching the screen. This happens with almost every pop-up box of that nature. (""use this app just once or always"" is not affected by this). Also, if the app requests multiple permissions, only the first will be auto-selected.

I've been fine to live with the issue until now, but last night I needed to connect my phone to my laptop with bluetooth, but the phone was autoselecting the ""cancel"" option, and I couldn't tap ""connect"" fast enough. (the permission screen will display for a fraction of a second before an option is selected, so I know it appears but I cannot do anything about it). I assumed it was a setting I enabled when I set up the phone, so I reset all my app settings/permissions, but this has done nothing to help the problem.

I'm generally a pretty tech-savvy person, but this has me clueless. Any ideas, tips, anything would be very helpful. Thanks in advance!

Pixel 3 Touch Screen/Gesture navigation issues,"Gesture Navigation
Not sure what's happening with my Pixel 3 but the swipe home gesture navigation stopped working. I can still swipe back and forth to get to other apps and swiping from the edge to go back still works. The other navigation options work fine tho. If I do the swipe left option to go to another app in a recent app and then quickly swipe up I can go home.With the gesture navigation enabled in apps like WhatsApp I can't tap the area to start texting.

Touch Screen 
In fullscreen apps especially games the lower section where the navigation gestures are doesn't work during gaming but work otherwise.
There is also a section from the top of the volume button to about 2-3cm down and horizontally that doesn't touch most times either. Like for example when I go to the Play store search for app and then tap on the app on the big horizontal green install button I cannot tap it I have to scroll to get that button out of the area and then press install.

I have tried factory resetting however that almost locked me out of the phone because the lower section when you're just starting up that says ""start"" I couldn't touch it. I had to use the magnification option to get it a little bigger and then repeatedly tap it.",Homescreen and Launcher

Suddenly though it is no longer working. Google Pay continues to work fine however.

When I now try to scan an NFC tag I just get no response from my phone and I've tried several apps to try reading the data.

Steps I've tried so far:

- Restarting phone. I have also gone into safe mode which doesn't resolve the issue.
- Uninstalling all third party NFC apps
- Turning off Android Beam
- Checking NFC is enabled in settings
- Removing the case (though it was scanning with the case on before anyway)

Car Bluetooth - Cannot Skip or Pause Audio on Pixel 5.,"Hello,
Ever since obtaining my Google Pixel 5 in November, I have had issues with connecting it to car Bluetooth. I have been able to connect and heat audio through a car's speakers, however I have not been able to see or control the tracks on the car's multimedia screen. 

When I connect to my car (2015 Subaru Crosstrek) I have gotten one of three screens (pic attached). 

""No audio device connected. Connect a Bluetooth device from the settings menu."" Again, this is happening while music is playing though my phone on the car speakers. 
""No items to be displayed, since this Bluetooth audio is not capable of title display."" This occurred AFTER I tried forgetting the phone from my car and the car from my phone and reconnecting. 
  ""Bluetooth audio is not possible with this device."" This happens when I try to pause the music using touchscreen.
 
I have ran into similar problems on at least one other car (2015 Honda Civic). This is not an issuer with my old phone (Samsun Galaxy S7) or my Fiancé's phone (iPhone 11) on the Subaru. Which leads me to believe this is an issue with the phone itself.  Furthermore, I do not have any issue with the audio itself. There is no skipping or cutting out with the audio. This issue is exclusively with the controls. 

I have exhausted most of troubleshooting capabilities. Mainly, unpairing the devices, restarting the phone, etc. And I have not found any similar issues online. ","Connectivity, Network, Bluetooth"

Pixel 2 XL Bluetooth Issues,"In the last week or so, my Pixel 2 XL started to have issues connecting to my OontZ Angle 3 portable blue tooth speaker. I would turn the speaker on and music would play for about 3 seconds before the music would stop. I tried to follow the exact instructions to reconnect the device to my phone, but still it would not work. I could only get it to work if I turned my phone off and on again.

After several days of doing this, I went to the Bluetooth Device Details for my speaker. I turned off Phone Calls and suddenly my speaker started playing music again. I didn't think anything of it again as the speaker was pretty cheap, so I figured there was some weird thing off in the speaker.

Turns out, I was wrong. For the first time in about a month I tried to listen to music using my Pixel Buds as well and the same thing was happening: music would play for a few seconds and then stop. I went in to the Device Details for the Buds and turned off Phone Calls and it started working again. However, doing this also made it so I can't control my music with gestures on the Buds.

I can understand issues with a cheap speaker, but for a pair of expensive ear buds that were designed specifically to work with the Pixel 2 is a bit much.

Pixel 4xl gesture swiping (not liking it),"So for my new pixel 4xl. I didn't know gesture swiping would be different than my current 3xl. 

I'm getting used to it. But I noticed one glaring problem. Holding down the home button before would bring up what's on my screen and assistant. Now there seems to be no way to do that. I really liked that feature.

To be honest all the continual changes to navigation is leaving me a tech junky kinda tired. I loved the 3 buttons. But I got pretty used to whatever the gesture mode was on 3xl. This new 4xl version is just way to complicated and non-intuitive. In a sense I see how it can be but it's also not. Maybe I'll learn the curve. My mom gets pixel phones, she would lose her mind on the 4. Thank you for at least having the option to switch to the old buttons. 

I think you need to work on gesture more or at least a long press should activate the home button as well work a way to get the what's on my screen or the Google lens more easily into the picture.

Neither phone will connect to the mobile network unless Wi-Fi is turned on and the phone is connected to Wi-Fi, and this is only because T-Mobile has Wi-Fi calling. When Wi-Fi is turned off or when the phone is not connected to Wi-Fi – as in when I am not at home, when having the phone work is the most important – the phone will not connect to the network.

Carrier Aggregation Mode Issues,"I have a US Pixel 2 and a US Pixel 3 in Thailand.  The Pixel 2 works fine except for seemingly slow mobile data.  I moved the sim from the 2 to the 3.  Then both wifi and mobile data would constantly reset.  Replaced sim, 5 factory resets, troubleshot at the carrier and with Google support which authorized a replacement.  After thinking about the issue, I turned off LTE on the 3 and everything starting working.  Before this, the 2 never showed LTE but the 3 would on occasion.
I know the 3 has added some bands that the 2 didn't have which probably allowed the 3 to attempt LTE.  I have seen a setting on the 3 something like Enable Carrier Aggregation Mode but I can no longer find it.  I know that US carrier aggregation is not compatible with Thai bands.  I have a feeling that the CA setting only appears if LTE is connected.  Since turning LTE on is so unstable that I can not get it to show LTE for more than a few seconds.
Therefore, how can I turn off the Carrier Aggregation mode if I cannot keep LTE on long enough?
I could be wrong, but I believe that would solve the issue and still give me better performance than my current 3G setting.","Connectivity, Network, Bluetooth"

"""Bluetooth keeps stopping"" message","I recently purchased a Pixel 3 XL and after a few months of good usage I began having a ""Bluetooth keeps stopping"" message. Thinking it was just something introduced by some app I had downloaded, or file that I had put on my phone I factory reset my phone. Then I factory flashed my phone to the most recent factory image. Then I flashed my phone to the very first factory image that was available for the the Pixel 3 XL, the September 2018 image. The error continues to come back. I can't believe this is a hardware problem, it can be temporarily solved by restarting the phone, and it is completely random, sometimes happening constantly every 5 seconds, and sometimes not happening for days at a time. I don't believe it's a loose connection in the phone, it wouldn't be fixed by restarts and it wouldn't be so frustratingly random. I've been reading forum post after forum post of people with this problem. I've only searched specifically for people with Pixel 3's but it seems to be happening with other Pixels and maybe even with with phones from other manufacturers as well.

This issue is causing people's otherwise perfectly functional phones to be useless. When the bluetooth keeps stopping it also takes the wifi and mobile network down with it. I've missed important text messages and phone calls.

Google won't warranty my phone because it's past the warranty period, even though I called them previously seeking help about this error before my warranty had expired.

Someone please look into this and figure it out. It seems to me that it the error was introduced after an Android update, personally I think the Android 10 update caused it, as that seems to coincide with when it started happening to me and when many other people are saying it started happening. Some reports of the error do contradict this though, saying it happened before that. All of these links are about the error from a cursory 5 minute google search. I imagine searching for much longer you could find so many more.

3 contacts with same phone # (main # for all). 2 display the 3rd's name. 3rd displays its own.,"Three contacts share the same main number, call them A, B, C.

Pixel 3XL 100% to 50% in one hour and off after 90 minutes - can't power on even after battery repl.,"The first week of March, I noticed my phone was discharging a bit more rapidly than normal. Not surprising to me since it's a 3 year old phone with the original battery, so I started thinking about replacing the battery. Fast forward to 3/9, and off of a fresh charge, I mounted my phone to my bicycle and fired up the Adidas app to track my bike ride (a fairly battery intensive activity). Within an hour, the phone was 50%. After 90 minutes, I noticed the phone was completely dead. I didn't pay attention to the phone while riding. When I returned home, I plugged in the phone to charge it... no signs of life. I then plugged in the phone overnight using the original charger and cable that came with the phone. Also, no luck.

On 3/10, I took the phone UBreakifix (the nearest Google authorized repair center) figuring the replacement battery would fix the problem. Unfortunately, their replacement battery did NOT fix the issue - they were never able to get the phone to turn on again. The tech found some internal knowledge base articles which indicate a problem regarding the March Feature Update for certain Pixel phones - including the 3XL, 4, and 4XL. 

I have since contacted Google support directly and as a result of that discussion mailed the phone in for a repair. I am hoping they can fix what their authorized service provider couldn't, but the phone has never been damaged, and was in excellent condition prior to its final shutdown on 3/9.

Although I don't think there's much the community here can suggest in my specific case, I am wondering if others are affected by the same issue on their phones, since, according to Ubreakifix, the issue is pretty new, and I wasn't able to find anything elsewhere in these forums.",Battery and Power

Sip calling accounts issues,"Unable to select any of my SIP accounts to dial out.  Google phone displays the account selection dialog to choose an account however the two SIP accounts I have added both report ""No signal"" one account is with a big name SIP carrier provider and the other is my own personally built dedicated cloud server with full gigabit band with and absolutely not restrictions or blocks of any kind. There is absolutely no reason for any kind of connection issues to be reported. Incoming calls work just fine! I have configured these servers onto my freshly and pristine installation of android OS as well as many previous attempts on other phones and have had this issue as well as many other issues trying to use my SIP services on my phone. This problem has been an issue for every company that I know of that uses SIP as well as my own personal experience. When is google going to show this problem some attention? How can I disable google phone from pre-checking signal status or quality prior to allowing the use of sip carriers for phone calls?

If you search for ""sip calling"" in any of google's help fourums you will not find an single post, not 1 with a solution.

They don't ignore issues like this for this long.

Pixel 3 battery issue -- different from the other topics I've seen,"I have a Pixel 3.  About a month after the warranty expired and around the time of the Android 10 update it started draining quickly under use -- call it 1% per minute.  Then at some point around 50%, the drain increased to 5% per *second* until the battery drained.  Now it's got a new habit. It's still draining at 1% per minute but it just randomly dies at some point between 90 and 80%.  Sometimes it restarts briefly, sometimes not, but even if it does it quickly dies again and then refuses to restart, claiming the battery is drained (by showing the icon).  When reconnected to outside power, the device operates normally and recognizes that it has whatever power it really had when it died.

Pixel 4 wireless charging percentage issues,I've noticed an issue with my Pixel 4 that other people have described but there doesn't seem to be a fix. If I charge my phone wirelessly above about 80% the battery percentage will jump to a higher number. For example it will jump from like 82% to 89% after taking it off the charger. Restarting the phone will reset it to the correct number of 82%. Also after a full charge the phone will hang at 100% but restarting it will also reset it to the correct 93% or 94% after using it for a little while. It's very annoying to have to constantly restart the phone to get an accurate battery reading.

But it is so bare-bones with such limited options for any sort of customization, it could definitely be improved. I suggest you consider the Lawnchair Launcher, which is open source but which is on the verge of going defunct because of a lack of support. You could mine it for gold in the form of features.

Some things that would be awesome:

 - The ability to arrange the home pages, and to set our own default page rather than being locked in to the farthest left page as the default. For example, I prefer the center page to be my default, making for shorter travel back and forth to the extremes, and because so many wallpapers are center-weighted, they look weird when you default to the farthest left page and cause the wallpaper to scroll to the right.

- Make the placement of the At-a-Glance widget optional. Currently, it takes up real estate at the top of the default page, with no way to move it or remove it.

- The ability to set an action for sliding your finger up or down on an icon, rather than just opening when tapping on it. This is a great option for (for example) quick access to the most frequently used app in a folder.

- The ability to hide apps in the app drawer. This is nice in the case of apps that bring premium features to other apps, but don't really do anything unto themselves. We may need to have them resident on the phone, but it's nice to not have them cluttering things up if we don't actually use them.",Homescreen and Launcher

send/recieve mms without data bug,"I believe there is a bug in Android 11 with the Pixel 4a (and possibly other Pixel phones). It's to do with the feature found in your mobile network settings called ""Send/receive MMS when mobile data is off"".
See photo:


What happens is this:
When the feature is enabled, and you send or receive MMS, the phone enables your mobile data for EVERYTHING, but does not tell you it will do this, nor does it enable the switch for mobile data on the same settings screen seen in the photo above.  Your apps that use data will immediately begin to use data and notify you as if you had manually turned your mobile data on.  It remains in this state for many hours, and possibly until you turn it off.

This is how you test it (assuming your phone plan has data):
1. disable mobile data
2. disable wifi
3. verify and ensure that data is in fact off by testing internet access
4. verify the ""send & receive MMS messages when data is off""  function is turned on
4.5 verify that RCS chat features are turned off in google messenges and has been off for at least a few minutes.  restart messenges app possibly as well ( i don't use that feature at all and this step might be redundant)
5.  send an MMS message to a contact using google messages
6.  verify that data has been turned back on by trying an app or browser (but settings menu shows data off)

Before you jump to conclusions and say ""but data needs to be on to send MMS"" this is not true, you can plainly see the function is there, and other phones from other brands have had this function for years despite not having the toggle switch in the settings menu. (Realme X2 was the most recent phone I've seen that can send/receive MMS without data on).

Lastly, please read the steps above carefully and perform them EXACTLY how I have outlined to test this ""bug"". Most people I've asked either miss a step or don't do them at all. In fact, there's a few threads started here about this issue but none have tested it in this way and all threads are locked for some reason since the issue never gets resolved.

And yes I've reported this scenario through the feedback function 3 times, once a month since I've had the phone after each monthly security patch since October, on Android 11.","Connectivity, Network, Bluetooth"

My pixel 5 has trouble playing audio if I switch apps while connected to Bluetooth,"So for some reason this only happens when I am connected to the Bluetooth in my car. I do not have the same issue when I'm using a Bluetooth speaker or headphones. The problem is that I will be playing music on Spotify and then I might open YouTube or a Snap or play an audio message from a friend, only when I switch apps, my phone will be playing the sound but the sound doesn't play through my speakers. Sometimes it works no problem, I will press play on something and it will just play with no issues. Other times it will not play any sound except for the last few seconds of a message or snap (and usually only when I am closing it out of frustration). 

 Sometimes I'll try disconnecting and reconnecting to the Bluetooth in my car and sometimes it works but it usually doesn't. It seems to be particularly problematic with Facebook Messenger audio messages. I do have more luck when I disconnect and reconnect and then play YouTube videos (and no I'm not watching music videos while I drive lol, there are just some songs I can only find on YouTube).

I don't think it's the Bluetooth in my car because I never had this issue with my previous phone (Galaxy Note 9). I could switch apps no problem and the sound from whatever app was active would play over my speakers just fine.","Connectivity, Network, Bluetooth"

I'm having problem with IPV6 connectivity.,"Some of my apps stopped working.  I was enable to load files from my Google Drive, images wouldn't load in Pinterest app and other shopping apps like Wayfair or Touch of Modern. Also, my Google agenda was taking forever to sync.

I've tried everything and reboot my phone from factory twice.  This problem drove me crazy for weeks.  Then I've tried to disable IPV6 connectivity on my network and everything is working fine again.

I'm suspecting that Pixel have issues with IPV6 connections.  If you feel that some apps aren't loading fine and that every other non-Android device works fine, try to disable IPV6 connectivity on your router and it might resolve your problems.","Connectivity, Network, Bluetooth"

"The Pixel 3 tethering hotspot changes frequencies and bands fast, connected devices lose connection.","I set up the wifi hotspot on the Pixel 3 to connect my laptop and other devices to the internet through my phone. I had a different Android before the Pixel 3 and did the same thing. When I sit on the train and move through areas with lots of other wifi networks/hotspots, which I will see, because the Pixel 3 will offer to connect to them, the Pixel 3 will change frequencies five six times a minute even between channels from the 5Ghz and 2.4Ghz band. 

My laptop will still show the connection, but the ping to the phone's IP (gateway) will fail. My other device behaves different. It will detect that the connection has failed and cease to show the wifi connected logo in the upper right corner, but none the less lose connection to the internet and have to be manually reconnected. 

This did not happen previously on the same train that I use to commute every day, when using my previous phone.

There might be other reasons for the loss of connection besides the Pixel quickly changing frequencies. This is only my suspicion, since the connection loss happens when I sit on the train and the train moves through the inner city. And because I see all the channel switches in my log files of my laptop.

I tried changing the preferred frequency. I usually have it set to 5 Ghz preferred, but the Pixel phone will most often still choose 2.4 Ghz. 

I also disabled bluetooth and wifi on the phone as well as the Google assisted location service (uses wifi) and wifi and bluetooth location search for apps. All of that does not help. 

I would love to force the Pixel to stop changing frequencies or manually set the frequency for the hotspot, but have not found a way to do that. Do you know how to enable that or do you have any other idea? My current workaround is to toggle flight mode on the laptop to reconnect about once a minute.","Connectivity, Network, Bluetooth"

Several issues since Android 11 update,"I have, like many many other people it seems, been having multiple issues with my Pixel 4xl since ever since android 11 launched and am completely regretting the idea that I should get the update. I'm looking for advice on how to fix these issues. List as follows

First update to android 11:
spotify wouldnt close
sirius xm wouldnt open or close
chrome wouldnt close or would crash randomly
wouldnt receive texts randomly from people. not all the time just a random text here or there. i use the built in messages app for texting
phone wouldnt connect to wifi sometimes. it would say its connected but i actually had to signal
i couldnt make wifi change to a different network
phone wouldnt connect to data when i turned off wifi
bluetooth on my hands free headset wouldnt work sometimes but other times it did. bluetooth in my car worked fine though all the time? (like pausing or skipping songs)
All the issues above could be temporarily fixed by rebooting the phone. usually needed to do so about 3-4 times per day. So I was running out of patience waiting for updates to fix this and decided to factory reset.
After factory reset some issues are solved for now. These still remain:
first and foremost I GET HALF TEXTS NOW FOR NO REASON!?!?!?! I will literally get the end of a text but not the first part of it so it makes it a BIT confusing????
Spotify still doesnt work properly, wont close sometimes, displays wrong song thats playing
bluetooth headset still fails to pause and skip songs correctly
chrome now refuses to reload a webpage when it has downloaded it for offline use (this is a new feature since factory reset)
This is all the new issues since the factory reset (I did this about 2 days from time of writing) and I am completely fed up with this update. Like really? I get that the 3rd party app issues are probably not Google's domain to fix but MESSAGES??? The main function of a cellphone is to contact people through voice or text and the one that is used most is now VERY unreliable!!!!

I'm sick of this update and I've only had it for about 2 weeks now. I'm at a loss for what to do next because as far as I can tell I've done everything short of getting a new phone. Which is what... 1 year old? Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!","Contacts, Calls, Voicemail"

Bluetooth connection with Samsung Gear S2 won't allow switching phone's audio output to speakerphone,"When in a call on my phone and connected to my Samsung Gear S2, it shows that the audio output is coming from my watch, but it's actually coming from the phone's earpiece.

That switched the call's audio output to my speaker, and then I was able to change it to speakerphone. Also, today I was clicking & un-clicking the mute button while on a call. On the phone, it would show that it was changing back and forth from the phone earpiece to speakerphone, but it never actually switched from the phone's earpiece.

Brand new Pixel 3a cannot pair with bluetooth devices,"Hello there! I 

just opened up my brand new Pixel 3a (Android version 10), and everything works just fine except pairing via bluetooth. I am working with these two devices:
- JABRA Talk 15 Headset
- Libratone Track+ in-ear headphones

When accessing the bluetooth settings and chosing ""pair new device"" the Pixel can't find either of the two, although they just lie next to it. With my old Nexus 5X both devices will pair and connect after a second. (By the way, the Nexus 5X does show up in the Pixel's pairing mode, so we are one step farther, but the two phones cannot be connected.)

I went through every step in this article: https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/2819579?hl=en
But I cannot go past the step ""Tap the name of the Bluetooth device you want to pair with your phone"" - as the devices just won't show up.

I also checked the ""Bluetooth Basics"" from this article: https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/7334382?hl=en plus the tips from the section ""Can't pair with other accessories"".

That is quite a pity, as this limits the functions of a, after all, expensive piece of tech. What am I missing?","Connectivity, Network, Bluetooth"

Not routing audio to bluetooth headset after latest Android 9 security update,"Since the February Android 9 security update, my Pixel 2 XL no longer routes call audio properly to the connected Bluetooth headset (a Radsone EarStudio ES100).  The EarStudio app clearly shows the call in progress, and the Phone app shows the call as being routed via Bluetooth to the EarStudio, but no call audio is heard on the headset and no audio is sent from the headset's microphone.  The issue also affects other apps that can use a Bluetooth headset for calls, such as Skype or Slack.  Calling works fine if I do not attempt to use a Bluetooth headset but instead use the built-in speaker and microphone in the phone.

A2DP audio (e.g. streaming Spotify tracks to the EarStudio) works fine from the Pixel 2XL, I can hear music on the headset.
The Bluetooth section of the Settings app shows 'Phone calls' as being enabled for the EarStudio.
The EarStudio works fine for calls using the HFP Bluetooth profile on other devices, I have paired it with an iPhone and also a laptop and it works correctly with those devices.
The EarStudio worked fine for calls on the January Android 9 security update, and all previous versions of Android I have had on the Pixel 2 XL.  The issue only started after updating to the February security update - I noticed it the first call I attempted to make after updating.
I have done a full factory reset of the phone and re-paired the EarStudio with the Pixel 2 XL, but the issue remains.

Any ideas?  It looks like a straightforward bug in the February security update that got missed in testing - though I'm baffled as to how it crept into the build, none of the fixes look audio or Bluetooth-related.  It's going to be very annoying if I have to wait a month or longer for a fix, and I'm not prepared to compromise on security by downgrading, especially given the severity and ease of exploitation of some of the issues fixed in the February security update.","Connectivity, Network, Bluetooth"
How come my Pixel 2xl wont work with CDMA Networks?,"Hey all,

I purchased a Pixel 2XL (Verizon model through Amazon)  last month and used it with Hello mobile, a Sprint based network, and all was working fine. However, the battery was dying too quickly so I did a warranty exchange on it. I've been sent about 3 replacement devices  because none of them will connect with the network I wanted to use. I've checked all the IMEI numbers and all of them showed up as incompatible on Hello Mobile's website, and also other CDMA network websites as well such as Verizon, Sprint itself, Boost mobile, etc.. They are only show up as compatible on GSM networks upon further testing,  and I'm using T-mobile right now. I've been going back and forth with customer service and everyone has told me that the phone should be compatible on both CDMA and GSM networks.

I contacted Verzion about the phone to see if maybe it was still locked to their network and gave them my IMEI to check but they don't even see the device in their database. I also did one of those 3rd party IMEI checks and it shows up as clean. So now I'm stuck and not sure what to do. Does anyone have advice about this?

However, once it has died (it's very sad to see its life dwindle away as I'm desperately trying to resuscitate it with the charger), it seems to charge pretty quickly back up.

Pixel 2 XL Battery Doesn't Last Very Long and Dies Fairly Fast,"I have had this Pixel 2 XL for about 8 months. Even from the beginning, I'd only managed 4-5 hours SOT.

I use the original charger as often as possible and only charge it when I need to. I've tried every solution Google says and other people's solutions. I've talked to Google Support a while ago and she recommended format my device. I did, but that didn't help. I got the same amount.

I'm not sure what's causing all of this. Should I talk to Google about a replacement phone, replacement battery, or go through uBreakiFix? I can spend any amount of money, reasonably.

"Bluetooth/Volume Issues on Pixel 3aXL, Android 11","Prior to the update, when my phone was connected via Bluetooth (speakers, Pixel Buds, etc), I could hit the volume rocker and I had the option to swap audio output, so I could choose whether audio could play via phone speakers, or through the speaker. That option is gone from the little menu, so I have to go into Bluetooth settings, and either disconnect or to select my output and unselect ""media audio"". 

Has this feature (selecting audio output from the volume menu) gone away for everyone, or is this a bug? It was super useful before (to listening to voice notes or anything that you wouldn't want played onto the speakers for example), so I don't see why they would remove it. 

Also, a different issue but in the same vein, the volume is also really messed up when playing on any Bluetooth device. Volume goes up 3 notches and is suddenly super loud on the speakers, but won't go up anymore, even though the slider is only at what, 20%? Going up in volume anymore does nothing to increase sound, it sounds as if it's at maximum. So currently it's as if I only have 3 volume levels; very quiet, somewhat quiet, and ear bleedingly loud.

Not sure if my first issue is a bug, but if not, seems a very silly thing for Google to have done. But certain the second issue is a bug, and wondering if there's any fixes or solutions.

Issues connecting to T-Mobile over Cell Network,"I'm having connection issues with T-Mobile and a brand new Pixel 4a 5G.  I recently received the phone and this past weekend set it up (Saturday April 3rd).  The phone worked fine until sometime around Tuesday April 6th, where it only connected to Wifi calling and had intermittent connection to the T-Mobile network (texts had trouble getting in and out and there was no way of making calls using the cellular network.

I took the phone to a T-Mobile store, where they tried different things, all ending with the same issues:  the phone connects for a minute or two (here I can get some texts coming in), but it disconnects from the network.  The SIM Card was changed in the store for a brand new one (no charge).  They also reset the network settings to no avail.  The last thing they told me to try was a factory reset, which once I got home.

I tested the new SIM Card in the old phone, and it works fine.  I did a factory reset of the phone, checked for updates (got the April 5, 2021 update), put the SIM card back into the Pixel 4a 5g, but the problem persists.  I called T-Mobile again and they told me to contact the manufacturer (Google) for the warranty and/or to try other alternatives with the phone.

The phone is brand new (less than one month old) and I have no idea what might be the problem.  Among the things that have been tried:
Reset network settings
Factory reset
manually connect to cell network (disabled automatic connect to network and I have seen at least 7 different t-mobile networks in different places, but cannot connect to any of them)
change preferred network type (tried all, restarted phone, no connection)
disabled wifi calling

My Pixel 3XL Suddenly Cannot Recognize the Usual SIM Card,"Hello..

Since that time, although I have already inserted my XL SIM Card to the tray as usual, my phone display always says ""No SIM Card, Emergency Calls Only"". On the SIM Status, it is said Not Available. I tried to insert the other SIM Card from the other Indonesian networking provider called Telkomsel, but the result is still the same, the SIM Status is Not Available. I reported to my carrier (XL Center). They replaced the old SIM card to the new one. I tried again and the result is still same.

I inserted both of the SIM Card (XL and Telkomsel) to another phones and they work well. Why it cannot operate on my Google Pixel 3XL?

Please help me with the solution.

My work is still living in the past and due to the nature of our work it makes sense. Security is very high on our networks.

I know Google dosn't add the OTG feature to their lineup anymore in favour of the wireless cast feature. BUT COMMON!!! There has to be a way that I can use the USB-C port with some sort of hub to get HDMI. I am sure Google can implement this with a software update.

AUDIO LOW WHEN SWITCHING ON EQ SETTINGS,"Hi,

Has anyone come across a problem when using the audio player via Bluetooth headphones?

I'm currently using the Play Music App and thought I'd adjust the bass, mid range and treble to my liking.

However, as soon as I switch on the EQ, the sound dramatically changes.  The volume decreases and sounds terrible.

So I go to the 'user' setting and increase the graphics higher to increase sound levels.  It does the total opposite and makes the volume even quieter as if there's a major limiter on the EQ's

Now in my experience when adjusting EQ's, like the Bass, Mid & Trebles, they get louder, just like on DJ Decks. 

Why does the EQ on the phone decrease sound quality and make it sound appalling?

I even downloaded another App and used the EQ settings on that App (had the option to use the app EQ or the phones EQ) and still had the same issue when using both.

And I've turned off Absolute Volume which has done sweet F.A. so that's re-enabled. 

Any reason why I cannot enjoy music how I want it.  And I'd also like to try and increase the volume too but that sounds limited too. 

I can only assume devices now have limiters for health and safety reasons (not like the old days where an MP3 player was actually deafening)

Any idea's how I this can be improved.

I'm also getting the same issue when using Bluetooth in the car with the EQ on and on Soundbars.  Basically anything that connects Bluetooth.

I can't check it out with a jack cable as I don't have the adapter any more as it broke after 5 days of using it.

Ever since I've upgraded my router from an old TP-Link (model TL-WR840N) to a Google WiFi mesh router my Pixel 5 and 2 XL have a spotty connection. With the old router no issues whatsoever. 

They keep dropping offline and reconnecting after few seconds. Sometimes they are unable to join that network at all (I get the message ""Unable to connect to this network"" or ""No Internet"")

Every other devices on the network work fine, the issue is just with the Pixels.

Troubleshooting steps taken:

- Rebooted the network;
- Rebooted the devices;
- Toggled WiFi on/off;
- Reset network settings on the 2 XL;
- Use the device MAC address (instead of the random one);
- Set rating provided to ""None""

"Pixel 3a devices can't connect to one specific wifi, but all other devices can","After the Android 11 update, my Pixel 3a has been experiencing consistent wifi connectivity issues.

What the issue looks like:
The wifi appears to be ""saved"", but returns ""Failed to connect to network"" or disconnects within thirty seconds after I try to connect.
(The wifi is AT&T.)

Constraints:
Another Pixel 3a device also has the same problems with connecting to this wifi after the update. (Both my device and this device have been used for less than a year, never sustained any falls, drops, or other hardware damage, and are barely used save for work functions such as scanning documents.)
Other devices can connect to this wifi perfectly fine.
My Pixel can connect to other wifi perfectly fine.

What I have tried, without success:
Restarting my device
Resetting network settings
Manually forgetting the network, waiting, and reconnecting
Resetting app settings
Booting in Safe Mode (there was still a wifi problem in Safe Mode, this did not help)
Turning on/off Bluetooth
Turning on/off Location
Turning on/off Airplane Mode
Turning on/off randomized mac address
Turning on/off Adaptive Connectivity

Some observations:
Initially, resetting app settings seemed to fix the problem for about half an hour, but this stopped working after a few days
Although I enabled Location and ""Turn on wifi automatically"", the main ""Wifi preferences"" dialog still displays it as ""Wifi doesn't turn back on automatically""

I am unwilling to do a complete reset of my device, as other users with similar problems have reported this to be unhelpful. In addition, it does not seem to be a problem with my wifi router because every device that is not a Pixel 3a can connect to the wifi without any issues.

Thanks for your time and help.","Connectivity, Network, Bluetooth"

Pixel 3a - no media audio over Bluetooth to car head unit?,"New Pixel 3a, trying to connect via Bluetooth to my car head unit (2016 Subaru Crosstrek).

Anyone have any new ideas?

Pixel 2 XL starting the camera upon single press of power button,"Hi

I've recently received a refurbished Pixel 2 XL from google to replace a previous faulty device.

The new device sporadically starts the camera application when single clicking the power button. It doesn't do this every time and I can go 30 min or an hour using the phone, turning the power on and off without incident.

However, when it does exhibit the problem, it'll usually occur multiple times when successively single pressing the power button. This results in the phone continuing to return to the camera application instead of powering the screen off.

I've attempted the following to rectify the issue

Stopping camera app, and clearing cache and data
Removing phone case
Booting into safe mode
Factory resetting the phone

None of the above has rectified the issue.

I've called Google support, who have advised that I take the same set of trouble shooting actions, and have subsequently advised I report the issue through the settings app as well as post here.

Any help would be appreciated.

Verizon Unlocked Google Pixel 4 won't read my GSM Sim card when connected to the Internet,"Hello,

I just bought my new Pixel 4 phone from eBay. It was written that the phone is unlocked. I used a forwarder and imported the phone to Georgia (the country). I have done so, many times without any problem and everything worked perfectly before.

Now, I am having the following problem - when I first insert my GSM sim card, it works fine, I can make phone calls, send/receive messages and etc. But, as soon as I connect to the Internet, the phone says that the Sim card isn't supported and asks me to contact Verizon.

The phone is definitely unlocked, because it reads my sim without the Internet. Furthermore, Verizon has a policy, when after 60 days, they automatically unlock phones and 60 days has already passed.

So, I am quite sure that it is a Google problem (when I received the device, it had Android 10, I updated it to Android 11 and I still have the same problem). After a factory reset, the phone again reads the sim and again does not recognize it after I turn on the Internet.

Why Google Pixel 3a XL takes fuzzy selfies,"Hello!
I just got the new Google Pixel 3a XL a week ago. But it appeared that photos from the front camera are blurry! Even the objects in the back are focused better. I wouldn't even complain about it if it wasn't the camera-phone Pixel. The phone got the latest updates on board, clear front lens, good environment and light.
I have contacted the Google support, they are proposing free repair but the thing is - I live in Russia, so I'll have to send it to the US, what will take forever with our post-office and upcoming holidays (I'll do it in January then anyway).
To make sure, could anyone please send any examples of selfie from exact this model (Or if there any fix for it?)? I'm just afraid that the repair service would say everything's fine.
Accidentally I found what caused the problem, but it isn't exact. When I cover 75% of the camera with something, the picture becomes clearer.

Pixel 2 Death - Battery Malfunction? (Can not turn on),"The thing is, it is not my first phone having some sort of weird stuff of that kind.
My previous Nexus 5X from Google went on an endless boot loop too... but from a different cause probably...

Anyway, I was using my Pixel 2 normally, It was charged to around 40-48% I went away for a sec, came back and out of nowhere my phone just died. The battery probably completely drained.
Must mention, my battery was operating perfectly all of the time before, so while it was strange, I thought I'll just come home and charge it regularly...
I considered this as a pretty weird anomaly since usually when the battery goes to 0% there is usually some red light that toggles to show that the battery is dead when PWR Button is pressed.
Nothing like that this time.

Once I plugged in my Pixel 2, it started charging and turned again for the last time to show it had 47% that switched to 0 % that immediately turned off the phone. Since then the phone was showing that it is charging the battery, turning on and to maybe show `Google` (from Android 10 dark theme) or something that looks like a loading bar and immediately fading out and showing that the battery was dead.

Details (details that came to my attention that might be helpful to resolve or better understand the problem)
Nothing turns on to show that the battery is dead (the Red LED in the bottom doesn't turn on, neither the one on the right top corner of the phone) When unplugged at least.
Charging Pixel 2 using USB - Type C that connects to PC made the red led in the top right corner of the phone flash. Nothing became functional though.
When plugged, the screen shows it is charging and tries to automatically boot up the system.
Once it tries displaying Google or some loading bar instead, everything on the screen immediately fades away slowly. (image seems to be stuck and brightness fading down shortly)
Then the top right LED flashes once completing that cycle and starting right from the beginning where it showed that the phone is charging.
When attempting to turn on sometimes it shows something that reminds me of a very thin loading bar or sometimes it shows ""Google"" before fading out.
I was almost sure it had charge before suddenly showing 0%
I tried letting it charge for some long time already without any new result
I have/had Android 10 on my Pixel 2 ( I updated from Android 10 Beta to Android 10) - I don't think it is related to the problem but I am trying to mention every little detail
The decorative glass in the top back of the phone cover is slightly cracked - it was in the same condition for a long time and kept working.
The phone was wet several hours before the incident - but Pixel 2 has some waterproofing.
it wasn't submerged but just had some little splashes on it for a short time. - once again it is not the first time it was wet with the cracked back cover glass.
I loved my Pixel 2 very much and it was perfect all of the time, keeping it in the almost best condition possible - software-wise and planned on repairing the back cover glass on the screen myself since it seems like nobody is repairing Pixel phones in the place I live in

What I suspect:
Since it doesn't have any response at all when unplugged: might be some unique malfunction with the battery?
Lower probability but I'd still mention that it had Android 10 - after all my previous Google phone Nexus 5X died from a software update...
Going from 48 or 47 % to 0% seems to be like a symptom of the phone having water in the wrong places maybe. In that case, replacing the battery is still a good idea right?
I am completely lost
My Pixel 2 is yet in some sort of coma. It could just wake up randomly, say hello and then going back into that phone coma breaking my heart once again.

I am planning on buying a new battery and trying to replace it. I don't have any special tools for heating up the adhesive layer so I'd probably use just a hairdryer for that.
Other tools are usually coming in battery replacements kits with the battery.
Hopefully, that surgical procedure will fix it up...
There is still risk that it won't and I'll just waste more time and money while trying to revive the dead.
I don't know if it is a good idea yet so please let me know.

So now I finally came here to write a thread and ask for help. (When I ran out of any other options)
If any of you came across something like this and were able to fix that please help.

Intermittent data issues for only a subset of apps/websites,"I recently purchased the 3a to upgrade from my old Nexus 5x and, due to the recent lockdown measures in the UK, I've not been out and about with it very often, but now the restrictions are being relaxed I've noticed some issues with mobile data (as in the house I've mostly been on Wi-Fi), but only for some apps/websites and not all the time.
When I leave the house and disconnect from the wi-fi I find I can no longer stream music through Amazon Music App or podcasts via the Google Podcast app. The phone shows a good 4g signal and most websites appear to load rapidly without problem (and are not cached for an offline experience) including reddit, facebook and the BBC, but I cannot load the outlook.live page (to check my work email account), it just hangs as if trying to load, but never actually goes anywhere. This has got me stumped as I think what could be causing this to only impact some websites/apps but not all.

Today I was streaming music via Amazon whilst driving, initially still buffered from the house wifi, but it soon cut out and could not be restarted. I pulled into a garage and found that I could stream a movie via Amazon Prime app, but not play music or use the amazon shopping app either. I could send and receive messages in Whatsapp and go to most websites, but again not outlook.
I tried restarting the device. Clearing the cache of the apps and the google app itself, no change. Tried turning mobile data on/off and going into aeroplane mode and back again, no difference. I gave up, but found I could play streaming music through Google Play app, so did that instead. Later I checked again and all seemed fine (amazon music played ok and outlook loaded instantly) so I left things as they were, but once again the problem re-occurred when I was heading home.

I've been driving around quite a lot listening to music and podcasts and it has only recently become very noticeable, but I've not really thought too much of it as it was very sporadic, but that was likely down to the stay at home measures and now it is becoming much more problematic.

Any ideas? Is there something really obvious I've missed? All apps are set to stream on mobile data (and as I mentioned, they will work at some times, not others, regardless of the displayed phone signal and ability to visit other website/stream other apps). 

I tried loading in safe mode, but I get no signal at all there (should I?) so could not test. I've performed a factory reset and the problem persists. I've put the sim back in my old phone and all worked fine on mobile data. As soon as I put the sim back in my 3a the problem returned, so it is definitely to do with the phone and not the network provider.","Connectivity, Network, Bluetooth"

Pixel 3/XL Camera Color Balance Defect still not corrected nearly a year later,"There are continuing complaints about the removal of color balance correction on Pixel phones. As of this date, nearly a year later, Google has demonstrated that they do not have the technical expertise to correct the ""automatic"" software  color balance issues (they appear to have gotten worse with the most recent OS updates) and ""for whatever reasons"" will not add back color balance adjustments, a foundation, expected requirement for taking quality images in any camera and a reason why so many advanced amateur and professional photographers selected Pixel. Reluctance to interact with the user base is disconcerting.

Google cannot claim it's camera's produce high quality JPG images if it's software is unable to manage color balance correctly. Resorting to the use of RAW images is no excuse.

As Pixel owners, if camera image quality was a deciding purchasing factor, and Google will not fix the problem, we have to make a decision to continue with defective cameras (this is a defect), or move to another manufacturers device. While we're getting fairly sharp, technically corrected images, the color balance issue makes them look like cheap smartphone camera's from years past, and today almost any other manufacturers camera's provide a more pleasing image. Don't you feel embarrassed when in the past people complimented you on the image quality and now ask you what happened to these images, why so poor? You can only say, well it's Google.

We no longer have a product that justifies its asking price. It's time to move on for those who need the best quality images in their life applications.",Camera

This was not the case here, as shown in the first pic below.

HOWEVER, I stumbled upon a short-term fix, which indicated to me that there is an issue that might be resolved. 

That fix was to point the camera at the ground, then raise it quickly and snap a shot before it could focus and washout the picture. It was the photographer's equivalent of taking shots like a quick-drawing, Wild West cowboy in a shootout outside the saloon. Not the best scenario for making a composition, or much else.

Three result was the second photo below, a pretty decent shot considering the quick, sweeping action I had to make to take it, and much truer to what my eyes saw.

Can anyone steer me towards a fix so I don't have to act like a outlaw at the ok corral when I want to take pics at sunset?",Camera

Any way to turn on a notification when wifi signal drops?,"I'm on a Google Pixel 3a XL on Android 10, and like apparently many, many of you I'm having problems with my wifi suddenly and constantly dropping. Sometimes it shows ""connected, no Internet"" and sometimes it just completely disconnects, and all I have to do is go in and manually click on my home network and it connects easily right away.

"Pixel 3 won't hold charge, stay powered off, or charge with USB-C to USB-C cable","My Pixel 3 (about eight months old) worked great until last week. But now...

--- Mysteriously, the phone would no longer take a charge from a USB-C to USB-C cable, though a USB-A to USB-C cable still works.
--- The battery lifespan evaporated: I previously needed to charge the phone every 36 hours or so, but now a full charge with little/no activity only lasts about eight hours if I'm lucky. 
--- The phone will not stay powered off. About 10 seconds after shutting down, the phone turns itself back on unless it is plugged into a USB-A to USB-C charger. Normally this wouldn't be a problem, but given that the phone can't hold a charge, it's a big deal.

I went through the forums and tried every fix I could find. I restarted the phone in recovery mode, saw the little green robot with the red triangle and the ""no command"" text at the bottom of the screen, rebooted into recovery mode...and nothing changed. I did a factory reset, restarting the phone ""as new"" as seen elsewhere on these forums...and nothing changed. If anything, the functionality of the phone slowed down a bit. Basically I went through this thread (https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/12851151?hl=en) and got nowhere.

I'm at a loss at this point. These issues came out of nowhere on a night where the phone was resting on my nightstand.

Pixel connectivity to hearing aids,"My ReSound LiNX Quattro hearing aids connect fine.  Tthey were the only android supported when I purchased back in Jan, that is why I bought them.  My audiologists told me that ReSound had a 6month exclusive agreement with Google and I can see that there are now more supported HAs.  I was hoping in that time period Android support would improve but does not appear so.

I am having two really annoying issues.
1-when connected I do not get alerts.  sometimes I will get the last nanosecond of an alert in my hearings aids OR the hearing aids will go momentarily quiet.  I'm guessing that the alert is getting issued before the connection can be completed.  When I disconnect the HAs the alerts come thru loud and clear.  Most of the time I will not get ring tone for an incoming call and for an outgoing call will not hear anything until the connection is made with the person or their VM.
2-When my car is connected (via BT) the sound is inconsistent.  Sometimes it will come thru the HAs and sometimes it will go thru the car spkr.  Calls as well.  The result is that I have to manually disconnect the HAs for the sound/calls to come thru the car.  You would think there would be a setting to automatically do this, ie, why would I want sound to come thru the HAs in the car especially when an incoming call does NOT turn off an media sound to the car.  When I use Android Auto (via USB/BT) the issue is the same.

I just tried google support - totally worthless.  Had me forget all BT devices and dropped off the chat before I could reply.  

I think these issues just reflect very limited support for HAs.  So disappointing.  I am not an Apple person but can tell from my wife's phone there are much more support options.

It appears other sensor-like issues are occurring, too, as I now have to reboot my phone every couple of days to get facial recognition to work again (it prompts me that the top of the phone might be too dirty, even after cleaning). A reboot immediately fixes this issue however, so it's not a dirty sensor.","Contacts, Calls, Voicemail"
PIxel 3 Bluetooth connectivity issues,"I have a pixel 3 phone.   It stopped pairing with my fitbit charge 2 about a year ago.  I thought it was Fitbit issue as my fitbit is 4 years+ old and the face is cracked.  I now sync via my desktop with a dongle in a USB port.  From that point I did not notice any issues until I bought Pixel buds and because the Pixel buds are a new product I thought the audio issues I were having were on the Buds side and I worked with google on that.  What takes the cake though is I bought a new to me used car with android auto.  I paired up my phone and it worked great for about 50 mins into our road trip to texas from wisconsin.  It kept disconnecting and I was getting super frustrated and was blaming the car and the cables I used to connect.  Until I had my wife connect her phone a pixel 3a.  No issues with her phone the whole rest of the trip. 

I reset all network settings, I put my phone in safe mode and still have issues.   confirming that my bluetooth is defective.  After two + years of owning the pixel 3 I assume my only option is to get a new phone which is disappointing as I was hoping to make it 3 years with my phone before I get a new one.  I guess the real reason why I am posting this is to warn others that it may not be the things your trying to pair with but it might be your phone.","Connectivity, Network, Bluetooth"

Pixel 4XL turns off after a few seconds,"My Pixel 4XL is not turning on unless I keep holding the power button. If I let go, it immediately turns off. It also turns itself off as soon as it finishes loading, even if I'm holding the power button. I tried charging it, but it doesn't solve the issue.

Restarting in recovery mode (by pressing power + volume down) also doesn't work, as soon as I let go of the power button (to navigate and select options from the menu), the phone turns off.

I've followed the troubleshooting pages for Fix a Pixel phone that won't charge or turn on and Fix a Pixel phone that's restarting or crashing (the steps I could, at least). It doesn't seem to be a problem with the phone not charging. Nor it seems to be a screen issue, as I tried calling it, but it won't ring.

It seems to be a hardware issue: I've been having problems for a few week with the battery stuck at 50%, but otherwise the phone was working normally, until today. Unfortunately, it seems impossible to get in touch with Google's customer support: every link I try (""contact us"", ""Chat"", ""contact pixel phone support""...) redirects to the self-help page.

Google Pixel Wifi Connectivity Issues,"We bought our daughter a Google Pixel for Christmas and it has never connected to our home internet. It attempts to connect, gets stuck at Obtaining IP Address and then either disconnects or is connected with no internet.

We have AT&T U-verse with an Arris NVG589 gateway, 2.4GHz. All other devices (laptops, iPhones, iPads) connect with no issues. Pixel is updated to Android 9.

The Pixel phone connects to other wifi networks with no issues.

I have tried all of the usual suspects - resetting network connections, restarting modem, restarting phone, forgetting network etc. multiple times, to no avail. I have tried safe mode and it still does not connect.

I've seen multiple other posts from people with a similar problem, most of which remained unresolved. One recommended enabling MAC randomization in the developer settings, but this phone doesn't have that option.

I myself have a Pixel XL which is 2 years old. When I first got it, it had the exact same issue and after multiple hours with Google and AT&T tech support, I managed to get higher level tech support free of charge. I don't remember which company it was with, but I do know that they talked me through changing some settings in my phone (I believe VPN and/or DNS, but I could be wrong as neither of those is showing anything out of the ordinary now) and it has worked ever since. Unfortunately, calling AT&T and Google support on this occasion has not been successful - they have no record of the solution to my problem, and they won't connect me to level 2 support without payment (and I'm not about to pay them to fix a problem that is none of my doing).

Since I'm not super tech savvy, I have no idea what could be causing the problem and how to fix it on my own. Arris routers have been mentioned in several of the other posts, so I'm wondering if it could be anything to do with this, and could be fixed with a new router.

Is it possible to change the default mode that the stock camera launches in from stills-camera to video?

I know it is a simple swipe to move between the two modes but 90% of the time I want video rather than stills so it would make sense to me to swap the default setting, especially as I often film from my bike so need quick access with the least fiddling around.

Are your Pixel charger died on you as well??,"For a high price charger, i'd expect Pixel charger is high quality too, but what came with the phone is a second rate charger. My charger just died on me just like that, i never twisted the cables or even take it with me anywhere, and it just won't charged anymore, died just like that.

I know that Pixel charger is using 5V 3A or 9V 2A, although it would mostly charge at 10W, not 18W like it advertised. Would it be okay to use other brand like Oneplus charger? Oneplus charger is using 5V 6A which could deliver 30W, i know that it would only max out at 18W for Pixel phone, but is okay to use higher Ampere, is it safe?

I bought Oneplus phone since it's the closest to pixel for pure android, even though software won't be as good as Pixel, but it closest enough and the hardware is way better than Pixel phone, and it's cheaper too

Strange battery drain Pixel 3 XL,"I've had my Pixel 3 XL for a couple of months and I love it. I also have a Pixel Stand for charging.

My 'phone is on standby - not completely switched off - overnight with all the battery-saving, data-saver and Do Not Disturbs turned on. I don't have any third-party apps that could affect it.

"Pixel 2, Verizon, Physical SIM not recognized","Issue: Phone randomly stops recognizing physical SIM card. I do not and have never used Google Fi or any eSim. In fact, I think the Verizon SIM in my phone has been there since both the SIM and phone were brand new in December 2017, and I haven't removed it.

I have been having this issue for months, since I think middle of November 2019. Pixel 2 on Verizon. All suggested and patches up to date always. No recent updates have fixed the issue.

Sometimes I can use the phone for days without any issue, other times it will only last an hour or less before it stops recognizing the Sim card. Sometimes toggling airplane mode fixes the issue, sometimes it doesn't. 

I found another post where an engineer recommended entering *#*#794824746#*# into the dialer. This switches between physical SIM and eSIM. So I have to enter it once, wait for the pop-up that eSIM is enabled, then enter it again, wait for the pop-up that the physical SIM is enabled, then wait for my physical SIM to be recognized. This usually works, but occasionally will not work.

It seems that the issue happens more frequently after a restart, which is unfortunate because sometimes I need to restart to fix the issue.

How is such a core functionality broken, after 2 years of no issues prior? How has this not been fixed in 3 or 4 patches? I see some bug tracker for a similar issue, but where the user had Google Fi and Verizon at the same time, and people are reporting that the issue is no longer present. Unfortunately I'm still having my issue.

I hope this post will get the right attention and this issue can actually be fixed. I love my pixel 2 and rave about how it's been so good for so long, but this is really a problem.","Connectivity, Network, Bluetooth"

Pixel 3 will not turn on,"When I woke up this morning, I was unable to turn on my phone or get any sort of response from it. I've run some troubleshooting on it, and this is what I have done/found so far.
The phone by itself does not respond to any kind of input from the buttons, even after several hours of being plugged into its charger. No response is seen from the LEDs, the screen, or from haptic feedback.
I have not yet tried a different cable, but I am reasonably sure that my current cable is fine (it charges my backup battery). I'm going to check it with a new cable very shortly, but I doubt it will make a difference.
When I plug it into my computer (running Windows 10), I get the connection notification sound, and Device Manager refreshes its list of devices (though I am unsure of where the phone would be located in the list). Holding down any button or button combination (including combinations that do not include the power button) while the phone is connected to my computer causes the connect/disconnect sounds to play at ~8 second intervals.

there are 2 ways so far to temporarily resolve the issue :
1. reboot the phone
2. ask google assistant to set an alarm

The second one is interesting, which indicates it might be the cause.
I guess when you call Google Assistant and get interrupted (close the tap or app crash)
Your phone might stuck in the session so audio get occupied by Google Assistant.

Random Huge Battery Drain Pixel 3 XL,"I've been using my Pixel 3 XL happily since I bought it to replace my 2 XL at the beginning of December, and have even been getting pretty decent battery life (about 5 hours per charge), but three or so days ago it randomly started draining its battery really quickly. I'm talking ~15% per hour just on standby with the screen off, although I do get a fair few notifications coming through.

I'm no novice to Android, and unfortunately the bugs that seem to come with it. My first instinct therefore was to check with apps were using power - absolutely nothing out of the norm, even system processes like Google Play Services were behaving. So I started to uninstall various apps to see whether anything made a difference. However, over several charges it had literally no impact whatsoever. I should probably also mention; I keep my phone lean at the best of times - I don't have any of the big draining apps like Facebook installed in the first place.

This is when I turned to a factory reset, I hate doing factory resets because they take far too long, and 2FA makes signing back into all my services nothing short of a nightmare. After this I was sure everything would have solved itself, but alas no. It's still draining away.

I went to bed last night at midnight with 30% in the tank after two charges during the day (haven't had to do that since my Nexus 4), I obviously don't receive notifications during the night, and normally I would only use about 8% of my battery overnight, but I woke up at 7 this morning to find my battery completely drained flat. 0%

What's the next step? I really don't want to have to deal with an RMA if I can help it. Is anyone else dealing with a similar issue? Like I say, it's very much come out of nowhere, I haven't recently installed a new app or done a system update. It's just randomly appeared.

Any help would be massively appreciated.

Mysterious app '10510' draining battery like crazy,"Hi community,

There's a mysterious app draining my battery, it only shows '10510'. Initially it seemed to be Facebook, so I've uninstalled FB app and installed FB Lite instead.

camera takes videos instead of photos,"Hi, when I go into my camera app I assume it is going to take pictures, so I start snapping away, under pressure for work, but when I go back and look at them it has taken short videos. I can't go back and re-take them. This is really annoying. No other phone in the history of my phones has done this. Why can't it just take pictures without me having to think - oh, hang on, there is something I have to do here because this phone likes taking short videos. Why am I in video mode by accident? Not only is it annoying that I can't plug it into the computer and get them off the phone, once I go through the process of waiting for them in google photos and downloading them, half of them are vids. They seem to be a rather odd video jpeg file. Perhaps I can guide the programmers here: When you open a camera app it should default to taking still photos. Jpegs are fine. The next option is shooting video. We don't want some kind of in-between file, as these are no good to get into photoshop or view as stills. Is it supposed to do this? Do they think it is wanted? Provide the option. Allow us to switch it off. I'm a stills man not a moving jpeg man. I want small files that can be emailed. I want to get them into photoshop. It seems like everything normal I want to do with this phone is made more difficult. Shall I throw it in the bin? No settings are available in the camera app. Using a different camera app makes it even more complicated. Who knows where the photos go. How do I get them onto PC? Has anyone heard of a wire? I am not looking for a learning curve. I want to snap a photo and see it on my PC asap.

- I made sure my Android device was on the same WiFi network as my other devices.
- I turned off mobile data.
- I disabled Private DNS.
- I am able to cast to Chromecast devices on my network from my phone (which also use mDNS) so it is able to receive/send multicast packets.
- My roommate who also has a Pixel 3 confirmed it does not work for him either.
- I've tried Chrome, DuckDuckGo, Firefox, Firefox Beta, and Firefox Nightly with no success.

I have come across the Network Discovery Service for Android, which provides tools for app developers to allow their apps to do exactly this - use mDNS to find *.local hostnames, which begs the question: do normal DNS resolutions on the Pixel 3 not know to do *.local domain lookups via mDNS?

And if not:
- Is there any way to enable it?
- Is there any plan to support it in upcoming Pixel updates?
- Are there any web browsers that use the NDS Android API to enable this functionality?

Thanks for your time, I know this is a tricky question, but I've been troubleshooting it for several days, and really can't find answers on Google. But with the number of consumer devices that run on *.local addresses I'm sure someone out there must know whether this is possible/supported or not.

Thank you very much for your time!

PS- I've seen some workarounds: setting up a private DNS server, adding a hosts file entry, etc. I may use those as a last resort, but I'm interested in allowing my roommates/friends to access things on my network while they're visiting, and I can't do special configuration on all of their devices if they happen to be using Pixel phones.","Connectivity, Network, Bluetooth"

"""Bluetooth keeps stopping"" message","I recently purchased a Pixel 3 XL and after a few months of good usage I began having a ""Bluetooth keeps stopping"" message. Thinking it was just something introduced by some app I had downloaded, or file that I had put on my phone I factory reset my phone. Then I factory flashed my phone to the most recent factory image. Then I flashed my phone to the very first factory image that was available for the the Pixel 3 XL, the September 2018 image. The error continues to come back. I can't believe this is a hardware problem, it can be temporarily solved by restarting the phone, and it is completely random, sometimes happening constantly every 5 seconds, and sometimes not happening for days at a time. I don't believe it's a loose connection in the phone, it wouldn't be fixed by restarts and it wouldn't be so frustratingly random. I've been reading forum post after forum post of people with this problem. I've only searched specifically for people with Pixel 3's but it seems to be happening with other Pixels and maybe even with with phones from other manufacturers as well. 

This issue is causing people's otherwise perfectly functional phones to be useless. When the bluetooth keeps stopping it also takes the wifi and mobile network down with it. I've missed important text messages and phone calls.

Google won't warranty my phone because it's past the warranty period, even though I called them previously seeking help about this error before my warranty had expired.

Someone please look into this and figure it out. It seems to me that it the error was introduced after an Android update, personally I think the Android 10 update caused it, as that seems to coincide with when it started happening to me and when many other people are saying it started happening. Some reports of the error do contradict this though, saying it happened before that. All of these links are about the error from a cursory 5 minute google search. I imagine searching for much longer you could find so many more.

PIXEL crashes when making/receiving calls,"Hello,

I updated my PIXEL to Android 10 and since then have been unable to make or receive phone calls.  Every attempt to do so results in the phone crashing.  Additional issues that occurred around the same time include the inability to record audio in videos, audio not working with the assistant, excessive lag, UI crashes, and occasional connectivity issues with both bluetooth and WIFI that result in crashes.  Most issues occur 50% or less of the time, while the phone issue occurs around 95% of the time.  I have managed to make one or two outgoing calls, but all inbound calls cause a crash when answered.  

These issues started immediately after applying the update.  I've tried booting my phone in safe mode, removing apps, and doing a factory reset.  No action has resulted in a noticeable change.  

It seems to me that there is a bug in the update, however I don't know how to revert to Android 9.  Any advice would be appreciated.

Pixel 3 randomly counts down and shuts off when its below 30%,"Months ago as my Pixel 3 USB type C port is physically damaged, I have been using wireless charger.
The phone was running fine until pretty recent.
Week ago, I was using hotspot + wireless charging at the same time for a couple hours, and then it randomly shuts off. To turn it back on, I could only factory reset the phone.

Now, with only a few apps on the phone, it randomly shuts off when the battery is below 30%. The battery percentage would drop down within a few seconds and shuts off. Sometimes I could start the phone back on and it shows 0% battery or to whatever battery percentage it had. But the phone will still have the issue unless I recharge the phone for hours.

I took the phone to fix the port so I can charge the phone with cable faster. But the issue is still there, technician told me to change a battery as they tested it and said my phone battery is getting old.

2. Under indoor light shooting, body skin is orange and colors seems to be unreal. Examples:

"""Alarm & timer notifications are off"" but no option to turn them back on?","I've been using the alarm from the built-in clock app, but it hasn't been working. I have tried setting a few, and sometimes none of them go off. Sometimes, the first alarm will go off, but it won't repeat if I've snoozed it (no matter how much I fuss with the snooze settings). And NEVER have ALL of the alarms gone off (I usually set 2-3). 

Every time I open the app, a notification at the bottom pops up that says ""Alarm & timer notifications are set to off"" with a link to the settings page. But when I get to the settings page, every option to turn them back on is greyed out! I can't figure out what setting has made it impossible for me to turn these back on (under ""Firing alarms & timers""). Under ""App Info"" for the clock app, Notifications are turned on.

Strange UI behavior for wallpaper selection,"Say I want to change my lock screen wallpaper. I open settings, choose styles & wallpers, swipe right to chose the lock screen preview.

This will be the second time selecting this option for one task. OK, so I like it. I click the check mark, now it's giving me the option to set it as my home screen, lock screen, or both.  So, again I'm being given more options than I want as a user.  I just want to change my lock screen.  

The last choice is nothing new, but the behavior before that is a bit goofy. I was legitimately confused when I selected a wallpaper for my lock screen when the home screen preview popped up. Not intuitive.

WiFi disconnects when phone is idle/asleep,"When my Pixel 3 running Android 10 is idle/asleep for more than a few minutes, the WiFi gets disconnected. Is there a way to ensure that WiFi stays connected when the phone is idle?

My guess is there's an option in the Battery Optimization setting, but none of the 100+ apps in there are obvious to me because they don't specifically say WiFi.

My other guess is some problem related with Android's Doze feature. Apparently in earlier versions of Android you could easily make an adjustment to keep WiFi on but I haven't found a way for Android 10, so here I am...

And for those curious, the larger issue here is that  when I receive a phone call, in certain circumstances, the phone only rings for one second on my end. Then the ringing stops and the call notification disappears. But for the person calling, the phone continues to ring and they eventually get sent to voicemail. My cell service is Republic Wireless which primarily operates over WiFi. I have run a number of tests and the only condition where the one-second ring occurs is when the phone has been connected to WiFi, then it's idle for a while and I receive a phone call. The phone is disconnected from WiFi when the call comes in. Then it reconnects, but at that point it's too late, the option to answer the call is already gone. If I'm off WiFi completely, calls come in just fine. And if I'm on WiFi and the phone has been interacted with within the past few minutes, the call comes through, likely because the WiFi hasn't disconnected yet.","Connectivity, Network, Bluetooth"

2016 Pixel having Bluetooth issues similar to its release.,"Hello,

Ever since my Pixel has received the April security update I have noticed that the Bluetooth performance is very similar to when the Pixels released back in 2016.

I remember Bluetooth being one of the major pains of the first gen Pixels and was pleased when Google released a software fix months later. However, it seems that the similar static issues are making a comeback.

I've already tried deleting my Bluetooth devices from the Pixel and repeating the setup process, as well as just restarting the phone, but it ends up only being fixed on several occasions.

Pixel 4a (brand new) 8-12% draining in Airplane mode,"I got a brand new Pixel 4a and every night I put it on Airplane mode for ~8 hours, but it drains the battery pretty fast. Around 8-12%
This should be around 1%
Why this is important? First of all, this is a bug in the system, so it should be fixed. Second is that I need to charge the phone in every two days instead of three.
I come from Samsung Galaxy S7 and after 40 months of use the battery health was 82% (according to AccuBattery) and with the same setup it drained only 1-2%.

Also I talked to other Pixel 4a users and around 1% is the norm, so maybe this is hardware related?
I don't have any bloatware on the phone and the battery advisor states that everything is OK. When I observe the battery stats by apps/hardware, I notice nothing out of ordinary which is strange.

Screenshots included: I put it down last night ~8 PM at 85% and in the morning (~6 AM) it was down to 73%.

Pixel Stand not charging Pixel 3,"For a couple of years, my Pixel Stand worked perfectly with my Pixel 3. I place it in the stand, the little stand light comes on and my phone charges.

If I place my wife's iPhone on the stand it starts charging immediately, so it just seems to be my phone. Unfortunately I haven't had the opportunity to try my phone on another wireless charger to rule out hardware issues.

However, a month ago I did a bunch of things and managed to get the Pixel Stand working, but now it's stopped again. I tried to repeat what I did last time but have had no luck.

Previously, I cleared the data (storage and cache) for the Pixel Stand app, and also uninstalled all its updates, and ""forgot"" the stand from my Bluetooth connected devices list. I also tried safe mode. After a restart or two I found that putting my phone on the stand prompted the Pixel Stand to start charging and it opened the Pixel Stand assistant setup.

Bluetooth tethering turns off when phone sleeps (presumably),"I've got the latest Android 9 OS and I'm on a Pixel 3 as the phone set up as a bluetooth hotspot. The purpose of this is to set up a second device on my motorcycle as a GPS map with data connection to show me real time traffic (without endangering my Pixel out in the elements).

I connect with this second device and put my Pixel in my pocket, and that works ok for a while. Some time later (5 minutes?), the data connection drops, as does bluetooth. Sometimes I'm able to reconnect by unlocking the Pixel and telling it to reconnect to the previous device (not while riding, of course), other times, the phones won't reconnect for quite a while (too many attempts doing some kind of timeout multiplier?), but since there's no real information given why a device does or doesn't connect, I don't really know.

I'm guessing that what's happening with the dropout is that bluetooth is either turning off or the hotspot is turning off on the Pixel. When I unlock it, certainly the icon telling me the hotspot is being used is gone while the second device still has bluetooth up and running. I'm hoping there's some way to tell the Pixel to keep the hotspot active.

I can try also with a wifi hotspot, but I'd hoped to not have to manually trigger the hotspot every time I got on and off the bike. Bluetooth and distance handles all that quite nicely, though I'm guessing the wifi hotspot will have the exact same issue anyway.","Connectivity, Network, Bluetooth"

What camera mode is best for taking pictures of black cats or dogs?,"I have a Pixel 2 XL and am having a hard time getting the camera to focus properly and take good pictures of my foster kitten, which I need for his personal ad. Usually the camera on this phone takes excellent kitten pictures in varying levels of light and activity. This kitten has dark brown to black fur. Typically dark cats are typically harder to photograph, though I have one that is mostly black that I regularly get great pictures of. I've watched a variety of videos on how to improve the pictures (direct sunlight, simple background, no flash, adjust exposure, focus on eyes). Still, it's not helping. 

I've tried portrait and the regular camera mode, as well as adjusting the exposure and shooting with direct sunlight on the cat and behind me. I'm tapping the screen to focus. Is it simply too dark or that I need additional direct light on him? Other than a couple of pictures, most came out blurry or low detail, which you can see in the gallery of pictures I took today. Any thoughts on how to get my little guy some great pictures so he can find a good family to adopt him? With kittens, time is of the essence, because they're most adoptable when they're really tiny and cute.

Battery on a Google Pixel 2 XL fully discharged,"Hey guys,

I have a Pixel 2 (XL I believe) and have had no real issues with it since I got it, other than my charging cable being only able to charge my Pixel (I think it was damaged in shipping, it ONLY fits my Pixel) until a couple of days ago where I tried to charge my phone in the morning and got a solid red light in the top right, and a power symbol different to the normal charge symbol. It's a white battery outline with a two-pronged power cable/connector. After some searching I found this means the battery has discharged, and considering this is still a new phone and batteries should never discharge fully, I was wondering what the heck to do?

Secondly I've tried for several days now to contact Google Support but it tells me that I have to wait for ""local business hours"".

So took my phone to my service provider because I figured it must be the provider because the phone works fine otherwise.    We did:
1.We checked and made sure that I have the newest software update (Android 10)
2.We switched out the sim card
3. We uninstalled the phone software and updated it again
4.  We put my sim card in a Samsung, and it worked!!!
5. Google still wants to tell me that it is my service provider which is at fault.

Through the whole process, I can see on my account and my provider can see on their side that my WiFi calling is activated!!!

"Pixel XL battery drain, shutting off at 20%, black screen... after Android 9","Hello !
My Google Pixel XL 1st Gen of 2 years now started acting up. I did the Android 9 update back in March but only started to experience very annoying problems a month ago.

After the update, I first noticed the battery drain, it wasn't much at first and since my phone isn't recent I was kind of not surprised but now it's at the point that my phone will be completely drained after 2 hours without even using it ! If I use it, for example in the commute to work (45min), Spotify + browsing social media it's drained before I get to my office ! I have to walk around with a bunch of power banks or pray I'll find a plug when going out so I can charge my phone. Sometimes it shut down at 20% or more.

There's also another issue, when it's battery drained it will shut down ""normaly"" with the turning off message BUT sometimes I will have 20%, 30% or even 50% left and the screen will turn black.... Even worse if I try to turn it back on, sometimes it will work but the battery will somehow be at 1% or sometimes I can't turn it on at all (sometimes I manage to turn it on again after a few try but battery will be at 1% anyway) THEN when I will plug it to charge it will start normally and the battery will magically be back at the same % before the blakc screen... It's really stressful because it happens literally on random, when I open an app, take a picture, unlock my phone ""too fast"", receive a msg... 

Anyway, I saw a lot of people complaining of the battery drain since the Android 9 update but haven't found a lot of related issues with the black screen thing, so I'm not sure if my problem is because of the update or just my phone being ""too old""
Should I wait for the new Android ? Change the battery ? Or just buy a new phone ? Any tips on how to save battery ? :(

LTE Instability on Pixel 2 after December Final Update,"My LTE connection on my Pixel 2 has been unstable since the final December update.  It usually settles on H+ and sometimes goes to 3G. I can only get LTE after removing the SIM card and reinserting.  It lasts for a few minutes, seemingly until I change what screen I'm looking at on my phone.

It will even tell me I don't have data when it shows that I am connected to H+.

Sending media through MMS is practically impossible.

I have T-Mobile for service and my phone was purchased unlocked from the Google Store.

I've tried:
APN settings
Reseating the SIM card
Swapping SIM cards w/ another phone on my account
Resetting network settings
Clearing data and cache from phone services

When I setup the both 2.4GHz and 5GHz to use the same SSID, the pixel phone will refuse to connect to 2.4GHz band even if 5GHz is too low or not available, I disabled all settings in my AP to force 5GHz connection, and I also tried setting an RSSI to force the client disconnection from the 5GHz band when its signal is low, but it didn't help (it disconnects from the 5GHz but doesn't connect to 2.4GHz). I basically gone through all settings in my AP and it didn't help.
If I set the 2.4GHz band to a different SSID, the phone connects fine to it. It is a workaround, but I'd prefer for using the same SSID because, at least in my testing, even doing this way, the phone would not change automatically to the 2.4GHz SSID and go back to 5.0GHz when signal is good again.

- Does not show up in devices lists in the google home app. Overall, looks like a lot of connected devices are not showing up in the list (like smart plugs and cameras) even though they are working fine.
- Does not seem to connect to the wifi point even when inches away and hence shows poor/fair wifi connection --> ends up buffering or not streaming content due to poor network

Pixel 4 + Pixel Stand - no longer charging.,"Overnight, my Pixel 4 stopped charging on the Pixel Stand. When I woke up this morning, the battery had drained to 49%, and now it will no longer charge on the Pixel Stand.

If I connect the Pixel 4 to the USBC cable, it goes into rapid charging mode as expected and begins charging (and remains charging).

Hey facing network issue,Facing network problem,"Connectivity, Network, Bluetooth"
When will Pixel 5 support 5G networks carriers in Hong Kong?,"Google has released a 5G phone, however due to software issues it does not connect to many carriers in many places (eg. Hong Kong)

Google has not addressed this software fix in the past few monthly updates. So hoping for an ETA on when Google will look into resolving this simple issue (if at all).

Previously a Google representative mentioned that it is not in scope to fix as the Google Pixel 5 is not sold in Hong Kong - and this is an absolute cop-out of an answer. If the Google Pixel wasnt able to function under HK wireless spectrum, then what's the excuse for supporting 3g and LTE. What about those who travel. Hong Kong's 5G wireless spectrum is a globally acceptable standard and proof exists that you can activate the Pixel 5 5G for Hong Kong by rooting the phone and tweaking the settings. 

I find the above alternative (rooting the phone) far more dangerous than simply activating 5G. There is absolutely no need to coordinate with OEMs or wireless providers to turn on the hardware. You don't do this for LTE, why would you need to do it for 5G.","Connectivity, Network, Bluetooth"
Pixel 3 camera not working with third party apps until a phone restart,"This just started after the aug 1 update.

The selfie camera does not encounter this issue.

When attempting to take a picture with a third party app the screen will remain black for about 20 seconds and the app will crash. On re-oppening of the app it will state ""camera in use by another application""
Reboot fixes this issue.

Safe mode does not fix this issue, factory reset does not fix this issue.

Pixel 4a bad GPS reception,"Does anyone else experiencing bad GPS signal reception on Pixel 4a?

I'm almost unable to use any navigation app incl Google Maps because every 10 to 30s the signal is lost.

Yes, I did factory reset already.

Yes, advanced location using mobiles network, WiFi, Bluetooth and sensors is activated.

Google location service working.

When I launch GPS Test app form Play store I can clearly see that the GPS signal is low. And the GPS fix is list every minute. And that happens even when I'm outside, open terrain, good weather with clear sky. In these conditions the signal is approx 35%. The highest value I saw for a second was 48%.

I made a test using my old Pixel 3a. I put both devices next to each other and in the same conditions I'm getting 78% GPS signal on Pixel 3a.

Photos dates wrong and photos won't delete,"I have been having problems with camera/photos for a couple of weeks. I concluded a long chat session with a Google rep but he was unable to fix it.I have also sent this in as Feedback from my Google Pixel 4a phone.
  These are the issues:
  (1) Deleting photos and videos on the Google Photos 'roll' is problematic. Some will not delete at all. Some remain but are blurry, out if focus, when I know that the original photo was in-focus. Some stay on the photo directory as grey squares; in other words they take up space on then 'roll' but there is no image.
  (2) Images/thumbnails on the Google Photos directory/roll have a right arrow in the middle, indicating that they are videos. When that thumbnail is tapped the full image fills the screen, the arrow is still there. When the arrow is tapped nothing happens, i.e. no video plays, the still image stays. I am not 100% sure that the image ever was a video-- I think it was (there are many fake video icons, it's not just one) but it is possible that it was a still in the first place and a video icon was somehow added.
  (3) The dates of many photos have been changed. Photos that I know for certain were taken in Nov, Dec, Jan, and Feb are appearing under Oct 25th or 27th, etc.The 'roll' is really a mess. Some images from long ago, prior to October, are dumped in the Oct 27th (or nearby date) listing. It's ridiculous. And a big mess.

"It is Aug 5, 2020. The sensors on the phone have quit working on Pixel 3a","My Pixel 3a had similar issues a while ago. I'm not sure what got it working again, or why it quit working.  I did try rebooting and booting to safe mode and a few other things.  It did start again, but not immediately.  Auto rotate no longer works.  I can't use Google Photo Sphere or Google Street View on my Google phone to make panoramic pictures.

Ironically, I got the Pixel to do just this as a Samsung crapped out right before this and I chose not to replace it with another one.

Sounds like a Google Android update was the culprit in regards to the sensor a year ago.

Anyone know what is going on. There is a new August security update. Will this fix it?

I really would like to make a panorama shot at this time.  

Maybe I need to upgrade to a 4a, but I just bought this one and my experience isn't such that I'd want to buy another.  Maybe a direct replacement if it would fix this and other issues like brightness settings changing on their own and other behaviors.  It seems as if the phone is possessed.",Camera

Troubleshooting so far....
I have deleted all phone profiles on the pioneer and ""forgot"" device connections for the pioneer in my Pixel and re-established the connections. I have completely reset the pioneer back to factory settings.  I have looked and there are no software and firmware updates for the pioneer.  All the issues still happen.

Connection problems...
1. My phone connects to the pioneer - then i see a message on the pioneer- ""your device will be disconnected"" - i have two options, ""cancel"" or ""continue"". It doesn't matter which i choose, nothing seems to happen and the phone stays connected.

2. ""Connection Failed"" - my phone will not connect at all, not to bluetooth not to Android auto. But my Pixel shows connections to the pioneer via Bluetooth and WiFi. A reboot of the phone is the only fix i have found this far.

3. Android Auto crashes over and over. Again, a reboot of the phone fixes the issue usually.

4. Android Auto only comes up on my Pixel 3XL and will not connect to the pioneer. I usually turn off WiFi and Bluetooth and thay fixes it sometimes or Android Auto will start crashing. Then A reboot of my phone is required.

5. Trying to connect to bluetooth only I get the message ""Connection Failed"".

6. Dark Mode turns off, and stays off OR dark Mode may turn back on when Android Auto does connect to the Head Unit.

Google Pixel 3 Android 10 Proxy Autoconfiguration,"Howdy Pixel fam,

I'm a proud owner of the Google Pixel 3 phone and I'm having connectivity issues when using Proxy in Auto-Configuration mode.

Historically, I have always been having issues with connectivity when using PAC scripts, even on my older Nexus 5X, both on Android 7 and 8, but they were fixed by simply excluding the ProxyHandler and PacProcessor applications from power optimization.

The Android 9 on my Pixel 3 worked well and had no issues using PAC script, even without power optimization workaround described above. But, ever since I upgraded to Android 10, I started having connectivity issues in some core Google apps and certain third-party apps. For example, Google One does not start saying that I'm offline, GMail only shows old messages and does not display pictures in already downloaded messages, Google account settings say I'm offline and information might be outdated. Chrome, YouTube and some third-party apps in contrast work well.

I have tried applying the workaround for Android 7 and 8 and it did not help. I reached out to support and have done a lot of debugging steps on the phone itself with no luck. I then went onto an exhaustive journey of debugging the network configuration and I believe that there is a bug with Android 10 system with proxy auto-configuration code.

I took an isolated testing lab machine and installed four applications on it - Apache 2, Nginx, Squid and Privoxy. Nginx and Apache 2 were used to serve PAC files and I have created vhosts that use the machine DNS hostname and the IP address as well, and tried using both modes for both servers on the phone. Privoxy and Squid were used as two proxy servers. I had five different PAC files: one pointing to Privoxy using a DNS, second pointing to Privoxy using an IP, third pointing to Squid using a DNS name, fourth pointing to Squid using an IP and the last one just using the ""DIRECT"" connection.

None of the above configurations worked with my Pixel 3. All of these configurations worked with other devices, including iPhone XS Max, 3rd gen. iPad 12.9"" Pro, Windows PC, Linux PC, macOS Mojave, Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge on Android 8 and Google Nexus 5X on Android 8.

I then went further, and tried using the ""Manual"" proxy configuration on the Pixel 3 with Squid and Privoxy servers and both settings worked. This leads me to think that there is indeed a problem with Android proxy handling in auto-configuration mode.

Did anyone else faced similar issues? Have you been able to resolve them, and if yes, how?

Cheers,

3rd party launcher affecting Gesture Navigation in apps,"I am using Google Pixel 4. Whenever I use any 3rd party Launchers like MS Launcher, Nova Launcher, I will encounter issue on the 'gesture navigation'. When in an app, eg. playing games, it affects the touch response at the bottom of corners. But when I switch back to the default 'Pixel launcher', I do not have any problem. 
(Note: No issue when I switch to 3-Buttons navigation when using 3rd party launchers)
I contacted Google support but was asked to contact the Launcher creators. It seems like the problem only affects Pixel phones and not other Android phones.

There has never been a situation that is considered a customer's fault after receiving a smartphone.

When you use voice call functions of applications like KakaoTalk and Skype with GIGA WIFI 2.4ghz, 5ghz, you will get ""strange noise, the crackling noise, the noise of the fan running"". A very small but clear noise is heard from the top of the smartphone that is not seen on ordinary smartphones.
In LTE, symptoms do not appear first, but may appear later.
There are no symptoms when using regular currency.
It is inaudible to the ear of the elderly and noise is recorded and audible.

Pixel 2 XL does not work with OEM charger and most Power Delivery USB C Chargers,"Hello, 

About 3 to 4 weeks ago my Pixel 2 XL stopped working with the OEM chargers. I have 3 OEM chargers, and they all stopped working at the same time. When they are plugged in the phone does not recognize them, however they work perfectly with any other USB C device. 

The phone also no longer connects regularly to my laptop via USB C when Power Delivery is enabled on the port. This was another symptom that points to a software issue specific to Power Delivery. It also makes updating the phone via the laptop and adb very difficult. My Phone constantly crashes when plugged into my laptop or 3rd party USB C chargers if Power Delivery in enabled from that source. I have tried cables numerous different brand and quality of cables and the behavior remains the same. If a USB C charger does not use Power Delivery the phone charges, however not rapidly.

Another strange aspect, but I cannot pin down if it is random or there is a pattern is how Power Delivery chargers work. When I use a charger type for the first time all seems well, power delivery or not. However subsequent attempts with that charger will fail. AN example of this was using the USB C port on the back of my LG monitor. It worked yesterday while I was testing, however when I attempted to use it today it did not work and my phone shutdowns immediately when it's plugged in. The same behavior has been seen with my mac book pro charger and my ZEROLEMON or AUKEY desktop chargers. 

I can get my phone to work with a USB C charger/port with Power Delivery randomly, however the majority of times it crashes. When it does crash it goes to the block screen, flashing the charging icon (with the bolt) repeatedly until unplugged, it cannot be started while it remains connected. Once unplugged it shows the battery symbol with the current charge and turns off, at this point the phone can be restarted as normal. 

USB A to USB C is fine for the most part. USB C to USB C without Power Delivery is fine however, even with these chargers the phone does crash randomly. That means alarms are now useless because on a few occasions I have woken up to the phone in a powered-off state, because it crashed overnight while plugged in (USB A to USB C). I have tested this numerous times, with numerous chargers. All theses changers still work fine with any other devices that support USB C and Power Delivery. 

This behavior began after the May update and it would seem this is a software issue and I am trying to figure out how to get it properly escalated so it can be fixed.",Battery and Power

Pictures are partially blurred not because of the focal depth,"I have problems with the camera. First, images I get are almost always partially blurred, and it is not because of the focal depth. For example, one of the two objects is blured while both are at equal distance from the camera, or part of the landscape is blurred. Second, the camera won’t stop autofocusing, the picture is wobbling continuously. That frequently makes the whole photo get blurred. And that also spoils the video capturing too.

While the second problem may be partly solved by uninstalling camera updates, the first one is not as easy as that. I already tried to reset the device completely and set it up as a new one but it didn’t help.

Upd: No, I didn't reinstall the apps when I reset the phone. I set it up as a new one, and the first thing I checked was the camera function. I also tried the safe mode too

Issue with one app after android 11was undated,"I had no problem before the new update when my phone was running android 10.
  I can't pair my Bushnell Phantom golf GPS to my phone app. I have uninstalled and reinstalled the app. The Bluetooth is on both the phone and GPS. When I tried to pair the GPS the passcode comes up on the GPS, I put the 6 numbers into the phone and then the app says cannot communicate with GPS.
My phone is a Google Pixel 2 software is up to date android 11 and GPS is also running latest update. This is what I have done so far. I have done a hard reboot on phone and GPS.
1            Try alternate web browsers (Chrome, Explorer/Edge, Firefox)/Or, clear out your current browser's cookies and cached data.
2            Make sure your device is powered on before you connect it to your computer.
3            Try all USB ports on your computer (safely eject from computer first before physically removing from USB port).
4            Try resetting the device by pressing the power and down buttons for 7 seconds (while it is disconnected).
5            Disable security settings that may prevent data transfer (3rd party antivirus software and/or firewall protection).
6            Try an alternate cord, if possible.
If all fails, we would recommend attempting on a different computer to verify if it is a specific computer configuration or program that is preventing the transfer.
 I have tried all suggestions. The update was successful but still will not connect to my phone.
  I removed GPS from the app. Tried another phone and computer, the same thing happened. The update was successful but still will not connect to the phone. Both phones were running android 11. I tried one more time with my laptop, the update was successful and used an apple 8 iPhone. I loaded the app and connected the GPS to the iPhone with success. So I have to say there is a problem with the app because it is not compatible with the new android 11 system but works fine with iPhone.
  So do you have any suggestions on how I can run the app?","Connectivity, Network, Bluetooth"

The phone doesn't even alert me in any way when I have a phone call coming in. I'm using pushbullet, so if I'm at my computer I will get an alert there, but I have no way to answer it.

Callers not hearing a dial/ringtone on calling my number,"I have an ongoing issue with callers to my number not hearing a ringing sound i.e. they hear complete silence until I answer or it goes to voicemail. This has only been an issue with the Pixel 4a as far as I'm aware and was brought to my attention a couple of months ago (unsure if it's been a problem the whole 7 months I've had the phone as I obviously can't tell from my end).

The strange part is it's only happening with certain callers. All of my frequent callers (e.g. family members) hear a dial/ring tone. If I test from my desk landline I hear no ringing sound, and have had this issue confirmed by several others including my carrier.

I've tried troubleshooting with the carrier (including SIM replacement which has not solved the issue) and have an open case with them but I am wondering if this is a known issue and any possible solutions?

To be very clear - the phone rings at my end and I am able to answer the call as normal. The problem is callers are always surprised when I answer because they haven't heard any ringing sound.

What occurs is that when I get onto a stable WiFi network, like at home, my phone will not automatically connect with WiFi calling. I will often have to reset my phone to get it to engage. When it is engaged, it will usually just stay this way for a few minutes to hours. It will randomly disconnect. At that point I will have to reset my phone again to get WiFi Calling to engage.

When WiFi calling is engaged, I can make calls without issue, I do not get dropped calls. The issue is not with dropped calls when using WiFi calling but with getting WiFi calling to actually connect and stay connected.

Of note, when I'm in Airplane mode with just WiFi on, then the connection to WiFi Calling remains stable, without random disconnects.

I'm not sure why this is happening. I've factory reset several times, deleted apps, my carrier has reset my WiFi profile multiple times, nothing seems to make things work as they should (my wife's iPhone does not have this issue).

This happens on various WiFi networks, not just at home.

Of note, my Pixel 3 did the same thing. I was never able to get WiFi calling work properly as the above issues occurred.

Is there any advice you can offer?

Thanks","Connectivity, Network, Bluetooth"

Pixel 2 XL won't charge on original charger USB-C to USB-C,"Ok, I'm on my fourth Pixel 2XL due to warranty issues, this one is out of warranty.  The phone will periodically not charge, I called google about this when it was still under warranty and got the run around so I said F it, I'll just deal with it.  A subsequent update and all was well for several months, hell probably a year.  However, this latest version of Android has brought a host of issues to my phone, most of which have been fixable.  Most of my settings were lost for example, google assistant no longer recognizes my voice, my news feed and Gmail had to be setup again.  

However, the larger problem is with charging.  If I charge the unit with the google included chargers it does not work.  The chargers aren't the problem, my wife's Pixel charges just fine.  Mine was charging until the update in June (and everything went wonky).  I can't charge when using USBC to USBC the phone just shuts off.  When using USBA to USBC it works some of the time but will periodically shut the phone down, I can't figure out the trigger on that one.  For example it shut down Monday overnight and again last night, but has worked well a half dozen times in between.  

On the car charger it will usually charge but I have to go through a restart before it will charge.  The restart happens within a minute or two of plugging the phone in.  

This appears to be a very common problem but the threads appear to be locked for discussion.  I'm running out of ideas and hoping someone here has a suggestion that I've overlooked?  

So far I've tried safe mode which still has the issue, I've put no new apps on my phone and as such don't believe this is a third party app issue.  This appears to be a google problem, especially given the high volume of issues and complaints I've found.  

Tips/Tricks would be nice if anyone has them.  Not sure I can limp along for 5 or 6 months like this.",Battery and Power

When this happens I can still hear the other person clearly but the other person can't hear me. Apart from that people complain a lot that they can't hear me well on calls.

I live in the Dominican Republic and from what I've been hearing it's a problem with the hardware and I will have to send it to an official store.

Wifi calling intermittent failures,"This is happening on multiple Pixel 5 units on T-Mobile.
It does not happen with a Pixel 2 or 3 on the same network  (location) & also t-mobile.
The issue manifests when wifi calling is enabled (either mobile  or wifi preferred). Note that if I set mobile preferred the phone chooses wifi almost always (even though mobile is working fine if I disable wifi).
wifi calling works perfectly if I enable airplane mode and then enable wifi.
After doing #4 wifi calling works for a day or so once airplane mode is disabled. Service then reverts.

Google Pixel 4a: Cannot Connect to Network,"Recently, my Google Pixel 4a's SIM card reader was damaged so I decided to try out an eSIM. I got the QR Code from my carrier (AT&T) and the device said the eSIM was active. However, the phone still says it has no service (emergency calls only).

Here is what I have tried:
I have made sure my APN settings are set. They weren't at first, but I set them up and still had no service.
I have tried changing the preferred network type by dialing *#*#4636#*#* and setting it there, 
I have tried dialing *#*#72786#*#* to reset my network settings. Dialing 72786 did not pop any kind of menu for me, it just cleared out the dial (I am not sure if this is expected behavior or not).
I also tried resetting my network connections by going to Settings > System > Advanced > Reset options > Reset WiFi, mobile & Bluetooth.

Is there anything else I can try? I assumed an eSIM would work as I believe it was just the physical SIM card port that was damaged. Also, AT&T has said that everything is correct on their end so it is possible the phone is just permanently damaged.

Pixel 4XL Wifi/Bluetooth/Hotspot Won't Turn On,"Last night I dropped my phone about 5ft. It has a case but landed on the screen. Upon picking it up I kept getting System UI errors until I finally managed to restart it. The system UI errors have persisted but not as often. 

The big problem I'm having now is I cannot turn on my wifi/bluetooth/mobile hotspot along with the phone being clunky and slow now. It'll make the attempt to connect then instantly drop. I'm still able to use network data. Soft reset/safe mode/software updates did not work and I'm hesitant to do a factory reset because of the wifi not working. I'm overseas for the foreseeable so I don't have access to UbreakIfix. Most of the locals have never done anything with a Pixel either and don't want to risk it.

I'm guessing something is wrong with the motherboard or a loose connection inside. Without connecting to a hotspot in the meantime is there anyway I can tether my network connection to my tablet or another phone? 

I've also heard of applying pressure to the corner right above the power button but it hasn't changed anything. Or is there anyway I'd be able to use my Surface Go 2 with Google Fi? Any help or ideas are greatly appreciated.","Connectivity, Network, Bluetooth"

Is there any way to backup a Pixel that will not charge/turn on?,"So over the past couple months, I've been having issues with my Pixel 4 XL's battery that have only been getting more frequent and more substantial. Specifically, sometimes the phone would say it is having a ""problem reading the battery meter."" This would result in the phone displaying an inaccurate battery percentage or simply refusing to charge (displaying a ""?"" on the battery icon when turned off and plugged in). Sometimes I would be able to temporarily fix the issue by using a tip I read online where you apply slight pressure to the battery area. While that worked the first few times, it quickly became less reliable. Fast forward to today, my phone said it was at 87% but must have not been reading from the battery correctly, because the phone suddenly shut off from low power. Now, whatever I do, I cannot get the phone to charge again. Hard rebooting doesn't do anything, the pressure trick has run its course, I have tried everything I have found suggested online and nothing has gotten the phone to accept charge again. The phone recognizes it is charging (when plugged in it will display the charging battery icon for a split second as opposed to the red ""low battery"" icon when unplugged) but due to the issues with reading the battery meter the phone simply will not allow the battery to be charged. I discovered online that this is a very common hardware flaw with the 4 XL involving the battery FPC connector and that it will have to be repaired/replaced by a professional.
 So, at this point, I've come to terms that I will have to send in my phone for repair. My 1-year warranty unfortunately ended in December, but I'm willing to pay the repair cost considering how much I have enjoyed my time with the 4 XL and would rather not shell out the money for a new phone. However, my dilemma is that I do not have a backup of my phone. I was prepared to do so after the issues becoming more frequent these past few days, but the phone shutting off at ""87%"" blindsided me and I missed my opportunity. Since from what I've read, repairing the phone involves a complete wipe and reset, I am curious if there exists any way to back up my phone in the current state it is in. There is some data on my phone apart from the cloud services that I would be really upset to lose and if I could obtain a backup of it I would be much more comfortable with having it repaired. So if there is either a way to retrieve backup data from the phone while it is dead, a way to repair it without wiping the data, or a secret way of getting it to charge just one last time so I can get a backup before sending it in, that would ease a lot of my worries. Thank you.

Edit: I did just discover the ""one year extended warranty program"" regarding these battery issues, which I believe I fall under and would be exempt from repair costs, which is fantastic to hear. So I still just need to know if there is any way to preserve my data before taking it to the local uBreakiFix.",Battery and Power

Pixel 2 phone shuts down suddenly when playing audio or vibrates on low battery levels,"Got a Pixel2 since launch with it having Android 10 installed. Since the start of this year, I've been having issues that shut down my phone at around 25% battery or less whenever I play audio on my phone speakers/alarm sounds/or sometimes a vibrate from a incoming call. Whenever it shuts down, it does sort of a like a sudden screen blackout without warning, with a few horizontal white lines in the middle; then if its somewhat >10%, it just restarts, but otherwise will stay off. I've downloaded some apps to check battery life (Accubattery), and it seems to be at around \~65% battery lifespan (though I'm not sure if this is an accurate measurement). However, I'm now very aware of when my phone is at low percentages, and am curious to know what could be causing the audio in low percent shutdowns to occur. As for physical damage to the phone, since a year ago ,I've only had one major drop to the phone's bottom left, with it landing screen side down causing a minor crack, but all parts of the screen still touchable and usable. Not sure if this is a common occurrence among the first set of Pixel2 phones, or this is just unique to my case.

"Android 11 update on Pixel 3xl caused battery overheating/expansion, splitting the case","I updated to Android 11 on 9/5, according to the System->System update.  In the following days, I noticed the phone seemed a little warmer than usual.  Also, I usually plug my phone into my laptop's USB-C port to charge.  A few days ago it would constantly notify me it was charging, stop charging (according to the charge status icon) continuously.  I eventually stopped keeping it plugged into my laptop.

A couple of days ago the phone started getting much warmer.  Today, I took it out of my protective case and noticed that the right side of the case where the power button and volume control are.  It looks like the battery has expanded from the heat, splitting the seal on the case.  The phone is still working, but I don't think it will be working for long if I can't reseal the phone case and stop the overheating.

Since the update to Android 10 my Bluetooth will no longer play media in the car.,"Since updating to Android10 the media side of my phone won't play via Bluetooth in the car. Phone calls work fine but any sort of media such as Spotify or YouTube will instantly pause, like someone is hitting the play button again as soon as I've pressed it.

Pixel 4a front-facing camera not focusing correctly on subject (FIX),"The Pixel 4a has a well-documented problem with the Pixel 4a front-facing (selfie) camera not being focused on the subject.  It is fixed focused 10 feet behind the subject, even at the recommended distance of 18"" or more - the subject remains out of focus and blurry while the background is crisply in focus.

Here's a test my professional video engineer dad ran on the 4a front-facing camera:

""The problem is a design or manufacturing fault.  Here are photos of the Pixel front facing camera as delivered and with a +2 or +3 close-up filter.  There are focus star charts at the subject distance of 14"" and also in the background at 9 feet.  As set at the factory the background is more or less in focus, but the subject is not.  It's better with a +2 close-up filter taped over the camera lens, and perfect with a +3 close-up filter.  Clearly the camera is not focused properly, either because the wrong focal length was spec'd or delivered for the camera, or because the lens is too close to the sensor.  The simplest fix for existing phones, under the circumstances, would be for Google to admit the camera has a fault, and send a small stick-on +3 close-up filter to place over the camera lens to anyone who requests one.""

Pixel 3a sound dropping in and out when connected to Bluetooth speaker (only when screen is locked),"My pixel 3a has recently started cutting in and out when connected to a Bluetooth speaker and Spotify is playing (have tried multiple speakers and have tried playing downloaded music and the same issue occurs). This is only happening when the screen is locked, so I'm thinking it may be an issue with a battery saving setting. The Bluetooth does not fully disconnect, it just cuts in and out. 

 - I have tried resetting wifi, mobile and Bluetooth settings (no change)
 - I have had the same issue on multiple speakers (UE Megaboom, JBL Xtreme, SRS-XB01)
 - I am running Android version 11.
 - Battery Saver is turned off
 - Adaptive Battery is turned off
 - Spotify has permission to use battery in background

I'm not sure what the issue is but it has only recently started (was having the same problem before updating to Android version 11 but no change after updating)

Battery charge level and Hotspot usage,"Pixel 4 XL has some issues with charging and hotspot (always on LTE). My observations are as follows:

1) The phone was at 100%, and still present on the wireless dock (Pixel Stand). Turned on Hotspot and was downloading a few things (at a speed of 1-2 MB/s for most of the time, sometimes beyond 5MB/s). After some 10 mins, the charge starts reducing to 99%, 98% and keeps going down (and also the device heats a little, I agree with heating using hotspot). But even when the heat is negligible, wireless charging is unable to go forward. I was at least expecting it to stay at 100% because Pixel Stand outputs 11W.
Tried this many times with different charge levels, all the time the charge reduces.

2) The phone was at 20%, plugged in the wired charger. For the entire 90 mins duration of hotspot usage, the charge increased from 20% - 23%. This is frankly shocking, given the output is 18 W charger and it managed to raise only 3%. Repeated this numerous times at 50%, 35%, all the time the maximum increase during hotspot usage is 5%.

Before buying the Pixel 4 XL, was using the HTC U11. It also comes with an 18W charger. I remember my HTC charging fast enough as I use the hotspot. I wanted to repeat it again and tried with my HTC U11. At 20% turned on the hotspot and connected wall charger. It went to 50% in approx 35 mins and it continued to fast charge. 

As I type this right now, have been using Hotspot over the past 2-3 hours, the device is on PIxel Stand and the charge is now at 40%, the original charge level was 92%.

Right now using Android 11 beta 3 on Pixel 4 XL. But, I have been observing this issue right from Day 1 of Pixel 4 XL.

How do I get an external DAC/AMP to work with my Pixel 2 XL?,"I am trying to connect my phone to an external DAC/AMP. The problem is that the DAC/AMP will not produce any sound.

Everything that I have tried:

I am using a Satechi – Aluminum Type C Mobile Pro Hub. This is so I can both charge and send data to the DAC/AMPs.

I have three DAC/AMPs
1)      Moshi - USB-C Digital Audio Adapter with Charging
2)      Focusrite - SCARLETT SOLO
3)      JDS Labs – The Element

Both1 and 2 are both USB powered devices, while the 3 has an external power supply.

Both 1 and 2 work with my phone, while 3 kind of works.

When I connect my phone to 3 I believe the phone recognizes the DAC/AMP. This is because when I try to play music the phone speakers do no turn on. Also, if I disconnect 3 from my phone the music player on my phone pauses the music.

The problem that I have is that when I plug in my headphones into 3 while playing music on my phone there is no sound. I have ruled out the hub as a problem because it works fine with 2 and when using it to connect 3 to my computer.

From what I have seen it seems to be a problem with Android and how it handles externals DAC/AMPs.

Both 1 and 2 are USB powered, thus the phone is sending both audio information and power. At the software level, Android knows this and thus does not turn on the phone speakers when playing music, but rather send the signal to the DAC/AMP.

3 uses an external power supply, so it does not need power for the USB connection. Thus, the phone only needs to send audio information. At a software level, the phone seems the understand that a DAC/AMP is connected and thus does not turn on the phone speakers when playing music. However, the phone also does not seem to be sending any audio information to the DAC/AMP.

For this simple analysis, it seems that Android will only send audio information to a DAC/AMP if the DAC/AMP also is powered by the same connection.","Connectivity, Network, Bluetooth"

044 prefixed to phone numbers when they send MMS but not SMS,"Since going to Mexico 1+ year ago, some contacts' # were randomly being prefixed with 044 (eg 301-555-5555 would be 044-301-555-5555).  Over the past month or more (maybe since an update? I'm not sure), it happens EVERY time to those same contacts when they 1) send me an MMS (pic, gif, etc) or 2) are on a groupt text.  I can send texts normally, but the problems arise when they respond.
1)  Weird thing is their SMS and MMS normally shows up in the same text thread (almost like there's 3 ppl in the group) and sometimes shows up as a separate thread, but either way the SMS shows up as them (ie their contact pic, correct contact info), but the MMS texts just show up as the 044 # as if it's a stranger.
2) When I create a group text (2+ people) it goes out normally, but when anyone on the thread responds, it creates a new thread with the 044 # instead of the contacts real #.

I called Verizon and had a nice guy help with trying to research but he was just google searching like me.  I've tried the below to no avail:
1) Erasing the contact completely from my phone & from contacts.google.com

How to change default navigation app in Android and Google assistant,"I'm simply trying to have Android open links to directions in citymapper Google assistant open citymapper when I ask it to take me somewhere.

Pixel 1 device unable to connect to 5Ghz WiFi networks,"Hi everyone,

For the last few weeks I've been having problems with sporadic connections to networks that use both 5 and 2.4 Ghz and as of today my Pixel is fully unable to connect to my home 5Ghz network (a Pixel XL I borrowed from work using Android 10 as well is able to connect to it just fine). My device also says the WiFi signal strength is about a degree or two poorer than the XL I held right next to it.

My device has the latest security update Google released (and the last one they ever will) from December. I've tried to connect to the network over Safe Mode and after turning flight mode on. I've tried forgetting the network as well. I've restarted the devices multiple times and from the recovery screen as well but nothing seems to help.

Is this the end for my device's high-speed connectivity or does a lab/repair shop have a chance at solving this type of issue? Will a factory reset even do anything technically speaking that my previous steps hadn't?

Used Pixel 3 native SIP client can't establish voice bearer over Mobile Data,"Just got my first Pixel, a used Pixel 3 from the US that I'm using in Canada.

I long ago moved to a full SIP solution for my voice calls, and like to use the native Android SIP client, which was previously working in my Essential PH-1.

Pixel SIP calls work fine over Wifi, and the signalling works fine over Mobile Data (i.e. incoming/outgoing calls will ring), but the moment that someone picks up the phone and the call attempts to establish a bearer (i.e. voice connection), the call immediately drops.

I've done pretty much everything I can think of... wiped the phone and installed a new image, reset network settings, but the problem remains.

The one thing I think might be happening is that the phone might be somehow locked to not allow VoIP traffic over mobile data, which I know is a thing. Is there anyway to check that setting from the phone?  It wasn't a problem with the PH-1, so I don't think it's a network setting, unless it's a restriction that the PH-1 somehow avoided. It could also be something specific to the Pixel's APN handling, in case that's generally a problem?

Sudden Rapid Battery Drain - Related to Predicted Battery Life?,"Per the attached image, I'm seeing a very strange sudden draining of my phone battery.

I don't think this is actually a problem with the battery itself, because it typically happens at the end of a day after about 15ish hours of normal use when I would expect the battery to be about done. The battery just sits at ""80%"" charge and ""2 days"" remaining all day, then suddenly seems to realize there's no juice  left.

I think this is some kind of problem with the battery performance predictor, but I don't see a way to disable it to just watch the actual charge of the battery deplete at the rate its actually being used.

Earbud middle button always triggers audio news now?,"I have a Google Pixel 3 and sometimes listen to news by saying ""OK Google, tell me the latest news.""

Very convenient.

Recently I paired the phone with a new pair of Google 3 earbuds (my original pair was broken), and after the setup I found that the earbud buttons can be used to control Google Assistant. For example when new notifications come in, I can press the top button to listen to the notification, without taking the phone out of my pocket, which is very cool.

But then I bump into another problem: nowadays when I listen to ebooks in the @Voice Aloud Reader app, and press the middle button to pause the ebook, next time I press the middle button the ebook doesn't resume, instead the audio news starts playing. This often forces me to stop whatever I'm doing, take the phone out of the pocket, and manually close the Google app, to resume the ebook.

Is there an easy way to make the middle button only pause/resume the ebook in @Voice,  instead of always triggering the audio news?

Then, today I wanted to change the my case and noticed that the back of my phone is coming off and looked like it was bulging. This current phone is a replacement because my old pixel 4xl got run over by a car, so I had it replaced in the summer. This new replacement they gave me, had no accidents and I have taken very good care of it. I am aware that if there are problems within the 90 days, there is no fee for any defects etc. But since it has been over the 90 days, my options are to pay again a service fee of $225 CAD, or go to ibreakufix store to have it diagnosed, the Assurant support person said. I even have preferred care, which was an additional $200 and if I get charged again for a service fee, then this phone has costed me $2k. At this point I could have gotten a better phone from a different carrier. I even found many threads on reddit about people reporting the swollen batteries, shouldn't these be recalled since many users are reporting this? Is there anyone that can help me? I already called customer support (Assurant), they literally just gave me generic responses, when this clearly is a manufacturer defect. I just find it annoying how they are gonna charge SAF for a manufacturer defect. If someone higher up can help me with this, please do.

Thanks for listening.",Battery and Power

"Pixel 4 July 2020 Security Update - LTE No Longer Connecting, Forced to switch to 3G. TMOBILE","My Pixel 4 got the July 2020 security update this morning. After the update LTE no longer works and I am forced to manually switch to 3G in order to be able to make calls.

Turning off WiFi and removing then re-inserting the sim card appears to allow LTE to connect again in the status bar, but when I attempt to make a call I get a pop up stating 'Mobile network is not available'.
WiFi calling also does not work unless I am connected to 3G.

This doesn't appear to be a network issue with TMobile as I have another identical Pixel 4 that has not been updated with the latest security patch and LTE works fine.

My Pixel just went from 100% to dying in 10 minutes.," I've had my little Pixel for a while. Up until February, it worked great! No issues, and the battery lasted long and charged fast. However, its battery life has been getting progressively worse at an alarming rate. 

 At first, it was alright; dying at 20% and even 30% was understandable. But it only got worse. This morning, I woke up at 9:50 to take my dog outside. Decided to go ahead and perform some app updates while I was at it. Lo and behold, not even at 10:00, my phone died. It was at 100%, and when I rushed to stick it on the charger, it said 3%.

Pixel 3 battery drain problem,"My phone battery has been steadily getting worse for months. Every night when I get home from work I have to charge it, or even charge it at work.

As of the last few weeks it's becone nearly useless. I charge it to full and it dies multiple times per day. Yesterday it was in my pocket all day, I barely touched it and it died. It gets to about 10-13% battery and then it shuts down. 

As of today I spent hours following the Google battery drain tips. I backed it up and reset it to factory settings after doing all the other steps. Now of it gets to 20% I can watch the per tick down 1% per second and crash...

I posted to @madebygoogle twitter and they gave me a generic list of things to try. The only thing I didn't do besides paying here was to put it in safe mode. So I did that tonight to see the power drain is caused by an app (and yes I already deleted junk files, opened up storage, deleted unused apps, deleted widgets, and battery check says everything is normal...) Yet I still lost power fairly quickly (less quickly since nearly no apps are running, but had 4 hours on this charge) and as soon as it got to 20% it began to crash.

Black bars on wallpaper,"I used to have a Google Pixel (the original). Soon after I upgraded to Pie, my wallpaper started reverting to a certain (stock) wallpaper every day or every time it restarted. After it did that [assuming I didn't change the wallpaper back], the next day or next time it restarted, there would be a black bar across the bottom of the wallpaper on the home screen. Then every day or restart, the black bar would cover more and more of the screen until the wallpaper was only visible at the very top. [If I tried to change it back to a different wallpaper, the process started over--wallpaper change the next day, black bar appears, then gets bigger, etc.]

When I got the Pixel 3, for the first 2 weeks, it worked perfectly. Yesterday when I woke up, the wallpaper had reverted to the stock wallpaper that was showing when I first got the phone (the pink sky with mountains at the bottom). I changed it back to a (stock) wallpaper. This morning when I woke up, the wallpaper is now a different stock wallpaper (that I've used before, but not the one I set yesterday), AND there is a black bar covering nearly all of the screen.

I don't have any wallpaper apps installed (except Zedge, but I don't use their wallpaper). I had not downloaded any new apps or installed anything the day this started.

1st Gen Google Pixel 128GB 2016 randomly forces shutdown when battery is under 50%,"We have the 2016 Google Pixel 128GB models. Once the battery drops below 50%, the phones will randomly shut down at any given time between 50% and 0% battery. We will plug the phones back into the charger, and after powering on, the batteries will show at up to 50% charge when plugged in, but will drop down to 3% / 2%/ 1% as soon as the cable is unplugged. We have to let the phones charge back to 100% for reliable function. 

We have tried everything that Google suggests, but we have not found any permanent fix if a phone is already experiencing the behavior. It seems the only thing that worked was to get a brand new replacement phone. But this issue took about a year or two of use to manifest, so who knows if a replacement phone is even a true solution at this point. 

Between my spouse and I, we have had this same issue with THREE different models of the 1st Gen Google Pixel 128GB 2016.

This issue would be easy to fix with a simple refurb replacement from Google, except they only offer a 1 year manufacturer warranty for a $750 product, and they won't accept responsibility for this major hardware defect...

Luckily my spouse paid for insurance with Verizon, so we received a replacement for her 1st phone that seems to be working OK so far.

I did not have insurance, so I bought an out-of-warranty refurbished unit and within a week it was displaying the same behavior. So I sent it back.

I took my original phone to the Google authorized 3rd party repair center to try a battery swap. Three days passed for a supposed 2 hour repair. I called to get a status update and they admitted that even after the battery was replaced with a brand new one, it was still randomly shutting down once battery was under 50%.

I asked the tech what next steps would be to fix the issue, and he said if they can't diagnose the issue, there's nothing else they can do and I would have to contact Google support. So here I am. But it seems that Google is not offering any real solutions to this issue. 

What we have tried per Google instructions:
- boot into safe mode
- factory reset
- replace chargers and cables
- request replacement device under Verizon extended warranty (only option working OK so far)
- replace battery via approved 3rd party
- contact Google support

The only solution offered by Google is to buy a new phone!?

We did not even finish making the monthly payments on my wife's phone before the issues began. We bought these phones brand new at launch for $750 each. Her insurance cost us another $350. I bought the refurb phone for $150. The battery replacement was $100. The replacement cables and chargers were another $40. So I have spent over $2000 on maintaining two Google Pixel phones that did not last 3 years, and are only 50% reliable. Terrible.

My phone has turned off during business calls, once in a lifetime family photos, time-sensitive moments of need, and many more unforgivable circumstances. I regret buying a Google Pixel phone because this power issue has been negatively affecting our daily quality of life for nearly a year now. 

I was a huge fan of the Google Pixel / Daydream / Fi line of products and I guess this is the price I paid as an early adopter. I will be going back to flip phones and a GPS because flagship phones are too expensive and risky when manufacturer warranty terms are shorter than their typical device payment plan terms. Only way this consumer exploitation will change is if the customers vote with their dollar and take their business somewhere else. 

I see this same hardware issue is affecting other Pixel models, even with latest gen releases. Shame on the Google Pixel team for poor communication and accountability for such a major hardware defect on multiple devices across a flagship product line.",Battery and Power

Could a system app update be causing battery problems?,"Ever since Beta 3 of the Android 10 Update, my phone's been shutting off early. It consistently shuts off around 30% However occasionally when using the camera app it also turns off as high as 70% 
So far I've tried several different ""fixes""
• Adjusting battery settings
• Looking for any apps using more battery than usual
• Using the phone in safe mode to see if it still shuts off early (it does)
• Factory Resetting the phone
• Downgrading the phone to Android 9

None of these permanently solved the problem BUT surprisingly downgrading to Android 9 did solve the problem for about a day. It went all the way down to 0. I didn't download any other apps but the problem consistently started again so I was wondering if maybe it's an update to the system apps that may be causing the problems.

I've read several articles about people with related issues and how it is probably related to an old battery. I'm not ruling that out as a possibility but seeing as the warranty time is up and it's not really feasible for me to get the battery replaced, I'm still searching for a solution on the off chance it isn't a hardware issue",Battery and Power

Pixel 2 XL Google Camera fatal error,"Steps I tried to resolve:

1.  I was receiving the fatal error when using the Google Camera app on Android Q Beta.

2.  Cleared the storage (data and cache) and it did not help. 

3.  Uninstalled the app updates and re-updated and it didn't help. 

4.  Restarted into safe mode and it still persisted.

5.  Downloaded another camera app to see if it was purely a software problem - had the same issue.

6.  Factory reset the phone and it did not resolve it.

7.  Opted out of the beta program thinking that may be the issue and factory reset as a result of the downgrade to Android P.  This also did not resolve my problem. 

8.  Repeated steps on Android Pie - no change

Note:  Both cameras on my Pixel 2 XL do not function.

Pixel 3a won't charge unless it is powered off,"-The phone is a replacement for her original Pixel 3a that started shutting down constantly. We've had this phone for 2 weeks. 

-On 7/29/20 the phone stopped charging when plugged into the Pixel USB C charger that came with the original pixel 3a phone. 

Here is what I have done so far: 
1. Restart the phone. No help. The phone still does not recognize that it is plugged in. 

2. Boot to safe mode. No help. The phone still does not recognize that it is plugged in.
 3. Tried my pixel charger for the pixel 4xl. No help. The phone still does not recognize that it is plugged in. 

4. Turned off the phone and plugged it in to the charger. The phone charges just fine until I turn the phone back on. Then the phone no longer recognizes that it is plugged in. 

5. I read many forum postings that show similar issues. Tried to charge with a USB C to USB A cable. The phone charges slowly. This is not an acceptable solution. 

6. Turned on developer mode and checked ""usb preferences settings"". It is already set to ""this device"" as is suggested in several forums. This has not fixed the issue. 

7. Today the phone is now recognizing that it is plugged in when I put the cable in to charge with the pixel charger. It will cycle between charging and not charging every 1.5 seconds for about 1 minute. Then sometimes it starts to charge and sometimes it stops recognizing that it is plugged in. 

From this basic troubleshooting, I do not believe the problem is hardware since it will charge slowly via a USB C to USB A cable. It is definitely not the charger since both the charger that came with the Pixel 3a and my Pixel 4xl work on my 4xl without any trouble. I do not believe it is an app since safe mode did not help. 

I would rather not do another warranty phone since that was a disaster the first time (FedEx delivered my package to the wrong address and it took 6 hours and 2 weeks to resolve). 1:1 support seems to be a waste of time based on my experience. They are nice but not very knowledgeable or helpful. I'm feeling kind of stuck at this point.",Battery and Power

Very strange rapid battery percentage loss on Pixel 3XL,"Over the past 2 weeks or so, my Pixel 3XL has began to lose battery percentage incredibly fast. This was a very sudden onset, I've had no issues with my battery previously. It will drain to 10% in less than 3 hours of standby. Checking battery usage it says that no apps are draining power faster than normal. With normal use, my phone will go from 100% to 60% in about 30 minutes. The thing that is the most strange, however, is that it doesn't gradually drain -- It will suddenly drop to 20% and then 3% in literally seconds. It happens in safemode, too. I have noticed that it is much more likely to do this if I use Chrome or the camera app at all. I used my phone to record a 15 second video in the video app and it went from 70% to 3% all of a sudden. The most bizarre part of all is that it will stay at 3% for a very long time. The day it dropped to 3% when I used my camera, I put it in my pocket and didn't touch it again until I got home 2 hours later, assuming it would be dead based off the fact that it will lose battery in idle so quickly, but it hadn't drained any further. I used it for a couple of minutes and it then dropped to 1%. When I charge it (using an official charger) it charges way faster than normal, too. I can go from 1% to fully charged in around 30 minutes. Yesterday I used my phone at 1% for around an hour and a half and it didn't die. It appears that there's some strange bug with the battery percentage indicator, indicating that it's losing power faster than it actually is. That's all I can think of that accounts for the weird sudden decreases (there's no pattern to it, either, it's never the same percentage that it jumps to), it staying at low percentage for a very long time, the very rapid charging and the fact that Android says no app is pulling more battery than usual.",Battery and Power

"1st Gen Pixel Buds connect randomly, Now won't disconnect","And the drama that is Pixel Buds continues. 

1. My Pixel Buds will randomly connect to my phone while still in the case (from another room!) without notice. I'll be in the middle of a call and all of a sudden, the audio is directed to the Pixel Buds.  The case never moves, it's not charging, just randomly makes the connection to the headphones...which are still stored in the case.  

2. On the flip side of this, now I can't get them to disconnect from my phone without turning off Bluetooth entirely. I want to listen to music via the speaker on the phone, but because they're connected to the Pixel Buds, it's sending audio there. I've made sure the headphones are seated properly in the case (the magnet clicks), I've cleaned the charging contacts on both the buds and the case, I even cleaned the entire buds to make sure there wasn't anything preventing them from making contact...and nothing. Eventually, not making the connection in the case is going to be an issue for charging as well. 

This is my second set of Pixel Buds (first one had wires protruding from the bend in the cable) and they've never worked quite right. Anyone have any tips on how to prevent random connections when most inconvenient and then to kill the connection when trying to return to audio via the device?","Connectivity, Network, Bluetooth"

Unable to make SIP calls over WifI on Pixel 2 when Google Fi account is inactive,"I've recently got a new Pixel 4 so I've transferred my Google Fi account from my old Pixel 2 to the new Pixel 4. I now want to retask the old Pixel 2 and use it over my local WiFI network as a handset for making SIP calls via a local server; ie no access is needed to the cellular network. This is something I've done several times in the past with previous Google phones, using the regular phone app, but I can't get it to work on the Pixel 2.

When I try and place a call, specifying the option in ""Make calls with"" to ""Ask First"", the app asks me to ""Choose SIM for this call"" but both items on the list (the eSim and the SIP account) show as greyed out. Note if I re-enable Google Fi on the phone then both items show as enabled, and I can make the SIP calls, suggesting it's something to do with the eSim.

Note that the phone DOES receive SIP calls, so it is provisioned correctly to the server. Also If I return an incoming SIP call then, the outbound call goes through - presumably because the number to dial is unambiguously a SIP number (number@server.ip).

"Contacts is incorrectly adding a number to a contact, thereby causing problems","I have two contacts; let's call them Erica and Tom (not their real names).

Tom once sent me an email with Erica's number. Now, on the desktop, Contacts keeps suggesting that Erica's number is in fact Tom's even when I tell it to ""Dismiss"" the suggestion.

Fortunately, on the desktop, it's not a problem. My Contacts page continues to work correctly.

But.

On the Pixel 2, suddenly, it's a problem!

On Android (not on the desktop)…
The Contacts app on the Pixel keeps adding Erica's number to Tom's contact details, and Tom's number to Erica's details. If I view the details, there are the numbers. If I edit the details in order to remove the numbers, they aren't there, so I can't remove them!
I can find both Erica and Tom by scrolling down the alphabetical list in the Contacts app.
When I select Tom's details in the Contacts app, it shows him as having Erica's name (both forename and surname). When I edit his details, his name is actually correct.
When I select Erica's details in the Contacts app, her name is displayed correctly.
When I use the search bar to look for Tom, I don't find him at all.
But, when I use the search bar to look for Erica, I find both of Erica's and Tom's details merged together under Erica's name.
It goes further. In other apps, such as Google Messages or Signal, they show Tom as actually being Erica. You can imagine my confusion, and thankfully I realised this before sending the wrong person a message.
I have tried force-stopping Contacts, clearing its storage completely, and reloading.
I have tried Settings > Accounts > Google > Account sync > menu > Sync now.

Prevent calls from ringing through BlueTooth headset while on a call,"I have a Google Pixel 4.  When I'm on Bluetooth and in the midst of a phone call, it cuts the audio from the call and plays the phone notification ""Call From **NAME**"" - completely blocks out the conversation I'm in the middle of, for both me and the other party.  I have to cancel the call and then it connects back to the discussion.

This is incredibly distracting and frustrating - if I'm in the middle of a call, I don't want to be interrupted by another call.  A beep in the background, a vibration, or even give me a notice but let me still hear what the discussion is.

"Unable to maintain IP address connectivity to a non-internet-enabled, Wi-Fi hotspot","I have a development device which operates in Wi-Fi hotspot mode, but doesn't have an internet Gateway (this is by design). I connect to the device with my Pixel 1 in order to manage it via SSH. For maybe the past couple months, my Google Pixel running Android 9 shows the below behavior (phone gets a IP address via DHCP yet can't ping the connected hotspot's IP, 192.168.43.1). Another older Android phone (as well as my laptop), works fine as a client for the same hotspot.

Temporary workaround, I have to:
==========================================
'Forget' the development device's access point
Re-connect (re-typing password) to the access point
Wait several seconds until the ..Stay connected?` message appears and tap ""Yes""

Symptoms; Wi-Fi shows connected but:
==========================================
Can't SSH to the development device from the Pixel (using JuiceSSH)
Phone has an IP yet can't ping the development device (192.168.43.1)
Phone stays connected to the hotspot but status is:
              Wi-Fi has no internet access
      Tap for options

           ..and the below status appears in the Android swipe-down menu:

              This network has no internet access. Stay connected?

           If you tap ""Yes"" and _also_ check the box:

              Don't ask again for this network

           ..it's not clear what this actually does, if anything. A short time later, the hotspot is back to the same broken state. Additionally, the Stay connected?` option is not persistent (disappears when it feels like it) in the Android drop-down drawer.
Some time after using the temporary workaround, the hotspot is back to the same broken state

I can't imagine this is not a bug. What use-case is there to stay connected to an access point AND deny IP connectivity because there's no public internet access? If there's a health check being performed that fails and causes this, what is the check? HTTP GET to a Google server; ping to a DNS IP etc?

Edit: I ran a packet capture on the dev hotspot and saw DNS requests to connectivtycheck.gstatic.com which lead me to the below post. I tried the below steps and it is working currently (could be too soon to tell).

Pixel 3a sometimes crashes and suddenly restarts when using the flash on the camera. Any ideas why??,"I have a Pixel 3a that sometimes has an issue when using the flash on the camera that causes the phone to suddenly shut off/reboot. Usually, it's when I try to rapidly take multiple photos using the flash (within a couple seconds of each other), but it will sometimes have the problem even when just using the flash to take a single photo. To the best of my recollection, I have not changed any of the camera settings since I set the phone up, and the phone does not have any other issues. Everything else on the phone works properly and smoothly (other than the camera not focusing as quickly and accurately as it usually does; but this is not a big deal).

I don't want to have to do a factory reset, but is it possible that a factory rest might help to resolve this issue? Also, I have cleared the cache on the Camera app multiple times, but the problem with using the flash causing the phone to restart still happens sometimes.

I got the Pixel 3a as a gift and don't have the receipt and don't know that I could still get in contact with the person who originally bought it. Is it possible to try to get a Pixel phone fixed under warranty, if you don't have the original receipt to provide? Or, as I suspect, am I SOL when it comes to possibly being able to use the warranty (assuming that it's still active/valid)?

Issues with phone calls (voice and not on apps like WhatsApp),"Hi

Anyone experiencing continued problems with voice calls?

So the problem i'm getting is that when i'm using the phone in my office (and many other locations too) people can't hear me.  They complain that i'm either too quiet or in a tunnel, so i have to find a decent spot, don't move and shout to be heard.

But's it's not the network.  Am also having to use an old Samsung Galaxy S5 and it's as clear as anything, no issues.

I had a situation yesterday when a customer couldn't hear me on a normal voice call and we had to switch to a WhatsApp call, which was totally clear.

And it's not a one off Pixel 3 phone either.  Been in touch with support, who are all very friendly and help out but all i end up is going through various steps like updating the phone, go into safe mode and then reset the phone.  Still with no solution in site.

And so i've followed the next step of sending it back to them and getting a replacement.  Three times!  So i've had four Pixel 3s with exactly the same problem.

And today's offer by the support team, who promised to ""look at all the options available once we've gone through the process"", is to yet again offer another replacement.

I'm not sure when this will get resolved, if ever.  10 phones?  15 phones?  Or perhaps wait until it goes out of warranty and then it's not a Google problem any more.

Been told that as i bought it through a retailer, nothing else can be done.  Of course something else can be done (they make a few billion profits don't they?!?!) but that's the standard line i'm being fed.

I'm really not sure anyone can help but here goes a post anyway!

Disable ringtone/notifications through the device speaker when paired with Bluetooth headset,"My Pixel 2 will ring both the headset and my phone speaker on an incoming call.

I understand that some will want the device to ring in case you happen to not have the earbuds in, so there should be a setting somewhere, right? It seems there needs to be a setting for each type of sound (alarm, notification, call, etc.) to be ""This device"", ""Bluetooth speaker"", or ""Both"".

warranty replacement not compatible with carrier network,"I sent in my Pixel 2 for a warranty repair due to bulging battery on 8/31.  I received the replacement on 9/08.

Xfinity stated there is nothing they can do as the phone is not compatible with their network.  I contacted Google and I worked through all of the troubleshooting steps to no avail (lots of back and forth between google and xfinity support).  Google then directed me to resolve the issue with Verizon.  Google said the phone was a Verizon variant and Verizon should be able to fix the issue.  I don't even have a Verizon account.

Within minutes I was speaking with a level 2 representative (on the phone) as we tried to work through the issue.  I was impressed by the level of effort considering I do not even have an account with them.

Verizon confirmed the phone was not locked by them or any other carrier.  They too stated that the phone is not compatible with their network.  Back to Google...  The google rep finally offered to send a new phone, but I would have to wait an additional 5-10 business days to receive the replacement phone and no way to guarantee the second replacement would be compatible.  At this point I asked to escalate the issue.  The rep agreed and that ended the chat.  About 6 hours later I received a quick email from the supervisor.  I promptly responded and haven't heard back since.  That was yesterday.  I am now on day 11 without phone service and seemingly no closer to a resolution.  I can't get a response from the supervisor and no idea how long I am supposed to wait around.

LTE not working on Pixel 3XL using AT&T network after September 25th Android 10 update.,"2nd UPDATE: NOVEMBER 2019 UPDATE BROKE LTE AGAIN! Thankfully the same fix worked a second time, but my patience with Android has just about run out. 

UPDATE: FIXED
Thank you Charles Zhang for the solution that I have copied and pasted below...

""So I got my to switch back to LTE on AT&T, first check your ATT version if it is att_us-10000000055.2 this is version that seems to be locking everyone into 4G. 
You will need to clear your cache and data from Google Play Services, once that's done turn your phone on Airplane Mode and reboot. Turn off airplane mode and it should update to att_us 61.2 and show LTE after a few minutes""

ORIGINAL POST BELOW...



I understand all the workings of the phone and therefore have exhausted all routes to fix short of calling AT&T. The only mobile network options I have at this point is 4G and 3G.

"Pixel 3 phone mysteriously & suddenly dead. Does not charge, doesn't power on.","My 9 month old Pixel 3 suddenly stopped working. It had neither been dropped nor was it exposed to moisture. No physical damage of any kind on it. Battery charge was last somewhere between 60% - 50%. I used the phone for a call then about 10 minutes after my conversation ended, while the phone was sitting idle on my desk, the screen went black. I plugged in the charger (original Google) but it had no effect. With the assistance of Google support, I went through the 30 second power button hold and the power - volume down hold; still nothing. Ultimately an RMA had to be created for a warranty replacement. The person I spoke with at Google support (Mara) was great. She was understanding and helpful.

My concerns are with the overall Google warranty process:
1) Why is it going to take 5 days for my replacement phone to arrive?
(RMA created on 12/12, phone shipped on 12/13, FedEx shows it will arrive by end of day on 12/17)
2) The replacement phone is a refurbished item, yet the hold Google placed on my credit card is the full retail price for a new phone.
3) Is this a lesson learned for customers not to deal with a 100% online retailer? In this day and age I would expect that a warranty replacement cell phone should be shipped such that it arrives next day or at worst two days after the RMA is created, not 5-days after.",Battery and Power

You will need to find the optimal setting for your home network. Mine on Spectrum Cable has a default 1500.

Pixel 3 Only Works With Charger In,"Hi,

My Pixel 3's battery died while I was using it. I charged it using the original charger, in a wall socket, as I've done for the past couple years. I left it to charge for an hour or so but when I tried to switch it on, there was no response. I couldn't even boot it into fast mode.
The only way I could get it to switch on is to use a third-party charger but as soon as I remove the charger, the phone goes off.
If I power off the phone while this charger is in, it boots itself up again as if the power button is being held down. 
If I use the original charger, the phone does not work; it'll flash the 'battery with a lightning bolt' symbol repeatedly and if I try to switch it on, the Google logo appears but then it crashes. 
If no charger is in, there is absolutely no response from the phone. 
I tried booting the phone into safe mode but this the problem still persists. 

Currently, the only why I can use my Pixel 3 is to have it on charge using the third-party charger. It works exactly as it used to but it's really taking the 'mobile' part out of mobile phone.

Pixel 3 continously restarting (unless charging),"Morning all.
I have a Pixel 3 and since last night it is just continuously restarting itself. It then begins to feel hot. 
The only thing that seems to stop it doing this is if I plug it into the charger. 
When it is not plugged in, it just keeps showing the screen as if I'd held down the power button and then restarting. 
I have no case on it now and have tried starting in safe mode but to no avail.

Camera quality on new Pixel 3a XL worse than my Pixel 2 XL,"I just purchased the Pixel 3a XL 3 weeks ago to replace my 2 XL and the photo quality is worse compared to it, is this normal? Everything I read online touted the superiority of the 3 camera and that they were the same ones being used in the 3a, but I was never disappointed in my 2's camera and love using it. These pics on the 3a are consistently slightly blurry and lacking in detail... I've tried all the troubleshooting options for fixing camera focus but it's not as if *where* the camera focuses is the issue--it's that the spot it is focused on is never as sharp as it was on the 2. Cleared cache, tried safe mode, etc. Quality still sucks.

Unfortunately I was 2 days too late to just return it otherwise I would've had the crack in my 2's screen repaired and kept using that. Now I'm not sure if this is something I should send the phone in to have fixed under the warranty, or if I failed to understand some aspect of the 3a's camera that would explain the poor quality and I've just wasted several hundred bucks?

I've taken several dozen side-by-side comparison shots and attached one to explain what I'm talking about. Obviously the 3a's is an 'acceptable' photograph and would've been great a decade ago, but it clearly looks like a downgrade in quality to me.

Google Pixel 3 XL faulty camera,"I'm having an odd problem with my Pixel 3 XL. More precisely with the device's camera. The camera works perfectly fine when it is functional, only problem is that it is functional around 40% of the time. It seems that at random moments, the camera simply stops working or doesn't turn on anymore. In fact, it leaves me on a black screen and the app crashes after a few seconds. When using an app that uses he camera (e.g. Snapchat) the app will show a message saying that it can not open the camera. Often times, the camera will be working just fine until I switch from front facing to back facing, then it will freeze, turn to black, and not be functional for an unknown period of time.

 I tried fiddling around with it to understand the problem,  and sometimes I need to switch from front to back a couple of times until it stops working. I also tried restarting the device many times and it seems to temporarily fix the problem until the camera stops working again. Factory reset had the same effect. 

Another thing I noticed is that whenever the camera is in its ""dead"" state, I can't turn the flashlight on either (the button is greyed out), which leads me to believe that it is a hardware issue? But when the camera works it looks absolutely perfect which means it might be a software issue?

Pixel 2 gps accuracy in europe (GALILEO). Could it be improved? (comparison vs Pixel 4),"Hi All 

I'm user of a Pixel 2 and Pixel 4. 

I noticed that the Pixel 4 is very accurate (regarding the compass direction) in Europe old towns (like in Barcelona old quarters with very narrow streets).

This is the first phone that gives me a good accuracy here (at least so far). 
Compass is always 80-100% pointing in the right direction.

I decided to compare Pixel 2 vs Pixel 4 and I noticed the following:

When opening ""GPSTest"" app in the Pixel 2, only 1 default GALILEO Satellite appears. And then the phone basically stays with 1-2 satellites, but it struggles to find them. 

When opening ""GPSTest"" app in Pixel 4, more than 4-5 GALILEO Satellites appear right after launching the app. And then a few more might appear, but that probably is not that required.

And finally: I also noticed that if I put Pixel 4 close to my Pixel 2 while the app is open, the Pixel 2 start to catch a lot of more galileo sattelites (Like if the Pixel 4 was enhancing the Pixel 2) --> Anyway, this last case,is weird, but I tried it two times only, maybe I need to try it more times, to confirm is not a placebo. (But the Pixel 2 didn't seem to catch lot of european sattelites by its own, without the Pixel 4 doing the same).

Now my main question about all this topic is: 

Is it possible to add more gallileo sattelites to the Pixel 2 configuration? Perhaps this improves the bad the GPS accuracy in some european places? 
I think the Pixel 2 is missing some sattelites in some config file. Could be possible to increase the initial satellite count from 0/29 to 0/37 like the Pixel 4? 

I'm just trying to know if it's possible to improve the GPS accuracy in Europe with the Pixel 2. 

Here we have some screenshots. 


Pixel 2 (when app starts, only 1 European satellite - so 0/29 instead 0/37):

Unacceptable Customer Service - Swollen Battery on my Pixel 3 XL,"So the battery on my Google Pixel 3 XL has now swollen over the past two days to the point of looking like it’s ready to explode. I tried to contact customer support and found the only option available is a web chat service, where someone reads/types from a preset script.  After spending hours typing back and forth, I’m told to reset the phone back to factory original specs and send it to them.  They then might return me back a reconditioned phone in about two or three weeks from when they receive the phone.

This is completely unacceptable.  First of all, why can’t I actually speak with a customer service agent.  Requiring me to speak with customer support agents via a web chat app is ridiculous.  What would have taken five minutes to resolve via phone call, took hours and in the end you now have a very frustrated customer. 

Second, being told I’m supposed to go without a cell phone for upwards of a month, in hopes of getting back a reconditioned phone is unacceptable.  Since this is a manufacturing defect, I should have been directed back to the store where the phone was purchased (Verizon) so I could exchange the phone for a credit toward a brand new phone.

Pixel 5 wireless charging bug,"I know there have been a number of reports of issues with Pixel wireless charging or maybe issues with Android 11, in general. But, I haven't seen a report of my specific symptoms so I thought I'd add them.

A lot of the time wireless charging seems to work well on the multiple Qi chargers I have around the house. All support Qi EPP at up to 15W with a 25W QC adapter, or ""12-13W"" with the QC 2.0 adapter curiously supplied with the charger.

Occasionally though, for seemingly no good reason charging will rapidly grind to a halt, for example saying that the phone is at x% (50, 60, 80, 90 - it doesn't seem specific to a particular battery level), with an estimated many, many hours to completion eg. 13 hours. Even rebooting the phone or moving it to another charger does not seem to fix it. The back of the phone in this situation is kinda warm, so maybe it has thermally throttled. But, there is no good reason why this would have happened - the phone is not being heavily used at the time, it is not in a hot location, really nothing is different to the other times when charging works perfectly.

Using a tool to look at the battery the charging power has dropped to 0.2-0.5W, which explains the long charging time! The battery temperature is shown at about 38C. I'm unaware of what temperature thermal throttling should occur.

So, it seems, at times the Pixel 5 (and other Android 11 phones?) seems to just about shut down wireless charging, even in circumstances of use and location, when this should not be necessary. It may possibly be caused by overheating. I guess this could be caused by one or more processors being stuck in a high power state.

Hopefully, this may help in identifying the issue.",Battery and Power

As if it were a standalone router. To reframe that for example I'd like to connect my Nintendo switch to my VPN protected Google hotspot which is connected to an unsecured wireless Wi-Fi network.

Pixel 4a Android11 BT intermittency during Wear OS watch setup,"I'm attempting to connect a Fossil Sport smartwatch to a Pixel 4a running Android11. During setup the phone pairs with the watch initially, but the setup stalls after the first cm or so of the progress bar and hangs and times out after several minutes.

I have done all the suggested remedies I can find (delete WearOS app, clear cache, reboot both devices, reset watch, etc) with no success. As a debug step, I also tried connecting the same watch to a MotoOne Hyper running Android10 which worked fine (no issues at all, completed the setup in about 5 mins).

Pixel 2 XL - Camera app crashes,"Hi
I have a Pixel 2 XL and I have been experiencing problems with my camera app.

I tried also cleaning the cash of the camera app
Rebooting the device many times
Closing and restarting the camera app.

VoWiFi calls abort (on Vodafone Germany),"Hi guys.

I have a Pixel 4 XL, and I'm on Vodafone Germany.

With my old Pixel 2, VoWiFi was rock-solid. Calls were never interrupted.

Since two weeks now, I have a Pixel 4 XL, and under the same circumstances calls abort all the time after 5-10 mins. It doesn't matter who I call (fixed or mobile network), or who calls me. It is definitely my VoWiFi.

For me it's hard to believe it's a network-side issue (with network I mean operator network), but I believe it must be an instability in the implementation of the Pixel 4 XL's VoWiFi client.

T-Mobile integration issues,"I recently bought a Pixel 4a 5G direct from Google, and installed my T-Mobile SIM card in it, under the impression it would be plug-and-play with the unlocked Pixel. I've experienced a bunch of network issues that I have not yet been able to rectify. This is my second attempt at asking for help. I'm speculating i may have some ignorance to the best way to utilize the Pixel on Tmobile. I have included a summery of the issue, as well as my T-Mobile debugging to date below:

Summary of issue(s): 
1. I don't seem to have to have reliable data/cellular connectivity (even after adding a new APN configuration per TMObile's recommendation) in places i would expect it; Denver CO, Salida CO, etc. 
2. I do not have the option to configure Wifi calling. How can I get access to wifi calling on the Pixel 4a 5G. Both google and TMobile documentation references selections that are not available in my OS.

TMobile service feedback: A call into TMobile support sent me to an APN configuration page, to build a custom network configuration. It is basically identical to the default Tmobile APN that came native. I still do not seem to pull 5g in the city. I often see an H+ next to the network icon top right. TMobile also mentioned that wifi calling is only supported if the Pixel is bought from Tmobile? Am i missing firmware? Do i need to buy the hardware from Tmobile? 

DeBug logic: My brother owns a 4a on Tmobile and does have access to Wifi calling. Both Google and TMobile say Wifi calling is obtainable on their websites, but i do not have any configuration options in my current Android OS.

Possible remedies: Do i need a new SIM card? Do I need to buy the hardware direct from TMobile (this is what i was told to obtain the Wifi calling feature). Do I have a defective Pixel?

Test if battery is at end of life?,"My battery suddenly went from lasting over a day to lasting less than 8 hours. It's getting old (Pixel 2 XL, I've had it for 2 1/2 years after buying it discounted because the Pixel 3 had come out).

Bug or Feature? Assistant triggers when I take pixel 2 xl out of my pocket even w/ max sqz setting,"I recently got a new Pixel 2XL under warranty. This new phone triggers Google assistant whenever I take the phone out from my pocket. I have been experimenting and observing this for a week now. I'm talking hours of obsession - including factory resets to experiment with fresh settings. I can (95% or more often) reproduce the problem with no fingerprints (to ensure I'm not accidentally hitting that sensor - but the problem exists with or without fingerprints) and Squeeze sensitivity at the max - but doesn't matter what the sensitivity is.

With the phone on and screen unlocked*, I can turn the phone off, turn it upside down, rest the top edge on of the now upside down phone on a table, with the back of the phone resting on my index finger (far away from the fingerprint sensor) and wait some time for the ambient display to turn off - basically simulating the phone being in my pocket. When the ambient display turns off, I gently hold the phone so as not to trigger the Active Edge, lift the phone up and hold it flat like you would when taking it our of the pocket. When the display turns on the Google assistant pops up.

Also, I am pretty sure this issue has something to do with the Always on ambient display, because if you turn it off in settings, then the screen won't wake when you take the phone out of your pocket and the assistant won't appear. If you do have ambient display on, simply picking it up from the table when it is ""ambient"" on will not trigger the assistant. It has to come out of your pocket - or simulated pocket as per above.

Lastly, prior to breaking my old phone I know I turned off Ambient display and did not use it the past year because at the time i did not like it. When I got this new one I thought I'd give it a try. So that is why ran into this issue.

*""the phone on and screen unlocked"" --- during my ""testing"" I noticed that if I did not start from this state, I could not reliably reproduce the problem. For example if the phone was off and flat on the table with the ambient display on, sometimes when I rested the top edge on the table to simulate being in my pocket and then lifted it, i could not trigger the assistant . . . but sometimes I could . So, i don't really know what the exact initial states needs to be to get assistant to trigger - it happens to me 95% or more of the time and I know I'm not accidentally triggering active edge.

:-) And if you read this far you probably think I'm crazy. Oh well, I hope someone can reproduce this issue too. If not then I'd have to guess my new phone is broken and send it back.again.",Google Assistant and Voice Actions

"Pixel 3 (not 3a) eSIM - No ""Add Carrier"" option provided","I am trying to understand why Google indicates ""Pixel 3 does support e-SIM functionality in select markets with select carriers""  and what that means. I have no issue with certain carriers not providing eSIM functionality for their OWN networks (certainly their prerogative). However if I have a Pixel 3 and I am willing to remove the physical SIM from my primary/original carrier, why does the unlocked Pixel 3 phone not allow me to add an eSIM from a DIFFERENT carrier?

Some details for context:
phone was purchased in Canada from Telus.
it is running Android version 10

I have done a fair bit of troubleshooting and at this point have likely exhausted the options and the 'Add Carrier' option (or '+') does not become available to me for any of the following:
Have removed the physical SIM
Have reset the the 'Wi-Fi, mobile & Bluetooth"" environment
Have invoked Developer mode
Have restarted the phone through various combinations of the above.
All with no success.

At this point I getting close to filing a complaint with the Canadian regulatory body for permitting Telus to limit the functionality of a device even when it is not connected to their network. This goes counter to the regulations here in Canada. However, Telus is stating to me that Google provided the phone with restricted functionality. So... is Google DELIBERATELY limiting users of UNLOCKED Pixel 3 phones with access to eSIM functionality?

Who can shed light on this?

How to recover data if unable to connect phone to computer or see them in the phone? Memory issue,"Dear Google (or any kind fellow human-being),
I had some issues with the built-in photo app (the pinwheel logo), namely it kept crashing while browsing photos. Therefore I tried to reinstall it through the play store. Then something super weird happened: all my photos and data seemed to have gone. They are still on my phone, somewhere, but my (Google?) applications can't detect them, so all the photos I've taken (camera as screenshots) just don't show up, I can't play music in the stock music player, nor take any new screenshots/photos.

When I try to take a photo (with the stock camera app) or screenshot (by holding the power and volume key) it just says the memory is full, but it's clearly lying, since I can go in through the file browser and see there's space left. Also, all my personal ring tones, sounds, etc, have been replaced by some super weird stock ones (I presume; maybe even hard-coded midi files, by the sound of it...). The weird thing is that all other apps seem to work normally and I can, for example, take and receive photos with other apps.

Since all the data is clearly all there, I wanted to connect to retrieve it, but I can't do that either. I went to the store to get professional help, but they said they couldn't connect to the device, although their computer did sense ""something"" was connected, but they didn't want to install new drivers and instead directed me to you.

So here I am: can you please help me connect my phone to a computer and then fix the problem with my stock apps? I was told by the store where I bought the phone it has been reported to happen because all the Google apps are connected with one another.

I really to get help with this asap, because it's really embarrassing. I'm a staunch supporter of Google over for example Huawei, because I trust Google more, so I really hope someone can help me with this.

Thank you very much in advance!

pixel 2 weak LTE signal,"Is anyone else experiencing decreased signal strength since March 1st update? My pixel 2, immediately after the update, started showing no connection. When this started, the display would show the LTE icon, full bars with an x underneath. After restarting the device it shows me on H+ or 3G connection. This is mostly happening at work, not sure if it happens at home as i switch to wifi as soon as I'm home. Before the update I had no network issues at work. Nothing has changed at work, in the same office. Signal strength is decent around town. 

I've been working with T-mobile for the past 2 weeks doing resets. T-mobile put in a ticket with their engineering team to check on issues in my area. I've replaced the SIM card. T-mo found no issues on their part and are still trying to work with me to find a resolution. 

I realize T-mo doesn't have the greatest signal inside buildings, but as I mentioned earlier i was having no issues until the latest update.

One weird thing that's happening, my phone will show LTE signal with full bars when i arrive to work but nothing loads, not even slowly. i have to restart my phone for it to switch to H+ or 3G.

Can I complete the factory reset on my Pixel 4 if the phone is unable to connect to my Wi-Fi?,"After installing a system update yesterday morning, my Pixel 4 stopped connecting to my WiFi.  I did all the troubleshooting and identified the problem was my phone. (Other devices are connected with no problem, and I took the phone to other locations where Wi-Fi is available and the same problem occurred.)
Multiple contacts with Google support led to a reset of my Wi-Fi and mobile connections, which unfortunately cut me off entirely from Google Fi and thus rendered my phone unworkable for calls/texts/mobile data via the network.  More contacts with Google support have led to repeated suggestions to do the same things which have not resolved the issue.
One suggestion was to to a factory reset, which I'm willing to do, but I'm concerned at the step that says to make sure you're connected to the internet.  Obviously I am not, since that prompted my service contact in the first place. 
Thus, my basic question: Can I do a factory reset if my phone is not not currently able to connect to an otherwise available Wi-Fi signal.?
I cannot believe how many repeated contacts I've had with Google support that have led me nowhere.  I've used both chat and email--no consistency and no resolution.","Connectivity, Network, Bluetooth"
Roaming data exhausted phone won't send texts,"I visit family and friends in a part of the US where my phone service coverage allows roaming data but that amount expires in about 24 to 48 hours. Because I visit them in a very wooded part of the country, my service only works when I'm in town around stores and businesses. The minute I'm driving between these little towns I have no coverage at all so letting people know I'm on my way or have been in an accident is a total crapshoot and is contingent on whether or not I happen to be close to a cell tower.

What's worse is when I'm at the place I'm staying, my ability to send and receive messages is also a crapshoot, especially with group texts. Now I've been having this issue for years and every time I'm up here I'll visit the community boards to try to figure out how can I fix this basic communication issue. Believe me I've read so many replies from the last 5 years of related topics and must have tried them all with little success. And usually I just give up and just use the land line.

This time around though I've found a workaround that seems to be a clumsily perfect solution and what I want to ask the community, is if any one else has had this issue, what they've done, and is this something that will be different with the Pixel 6 phone. And if you have had this issue, I'm offering my solution.

At home base I have my phone set to recognize the wifi here to nake and receive calls. It works for calls but not for texts or pictures. I've tried clearing up storage, clearing cache, switching between mobile data, tuning off the phone, nothing worked. Some times I'll send a text and never get a response. Other times I'll be sent a text that may take a while to get to me. What seems to happen is that the messages are sent to cell towers and because my roaming data is exhausted, that protocol prevents those texts from ever landing. One time I received a text that had been bouncing around the cell phone towers for close to 2 years. And I got that message when I was 350 miles away from where it was sent.

My workaround is this. When I'm at a house -or business that has WiFi, turn off mobile data altogether and turn on airplane mode. Connect to the local WiFi and use that exclusively. When I have to leave that comfort zone I turn off airplane mode and return to open WiFi and turn mobile data back on to get calls and directional data. So in other words if I can restrict all of my data to go through a local WiFi source exclusively, everything work fine. I just have to go into Lisa Douglas mode ala Green Acres to get it to work.","Connectivity, Network, Bluetooth"
