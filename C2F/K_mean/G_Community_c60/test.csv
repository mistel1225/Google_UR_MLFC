why is t-mobile telling me my unlocked pixel 3a is not compatible with their network?,"For over a year I used my pixel 3a (that I bought from Amazon as unlocked and able to work with any carrier) with Sprint.  Now Sprint users are migrating to T-mobile.  When I tried to get a new sim at the Sprint/T-mobile store, they told me my phone is not compatible with their network and I would have to buy a new phone soon.  My phone has an esim right now.  I have talked to Sprint tech support and T-Mobile tech support.  Both have told me, after being transferred to several techs, that a pixel 3a phone is not compatible with T-mobile even though they sell pixel 4a phones.  So I contacted Google support.  They tell me my phone will work with any carrier.  As per their instructions I have refreshed the sim and reset the mobile network.  What could be the problem?  Is it the esim?  I really like this phone and planned on keeping it for at least 2 more years.  Why is T-mobile insisting it is not compatible?","Connectivity, Network, Bluetooth"
What sites are used on a Pixel when undertaking the internet connection test on a WiFi Service,"We have a captive portal on the business network that users must authenticate to before gaining access to the internet.  The Android phones will connect to the WiFi no problems but then advise there is no internet on that connection as they cannot access the internet as they have not authenticated via the captive portal.
I assume the Pixel handset undertakes a test to specific sites to see if there is internet access, i am trying to find out what they are so we can allow them through the firewall so the phone then thinks it has a connection and then will bring up the captive portal.","Connectivity, Network, Bluetooth"

Set Important Contacts to always RING your phone even if device set to vibrate,"My girlfriend is literally going to force me to get an iPhone since Pixel 3 doesn't have this feature...

On iPhone, there is a setting to make it so that when select contacts call you, the phone ALWAYS rings on loud. Even if the device is set to ""vibrate"" ""silent"" ""do not disturb"" or ""low volume.""

On Pixel 3, there is only the option to make it so that if your phone is on ""do not disturb"" your Favorite contacts calling will still make the phone ring. Useful for if you're going to sleep maybe, or in a meeting.

HOWEVER, very often I leave my phone on vibrate or low volume. Sometimes though, you miss a call when you don't feel it vibrating, or its laying on a desk where the vibration can't be felt and you're away from table. Or being on a low volume can be too low for you to hear phone if you're somewhere noisy. Even if most of the time (like 80-90% you catch the call, there's 10-20% of time where you miss it because it wasn't ringing on loud when a particular person, ie: girlfriend, called).

This means that occasionally, I miss calls from my girlfriend, and she gets pissed. I'd imagine a good number of other girlfriends/wives may also face this issue of not having their calls to their men sound a loud alert so guys never miss the call...

iPhone has this ""girlfriend/wife mode"" feature, please replicate it on Pixel. Otherwise I can't get Pixel 4 and have to switch to an iPhone...

I already checked app store for an app to do this. There doesn't seem to be anything and I think new Android software blocks these types of app's permissions.","Contacts, Calls, Voicemail"

"Pixel 2 won't switch automatically between wireless networks, have to do it manually","I have two networks in my house -- the main router and an extension. The extension has a strong signal in my home office, and the main has a strong signal in my bedroom. No matter how long I wait or what settings I try, it doesn't switch automatically to the stronger network when I have moved from one area to the other. 

Both are remembered networks, and both get pretty weak when I'm at the other end of the house, so my phone will be slow and have trouble loading stuff...

Is there a way to get my phone to seek the strongest network automatically?

I found Google Pixel 3 XL eSIM card flaw and contact google support and nobody care,"In conclusion: Pixel 3 xl eSIM card function has a flaw and can't work as physical SIM card.

About two months ago, I switched to Sprint. Because pixel 3 xl support eSIM card, I download the eSIM card and active the service. Everything looks good. Until I use WellsFargo app in a ATM, I can't log in this app. I made sure signal is great, other apps including Youtube was working fast excep WellsFargo. First time I was mad with WellsFargo. I though WellsFargo's server was down.
Soon after, I found App Line also didn't work in cell data connection.
Then, again, I found if I use wifi, wellsfargo app works great. When I switch data, it never works.
I call Sprint many times to figure out what problems. Sprint can't find anything.

After two months' all kind of try, I know problem should be in the phone itself. Then I noticed I used eSIM card. This is the only different when I switched to Sprint. Then I looked for pixel phone support. Not surprised, like before, they insisted they are everything great. I need to talk to every app company to find the app problems. Google is always disappointed me every time now.

Finally, I asked Sprint to send me a physical SIM card. I just got it and put it on. All problems go away.

I noticed that when using a headset (headphones), the interlocutor’s echo disappears and he hears me perfectly. All is well and when using ""loudspeaker"". The interlocutor echoes only when I communicate by attaching my Google pixel 2 to my ear.

Google Connectivity Service used almost a gig of data on my last cycle. Is this normal?,"My data usage was much higher this month due to just starting to drive for Lyft. Top data usage was 1. Spotify: 2.20gb, 2. Lyft Driver: 1.01gb, and 3. Google Connectivity Services:700mb.

Spotify usage makes sense. Lyft Driver makes sense - if they are disregarding my downloaded Google map of the city I drive in, even though their map is supposed to be an integration of Google Maps. 

However, Google Connectivity Services seems a bit high to me, and I don't know what's making it so high, yet nowhere near the others in quantity. The only thing close is messenger, at 693mb, from sharing photos. It seems like, as a VPN service provided by Google that we might not get charged data for using it. it also seems like if it is protecting us all the time the data usage would be much higher, since there are apps on the list that have used more data.

Can anyone help explain this?","Connectivity, Network, Bluetooth"

Pixel 5 Visual Voicemail not working on Telstra (Australia),"After a few weeks of having the Pixel 5, I've only just realised that my voicemail has gone from being delivered as an audio file into Messages on my Pixel 4XL to now getting a text from my carrier (Telstra - Australia) asking me to call their voicemail number (101) to retrieve my voicemail manually.

After scouring Telstra's support site, there was a lot of conjecture about RCS and it not working and being a cause / contributing factor to Visual Voicemail also not working. It appears this has now been fixed by the rollout of ""Chat features from Google provided by Jibe Mobile"". 

However this has left the Visual Voicemail in limbo as Telstra is saying that as they are no longer supported by Google to provide the RCS from their end, they can't offer visual voicemail anymore.

Looking for a Call Blocker solution for my Pixel 3,"When I got my first Android Smartphone I installed a program called Call Control to block known spammers callers in their database and to block calls I add to my black list.  The app worked pretty good on older phones but on my Pixel 3 not so good.  To block calls on your phone Call Control requires that it be the default dialer.  With the integration of contacts and voicemail withing the default Google dialer I want it to be the default which makes call control pretty much worthless.  Is there a call blocker that doesn't require that it be the default dialer that works well on the Pixel 3?  If there is none that will block the call outright, is there an app that will at least identify known spammers as the call comes in so you can disregard the call and then blacklisted yourself?  I was hoping that Verizon's call blocking app would work but when I go out to the store the app doesn't even show up to download and I've been told it doesn't even work with the Pixel 3 that's why it's not available to download from the store.

If anyone has any idea's or solutions let me know.  Thanks.","Contacts, Calls, Voicemail"

I am a visually impaired user and on a fixed income so I have to stick with my current plan but can not get the one phone I truly want.

Pixel 3xl battery swelling and backing is separating,"Back a few months ago my nfc stopped working, didn't think anything of it until a couple months later I noticed that my phone was no longer even with the top of the case I had it in.

"Pixel 3a Bluetooth car connection not supporting ""phone calls""","I am encountering an issue with Bluetooth connectivity on my car.

When the Pixel 3a initially auto-connects to the car, the car is able to see call and SMS history. However, in the phone's BT settings, the ""phone calls"" option does not appear.

If I disable and then re-enable BT, the ""phone calls"" option appears in the settings and the car's phone operations work as expected.

Alarm routine misbehaves after Android 11 update.,"I am one of the people who ran into all sorts of trouble after the recent update to Android 11. The biggest issue is with the touchscreen that is oversensitive now and results in a million of fathom presses per minute. That aside, I just noticed another quirky thing today. 
In the morning, when the alarm goes off, it automatically triggers a routine of providing details on the day's tasks, weather, and alike, and then it starts playing news. All worked fine until the update. Today, the routine started as usual, but when it came to news, the management window for it (pause, fast forward, etc) just didn't appear in the notification area at all! There it was, Google Assistant's voice reading news with no possibility whatsoever to control it. I have around 30 news sources going that way, which results in literally hours of news, and usually I just stop 15-25 minutes into it from the above-mentioned management panel in the notification area. As the window seems missing now, I just had to restart the phone to shut up those news. Anyone else with the same issue?

P.S. General afterthought on the update. I found myself to be a die-hard fan of clean Android and Google recently, and I've been recommending all my friends to switch to Android. Now this update came, and it has so many bugs that frankly left me shocked. It feels like a throwback into nightmares of 2010s, when Android on third-manufacturer devices was so buggy it was barely usable.  Clean Android is awesome for everyday use, but I only now realized it's the first major update I received since my romance with Google's devices. And no, it's no better than those old days when an update would introduce more bugs than good features. Really, Google? You disappointed me so much that I started to think about switching to iPhone instead - and that comes from a person who is never ever said one good word about Apple in her entire life. Heck, I was given a free iPhone X twice in the last 6 months, and both times I ended up giving it up after 2 weeks and buying Pixels (3a and now 4a) instead. 
Yeah, I know Google is going to fix these bugs soon, but just the general attitude of pushing an update that is half-baked and making customers struggle for several days is what makes me think about my choice of phones for the future. With Apple, I won't enjoy the simplicity and customization Android has to offer, but I won't struggle after each update either. If the entire selling point of Pixels is just how simpler they make our lives, then sorry, it ain't it.",Google Assistant and Voice Actions
"How do I get my Pixel 4 XL, which is only showing a battery with a question mark, to turn on?","I was using the phone regularly yesterday when I noticed a bit of a delayed/ jerky response in the system UI.

Pixel 5 wireless charging has suddenly become extremely slow,"I have had a Pixel 5 since December 2020. It’s worked very well and I’ve had no issues with it. However, wireless charging has suddenly become extremely slow. I use a Pixel Stand at my computer desk and a 3rd party wireless charger bedside and charging at both locations has slowed down significantly. However, direct USB-C charging is as fast as ever.

I’m not sure what has caused this slow wireless charging all of a sudden. I’ve done everything to troubleshoot. I have removed the thin phone case to try again (previous, there was no issues with leaving the case on) and have also rebooted the phone twice. I’ve called Google support and they are less than helpful. They just give me very generic steps to try.

I believe this change in wireless charging behaviour came about after the May 2021 security update. However, I admit that this problem might date back a couple of months. Since a couple of months ago, I sometimes wake up in the morning and take my phone off the bedside wireless charger and noticed it was not at 100%. This was intermittent behaviour and I had attributed to possibly not having my Pixel 5 aligned properly overnight. But since the May update, it seems like it is a constant behaviour.

Feature request: bring back the suggested apps/search bar/app drawer access on the recents screen.,"A lot of Pixel people (including myself) absolutely loved the feature in Android 10 of having suggested apps, a search bar and access to the app drawer from anywhere, as they were present on the recents screen. 

Personally, I really like the suggested apps because they were really accurate. These kind of AI features is the main reason why I bought a Pixel (and why people love Pixel phones - because of their unique AI features which other phones don't have). Having the app suggestions only on the dock now seems like a step back. Also, losing access to the search bar and app drawer from anywhere were really handy features, especially seeing how much space there is on the bottom of the recents screen, where now you can only find a ""screenshot"" and ""select"" button. 

Some sources which prove that people loved the feature:
- AndroidPolice post about the introduction of dynamic app suggestions on the home screen, top upvoted comments:
""What they should really add (back) is app suggestions to recents"" 
""I really hope they add these suggestions back to the recents menu; that's where I find them useful.""
""It saves me from having to swipe up the app drawer because the app I want to open is probably already going to be suggested at the bottom. I can't believe they removed that and for what, a screenshot button.""

- Reddit post about introduction of Android 11, top upvoted comments:
""I'm not a big fan of the change to the recent apps menu. The view seems a lot more clunky now that you can no longer use the Google search bar, click on a suggested app or go to your app drawer."" 
""The search and suggested apps in the recent apps menu was one of my most used features. Really hating that those are gone.
""Suggested apps as an option on all my home screens seems like a step back."" 
""Oh god, the bottom bit for the launcher is actually gone? I've been so accustomed to tapping the suggestions (because they're that good) that I don't even scroll through the previous apps anymore.""
""Damn I wouldn't have updated if I'd known 😖 What a dumb change. Hopefully they add an option to get these features back""

Also on 9to5google's Android 11 feature overview, they are mainly talking about losing this feature:
- ""RIP overview suggestions. Used it daily.""
- ""You can turn it off in Home settings luckily. I love suggested apps but didn't like them on the home screen""

Pixel 4XL Charges wirelessly to 100% and then stops charging and discharges on Pixel Stand.,"Recently purchased a Pixel 4xl last month along with a pixel stand. Over the past two days I've noticed the pixel will charge to 100% while on the stand and then stops charging and starts discharging while still on the stand. I do not have a case on it. The pixel will show it's charging wirelessly until it reaches 100% and then shows ""not charging"" and then appears to discharge as if not on the stand at all. Pixel stand features such as the photo show continue to work which drains the battery even faster. I'm not sure if it has anything to do with the update released recently or if that's just a coincidence, because it did start around the same time i updated the Pixel to June's update. I'm waking up now to a phone at 60% battery. Does anyone have any ideas or is anyone experiencing this as well?

I have a WiFi not working issue with my Pixel 4.,The WiFi on my Pixel 4 will randomly stop working. I have tried all the fixes I can find on the internet with no success. I factory reset my phone and that worked for a few hours but im not going to constantly factory reset my phone all the time . So I started experimenting with my own fix. I finally found a fix that works every time and uncovered a manufacturing defect in the proccess. When my WiFi stops working I will shut the phone off and place an icepack on it for approximately 3 to 5 minutes. then turn the phone on and the WiFi works again every time. It will work for about 2 days and then I have to do it again. This leads me to believe it is a manufacturing defect. most likely a solder connection that gets just hot enough that the connection separates causing a loss of WiFi. Im curious if anyone else is having a WiFi issue and if they try this fix with an ice pack and if that works for them also.,"Connectivity, Network, Bluetooth"

Camera Pixel 4,"Compared to the Pixel 3, the fourth family has only one selfie camera and autofocus has been removed from it, this is a minus, why remove it, what works better?  The question is open!  Everyone puts ultra-wide-angle cameras on smartphones, but Google thinks that zoom is more important to users - that's why the Pixel 4 just has a dual camera with the zoom that Apple has had since 2016, although Google insisted that they did not need a second camera for optical zoom, each  year they contradict themselves.  Next year, they will add a third ultra-wide camera and a self-focusing camera with autofocus.  Maybe the main camera in Pixel 4 is very good and it is slightly better than in the previous generation, but it would have been earlier if Apple had not worked out its deep fusion and night mode as it should on iPhone 11, in pixel 4 there is no such separation from competitors as  was earlier in comparison with pixel 2-3 versions, competitors worked out software algorithms.  The video, as it was 4K 30 frames, remained, the competitors already have 4K 60 frames on the front camera, but what the hell is Google?  put another sensor that can record 4K video 60 frames, purely for video, if the IMX 363 is so good for the photo part, leave it too, there is only two cameras in the back, and on the front, put the sensor up to 4K 60 frames, the prices are almost the same  same as Apple, but in the aggregate and in general worse!",Camera

Does Live Caption on 4a during phone CALLs needs Android 11 ? (Not 10 as shipped)?,"I just unboxed an unlocked 4a (from BBuy) for my almost deaf mother just for the ability for her to use Live Caption during a phone call.

But the caption never shows up during a phone call.  I have it enabled and I see the Live Caption on/off selection (below the volume up/down slider when volume buttons are pressed).  Note that it works for other video content but not on phone calls.  I am not using a headphone or bluetooth speaker just plain handheld phone call not on speaker (think: deaf person!).

Long story short, I received the phone on 9/24/20 and followed all the steps to insert SIM, connect to WiFi, copy content from my old phone via cable, let it update all my apps, etc.  
It is running Android 10.   

So I just wondered if this possibly needed Android 11 to work, and since my phone said an update was available... I updated 11 and NOW IT WORKS!  

Is Android 11 stable?  If so why didn't Google release the 4a with it on it?
This phone will be sent to my 92 year old mother with no tech support and no T-Mobile store even if she had one nearby.  She needs a reliable phone so should I wait and not buy it yet?

NOTE added: After I wrote this I have learned that Google only released Android 11 on Pixel a couple of weeks ago... so these phones have probably been in the supplier pipeline so still have 10 on them.

When I plug it in, if I immediately turn it back on it shows the last percentage that it was at (like the 20% it just shut off at, about 10 minutes ago).  It charges fine, but I'm nervous to use it when the battery gets low because I can't trust if I actually have 100% of my power.

Phone Number Marked as Suspected SPAM,"We have a contact center that calls users on an opt-in basis.  In the new OS there is a feature to mark calls as SPAM and we've noticed that our calls from this number are being marked as ""Suspected SPAM"".  We deliberately don't hide the number via CallerID so people can call back if required and these are legitimate calls.

From what we can gather this is a crowd sourced feature and that if enough users are marking a number as SPAM it is alerted for all.  Is there a way to provide a rebuttal to these calls being marked as SPAM?

Any help or guidance would be appreciated.","Contacts, Calls, Voicemail"

Incomplete mp3 transfer from s8 to new pixel 3 plus,"Recently purchased a Pixel 3 XL because, I'm sick of Samsung sloppy code and clumsy UI. I have thousands of mp3s on my Samsung's SD card.

When I access the SD card, for a split second you can see the missing titles but then they disappear, preventing me from selecting or transferring them. All of the music was purchased legitimately or ripped from CDs I personally own. DRM is not an issue here. So far I haven't been able to find any relevant help on my own in the forums.

Disable Contacts sync does not work,"I have found that with my Pixel 4XL (or maybe it's Android 10) disabling Contacts syncing NO LONGER WORKS! With my older Pixel 2 it did work, and I would manually trigger a Contacts or Calendar sync when I wanted to. I have checked and double-checked all the settings (see below)... but it still syncs without me triggering a sync.
The settings I make are as follows ... Via Settings -> Accounts At the bottom of the main accounts page, there is a toggle named ""Automatically sync data"" with the text ""Let apps sync data automatically"". If this ""Automatically sync data"" toggle is ON and you then select your GMail account, and press the ""Account sync"" button, you are able to edit the(Google) apps you don't want to auto-sync (i.e. turn sync OFF). I do this (I switch all Google apps to off), and return to my GMail account page. I then see ""Sync OFF for all items"" in grey text under the ""Account Sync"" button (my upper case for OFF above). I then go back up to a higher level .. that is back to the main accounts page. The toggle ""Automatically sync data"" is still ON of course, and the grey text under it says ""Let apps sync data automatically"". I don't want this to happen, so I now set this ""Automatically sync data"" toggle to OFF. Here's the problem: after making this last change (i.e. ""Automatically sync data"" toggle to OFF), when I select my GMail account again, I now see ""Sync ON for all items"" in grey text under the ""Account sync"" button(my upper case for ON above)!! This is completely contradictory! How can it be that after first disabling auto-sync on all the Google apps and then switching off ""Automatically sync data"" Google signals ""Sync on for all items"" ?!?
And here's the bigger problem: the above message is correct. Because if I leave the settings as above the Contacts does indeed continue periodically auto-syncing. (I know this because if I delete one of my contacts in the Google Contacts app in the cloud after a short period the same contacts on my phone disappear too! The ""short period"" can be anything from 3 to 30 hours).
I have tried removing my Google account and adding it again, but without success. It seems to me that this is either (a) a bug in the ""Automatically sync data"" implementation .. OR .. (b) a deliberate implementation to either check data or mislead users.
I have also tried all sorts of variations and checked Google account settings in the cloud too (not much there!), all to no avail. It seems I cannot now disable auto-syncing of Contacts ... If somebody thinks I'm missing something help would be appreciated?","Contacts, Calls, Voicemail"

Bluetooth connection to Volvo radio causes car radio reboot,"I frequently use Bluetooth from my Pixel 3 to connect to my 2015 Volvo S80.

Quality / Call Issues - other side cant hear me for the first 2-3 seconds,"Hey everyone,
I'd appreciate some help with this issue, because the Google Support team has not helped at all unfortunately:

The issue:
Every time I make a call or receive one - in the first few seconds of the call the other party/side can't hear me. I say ""Hey"", but they can't hear me. They say ""Hello?"", and I reply ""Hey!"", and only then we can start the conversation.

The Google Support solution:
I was told to try and turn on the phone in Safe Mode. Once I did, the issue seemed to have been resolved.
The CSR said this is probably due to an App that I have installed that's causing this, however - there is no way of knowing which. I have so many that it doesnt make sense to uninstall one-by-one and check if that helped or not.

My Solution (didn't work)
Factory Reset. Very annoying, as its a pain in the A**. I had to make sure that once I log in to my google account after the Reset - it doesnt re-install the apps automatically. I did some test calls and it seems to have worked for a while. so I thought the issue was fixed, so I installed all my important apps when I needed them.

After a while, I started experiencing the old issue again and again. No idea which app is causing it (if an app is even to blame, that is), or if it is and issue with the software of hardware. This SHOULD NOT HAPPEN in any case. Why does Google approve apps to its Google Play Store if they are (in theory) not compatible with the Google Phones or OS? 

I had the Nexus 6P before that and had call issues that were never resolved. I had hoped replacing it with the Pixel 3 would do the trick but it didnt. I am very frustrated and really like the Google phones, but I might not have a choice but to switch to and iPhone...  :(

Please prevent me from switching to and iPhone by helping my find a solution....
Thanks a lot in advance :)

My Microphone Doesn't Seem To Work Correctly,"Really not sure if this question is in the right place but here goes. I just got my Pixel a couple days ago and had downloaded Discord on it.

Call screening script is poorly phrased,"As soon as actual callers hear ""Hi, the person you are calling..."" they immediately hang up because it's phrased the same as a disconnected number message or generic voicemail, and uses a close approximation of the same voice.

Would it be possible to A) start the script with something else, like ""This is a screening service from Google..."" and B) use a voice that sounds less robotic/generic?

I've had exactly one person realize what was going on and actually have their call connected since this feature was deployed 2+ years ago, and numerous others with whom I needed to speak that hung up.

It's critical that the important part is front-loaded to avoid hang-ups:

Any way to fix bad rotation behavior on the app switching screen without disabling auto-rotate?,"This seems to be a problem whenever auto rotate is enabled.  By default the home-screen is landscape-only, which is fine and how I prefer it.  The issue is that this 'default' does not apply to the recent app view/app switcher.  

The way this behavior manifests is that if my phone is on a desk or other flat surface, it will be in portrait view in the home screen, but if I swipe up to get to the recent app view, there seems to be a 50/50 chance it will switch that specific view to landscape, turning everything 90 degrees and changing the direction needed to swipe to close etc.  

If you are holding the phone vertically in-front of you, its not an issue as obviously the sensor will indicate everything should remain portrait, but if it is on the desk you can't tell if the sensors feel it is technically 'portrait' or 'landscape' since its just laying flat there to begin with and you might as well flip a coin as to what orientation that the app switch screen will come up.

In prior versions of android that screen seemed to be 'informed' not just from the sensor but also what the orientation of the last 'view' or app you were in when you launched it.  i.e. if playing a game locked to landscape mode and opening that screen, it would still open landscape, even if the device was flat on a table and/or the 'sensor' last read was a portrait one.

In android 9 it seems like it always favors the sensor readings which is causing kind of random/guesswork behavior if the phone is set down and it means I kind of cringe every time I go to open the screen because I never know whether its going to sit there and then rotate 90 degrees on me or not.  So instead of a quick flick like the gesture is supposed to be its always a flick, sit there, wait, see if it turns, if it turns re-adjust my internal perspective and change all my swipe options by 90 degrees, or just try and pick the phone up off the desk to have it turn back etc, then swipe to the other/recent app I want. 

Either way it takes what used to be a half-second near-thoughtless navigation gesture and makes it a 4-5 second series of steps I need to focus/concentrate on.  Having the 'last seen' screens all be in their original orientation doesn't help matters because even if it switches to landscape view and navigation the apps will still 'look' portrait and its just the main phone status bar etc that will be visually rotated and serve as an indicator that the UI is now turned 90 degrees from what it was a half-second ago.

Basically instead of observing the orientation of the app (or home screen) that it is opening from, it is *always* subservient to the sensor data, which can disagree when the app is 'locking' the orientation (either portrait or landscape) and/or the sensor data is ambiguous (laying flat on a desk, so neither definitively portrait nor landscape) and that causes delays or directional ambiguity when they don't match and things start rotating in unexpected ways.",Homescreen and Launcher

There's a way to get around it  by going to taskbar then to settings, a choice to unlock the screen will popup taking you to settings and from then the call can be bubbled, But there has to be another way as I don't think this is an intended way to open the phone.

Able 2 receive text msgs w/ Wi-Fi & data turned OFF. Unable 2 receive msgs w/ WiFi+Airplane both on.,"I can send and receive text messages with both Wi-Fi and cellular data turned off (native ""messages"" app for Google Android Pie latest update). I cannot send or receive text messages when Wi-Fi is on and airplane mode is also on simultaneously. This could not be a more inconvenient setup for me. When I don't want to receive text messages or phone calls I have always turned off cellular data and Wi-Fi, but now I can receive these messages when I have nothing turned on. In addition I often leave airplane mode on and just use Wi-Fi so everything else is not using battery, but now I can't receive text messages or send them when airplane mode is on as well as Wi-Fi, this happened all of a sudden after the last Pie update or thereabouts. Every other app including my other texting apps work with airplane mode and Wi-Fi turned on. The only app that is having an issue is Google's native Messages app. 

This humongous bug has cost me tremendously financially because I've missed important business-related phone calls and I do plan to sue for monetary damages. I want compensation. Being able to receive text messages with Wi-Fi on is a basic right of buying an expensive phone and paying for service and this is a Google related issue as well as Verizon, you are both culpable.

This BUG also means that the network is connecting to my phone and using MY battery when I don't want it to EVEN WHEN I have turned the cellular data and WiFi off❕ I have definitely noticed that my battery has been draining significantly faster since I have been able to receive and send text messages with my cellular data and WiFi turned off❕

How to recreate when you connect to WiFi at home them leave home, or go underground and lose LTE service or drive through an area and lose service.


When you regain service the phone no longer attempts to connect to LTE it defaults to 3G.  


Once this starts to happen to you... It doesn't go away...


Only fix I've found works is 


Go to settings app
Go to network / internet
Go to mobile network
Go down to bottom
Click advanced
Click carrier settings on bottom

Click Update Device Config

This will take a few seconds then fix the issue.

Here's the catch... You will be doing this all day everyday anytime you leave LTE to WiFi or lack of service when you go back to mobile data the phone os will never attempt LTE only goes to 3G

Pixel 1 manual and auto focus aren't working,"Ok so, for unrelated reasons, a few years ago I had my first pixel replaced with a refurbished version.

The refurbished phone had issues with focusing within a month of using it.

By that point, I was out of warranty to get it fixed. Google support staff had me try everything including clear my cache, reinstall the camera app, use safe mode, factory reset, etc. None of those steps worked.

* Critical Point: A third party app called Open Camera allows you to manually control the camera focus. This is NOT automatic focus. It's manual. Manual focus on the third party app couldn't even adjust the focus. So the issue isn't the laser sensors. It's the camera itself.

What I want is simple: an acknowledgment that this phone has a fundamental fault with its camera that isn't a software issue.

For years, you guys have refused to acknowledge that it's a hardware problem, and have consistently insisted the problem is from software.

You guys wouldn't stand by your product or acknowledge it was faulty, and tried to get me to pay for repairs on a phone that was broken out of the box.

(The contacts app works very well [as it allows viewing contacts from individual accounts];  but the phone app merges all the disparate account contacts into one giant mess.) This isn't ideal.

I have tried removing one account, turning off sync, adding the account back, turning on airplane mode, turning sync back on and then turning off sync for contacts. But this does not work because the contacts are synced immediately when the account is added. Evidently there is no getting around this.

I have also tried clearing the cache and data for both the phone and contacts list. But this does not remove the synced contact data either.

The only effective solutions I've found are either, removing one of the google accounts or deleting contacts from one or the other account. Neither of these are good solutions.

Selfie mode is not working in Camera App or any app using the camera. 

Unless I use 'Playground' mode in the Camera App - it works fine then. Weird but makes me think it's purely software issue???

I have tried Safe Mode and deleted storage/cache. Really don't want to do a factory reset as I have work accounts linked to it which were not easy to get set up. Is there any other option?
On latest Android 11 version. No outstanding updates.
And, this was the same before I installed Android 11 so not related to that. 

Any suggestions?

Pixel 4a: is it possible to manage icon arrangement from a PC?,"Now that I have lots of app icons over a number of home screens I would like to re-arrange everything into an arrangement that suits the way I work with the phone.

Battery and texting issues,"Last night, I charged my Pixel as usual. I unplugged it around midnight when it was fully charged. When I woke up around six and a half or seven hours later, it was at 51% battery when it normally would have been around 95%. I had no apps open at the time. I charged it as fully as I could while getting ready, getting it to about 90%. The battery continued to drain at a much faster rate than normal, losing 1% about every six or seven minutes.
I'm not sure if this is related to the battery issue or not, but my phone resent a picture I sent to my friend (Message+ app, not the default Messages) twice, once at 2am while I was asleep and once at 7:36am. When the battery drain continued, I restarted my phone. My friend let me know that I had apparently texted her the same picture yet again, although it never showed up on my phone. I don't know if anyone has had the same kind of issue, mainly because I'm not sure how best to search for it, but I would appreciate any help with either/both of the issues.",Battery and Power

Pixel 2XL turns off when the screen is off. Odd charging and battery statistics,"Hello all,

My 2XL has performed flawlessly until this past week. It is now crashing and turning off throughout the day, but only when the screen is off. Sometimes it is able to sit idle, and others it powers off the second the screen also turns off. The battery level does not seem to be a factor as it has happened minutes off the charger at 100% and when below 20%. The phone was pre-ordered so it is 3 years old, the battery was replaced last November through Ubreakifix so it's only a year old.

Google support suggested safe moe, however that did not fix the issue.

As for the odd charging and battery statistics. Until today, when the phone would power off, it would not turn on unless charging, but that is no longer the case. When plugged in, it would initially quickly cycle between red, green, white charging icons before turning off with no led light. My battery statistics are saying that it has been 65 days since being at 100% but that's not true as I charged to full last night. The battery also seems to be draining abnormally fast despite no apps reporting high usage.

I intend to do a factory reset this weekend as I have run out of options. I found two users on the forum that described a similar issue but neither had helpful replies as one was under warranty and one was on beta.

Thank you for any and all help. My 2XL has been incredible and I was hoping to have a few more months with it.",Battery and Power

Notifications squished and not expanding properly in pull-down notification drawer,"In the last ~3 weeks (I think since the July 2020 security update) I've noticed my notification drawer (which you drag down with your fingers) is no longer expanding further than about 50% the height of the screen. Additionally, it no longer allows me to scroll the list of notifications within the drawer. As such, the notifications in the drawer are squished and some scroll off the bottom of the drawer and I cannot see them at all. See sample screenshots at the bottom of this message.

Normally, I would just use my fingers (have tried 1, 2, 3, 4 fingers) to expand the drawer down to the full height of the screen (and once it's full height, I used to be able to scroll the list of notifications independently) but now it just expands the shortcut buttons section (the top row of the open notification drawer) rather than the notifications section itself.

I've not changed any settings relating to the notification drawer, and in fact, I cannot even find any settings to customised the look/feel/layout of the notification draw so I believe it was a change made as part of an update rather than something I've changed.

I've also tested with my launcher (I use Nova Launcher Pro) and the default pixel launcher - the notification drawer doesn't change and works the same no matter which launcher I use so I don't think it's an issue with Nova Launcher.

"Pixel 4 XL no longer shows ""Charging rapidly""","My Pixel 4 XL is pretty new.  I bought it early Oct 2020.
In the Settings > Battery screen, it used to briefly show ""Charging rapidly"" when charging began.
It was just brief.  Then the estimated charging time would replace it, I recall.

It was useful info.
I could tell if the phone was plugged into a usb PD port.
Or the phone was on a good Qi wireless charger.

But since recently, I think since this recent Dec update, it no longer displays that.
Was that text string ""Charging rapidly"" removed by this update?
Or is my phone suddenly broken?

I just checked.  Right now at this very moment, I get that same ""59 min left until charged""  (pic above) regardless if I plug into the original Pixel 18W charger, or into an unpowered USB 2.0 port, or put the phone on a 15W Qi wireless charger.

USB-C jack headphones don't work during phone call,"Before few days ago, I was able to connect headphones/speakers through usb-c/jack adapter and make a phone call. My callers voice would be played via speaker, whereas my phone mic would capture my voice.

Recently, this stopped working. I am still able to listen to podcasts on the speakers, but once I make a call neither my caller hears me, neither I hear what he says. If I switch to internal phone speaker, then all works. The issue is problematic to me, as I used that setup in my car. Internal speaker is not loud enough to be comfortabily used while driving. 

This issue is reproducible also on a pixel 4 my friend has (so that's not my handset related). I also tried different usb-c/jack adapters (should not be adapter specific). Everytime we have the same problem. 

Additionally, I can make calls via Bluetooth headset (but can't use it while driving, as I wouldn't be able to hear the outside world at all).

I tried uninstalling updates to phone app and clearing it's data and cache. Got no improvements.

Low Volume/Audio when connected via bluetooth,"Ever since the January 1, 2018 patch the volume on my phone is much lower than it previously was when the phone was new. Especially in my car I now have to crank the volume up about 80% to get the same audio output I was getting in Oct-Dec at 55-60%.

Also watching video or playing any audio out of the phone speakers is now substantially lower. I know Google created some kind of patch to lessen a ""vibration"" issue people claimed to have but the speakers within the phone have a much lesser output as well. This is disappointing.

And let me save you some time, no it's not network settings. It's not the connected device, yes the volume is up at 100% on the phone, yes certain settings have been reset, yes the phone has been tested in safe mode, etc...

Holding the power button down for any length of time (I sat there for a few minutes) yields no response, same goes for power and volume keys, I tried up and down for the fun of it, again, no response in the slightest. Have also tried this while plugged in and while not plugged in.
The only thing close to a response i can get from it is when i plug this into my PC and it will make the usb detected sound, however the phone does not seem to appear anywhere on my PC.

Is there anything else I can try?

I've exhausted every option i can think of and the repairs option is currently not up for grabs. If I can find a fix without having to deal with Carefone Warehouse again I will be super happy.

If anyone has any hints at all it'd be much appreciated.

Thanks in advance.",Battery and Power

"Pixel 2XL restore is incomplete after reset. Missing messages, home screen layout","I had to perform a factory reset on my phone due to a system malfunction which rendered my phone unusable. This happened a few weeks ago and I was able to restore my phone completely to how it was before.
   However this time I went through the same process: logged into my account and selected the most recent Google Drive backup from a few days ago to restore. Except this time round there's lot of things missing. My home screen has returned to the default one, all my SMS are gone and a lot of my settings preferences are gone too. 
  This is intensely frustrating as I can see the backup I wanted still saved on the drive but i can't restore it properly.

Pixel II XL Bluetooth issues,"For the last 4 months, I have been having problems with my bluetooth connection from my Pixel II XL to my 2011 BMW 3 series.  I keep the operating system up to date and am currently on 9.  As odd as this sounds, I think that my phone corrupted my car's bluetooth system somehow in its two way communication.  My car first would drop the connection 10-30sec into playing a song with an unpleasant high pitch beep.  Then overnight, my car would forget all phones connected, including my wife's phone.  I had the car battery replaced, and had the whole communication system reprogrammed in the car.  But the issue was still there.  BMW is quoting $1,400 to replace the whole communication system;  but, I have a sneaky feeling that this will not fix the problem and that the phone has something to do with this.  As you can imagine, I do not want to spend $1,400 that I won't be able to get back, only to find out that there either is a problem with the phone or that the phone somehow corrupted the bluetooth in my car.  I tried all of the standard steps in the forum many times over.  Also, my phone pairs perfectly with my wife's 2016 BMW so I think it is a mismatch between the older car system and my Pixel II XL.","Connectivity, Network, Bluetooth"
Google Assistant is Doing Commands as Searches,"For the longest time, my Google Assistant has worked well. But recently, it's started doing my voice commands as searches instead of actually doing the command.

For instance, I would say ""Call Jane Doe"" and instead of calling that person that is in my contacts as it always has, it will do a Google Search for ""call Jane Doe"". When it first started doing this, I restarted my phone and it seemed to go back to working normally, but now it's doing it with increasing frequency, and restarting is not fixing the problem. I tried uninstalling the Google app (well, putting it back to its default state), and then re-downloading the updates for it, but that hasn't solved the issue either.

Any help would be appreciated.

For the record, here are the steps to my problem:
1. Squeeze phone to bring up Google Assistant
2. Say ""Call Jane Doe""
3. Google Assistant does a Google Search for ""call Jane Doe"" instead of actually calling Jane Doe from my contacts.",Google Assistant and Voice Actions

Pixel 4 XL WiFi not working after android 11 update even after factory reset.,"It's been several months since both of our Pixel 4 XL phones were upgraded to Android 11. I have tried everything including two factory resets, and WiFi still works only a few seconds at a time, even though phone says it's connected. Pages take several seconds to load or sometimes I have to turn WiFi on and off for it to work. Every other device in the house has absolutely no issues and our phones were fine until Android 11 was pushed out. Google has ignores this issue that is all over the internet as I assume they have no idea how to resolve.
I find this situation unacceptable and someone from Google needs to reach out to help resolve this situation or replace our phones. Otherwise this will be the last device that I will ever purchase from Google and currently my house is full of them.","Connectivity, Network, Bluetooth"

Kid's phone won't connect to wifi or mobile service; can't factory reset because of family link,"Two days ago my son's phone (Google Pixel 3a) stopped connecting to wifi; a few hours later we realized it was getting no service at all, and the settings app kept freezing up and crashing.

Original Pixel XL - Premature Shutdown - Battery Drain - Android 10,"I have an original Pixel XL, since 2017.  Use daily for work.  After the Android 10, the battery life was cut in half.  At the most I am getting approximately 2 hours of active use.  The battery under Android 9 would run approximately 4 to 5 hours of heavy use.

Recently, the phone started shutting down with between 20% and 30% of power still shown on the indicator.  After reading through the troubleshooting notes, I performed a hard reboot after I had charged the phone to 100%.  After the phone rebooted, the battery indicator showed 73% battery life.  I placed the phone on the charger and it charged another 25 min approx and reached 100 percent again.  Another hard reboot, and the phone still showed 100%.  If I use the phone under heavy use after the hard reboot, my battery life is closer to 4 hours again.  However, it seems there is an App or a setting under Android 10 that is affecting both the battery life and the accuracy of the battery indicator, because after some use, the phone will return to it's previous behavior and require another hard reboot.

I have two Pixel XL phones and these issues only started after the upgrade to Android 10.  I also own a Nexus 6, still going strong and recently purchased a Pixel 4 XL.

I am hoping that Google is paying attention to these posts and provides a fix for their original Pixel customers instead of leaving them hanging with a final update to Android 10 with inherent battery issues.

"Pixel 3 XL LTE Connection keeps restarting (RMA'd Device, New one resolved issue)","I'm hoping someone has seen this and knows the solution.
I have a Pixel 3XL, bought Nov.`18. Unit has a case, never dropped outside, it's in immaculate condition.
A few weeks ago, I noticed the LTE Connection would restart every 8 to 12 seconds (going from LTE - LTE+, back to LTE)
I did a ton of things (restarted device, safe mode, Factory Reset with stock setup (no backup) and even did a Factory Image restore of Android 10 from September)
Nothing has resolved this issue. The case has been removed, a different SIM Card was purchased.
Even when changing the connection to 3G, it changes from HSPA - to 3G every 10-15 seconds. I've disabled VoLTE and even used the phone after factory image restore, with a new google account (to make sure no settings were copied over from previous install). Checked APN settings, all good there. I've had every PIXEL phone on my carrier (Rogers, in Toronto) without any issues like this.
Wifi calling is Off/ phone updated to December Android 10 Build.

Video of LTE Connection:
https://streamable.com/zsylg

At this point, I am thinking hardware.
Does anyone have any insight into why this would just start randomly in November? I see others have had this issue without a real solution.. If a full factory image restore (from September, Android 10 build) won't resolve the issue, it must be a hardware issue. Can this be escalated to Google Engineers? I have called Google Support, but they cannot help. This needs to be escalated through the proper channels somehow.

Google sent me another device since mine was in warranty, and the new device works perfectly. So as I suspected, this is a hardware issue and Google needs to look into this because a lot of people are experiencing it.","Connectivity, Network, Bluetooth"
