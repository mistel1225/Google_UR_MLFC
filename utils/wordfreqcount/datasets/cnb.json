Because I visit them in a very wooded part of the country, my service only works when I'm in town around stores and businesses. The minute I'm driving between these little towns I have no coverage at all so letting people know I'm on my way or have been in an accident is a total crapshoot and is contingent on whether or not I happen to be close to a cell tower.\n\nWhat's worse is when I'm at the place I'm staying, my ability to send and receive messages is also a crapshoot, especially with group texts. Now I've been having this issue for years and every time I'm up here I'll visit the community boards to try to figure out how can I fix this basic communication issue. Believe me I've read so many replies from the last 5 years of related topics and must have tried them all with little success. And usually I just give up and just use the land line.\n\nThis time around though I've found a workaround that seems to be a clumsily perfect solution and what I want to ask the community, is if any one else has had this issue, what they've done, and is this something that will be different with the Pixel 6 phone. And if you have had this issue, I'm offering my solution.\n\nAt home base I have my phone set to recognize the wifi here to nake and receive calls. It works for calls but not for texts or pictures. I've tried clearing up storage, clearing cache, switching between mobile data, tuning off the phone, nothing worked. Some times I'll send a text and never get a response. Other times I'll be sent a text that may take a while to get to me. What seems to happen is that the messages are sent to cell towers and because my roaming data is exhausted, that protocol prevents those texts from ever landing. One time I received a text that had been bouncing around the cell phone towers for close to 2 years. And I got that message when I was 350 miles away from where it was sent.\n\nMy workaround is this. When I'm at a house -or business that has WiFi, turn off mobile data altogether and turn on airplane mode. Connect to the local WiFi and use that exclusively. When I have to leave that comfort zone I turn off airplane mode and return to open WiFi and turn mobile data back on to get calls and directional data. So in other words if I can restrict all of my data to go through a local WiFi source exclusively, everything work fine. I just have to go into Lisa Douglas mode ala Green Acres to get it to work.", "is_img": 0, "category": "Connectivity, Network, Bluetooth, Google Pixel 3", "post_time": "2021-05-31T15:40:55.765528+00:00", "reply": "0 Replies"}

I first assumed it was a Pixel problem and reached out to support(chat) and after me telling them that I had tried reinstalling the app after clearing all the casche and also doing a full factory reset, since I told them it was only happening on Spotify, they told me to contact their customer support. I have been in contact with them and doing extensive I.T. problem solving, they have now deemed it a Pixel problem so I am here again begging for help to fix an unusable app. I mentioned above some things I had troubleshooted, but here's what else I did: logged into a friend's account on mobile to see if it was account based(it wasn't), tested other phones in the household(pixel 4A) for the issue(none), tested our home computers(no issues). With that I deemed it not a Wi-fi issue. I then downloaded a playlist to see if having the files on my phone would help(it didn't), I used a jitter test to experiment with jitter when I held or touched the phone(the number stayed constant) so jittering wasnt an issue. While doing that jitter test I did find something interesting though. I turned my screen timer from 1min to 30min. Whenever I had tried to do a speed test in the past, since it takes me a bit to unlock my phone(and touch it), the issue would always clear up by the time I initiated the test. What I did notice is that I had zero stuttering when my screen stayed on, the minute it timed out, it went right back to stuttering. Definitely not expecting that, so there's something there. I also experimented by turning my phone on airplane mode while I played that downloaded playlist, to see if it was some kind of data leak(still stuttered), I streamed an hour each of Pandora and YT and neither stuttered. This happens when I'm playing it just through my phone speakers or connected to Bluetooth. I tried giving the app all permissions, changing the battery settings(unoptimized and background app refresh). That's about it, this seems to be a phone issue, not an app issue.

It stopped pairing with my fitbit charge 2 about a year ago.  I thought it was Fitbit issue as my fitbit is 4 years+ old and the face is cracked.  I now sync via my desktop with a dongle in a USB port.  From that point I did not notice any issues until I bought Pixel buds and because the Pixel buds are a new product I thought the audio issues I were having were on the Buds side and I worked with google on that.  What takes the cake though is I bought a new to me used car with android auto.  I paired up my phone and it worked great for about 50 mins into our road trip to texas from wisconsin.  It kept disconnecting and I was getting super frustrated and was blaming the car and the cables I used to connect.  Until I had my wife connect her phone a pixel 3a.  No issues with her phone the whole rest of the trip. \n\nI reset all network settings, I put my phone in safe mode and still have issues.   confirming that my bluetooth is defective.  After two + years of owning the pixel 3 I assume my only option is to get a new phone which is disappointing as I was hoping to make it 3 years with my phone before I get a new one.

In my country, a lot of people on samsung\u2019s, and that applies to my university as well. The IT dept. at my uni was not ready to make such a big change to their enterprise wifi because only 2 people owned a pixel in the whole place, the rest own samsungs, which aren't running the latest pixel updates yet, and iphones which don't have this problem. Now before I change my phone, which I bought from my hard earned savings, I want to know whether if Samsung phones, and other android phones, have or will likely receive that particular update, because if that\u2019s the case, I can wait till this becomes a widespread update and my university is forced to change their wifi system. After all, this is the very reason why google released this update: to push organisations to push for higher security measures. I would be SO GRATEFUL of someone can help me with this.\nI want to know that such deeply embedded system changes in android APIs, do they always arrive on other android phones which receive the latest updates?

The problem is that the phone keeps dropping its connection to my mobile carrier. Its happening throughout the day intermittently. I know when it happens as I can see the mobile symbol at the top of the screen flicker off and on again .  When I'm not using the phone  I know its happening because the phone makes a sound indicating its not connected to mobile. Also it happens when I try and make a phone call. Basically when I attempt to make a call it fails the first time and immediately afterwards when I try the second time it works.  The same goes when I try to text somebody using Google Message app. When I try and send the text message it immediately fails. If I tap the message it will try and send the message again resulting in it working the second time.  So same pattern is occuring when I try to make a phone call or if I try and text using standard SMS. Basically fails the first attempt and works on the second attempt.  I have contacted my carrier Rogers and they say the problem is not on their end. They are now recommending I contact Google so that is what I'm doing here. So any help would much be appreciated. \n\nUp to this point these are the things I have tried to do in order to fix this issue. None have made any difference as the problem is still occuring.\n\n1.

I do not have the same issue when I'm using a Bluetooth speaker or headphones. The problem is that I will be playing music on Spotify and then I might open YouTube or a Snap or play an audio message from a friend, only when I switch apps, my phone will be playing the sound but the sound doesn't play through my speakers. Sometimes it works no problem, I will press play on something and it will just play with no issues. Other times it will not play any sound except for the last few seconds of a message or snap (and usually only when I am closing it out of frustration). \n\n Sometimes I'll try disconnecting and reconnecting to the Bluetooth in my car and sometimes it works but it usually doesn't. It seems to be particularly problematic with Facebook Messenger audio messages. I do have more luck when I disconnect and reconnect and then play YouTube videos (and no I'm not watching music videos while I drive lol, there are just some songs I can only find on YouTube).\n\nI don't think it's the Bluetooth in my car because I never had this issue with my previous phone (Galaxy Note 9).

It's still under warranty until the 29th of this month. I purchased it new. In November  I was having a no charge issue and the battery was stuck on 50%.

I took the phone back and they again replaced the battery and motherboard. \nAll was fine until last week. I again had the 50% issue so I again took it to ubreakifix and they replaced the battery and motherboard again.

I'm dropping the phone back off at the repair shop but they're telling me they're not sure if they can do anything about it or not.

Anyway, back to topic, I carefully removed the SIM card (network provider card) from the Pixel 5, and inserted it on my Apple device. \n\nInstead of returning the Pixel 5, I decided to keep it to continue listening to the device stored music (MP3, WAV, Flacs, etc)  when I connect it to my Type-C AUX cable, the music and sounds continue to come out of the device speakers.This issue wasn't present at all 2 minutes ago when it had the network SIM card? could there be an issue with Google Assistant now that is doesn't have LTE network connection? Regardless, I've tried to play music while on home WiFi but no response. What could have happened in the OS that now it doesn't recognize it? Note: All my music is stored locally and it does plays only on the Pixel 5 speakers as mentioned earlier.\n\nI cleaned the port carefully, which wasn't required, the device is new & there was absolutely nothing in the port that wasn't already cleaned. \n\nI also bought a new Type-C Aux cable certified for the Pixel 5, tested it and no results what so ever, it's like it's invisible, but get this, it DOES recognize charging and also it DOES recognize any PC connected to it, I could even plug that same port to a Chromebook to transfer files successfully, so it's not like it isn't working. \n\nAnd it's not the first time that Google Assistance Microphone options interrupt or cause issues with music playback, I previously owned a Pixel 4 that was getting a lot of issues with the Google Assistance interfering with audio playback through the port.

In my opinion Pixels would sell better in developing countries rather than in countries dominated by Apple or Samsung. I think that Google's policy when it comes to phones is not prioritized to sell phones and make profit.\n\nAnyway, is there a chance that modern or future Pixels will get a support for 5G / VoWiFi / VoLTE for network operators outside Germany, France and UK? I can import the Pixel from Germany on my own, but it's useless for me as long as it doesnt at least have working Wi-Fi calling and I can't make it work on my own. \n\nAnd there's one thing.

It has a case but landed on the screen. Upon picking it up I kept getting System UI errors until I finally managed to restart it. The system UI errors have persisted but not as often. \n\nThe big problem I'm having now is I cannot turn on my wifi/bluetooth/mobile hotspot along with the phone being clunky and slow now. It'll make the attempt to connect then instantly drop. I'm still able to use network data. Soft reset/safe mode/software updates did not work and I'm hesitant to do a factory reset because of the wifi not working. I'm overseas for the foreseeable so I don't have access to UbreakIfix. Most of the locals have never done anything with a Pixel either and don't want to risk it.\n\nI'm guessing something is wrong with the motherboard or a loose connection inside. Without connecting to a hotspot in the meantime is there anyway I can tether my network connection to my tablet or another phone? \n\nI've also heard of applying pressure to the corner right above the power button but it hasn't changed anything.

I've experienced a bunch of network issues that I have not yet been able to rectify. This is my second attempt at asking for help. I'm speculating i may have some ignorance to the best way to utilize the Pixel on Tmobile. I have included a summery of the issue, as well as my T-Mobile debugging to date below:\n\nSummary of issue(s): \n1. I don't seem to have to have reliable data/cellular connectivity (even after adding a new APN configuration per TMObile's recommendation) in places i would expect it; Denver CO, Salida CO, etc. \n2. I do not have the option to configure Wifi calling. How can I get access to wifi calling on the Pixel 4a 5G. Both google and TMobile documentation references selections that are not available in my OS.\n\nTMobile service feedback: A call into TMobile support sent me to an APN configuration page, to build a custom network configuration. It is basically identical to the default Tmobile APN that came native. I still do not seem to pull 5g in the city. I often see an H+ next to the network icon top right. TMobile also mentioned that wifi calling is only supported if the Pixel is bought from Tmobile? Am i missing firmware? Do i need to buy the hardware from Tmobile? \n\nDeBug logic: My brother owns a 4a on Tmobile and does have access to Wifi calling. Both Google and TMobile say Wifi calling is obtainable on their websites, but i do not have any configuration options in my current Android OS.\n\nPossible remedies: Do i need a new SIM card? Do I need to buy the hardware direct from TMobile (this is what i was told to obtain the Wifi calling feature). Do I have a defective Pixel?\n\nMany thanks in advance! I really hope i can resolve these inconveniences on the most expensive phone i've ever bought.

It's to do with the feature found in your mobile network settings called \"Send/receive MMS when mobile data is off\".\nSee photo:\n\n\nWhat happens is this:\nWhen the feature is enabled, and you send or receive MMS, the phone enables your mobile data for EVERYTHING, but does not tell you it will do this, nor does it enable the switch for mobile data on the same settings screen seen in the photo above.  Your apps that use data will immediately begin to use data and notify you as if you had manually turned your mobile data on.  It remains in this state for many hours, and possibly until you turn it off.\n\nThis is how you test it (assuming your phone plan has data):\n1. disable mobile data\n2. disable wifi\n3. verify and ensure that data is in fact off by testing internet access\n4. verify the \"send & receive MMS messages when data is off\"  function is turned on\n4.5 verify that RCS chat features are turned off in google messenges and has been off for at least a few minutes.  restart messenges app possibly as well ( i don't use that feature at all and this step might be redundant)\n5.  send an MMS message to a contact using google messages\n6.  verify that data has been turned back on by trying an app or browser (but settings menu shows data off)\n\nBefore you jump to conclusions and say \"but data needs to be on to send MMS\" this is not true, you can plainly see the function is there, and other phones from other brands have had this function for years despite not having the toggle switch in the settings menu. (Realme X2 was the most recent phone I've seen that can send/receive MMS without data on).\n\nLastly, please read the steps above carefully and perform them EXACTLY how I have outlined to test this \"bug\". Most people I've asked either miss a step or don't do them at all. In fact, there's a few threads started here about this issue but none have tested it in this way and all threads are locked for some reason since the issue never gets resolved.\n\nAnd yes I've reported this scenario through the feedback function 3 times, once a month since I've had the phone after each monthly security patch since October, on Android 11.", "is_img": 1, "category": "Connectivity, Network, Bluetooth, Google Pixel 4a", "post_time": "2021-01-06T17:36:14.668125+00:00", "reply": "4 Replies"}

Thinking it was just something introduced by some app I had downloaded, or file that I had put on my phone I factory reset my phone. Then I factory flashed my phone to the most recent factory image. Then I flashed my phone to the very first factory image that was available for the the Pixel 3 XL, the September 2018 image. The error continues to come back. I can't believe this is a hardware problem, it can be temporarily solved by restarting the phone, and it is completely random, sometimes happening constantly every 5 seconds, and sometimes not happening for days at a time. I don't believe it's a loose connection in the phone, it wouldn't be fixed by restarts and it wouldn't be so frustratingly random. I've been reading forum post after forum post of people with this problem. I've only searched specifically for people with Pixel 3's but it seems to be happening with other Pixels and maybe even with with phones from other manufacturers as well.\n\nThis issue is causing people's otherwise perfectly functional phones to be useless. When the bluetooth keeps stopping it also takes the wifi and mobile network down with it. I've missed important text messages and phone calls.\n\nGoogle won't warranty my phone because it's past the warranty period, even though I called them previously seeking help about this error before my warranty had expired.\n\nSomeone please look into this and figure it out. It seems to me that it the error was introduced after an Android update, personally I think the Android 10 update caused it, as that seems to coincide with when it started happening to me and when many other people are saying it started happening. Some reports of the error do contradict this though, saying it happened before that. All of these links are about the error from a cursory 5 minute google search.

I  now have an appointment for a phone repair, but I just wanted to see if anyone knows what this could be and if I could get it running sooner.  \n\nI was texting my Dad when my messages randomly stopped sending.  I noticed that my wifi was turned off, and it said \"no SIM card\" under the mobile data option.  When I tried to turn WIFI back on, the toggle switch turned to the on position, but the wifi remained off.  It did not show any networks, and when I left settings and came back, the toggle switch was flipped off again.  Here's the really weird part: I went to a restaurant, and my phone displayed the song name on my lock screen (while claiming it has no network connection of any kind).  Surely Google has not downloaded a complete neural net of every song in existence to my phone: this feature must require network connectivity of some sort. \n\nMy first instinct is to think this is a software problem, but I did a factory reset... twice, so I think we can rule that out.  Next, I wonder about a hardware issue, but I would assume the WIFI antenna and the mobile data antennas are two different parts, so what is the chance they both break at the same time?  This leads me back to thinking it is a software issue.

I bought it from a private seller face to face, but it's brand new, it's supposed to have warranty. I took the plastics and ripped the seals off the cables on the phone's box. It would be insane for it not to have it, and it would be a first of all the products I've owned in my 38 years.\n\nI say this because I already saw some other suggested posts where \"diamond\" level agents have told customers to go back to their retailer, even if they bought it from private sellers on eBay. It shouldn't matter. It's still a new phone. It's production date is, quite literally, not over a year back.\n\nThe phone simply stops recognizing the SIM card at random points during the day. Usually I solved it by opening the tray and closing it, which is not normal. Then yesterday the phone didn't recognize the SIM at all, no matter what I did. The SIM card works with no issue on each and every other phone I've tested it on besides the Pixel 4a. \n\nI am only doing this post because I can't reach anyone in customer service in Google, which is pretty insane. No chat, no phone, no e-mail. \n\nPlease, help. This is a new phone and something is wrong with it. $349 may be nothing to some, but it is a lot of money to me.

In a complete coincidence, I was planning on transferring my number over to Xfinity Mobile.  I attempted to do so after verifying on the Xfinity site that my IMEI was compatible with their network.  Ported the number, but the service did nothing since I bought a GSM phone and Xfinity is CDMA.  After the days it took to figure that out, I then ported that number over to Cricket since they're GSM.  Successfully ported the number, I guess, but the phone still says \"SIM card isn't supported. Ask Xfinity Mobile if this device can be unlocked.\"  I have spent hours with Xfinity Mobile veryifing that the phone is not locked, not was ever locked by them.  They stated the issue has to be with my new carrier Cricket.  Cricket states everything is good on their end, active phone number, no issues, and that since every time I insert the Cricket SIM it states to check with XFinity to unlock, it must be XFinity's fault.\n\nI've tried a hard factory reboot, and it still gives me the Xfinity message with no service.\n\nA quick google, and it shows many people purchased unlocked Pixel 4 phones directly from Google only to have them show up locked to XFinity.  Google recognized the issue and sent them new phones, and many people received another phone with the same issue. There are multiple threads on Reddit about this, and even an article on 9to5google specifically about the Xfinity locked Pixel 4 issue.\n\nConsidering Xfinity has verified multiple times the phone was never locked by them, and even a hard reboot doesn't stop if from saying it's XFinity locked, does it sound like I got one of these phones?  If so, buying it used and having spend 30 days troubleshooting this, is there any chance Google will take responsibility for a known error if it's on a used phone?\n\nThanks in advance.", "is_img": 0, "category": "Connectivity, Network, Bluetooth, Google Pixel 4", "post_time": "2020-12-17T16:59:07.087348+00:00", "reply": "1 Recommended Answer"}

Supplied charger used and also Pixel 3a charger. Same result. Issue still present in Safe Mode and after factory reset. Didn't migrate any data from Pixel 3a after factory reset so as close to a clean install as you can do on a Pixel.\n\nIssue 2: Phone won't maintain a 5G connection. All correctly configured on network side. Phone will connect to 5G (five bar signal), but will drop back on to LTE within about 5 or 10 seconds. Can force it back onto 5G or a further 5 or 10 seconds (most of the time) with an on/off of Airplane Mode, but phone will then drop back to LTE again. In the Networks > Mobile Networks settings it defaults to 5G preferred but, if you open the setting, only LTE, 3G and 2G are available for selection??? Setting it to 5G only (via *#*#INFO#*#*) displays similar behaviour, except connection drops out entirely without dropping back to LTE, naturally.\n\nIssue 3: Neither VoLTE or VoWiFi are available to turn on via *#*#INFO#*#*. Both are supported for the phone on my network (Vodafone Ireland)\n\nI'd have this straight back for replacement but, considering I've managed to get one WITHOUT a screen gap, I'm hesitant (though the battery issue concerns me, it could be software, but...).

Works well without sim card.\n\nOther network stuff like Wifi and Bluetooth works \"well\".\n\nAny idea ? Do I mess something ?!\nThanks\n\nAndroid version:\n\n\nnetwork picto:", "is_img": 1, "category": "Connectivity, Network, Bluetooth, Google Pixel 5", "post_time": "2020-11-05T01:30:29.662058+00:00", "reply": "0 Replies"}

Hence I can't check in at delivery destinations. Restarting the phone and re-running the app fixes this.\n\nThe same happens in other apps, when I switch from WiFi to 4G.\n\nExample 2:\nCompletely randomly (as it seems to me), I'm told I have no network connection on apps like YouTube and Spotify when I clearly do have connection and can access the internet. I either have to wait a while or restart my phone to fix this.\n\nExample 3:\nI'm on Instagram or Facebook and I lock my phone while the app is still open. If I unlock my phone (back onto the app), the app doesn't refresh. I need to close the app and reopen it to get it working.\n\nI've already reset my network settings, but this hasn't changed anything. I'm on android version 11.

I'm not 100% sure what that means, but Google suggests KDDI is a Japanese provider, so me, being in Germany, receiving a phone with that firmware on it might be the reason why VoLTE/VoWiFi aren't fully working?\nI was not able to install the non-KDDI variant via adb recovery, since it does not allow downgrades and I have no plans on unlocking the device.\n\nIs this related?

That option is gone from the little menu, so I have to go into Bluetooth settings, and either disconnect or to select my output and unselect \"media audio\". \n\nHas this feature (selecting audio output from the volume menu) gone away for everyone, or is this a bug? It was super useful before (to listening to voice notes or anything that you wouldn't want played onto the speakers for example), so I don't see why they would remove it. \n\nAlso, a different issue but in the same vein, the volume is also really messed up when playing on any Bluetooth device. Volume goes up 3 notches and is suddenly super loud on the speakers, but won't go up anymore, even though the slider is only at what, 20%? Going up in volume anymore does nothing to increase sound, it sounds as if it's at maximum.

Tthey were the only android supported when I purchased back in Jan, that is why I bought them.  My audiologists told me that ReSound had a 6month exclusive agreement with Google and I can see that there are now more supported HAs.  I was hoping in that time period Android support would improve but does not appear so.\n\nI am having two really annoying issues.\n1-when connected I do not get alerts.  sometimes I will get the last nanosecond of an alert in my hearings aids OR the hearing aids will go momentarily quiet.  I'm guessing that the alert is getting issued before the connection can be completed.  When I disconnect the HAs the alerts come thru loud and clear.  Most of the time I will not get ring tone for an incoming call and for an outgoing call will not hear anything until the connection is made with the person or their VM.\n2-When my car is connected (via BT) the sound is inconsistent.  Sometimes it will come thru the HAs and sometimes it will go thru the car spkr.  Calls as well.  The result is that I have to manually disconnect the HAs for the sound/calls to come thru the car.  You would think there would be a setting to automatically do this, ie, why would I want sound to come thru the HAs in the car especially when an incoming call does NOT turn off an media sound to the car.  When I use Android Auto (via USB/BT) the issue is the same.\n\nI just tried google support - totally worthless.  Had me forget all BT devices and dropped off the chat before I could reply.  \n\nI think these issues just reflect very limited support for HAs.  So disappointing.  I am not an Apple person but can tell from my wife's phone there are much more support options.\n\nIs there a forum where we can lobby Goggle for better support?", "is_img": 0, "category": "Connectivity, Network, Bluetooth, Google Pixel 3a XL", "post_time": "2020-09-10T16:07:30.932852+00:00", "reply": "0 Replies"}

Within minutes I was speaking with a level 2 representative (on the phone) as we tried to work through the issue.  I was impressed by the level of effort considering I do not even have an account with them.  After looking up the IMEI number and serial number, it was determined that they have no record of that phone in their database.  Verizon confirmed the phone was not locked by them or any other carrier.  They too stated that the phone is not compatible with their network.  Back to Google...  The google rep finally offered to send a new phone, but I would have to wait an additional 5-10 business days to receive the replacement phone and no way to guarantee the second replacement would be compatible.  At this point I asked to escalate the issue.  The rep agreed and that ended the chat.  About 6 hours later I received a quick email from the supervisor.  I promptly responded and haven't heard back since.  That was yesterday.  I am now on day 11 without phone service and seemingly no closer to a resolution.  I can't get a response from the supervisor and no idea how long I am supposed to wait around.  I tried to contact by phone, but when they call back came through I was disconnected before speaking to a human.  The policy of sending in the phone before they will send the replacement is ridiculous.  I am now two days into this and have spent more hours than I care to admit.  Not sure where to go from here other than giving up and purchasing a new phone from somewhere else...", "is_img": 0, "category": "Connectivity, Network, Bluetooth, Google Pixel 2", "post_time": "2020-09-10T15:09:06.608433+00:00", "reply": "0 Replies"}

After ANY Android updates (been happening for over a year now), my Pixel 3 XL appears to work just fine until I need to 'switch' over to 'Mobile Network'.  It won't switch over, meaning that when I leave the house (and wireless), I don't have a connection to the Internet (or anything).\n\nI go into the Network and Internet settings, click on the \"Mobile Network\" (which says Google FI under it already) and it shows that it is \"Off\" - so, I try to turn it on again.  Says \"Switching to Google Fi, but then goes back again and no connection.\n\nSo far, the ONLY way I can get it to work again (which is weird also) is to tell it to 'erase sim'.  Then, it actually gets an error message saying I can't erase it and it goes back to the \"Network and Internet\" setting page whereupon I go into the \"Mobile Network\" (which still says Google FI), and  tell it to \"Turn on\" again and then it works...\n\nI am just kind of tired of having to do this whenever an Android update comes out - especially frustrating if I just grab my phone in the morning and head out only to have to pull over to the side of the road after realizing I have no 'Mobile Network' connection.\n\nVERY strange.  When it first happened, I called support, worked with them for over an hour trying to get it to work and they said I could also swap the phone out (if was new), which is what I was GOING to do, but I thought \"better erase the SIM card before I do so\"... that's when I found this 'jury rigged fix'...\n\nAnyone else getting this kind of thing?

A lot of times it'll hold onto a signal from a puck far away as I walk across the house, then switch to LTE only, and then about 10 seconds later pick up the newer, closer Google Wifi puck.\nThis is my first Pixel 3 but we have other Pixels in the house (3a, 2, OG) and they all hold onto the Wifi smoothly from room to room across the house.\n\nI already assigned a static IP.  Didn't seem to help.\n\nI tried it in safe mode.  Also didn't seem to help.\n\nI don't have any weird apps on it -- the exact same ones I had with my previous OG Pixel, which didn't do this.\n\nMy guess is that I have a wonky wifi unit (i.e., hardware problem).  In the grand scheme of things this is a minor annoyance and the world won't end.\n\nAnd as the other phones don't do it and my Google Wifi setup hasn't changed in 2 years, I don't think it's the Wifi.  I \"turned off and on again\" all the google wifi pucks just in case it was acting funny after an update or something.  No difference.\n\nCould this be a known 11 beta 3 bug?  (did it in 2.5 also).  I didn't really use this in Android 10 -- as soon as I got the phone I upgraded to 11 beta 2.5.\n\nI don't want to factory reset the phone.  Not worth it.

I have checked back in twice,  and each time I was told a specialist would get back to me \"at the earliest.\" (Such a polite phrase from the playbook that says absolutely nothing.)

In fact, everything works perfectly on other WiFi's, just not my home WiFI. I have dual band, I have tried both 2.5 and 5 channels with no difference. The Wifi works fine on my other devices, such as home computer, tablets, and TVs. I can't seem to find any answer. Interestingly, I pulled out my original Google Pixel and it has the same issue with latency around 3rd party apps as our 3A's? Could it be the Pixel OS and compatibility issues with my modem/router?

I'm posting here because I've been Googling this issue for 2 days and haven't found an answer.\n\nHere's my issue: I have a NAS running on my local network at mynas.local. When I visit that URL in any web browser (Firefox, Chrome, IE, Edge) from my Windows PC, iPad, Windows laptop, or Mac laptop, the NAS's login page is displayed as expected.\n\nHowever, when I attempt to visit the same URL in a web browser on my Pixel 3 it does not resolve.\n\nTroubleshooting:\n- I made sure my Android device was on the same WiFi network as my other devices.\n- I turned off mobile data.\n- I disabled Private DNS.\n- I am able to cast to Chromecast devices on my network from my phone (which also use mDNS) so it is able to receive/send multicast packets.\n- My roommate who also has a Pixel 3 confirmed it does not work for him either.\n- I've tried Chrome, DuckDuckGo, Firefox, Firefox Beta, and Firefox Nightly with no success.\n\nI have come across the Network Discovery Service for Android, which provides tools for app developers to allow their apps to do exactly this - use mDNS to find *.local hostnames, which begs the question: do normal DNS resolutions on the Pixel 3 not know to do *.local domain lookups via mDNS?\n\nAnd if not:\n- Is there any way to enable it?\n- Is there any plan to support it in upcoming Pixel updates?\n- Are there any web browsers that use the NDS Android API to enable this functionality?\n\nThanks for your time, I know this is a tricky question, but I've been troubleshooting it for several days, and really can't find answers on Google. But with the number of consumer devices that run on *.local addresses I'm sure someone out there must know whether this is possible/supported or not.\n\nThank you very much for your time!\n\nPS- I've seen some workarounds: setting up a private DNS server, adding a hosts file entry, etc. I may use those as a last resort, but I'm interested in allowing my roommates/friends to access things on my network while they're visiting, and I can't do special configuration on all of their devices if they happen to be using Pixel phones.", "is_img": 0, "category": "Connectivity, Network, Bluetooth, Google Pixel 3", "post_time": "2020-07-23T23:18:16.138857+00:00", "reply": "1 Recommended Answer"}

I was astonished when I realized that I was not even capable of setting up the device. I feel the need to mention that I am not able to use cellular data on this device as it does not have a SIM card in it (I primarily use WI-FI as a substitute for cellular data). I was able to skip the activation portion of the phone's set-up sequence, however, as I was configuring the phone, a message popped up saying that bluetooth was not functioning properly. I ignore it, and moved on to the next step. It asked me for a WI-FI network because I could not use cellular data, but none of them were appearing. It's telling me that there are no WI-FI hotspots in my location, and that both my IP address as well as my MAC address are unavailable. I hope you see my predicament here. I can't use cellular data because I have no service or SIM card & I can't use WI-FI because no networks are appearing. I was told that this was due to my router being misconfigured, but that's literally impossible considering I have 12 other devices that are running perfectly & are connected to it as we speak. It also doesn't make sense that it wouldn't show any of my neighbors' networks if it was truly just mine that was affected. I have spent hours on the community forums & help guides written by Google to no avail. I have tried going into \"safe mode,\" I have tried wiping all data from the device & factory resetting it, and nothing works. I even had an actual Google customer service employee try to tell me that I needed to update my device's operating system... Let me ask you this, genius, how can you expect me to update my device using WI-FI when the whole reason I contacted you was because I couldn't connect to it on said device in the first place? It seems to me that the combination of narcissistic deception & a general lack of common sense has plagued customer support.

{"url": "https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/51257922/pixel-2-xl-android-10-networking-continues-to-malfunction-bluetooth-lte-wifi-all-are-unreliable?hl=en", "title": "Pixel 2 XL Android 10 networking continues to malfunction. Bluetooth, LTE, Wifi all are unreliable", "content": "Since the Android 10 update, my Pixel 2XL has had continuous problems with ALL its network connections staying reliable, persistent, connected, and actually working.  Symptoms are consistently inconsistent, and its become super annoying.  US based on Verizon.\n\nFirst on basic phone calls, the relationship between 4G/LTE and Wifi calling is pretty broken.  If making a phone call, when there's what appears to be a somewhat weak 4G signal, but a strong Wifi signal, calls will not go through.  The calling process either hangs or times out.  It can take several retries to get connected.  Android's phone subsystem cannot differentiate between bad 4G and good Wifi.  It gets confused.\n\nNext, if indeed a call connects, the handoff from 4G to Wifi causes a 3-10 second blackout, where either side cannot hear each other, causing people to hang up on the far end.  It can take several tries to just get the call connected and both parties speaking.\n\nSimilarly, when trying to use basic broadband data services (ie, downloading a file or podcast as an example), the phone gets confused as well.  If both 4G and Wifi are strong, downloads of say a podcast, may take 10-15 minutes.  If I shut off either 4G OR Wifi, the download happens in seconds.  Again, Android 10 cannot handle 4G/Wifi selection correctly.  It simply gets confused and stalls everything.  \n\nNow, on to Bluetooth, which also misbehaves consistently when either 4G or Wifi state changes.  Bluetooth as an example, will disconnect when the LTE modem throttles between 4G and 3G, or when an cellular signal cuts out completely in a rural area.  The same is true for Bluetooth audio.  Bluetooth audio (like a podcast or music) will simply STOP playing, when the LTE modem is modulating between 4G, 3G or no signal.   When driving in a rural area as an example, and cellular signal is choppy, Bluetooth consistently disconnects, stalls, or simply hangs.\n\nWhile I like the phone in general, it was a much more reliable networked experience under previous Android versions.  I imagine its a set of poorly tested code blocks that control the Snapdragon 835's networking stack, and that handoff routines are clearly broken.   No idea if its drivers or something else, but basically networked reliability is terrible.  \n\nIts clearly an Android code problem.  The Snapdragon 835 uses a combined MAC for all networking layers AFAIK (definitely LTE and Wifi do).", "is_img": 0, "category": "Connectivity, Network, Bluetooth, Google Pixel 2", "post_time": "2020-06-04T17:08:56.951883+00:00", "reply": "1 Reply"}

Thinking it was just something introduced by some app I had downloaded, or file that I had put on my phone I factory reset my phone. Then I factory flashed my phone to the most recent factory image. Then I flashed my phone to the very first factory image that was available for the the Pixel 3 XL, the September 2018 image. The error continues to come back. I can't believe this is a hardware problem, it can be temporarily solved by restarting the phone, and it is completely random, sometimes happening constantly every 5 seconds, and sometimes not happening for days at a time. I don't believe it's a loose connection in the phone, it wouldn't be fixed by restarts and it wouldn't be so frustratingly random. I've been reading forum post after forum post of people with this problem. I've only searched specifically for people with Pixel 3's but it seems to be happening with other Pixels and maybe even with with phones from other manufacturers as well. \n\nThis issue is causing people's otherwise perfectly functional phones to be useless. When the bluetooth keeps stopping it also takes the wifi and mobile network down with it. I've missed important text messages and phone calls.\n\nGoogle won't warranty my phone because it's past the warranty period, even though I called them previously seeking help about this error before my warranty had expired.\n\nSomeone please look into this and figure it out. It seems to me that it the error was introduced after an Android update, personally I think the Android 10 update caused it, as that seems to coincide with when it started happening to me and when many other people are saying it started happening. Some reports of the error do contradict this though, saying it happened before that. All of these links are about the error from a cursory 5 minute google search. I imagine searching for much longer you could find so many more.\n\nhttps://forum.xda-developers.com/pixel-3-xl/help/constant-bluetooth-stopping-t4035007\nhttps://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/21889103?hl=en\nhttps://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/1886970?hl=en\nhttps://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/2013979?hl=en\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/dbkn5r/bluetooth_keeps_stopping/\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/dh0fsm/wifi_bluetooth_keeps_stopping_on_pixel_3_xl/\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/bifu3h/google_pixel_3_xl_bluetooth_crash_disabled_wifi/\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/dj1cck/why_does_google_refuse_to_fix_bluetooth_keeps/\nhttps://forum.xda-developers.com/pixel-3-xl/help/bluetooth-stopping-t4003431\nhttps://forum.xda-developers.com/pixel/help/bluetooth-stopping-factory-reset-t3926052\nhttps://forum.xda-developers.com/pixel-3-xl/help/factory-reset-losing-internal-storage-t3937651\n\nSomeone at Google needs to step up and make sure this gets fixed.

This has got me stumped as I think what could be causing this to only impact some websites/apps but not all.\n\nToday I was streaming music via Amazon whilst driving, initially still buffered from the house wifi, but it soon cut out and could not be restarted. I pulled into a garage and found that I could stream a movie via Amazon Prime app, but not play music or use the amazon shopping app either. I could send and receive messages in Whatsapp and go to most websites, but again not outlook.\nI tried restarting the device. Clearing the cache of the apps and the google app itself, no change. Tried turning mobile data on/off and going into aeroplane mode and back again, no difference. I gave up, but found I could play streaming music through Google Play app, so did that instead. Later I checked again and all seemed fine (amazon music played ok and outlook loaded instantly) so I left things as they were, but once again the problem re-occurred when I was heading home.\n\nI've been driving around quite a lot listening to music and podcasts and it has only recently become very noticeable, but I've not really thought too much of it as it was very sporadic, but that was likely down to the stay at home measures and now it is becoming much more problematic.\n\nAny ideas? Is there something really obvious I've missed? All apps are set to stream on mobile data (and as I mentioned, they will work at some times, not others, regardless of the displayed phone signal and ability to visit other website/stream other apps). \n\nI tried loading in safe mode, but I get no signal at all there (should I?) so could not test. I've performed a factory reset and the problem persists. I've put the sim back in my old phone and all worked fine on mobile data. As soon as I put the sim back in my 3a the problem returned, so it is definitely to do with the phone and not the network provider.", "is_img": 0, "category": "Connectivity, Network, Bluetooth, Google Pixel 3a", "post_time": "2020-05-24T09:13:16.188167+00:00", "reply": "7 Replies"}

Of course I contacted my carrier about that and they said the service is enabled on my line, and normally with that devices from OnePlus, Xiaomi or even Samsung can work with minimal software modifications (no root). I know you consider it as an non-essential feature, however, for the time being, many carriers are using cell towers to illegally collect user's movement data without consent using the pandemic as an excuse, which makes me feel totally uncomfortable and not safe. That's why I need VoWiFi so that I can turn off cellular radio on my phone and still be able to call & text using WiFi. So, I don't hope that Google can make things easy like on iPhone, but please, at least give users a simple setting switch, with a warning about risks of non-compatibility on uncertified carriers.\n\nI don't know why but every iPhone has it working on any supported carriers, no matter which resellers or original carriers do they came from. Everything is simple and it works. I know there's a lot of differences between two platforms, but as I mentioned above, it can be modified by software, so why don't you let users have their choices?

No recent updates have fixed the issue.\n\nSometimes I can use the phone for days without any issue, other times it will only last an hour or less before it stops recognizing the Sim card. Sometimes toggling airplane mode fixes the issue, sometimes it doesn't. \n\nI found another post where an engineer recommended entering *#*#794824746#*# into the dialer. This switches between physical SIM and eSIM. So I have to enter it once, wait for the pop-up that eSIM is enabled, then enter it again, wait for the pop-up that the physical SIM is enabled, then wait for my physical SIM to be recognized. This usually works, but occasionally will not work.\n\nIt seems that the issue happens more frequently after a restart, which is unfortunate because sometimes I need to restart to fix the issue.\n\nHow is such a core functionality broken, after 2 years of no issues prior? How has this not been fixed in 3 or 4 patches? I see some bug tracker for a similar issue, but where the user had Google Fi and Verizon at the same time, and people are reporting that the issue is no longer present. Unfortunately I'm still having my issue.\n\nI hope this post will get the right attention and this issue can actually be fixed. I love my pixel 2 and rave about how it's been so good for so long, but this is really a problem.", "is_img": 0, "category": "Connectivity, Network, Bluetooth, Google Pixel 2", "post_time": "2020-02-25T12:19:24.923729+00:00", "reply": "5 Replies"}

All other devices (laptops, iPhones, iPads) connect with no issues. Pixel is updated to Android 9.\n\nThe Pixel phone connects to other wifi networks with no issues.\n\nI have tried all of the usual suspects - resetting network connections, restarting modem, restarting phone, forgetting network etc. multiple times, to no avail.

One recommended enabling MAC randomization in the developer settings, but this phone doesn't have that option.\n\nI myself have a Pixel XL which is 2 years old.

Unfortunately, calling AT&T and Google support on this occasion has not been successful - they have no record of the solution to my problem, and they won't connect me to level 2 support without payment (and I'm not about to pay them to fix a problem that is none of my doing).\n\nSince I'm not super tech savvy, I have no idea what could be causing the problem and how to fix it on my own. Arris routers have been mentioned in several of the other posts, so I'm wondering if it could be anything to do with this, and could be fixed with a new router.\n\nIf anyone has any knowledge of this issue and a potential solution, I'd be very grateful!", "is_img": 0, "category": "Connectivity, Network, Bluetooth, Google Pixel", "post_time": "2019-06-01T00:40:16.628755+00:00", "reply": "1 Recommended Answer"}

I was referred to a forum post about changing the setting from randomized MAC to use device Mac, but I don't seem to have the as a choice under wifi advance settings.  Only thing I see I can change in Private DNS.  So, do I need to turn that off so my phone will connect every day?  Or, is there something else I am missing (and IT is missing?!)?!", "is_img": 0, "category": "Connectivity, Network, Bluetooth", "post_time": "2020-02-06T18:30:43.159716+00:00", "reply": "0 Replies"}

I've been going back and forth with customer service and everyone has told me that the phone should be compatible on both CDMA and GSM networks.\n\nI contacted Verzion about the phone to see if maybe it was still locked to their network and gave them my IMEI to check but they don't even see the device in their database.

Security is very high on our networks. We don't have WiFi in any of the buildings, our firewall blocks everything that is entertaining (Netflix, YouTube, Twitter), and we are unable to connect any other device to the network without the security guys coming down and screaming at us. Just one TV in the break room with a DVD player, no cable. We also work 12 hour shifts and I can't look at the news sites any longer to pass the time.\n\nI would like to download movies or shows to my phone or use the download for offline feature that many apps offer like Netflix and YouTube. Or even use my data when I can. I want to connect my phone to a TV or projector over HDMI so I can enjoy them on the big screen.\n\nI know Google dosn't add the OTG feature to their lineup anymore in favour of the wireless cast feature. BUT COMMON!!! There has to be a way that I can use the USB-C port with some sort of hub to get HDMI. I am sure Google can implement this with a software update.\n\nCan someone help me on this. Is it possible to cast to a chromecast with absolutly no internet/data over WiFi direct?

But when I contacted SoftBank they told me: \n\n\"Please find our policy of unlocking the handset.\nYou can have your handset unlocked only if:\n\n1)You are currently the subscriber of the mobile number.\n2)You were ex-subscriber, but the subscription has been \nterminated within 90 days.\n3)The handset should be purchased through Softbank shops\nor Softbank online shops by yourself.\n\nSince you don't meet the conditions, you cannot have your\nhandset unlocked by us.\"\n\nSo they are apparently not able to find any indication that my phone was connected through their network, since I was a subscriber through another company. \n\nDoes anyone have any idea about how to solve this this problem? Has anyone else experienced this kind of problem??

I was primarily going to use this phone simply because of the camera, which 1000% better than my Note 8 daily driver. However, after a week of reminiscing of when I owned the smaller Google Pixel in the same color. The UI, the quality, honestly the overall everything of the phone is just so pure and far more enjoyable than any phone I have used to date. This meant going back and forth between using my Note 8 and the Pixel XL as my daily drivers, which meant I would be able to use the phone for calls, text messaging, and data. All of that worked good and fine up until about 2 weeks ago now. It is tragic to say the least, but it is far worse: now I cannot use the phone period anymore since having the issue aforementioned as my title.\n\nI have literally tried everything under the Sun for troubleshooting, even going as far to unlock the bootloader, flash previous versions of Pie and I went as far as flashing 8.1 Oreo. I figured it was a software issue hence why I went that far and the reason I went that far is because the other day, I inserted my Verizon SIM from my Note 8 and I say the service icon in the status bar show up for a split second, and then disappear as soon as it popped up. So, something is sort of working, but not. It could be hardware; it could also just simply be software. Oh, no water/moisture damage and I have not dropped it since I had it. The previous owner did, but again, it worked fine even so.\n\nAgain, I purchased this second-hand as a private sale, not through my carrier. Going to them would be futile in essence simply because Verizon enjoys making their customers jump through hoops. I digress... I have referred to XDA and Google Search in an attempt to find someone with the same issues I am having and then I stumbled across the Pixel Community Hub (this wonderful place) and found that my issue is apparently a big issue. I am posting another thread simply because I was not satisfied with the answers I was reading. I am looking for a somewhat more advanced answer I guess, if I can even get one. I am considering to root my device and see if that helps and try to dig through system phone/modem apps and sort out the issue (if even possible).

My previous P20 Pro connected to 3G on the parking lot but as soon as I was entering the house it switched to 4G+ and stayed there. The signal strength was around -100dbm\nMy Pixel however only uses 3G. As soon as I drive away from home, it switches to 4G+.\nSame at work.

At home there is a difference of 25dbm between them (3G has -75dbm and 4G around -100dbm).

It has consistently failed to play audio under those circumstances even though everything works fine if I leave the car for shorter periods of time. The music will then pick up right where it left off from with audio. With longer periods of time the track will show but with no sound. I can change the track on the car system and the phone will reflect the change but again with no sound. I can pause the music and that will also be communicated to the phone as well or vice versa. In other words the phone and the car are connected via bluetooth for everything but audio. This didn't occur with my older Samsung S7 Edge over a five year period with one of my Mazda cars and a 3 year period with another one.\n\nIf I restart the phone the audio will come back. If I force stop the bluetooth system app and hit play again the audio will start but will have drop outs and be of lower quality until I stop and restart bluetooth again. Clearing the cache and data from the music app does not fix the audio.\n\nI have discussed this with Google support and am running the Pixel 3a in safe mode and will check tomorrow to see it the audio works when I restart my car. This might indicate a 3rd party app may be responsible for the problem. Beyond that, I would have to do a factory reset again and have diagnostic work done at an Ifixit store (hardware?).\n\nI am not confident that Mazda would be of much help and doubt the cars are a problem based on my past history with my Samsung phone. I have spent a lot of time isolating this problem and determining the \"fix\" (restart or force stop bluetooth). I have also rebooted the firmware in both cars and could possibly call Mazda and also check for firmware updates for my cars but this as well as using the older Samsung phone are unlikely or impractical solutions as I don't want to keep using an older phone. By the way, I have also unpaired and re paired both cars with the Pixel 3a.\n\nI know having a Pixel 3a and the Mazda cars narrows my chance of someone else having the same problem with the same equipment. I'm hoping someone else has also experienced this problem with either the same or another combination of equipment.

I had a different Android before the Pixel 3 and did the same thing. When I sit on the train and move through areas with lots of other wifi networks/hotspots, which I will see, because the Pixel 3 will offer to connect to them, the Pixel 3 will change frequencies five six times a minute even between channels from the 5Ghz and 2.4Ghz band. \n\nMy laptop will still show the connection, but the ping to the phone's IP (gateway) will fail.

But, ever since I upgraded to Android 10, I started having connectivity issues in some core Google apps and certain third-party apps. For example, Google One does not start saying that I'm offline, GMail only shows old messages and does not display pictures in already downloaded messages, Google account settings say I'm offline and information might be outdated. Chrome, YouTube and some third-party apps in contrast work well.\n\nI have tried applying the workaround for Android 7 and 8 and it did not help. I reached out to support and have done a lot of debugging steps on the phone itself with no luck. I then went onto an exhaustive journey of debugging the network configuration and I believe that there is a bug with Android 10 system with proxy auto-configuration code.\n\nI took an isolated testing lab machine and installed four applications on it - Apache 2, Nginx, Squid and Privoxy. Nginx and Apache 2 were used to serve PAC files and I have created vhosts that use the machine DNS hostname and the IP address as well, and tried using both modes for both servers on the phone. Privoxy and Squid were used as two proxy servers. I had five different PAC files: one pointing to Privoxy using a DNS, second pointing to Privoxy using an IP, third pointing to Squid using a DNS name, fourth pointing to Squid using an IP and the last one just using the \"DIRECT\" connection.\n\nNone of the above configurations worked with my Pixel 3. All of these configurations worked with other devices, including iPhone XS Max, 3rd gen. iPad 12.9\" Pro, Windows PC, Linux PC, macOS Mojave, Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge on Android 8 and Google Nexus 5X on Android 8.\n\nI then went further, and tried using the \"Manual\" proxy configuration on the Pixel 3 with Squid and Privoxy servers and both settings worked. This leads me to think that there is indeed a problem with Android proxy handling in auto-configuration mode.\n\nDid anyone else faced similar issues? Have you been able to resolve them, and if yes, how?\n\nCheers,\nGarry", "is_img": 0, "category": "Connectivity, Network, Bluetooth, Google Pixel 3", "post_time": "2019-11-16T08:05:49.654372+00:00", "reply": "0 Replies"}

At first, I thought that maybe it was just the cars I was driving at the time not being too great with Bluetooth on Android devices (iPhones seemed to always have this feature in my cars and it made me jealous of my friends a little from time to time). \n\nHowever, 3-4 cars down the line I find myself still stuck with this problem of only having the options of \"Next Song\", \"Previous Song\", \"Pause / Play\", and that's it. I thought the problem would then be that I was using Spotify instead of the phone's built-in music players; so I have switched from Spotify to Google Play Music as I currently use a Pixel 2 XL. This also hasn't fixed the issue though as I am still only given the same options. \n\nBut when two of my friends got in my car I let them connect their phones to cars to play music and oddly enough, they had a lot more features than I ever have with any of my Google phones. Both of my friends were able to shuffle, repeat, browse playlist and queue, and also select other playlists entirely. Those friends have a Samsung and an iPhone, meaning both Android and Apple devices are capable of the technology. It just seems that while I am very impressed with my Google phone so far, they are also very basic in terms of quality of life aspects. \n\nI'm here to ask if anyone knows any workarounds or ways to improve the features that a Pixel gives off as a media player when connected through Bluetooth? \n\nCheers.", "is_img": 0, "category": "Connectivity, Network, Bluetooth, Google Pixel 2", "post_time": "2019-09-29T20:18:09.394952+00:00", "reply": "1 Reply"}

Could it be improved? (comparison vs Pixel 4)", "content": "Hi All \n\nI'm user of a Pixel 2 and Pixel 4. \n\nI noticed that the Pixel 4 is very accurate (regarding the compass direction) in Europe old towns (like in Barcelona old quarters with very narrow streets).\n\nThis is the first phone that gives me a good accuracy here (at least so far). \nCompass is always 80-100% pointing in the right direction.\n\nI decided to compare Pixel 2 vs Pixel 4 and I noticed the following:\n\nWhen opening \"GPSTest\" app in the Pixel 2, only 1 default GALILEO Satellite appears. And then the phone basically stays with 1-2 satellites, but it struggles to find them. \n\nWhen opening \"GPSTest\" app in Pixel 4, more than 4-5 GALILEO Satellites appear right after launching the app. And then a few more might appear, but that probably is not that required.\n\nAnd finally: I also noticed that if I put Pixel 4 close to my Pixel 2 while the app is open, the Pixel 2 start to catch a lot of more galileo sattelites (Like if the Pixel 4 was enhancing the Pixel 2) --> Anyway, this last case,is weird, but I tried it two times only, maybe I need to try it more times, to confirm is not a placebo. (But the Pixel 2 didn't seem to catch lot of european sattelites by its own, without the Pixel 4 doing the same).\n\nNow my main question about all this topic is: \n\nIs it possible to add more gallileo sattelites to the Pixel 2 configuration? Perhaps this improves the bad the GPS accuracy in some european places? \nI think the Pixel 2 is missing some sattelites in some config file. Could be possible to increase the initial satellite count from 0/29 to 0/37 like the Pixel 4? \n\nI'm just trying to know if it's possible to improve the GPS accuracy in Europe with the Pixel 2. \n\nHere we have some screenshots. \n\n\nPixel 2 (when app starts, only 1 European satellite - so 0/29 instead 0/37): \n\n\nPixel 2 (after putting Pixel 4 and Pixel 2 using GPS together, or at least, after letting Pixel 2 use the GPS for some time): \n\n\nPixel 4 after opening the app (0/37): \n\n\n\nThanks\nSebastian", "is_img": 1, "category": "Connectivity, Network, Bluetooth, Google Pixel 2", "post_time": "2019-10-26T19:13:39.959313+00:00", "reply": "3 Replies"}

Basically, the connection seems to stop working very regularly even if my toolbar icons show me connected at full strength to an LTE network or a known, working WiFi network. Doesn't seem to matter if one of those two connection types is on or off on the phone, nor does it matter how strong the signal is reported by the phone.\n\nIt can happen in many apps but what usually happens is when I try to get some sort of data to the phone, without warning, whatever app it is just spends a long time trying to get the data it needs. In other words, YouTube videos will never start or move forward when this happens.\nWhen I open the MLB app, I can't even get the news page (which is basically a list of headlines). Or, maybe I have that app open and I read a couple of articles then tap to go listen to a game. Suddenly, the list of available audio feeds just doesn't load.\nIf I look at the Google News feed to the left of my main home screen, it's a crap shoot whether or not any article I tap on will actually load. Note: I am clicking on articles from major sites, not the clickbait, algorithm whores. The same can happen if I use the search bar Maybe results come up, maybe they don't and the process bar just stops at maybe  25% loaded.\n\nYou get the idea, but the worst example I can think of was from this weekend when I couldn't find my phone anywhere. I did the Where's My Phone stuff in Google from my laptop and although I got multiple rings before going to voicemail when I called from another phone (indicating it was turned on and ringing somewhere), Google could not connect to the phone to geolocate it for several tries. It also took a few tries to get actually get it to ring it constantly for five minutes. \n\nCurrently, I can't open Messages.Android.com/web on my laptop because it wants me to connect my phone to a network. But it is on a network, both wifi and LTE. I am sitting here at my kitchen table in the middle of Seattle. I have a strong signal.\n\nAny suggestions are welcome.

I've tried tenths of Music Player apps, including the ones that worked correctly in elder phones, also I've re-reviewed phone and stereo settings repeatedly.\n\nFurthermore, when you try to make phone calls, some phone information cannot be retrieved.  It's not possible to navigate thru call history using stereo dash (nor missed, neither recent) even if you make the call from the stereo... Nothing never appears on any registry. It's possible to navigate the address book, and see names and numbers (since I've correctly set address book permissions on both devices) but that's it so far...

Glad that DSDS was activated/ official for Pixel 3a series. After updating to Android 10 on release day, I tried to add esim to my phone to use 2 SIMs. \n\nOK, I tried using an esim from a carrier that specifically stated that they did not guarantee their eSIM will work with Pixel phones as they only supported the fruit phones. So with that in mind, I went ahead nevertheless and obtained the eSIM QR code from the carrier (\"Carrier 1\"). Followed the usual process to add eSIM: -\nSettings -> Network & Internet -> \"+\" Mobile Network -> \"Don't have SIM card\" -> \"Checking network info...\" -> camera automatically fired-up to scan the given QR code;\nscanned the QR code of Carrier 1; and\nreceived error message \"Networks not activated\".\n\nOK, fine.... Carrier 1 already said they did not guarantee their eSIM will work on Pixel.\n\nAnd after some forum discussions with fellow users in the same country who succesfully added esim to their Pixel 3 (not 3a) using other carriers who also specifically stated that they only supported the fruit phones, I decided to instead try another carrier's eSIM (\"Carrier 2\").\n\nPrior to trying to Carrier 2, these were the intervening matters: -\nnetwork settings (only) were reset, including checking the box to reset \"downloaded sims\"; and\nupdated apps - including \"SIM Manager\" by Google [current version D.1.5.73-google (5793666)].\n\nSo went to Carrier 2's store and requested their eSIM. Again, followed the usual process to add eSIM: - \nSettings -> Network & Internet -> \"+\" Mobile Network -> \"Don't have SIM card\" -> \"Checking network info...\" -> \ncamera DIDN'T fire-up at all to scan the given QR; and\nreceived error message \"Networks not activated\".\n After, the above, I reset the phone back to factory settings and tried again. Same result as per trying to add Carrier 2's eSIM above. NOT EVEN a chance to scan the QR code and was again and again informed \"Networks not activated\"...\n\nWhat seems to be the problem? Could it be the \"SIM Manager\" app's latest update?\n\nThanks in advance.", "is_img": 0, "category": "Connectivity, Network, Bluetooth, Google Pixel 3a XL", "post_time": "2019-09-17T04:09:50.710767+00:00", "reply": "1 Recommended Answer"}

Today I am feeling sorry for her vs. frustrated last night.\n\nBasically, I learned they do not support Pixel very well for automated media backup.\n\nThat's no surprise. Most automated backup/sync doesn't work how I expect/want, so finding a way to do it manually is my goal.\n\nTheir drag/drop or select from device are impractical (Pixel plugged into W7 laptop to access Pixel folders for Verizon Cloud doesn't respond to drag/drop. Selecting from menu only supports one file at a time & forgets what directory you were using every time).\n\nSo I tried to use Verizon Cloud Sync folder on the laptop. I was able to copy content to the VC Sync folder but their user interface is not very responsive or meaningful. It's very quick to tell you all Sync, Backup & Restore processes are completed. It says that by default. One time I saw it say it had completed file uploads, then how many files were awaiting processing. That number did not change overnight. I can understand it taking time, but either it wasn't working at all, or won't change status until the entire process is completed.

Therefore I tried to reinstall it through the play store. Then something super weird happened: all my photos and data seemed to have gone. They are still on my phone, somewhere, but my (Google?) applications can't detect them, so all the photos I've taken (camera as screenshots) just don't show up, I can't play music in the stock music player, nor take any new screenshots/photos.\n\nWhen I try to take a photo (with the stock camera app) or screenshot (by holding the power and volume key) it just says the memory is full, but it's clearly lying, since I can go in through the file browser and see there's space left. Also, all my personal ring tones, sounds, etc, have been replaced by some super weird stock ones (I presume; maybe even hard-coded midi files, by the sound of it...). The weird thing is that all other apps seem to work normally and I can, for example, take and receive photos with other apps.\n\nSince all the data is clearly all there, I wanted to connect to retrieve it, but I can't do that either. I went to the store to get professional help, but they said they couldn't connect to the device, although their computer did sense \"something\" was connected, but they didn't want to install new drivers and instead directed me to you.\n\nSo here I am: can you please help me connect my phone to a computer and then fix the problem with my stock apps? I was told by the store where I bought the phone it has been reported to happen because all the Google apps are connected with one another.\n\nI really to get help with this asap, because it's really embarrassing.

Another older Android phone (as well as my laptop), works fine as a client for the same hotspot.\n\nTemporary workaround, I have to:\n==========================================\n'Forget' the development device's access point\nRe-connect (re-typing password) to the access point\nWait several seconds until the ..Stay connected?` message appears and tap \"Yes\"\n\nSymptoms; Wi-Fi shows connected but:\n==========================================\nCan't SSH to the development device from the Pixel (using JuiceSSH)\nPhone has an IP yet can't ping the development device (192.168.43.1)\nPhone stays connected to the hotspot but status is:\n              Wi-Fi has no internet access\n      Tap for options\n\n           ..and the below status appears in the Android swipe-down menu:\n\n              This network has no internet access.

They have had minor inconveniences through out the entire year.    I am just now writing to you here because I am getting NOWHERE with Google help desk.    Here is my problems for both phones.  There have been several times they wouldn't connect to any WiFi router and then I noticed that some of the apps were running very slow.  It seems that after a factory update (at least every other one it seems) I need to reset our phones totally and use the backup to reinstall everything back on the phones.    The phones will automatically restart with NO action asking for it.   Now my biggest issue with my phone is that it is now taking over 10 hours to charge from 57% battery.   I have a screen shot of it telling me that it is going to take 15 hours to charge from 10%.   I have already tried cleaning out the charging port, and going through the Google automated line.  Lets just say that after going through all the steps to try and fix the problem, it left my phone in safe mode.  I had to yet again reset my phone.   I called and finally spoke to a human being that could not speak English very well, but he manged to tell me that I needed to give Google my phone and they would see why it was acting the way it is.  Oh, did I mention that that process was going to take 7 to 10 days?    We use our phones for work purposes and cannot be without them that long.   Again, I have contacted Google about my phone and not my wife's phone directly because of the issues we are having.  I figured if I could get the fix on my phone, than I could use the same fix on hers.   By this time, we just want to get away from these Pixel phones. In short, THESE THE WORST PHONES I HAVE EVER OWNED. I have been on a cell phone of one kind or another for over 20 years. \n       We were talked into them and have not liked them the entire time we have had them.   The customer service for Google is good, but they are more worried about making sure their product is seen in a good light instead of helping the actual customer out.     I am posting this exact message on every message board I can find.  All I am asking is to get out of these phones.   I will spread this negative message everyday until I get the results I am looking for.", "is_img": 0, "category": "Connectivity, Network, Bluetooth, Google Pixel 2", "post_time": "2019-07-08T17:50:26.577896+00:00", "reply": "1 Reply"}

On my old Pixel XL on Android 9, I get this system notification, and everything works as expected.\n\nHowever, on my Pixel 3A XL also running Android 9, this system notification never happens and it seems the connection doesn't fully establish, though again, it appears connected.  Data transfer will not work successfully.\n\nHas anyone else encountered this?

Again I DO NOT and WILL NOT have any internet access with this network because it is not needed.\n\nHere is my issue: when I connect to the network's wi-fi from my PIXEL 2, I type in the password and it connects to the network fine, but it does not recognize the device (mixer) on the network UNTIL I press \"yes\" when it asks if I want to \"stay connected to the network since it does not have internet access?\". That wouldn't be an issue, but when i disconnect the PIXEL 2 from the wireless network or the connection is interrupted, I will connect to the saved network for the second time but the notification for \"stay connected?\" never pops up, EVEN THOUGH I left the box for \"don't ask me again for this network\" UNCHECKED because I WANT it to ask again. It seems the PIXEL 2 does not look for devices on the network until AFTER I hit \"yes stay connected\", however when I connect to the network using my NEXUS 5X running android lollipop, it recognizes the device on the network RIGHT AWAY before the \"stay connected?\" notification even pops up. This is how I KNOW it is an issue with the PIXEL 2 SPECIFICALLY. Either that or there was a change to exactly WHEN android recognizes devices on a network that is not connected to the internet. (The Pixel 2 on Pie recognizes devices AFTER I hit \"yes stay connected\" as opposed to the nexus 5X on lollipop recognizing it BEFORE the pop up.) All I want is for the PIXEL 2 to do what my nexus 5X does. Look for devices BEFORE the \"stay connected?\" screen. Either that or actually ask me everytime I connect to the SAVED network. I was not able to get help from Pixel support and it should not matter that my mixer is a third party product because it is just a device with an IP address connected to the router through an ethernet cable and this all works like it should only on the PIXEL 2 I keep having to \"forget\" the network and reconnect with the password to get the \"stay connected?\" notification to pop up so I can hit \"yes\" and it finally will recognize the devices on the network. Both Google PIXEL and NEXUS 5X can see the device, but the Nexus 5X sees the devices on the network BEFORE it asks me to \"stay connected?\", while the pixel looks for it AFTER I hit \"yes\" which is a problem because it only asks me when I connect for the first time, never again unless I \"forget\" the network and start over. I would SO GREATLY appreciate some info on why this is an issue on the Pixel 2 and not the Nexus 5X, it is the same OS (stock android), just a different version.

On a fixed income, how do retired seniors, & US Military Veterans get their pay, & social security benefits, without  Internet Service in rural parts of the country & the price of inflated internet service, with monetary growth in mind for wall street profits, yet retired folks, millennials, veterans pay are on a fixed income & won't be able to keep up with inflated Internet Service!  \n\nAnother concern I have is, without Internet service, I would not be able to detach the Google Pixel 3a I am returning to Google, from my Google Account!  Currently I won't add any banking for this reason due to the security risks of a 3rd party accessing my financial account by law enforcement taking mobile computers!   I keep revisiting in my mind, when I was arrested,  & the local law enforcement had full access to my Google Account including Google Adsense & my Banking & all my passwords to other accounts! While I was in jail, I had no way to shut off my mobile computer from my Google Account! My husband said that should teach what not to write, & it serves me right!  He said he don't care about the First Amendment when what I say brings the police around!  He approves of violating the first amendment using censorship, because he is using it as a control mechanism to gas light, to yell & scream in a man baby fit of rage!   He threw me under the bus, & has threatened divorce, several times since I was arrested, after I used my youtube revenue to help pay for the house, when times were really good! When the police got a search warrant & my husband would not stand up for me, & defend my first amendment, & he told the police to keep me, the police then had my banking information, & youtube pay information!  HE even broke a new computer 2 weeks later, because I had to buy a new computer, not having a computer, over a video I made about discrimination in advertising!  The last time he threatened to break my computer equipment was about 4-6 weeks ago, when he was raging! Maybe its the medications or his medical issues, I don't know but he is over medicated & I have no help for him!  I have no place to share feedback, where I feel safe, away from, \"SPOUSE RETALIATION\", over how I feel!   For 14+ months, they have had my computer equipment,  confiscated for an on going investigation!  Funny how that works, when I was being carefree, thought I has a real relationship, but I see things a lot different now!  Why would I help pay for a house, if I knew 16 years ago, all he thought of our relationship is me as a throwaway renter, serving some sick twisted agenda of his, which he kept hidden!  How can someone you thought cared about you, disassociate so swiftly, due to his own discomfort, using it as control in a relationship?  \n\nThank you to those who have shown me something different, & empowered my life education to my 2nd marriage because it was not at all what I thought!  If I would have know this, I would have put the $366,000+ I earned on youtube in to the bank, instead of buying the house in a fema flood zone & paying off vehicles! Hindsight is 20/20!  That way I could have quietly left, which is what he has told me to do on several occasions!  I am just at a point of indifference towards marriage & indentured servitude thru marriage, which violates the 13th amendment, & is slavery!", "is_img": 0, "category": "Connectivity, Network, Bluetooth, Google Pixel 3 XL", "post_time": "2019-06-18T18:37:31.890553+00:00", "reply": "4 Replies"}

{"url": "https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/7822972/anyone-else-having-issues-connecting-to-lte-and-receiving-mms-messages-with-pixel-3-on-att?hl=en", "title": "Anyone else having issues connecting to LTE and receiving MMS messages with Pixel 3 on ATT?", "content": "I've had a Pixel 3 on ATT essentially since launch. Everything was working find till about 1 month ago when I started having issues connecting to LTE and receiving MMS messages. \n\nFor the LTE connection, this issue is in initial connection eg after turning off WiFi, or leaving wifi range, or leaving a dead zone (underground garage) the phone has difficulty connecting and shows \"No internet\". Sometimes it reconnects in a few minutes but sometimes it takes 30+ minutes. I havent found any solutions to get it to reconnect quickly: not toggling airplane mode or mobile data on and off, not restarting, not resetting network connections...nothing.\nOnce the phone eventually connects to LTE the data connection works fine and stays stably connected until I either go into a dead zone (eg underground parking lot) or connect to WiFi -- so the trouble really just seems to be with the initial connection.  Also, when the LTE isn't connecting i can still make and receive phone calls without any difficulty.\n\nFor MMS messages, I apparently have been missing missing a bunch of messages and even when i get them they are extremely delayed.  This issue started at the exact same time as the LTE issue, but seems to be independent of the LTE status--it happens whether or not the LTE is connected.  I seem to be able to send MMS messages without issues and send and receive SMS issues without any issues.\n\nBoth of these issues started at the same time. I live in a large urban area with good ATT signal. My wife does not have any of these issues in the same areas on her iPhone. I have found posts on Reddit and the ATT community forums where people describe similar issues. \n\nUnfortunately, both AT&T and Google support have been of little help.\n\nGoogle support asked me to:\n--Install the latest system updates (I was already updated to May and since the problem has been going on for so long I have subsequently installed the June security update)\n--Reset network settings\n--Uninstall updates to a variety of system apps including google connectivity services, pixel launcher, pixel ambient services (I don't remember the complete list anymore but I followed their instructions precisely)\n--Check APN setting with my carrier (were already consistent with recommended settings).\n\nAT&T support:\n--Checked that my IMEI number matched (it already did)\n--Manually re-provisioned my IMEI (I think multiple times now)\n--Re-verified my APN settings again\n--Some AT&T support agents have suggested replacing my SIM while others say this would not help (I haven't done this yet but supposedly they are shipping me a replacement SIM -- but I really don't see how this could be the issue)\n\nBased on Reddit/AT&T community forum posts i have also tried:\n--Disabling developer options\n--Disabling enhanced 4G LTE mode\n--Switching between 3G and LTE (as the preferred network type)\n\nI think at the heart of it neither AT&T nor Google will truly acknowledge this issue -- they both act like I am the only one having this problem even when I point them to the articles, reddit posts and ATT posts. This is extremely disappointing when they have both advertised compatibility between the Pixel 3 and the ATT network.\n\nGoogle has now offered to replace my device under warranty, but of course they only offer a refurbished replacement and its not even clear to me if its a hardware issue -- some people seem to report ongoing issues even after getting replacements.  Has anyone else here experienced the issues that I'm having?  If so, did a replacement solve the issue?  Maybe if enough people report this problem on the google boards we can draw their attention to the issue and get some response (when i point to reddit they say they are not \"able to comment on the content and issues specified on the third party websites\").", "is_img": 0, "category": "Connectivity, Network, Bluetooth, Google Pixel 3", "post_time": "2019-06-11T12:20:04.612176+00:00", "reply": "3 Replies"}

Some time later (5 minutes?), the data connection drops, as does bluetooth. Sometimes I'm able to reconnect by unlocking the Pixel and telling it to reconnect to the previous device (not while riding, of course), other times, the phones won't reconnect for quite a while (too many attempts doing some kind of timeout multiplier?), but since there's no real information given why a device does or doesn't connect, I don't really know.\n\nI'm guessing that what's happening with the dropout is that bluetooth is either turning off or the hotspot is turning off on the Pixel.

I would turn the speaker on and music would play for about 3 seconds before the music would stop. I tried to follow the exact instructions to reconnect the device to my phone, but still it would not work. I could only get it to work if I turned my phone off and on again.\n\nAfter several days of doing this, I went to the Bluetooth Device Details for my speaker. I turned off Phone Calls and suddenly my speaker started playing music again. I didn't think anything of it again as the speaker was pretty cheap, so I figured there was some weird thing off in the speaker.\n\nTurns out, I was wrong. For the first time in about a month I tried to listen to music using my Pixel Buds as well and the same thing was happening: music would play for a few seconds and then stop. I went in to the Device Details for the Buds and turned off Phone Calls and it started working again. However, doing this also made it so I can't control my music with gestures on the Buds.\n\nI can understand issues with a cheap speaker, but for a pair of expensive ear buds that were designed specifically to work with the Pixel 2 is a bit much.

The Pixel 2 works fine except for seemingly slow mobile data.  I moved the sim from the 2 to the 3.  Then both wifi and mobile data would constantly reset.  Replaced sim, 5 factory resets, troubleshot at the carrier and with Google support which authorized a replacement.  After thinking about the issue, I turned off LTE on the 3 and everything starting working.  Before this, the 2 never showed LTE but the 3 would on occasion.\nI know the 3 has added some bands that the 2 didn't have which probably allowed the 3 to attempt LTE.  I have seen a setting on the 3 something like Enable Carrier Aggregation Mode but I can no longer find it.  I know that US carrier aggregation is not compatible with Thai bands.  I have a feeling that the CA setting only appears if LTE is connected.  Since turning LTE on is so unstable that I can not get it to show LTE for more than a few seconds.\nTherefore, how can I turn off the Carrier Aggregation mode if I cannot keep LTE on long enough?\nI could be wrong, but I believe that would solve the issue and still give me better performance than my current 3G setting.", "is_img": 0, "category": "Connectivity, Network, Bluetooth, Google Pixel 3", "post_time": "2019-05-12T22:49:33.327318+00:00", "reply": "0 Replies"}

When I look at the system alerts it shows that the phone thinks a USB connection is present, even when there is no cable connected.

The USB Preference shows USB controlled by connected device, and selecting \"this device\" fails.  I have tested multiple USB cables, charges, battery packs, PCs, etc all with the same result and all working fine on other android phones\n\nI reached out to Google support who verified this should not be the case and talked me through some settings that have now allowed me to manually toggle the USB preference to \"This Device\" when a cable is connected, allowing me to charge or use the android auto.  Unfortunately I have to make this change manually every time I connect the phone which is still not right.\n\nI installed the May updates today, hoping it would address this issue, but nothing has changed.  I have also turned off Battery Saver and Adaptive Battery as this helped some Pixel 2 users with similar issues, but had no affect on my phone.\n\nI know this is not an isolated issue as there are several similar threads, I am hoping someone has a better solution than Google telling me that \"it shouldn't be like that\" and attributing the issue to user error.", "is_img": 0, "category": "Connectivity, Network, Bluetooth, Google Pixel 3", "post_time": "2019-05-07T21:38:03.967929+00:00", "reply": "0 Replies"}

But the problem is, the phone will not connect to the network. It says I have no bars,  and when I try to make calls it says to turn off airplane mode, yet airplane mode is not on. \n\nThings I have tried : \n\nTaking the sim out and cleaned it. No fix.\n\nUsing a different sim from a boost phone. This worked, of course it wouldn't let me use the service because my IMEI wasn't on the boost account.  But it read the sim and tried to configure network. So I know it can read sim cards. I did try to put the IMEI on the boost account and it said \"this phone isn't eligable for swap\" or something like that. Hmmm.\n\nI have tired factory resetting. Wiped it clean. Still no luck . \n\nThe att worker said the IMEI and the apn were correct, but I suspect he may have made an error. Because this doesn't make any sense.\n\nI have done *#*#4636*#*# and checked mobile radio on. It didn't change anything. I have also looked at preferred network type and it says unknown.\n\nIf I go into sim status, it says :\n\nNetwork unknown\n\nPhone number on sim unknown\n\nMobile network state disconnected\n\nService state radio off (even though I've checked mobile radio on)\n\nSignal strength 0\n\nMobile voice network type unknown\n\nMobile data network type unknown\n\nRoaming not roaming\n\nEID unknown.\n\n\nThere is also no option in the phone for Wi-Fi calling. \n\nIf I do *#*#4636*#*# I get this info:\n\nSet preferred network type : it gives me dozens of options, but when I restart the phone to apply the change it just goes to unknown.\n\nIf I run a Ping test all 3 categories pass.\n\nSmsc refresh and update both bring up refresh error.\n\nThere is a button that says toggle DNS check and next to it it says 0.0.0.0\n\nCall info refresh rate just goes back to disabled no matter what I set it to.\n\nPlease help me.

So, I want to use, specially the USB-A to USB-C to connect my phone to my computer and transfer files and use Android's \"adb and fastboot\" utilities.   Can that cable be used safely with the Pixel 3 XL ?\n\nWhat about the OG Pixel XL charger ?  It seems to be also a 18W charger.  Is it functionally identical to the charger that comes bundled with a brand new Pixel 3 XL ?  Can it be safely used with the Pixel 3 XL ?\n\nLastly, the OG Pixel XL  USB-C to USB-C  charging cable... same thing,  can this be used with the PIxel 3 XL ?\n\nOf course I am interested in engineering/science grounded answers,  not on beliefs or \"I think that\" answers... we need truthful info here as to not fry a brand new Pixel 3 XL !

The problem is that the DAC/AMP will not produce any sound.\n\nEverything that I have tried:\n\nI am using a Satechi \u2013 Aluminum Type C Mobile Pro Hub. This is so I can both charge and send data to the DAC/AMPs.\n\nI have three DAC/AMPs\n1)      Moshi - USB-C Digital Audio Adapter with Charging\n2)      Focusrite - SCARLETT SOLO\n3)      JDS Labs \u2013 The Element\n\nBoth1 and 2 are both USB powered devices, while the 3 has an external power supply.\n\nBoth 1 and 2 work with my phone, while 3 kind of works.\n\nWhen I connect my phone to 3 I believe the phone recognizes the DAC/AMP. This is because when I try to play music the phone speakers do no turn on. Also, if I disconnect 3 from my phone the music player on my phone pauses the music.\n\nThe problem that I have is that when I plug in my headphones into 3 while playing music on my phone there is no sound. I have ruled out the hub as a problem because it works fine with 2 and when using it to connect 3 to my computer.\n\nFrom what I have seen it seems to be a problem with Android and how it handles externals DAC/AMPs.\n\nBoth 1 and 2 are USB powered, thus the phone is sending both audio information and power. At the software level, Android knows this and thus does not turn on the phone speakers when playing music, but rather send the signal to the DAC/AMP.\n\n3 uses an external power supply, so it does not need power for the USB connection. Thus, the phone only needs to send audio information. At a software level, the phone seems the understand that a DAC/AMP is connected and thus does not turn on the phone speakers when playing music. However, the phone also does not seem to be sending any audio information to the DAC/AMP.\n\nFor this simple analysis, it seems that Android will only send audio information to a DAC/AMP if the DAC/AMP also is powered by the same connection.", "is_img": 0, "category": "Connectivity, Network, Bluetooth, Google Pixel 2", "post_time": "2019-03-12T22:50:20.018715+00:00", "reply": "0 Replies"}

I use OpenVPN to connect back to my home network when I travel.  Usually this is done via the 4G hotspot provided by a mobile device I'm carrying.\n\nRecently upgraded to the Pixel 3 XL and found that when tethered to that hotspot, I cannot connect to my OpenVPN instance at home if I use UDP.  The initial handshake packet doesn't even reach the router (looking at packet captures).  Where as if I put my SIM card into an iPhone or a Nexus 5X/6, it works just fine.\n\nWhen I've tested other OpenVPN connections, I get the same results if using UDP.\n\nNow have to resort to TCP, which makes Windows RDP completely unusable because of the overhead via TCP.\n\nI've been scouring the internet trying to find somewhere to submit a bug report to Google...

The EarStudio app clearly shows the call in progress, and the Phone app shows the call as being routed via Bluetooth to the EarStudio, but no call audio is heard on the headset and no audio is sent from the headset's microphone.  The issue also affects other apps that can use a Bluetooth headset for calls, such as Skype or Slack.  Calling works fine if I do not attempt to use a Bluetooth headset but instead use the built-in speaker and microphone in the phone.\n\nA2DP audio (e.g. streaming Spotify tracks to the EarStudio) works fine from the Pixel 2XL, I can hear music on the headset.\nThe Bluetooth section of the Settings app shows 'Phone calls' as being enabled for the EarStudio.\nThe EarStudio works fine for calls using the HFP Bluetooth profile on other devices, I have paired it with an iPhone and also a laptop and it works correctly with those devices.\nThe EarStudio worked fine for calls on the January Android 9 security update, and all previous versions of Android I have had on the Pixel 2 XL.

An example would be any available Wi-Fi perhaps a laundromat, airport, campus or anything of the sort. Google is number one and let's see if there's a way to make cool things happen like this!

I have made sure the media option was turned on for my speaker on my phone. My next problem comes into play here. When I adjust my sound using the buttons on the side of my phone it shows I'm adjusting ringer volume and not media volume. The media volume slide does come up next to it in a darkened tone. When connected to a device it the media slider does not have the Bluetooth symbol as it previously had. These are new problems for me this phone has paired with this speaker and played music many times before and the sound buttons used to adjust media and I'd have to go into settings to adjust ringer volume. Any suggestions are helpful because I'm at a loss!", "is_img": 0, "category": "Connectivity, Network, Bluetooth, Google Pixel 3", "post_time": "2019-01-23T15:55:11.937613+00:00", "reply": "1 Reply"}
