It still works for my friend who has the exact same phone and the assistant language German.\n\nI hope someone can help me with this.", "is_img": 1, "category": "Google Assistant and Voice Actions, Google Pixel 3a", "post_time": "2021-05-27T04:52:45.452409+00:00", "reply": "1 Reply"}

I have also tried unlinking the Spotify account and linking it again.\n\nI'm not sure what else is best be to try but I've just upgraded from the Pixel 2 and it was working flawlessly on there.", "is_img": 0, "category": "Google Assistant and Voice Actions, Google Pixel 4a (5G)", "post_time": "2020-11-30T20:21:06.105354+00:00", "reply": "2 Replies"}

The problem only occurs when starting the Assistant via voice. However, when I click in the search field in the Google app and then ask for a search via voice, it works fine. So the problem is in the handoff from saying OK Google to getting the Assistant to listen and respond. You might say this is Not OK Google!

The biggest issue is with the touchscreen that is oversensitive now and results in a million of fathom presses per minute. That aside, I just noticed another quirky thing today. \nIn the morning, when the alarm goes off, it automatically triggers a routine of providing details on the day's tasks, weather, and alike, and then it starts playing news. All worked fine until the update. Today, the routine started as usual, but when it came to news, the management window for it (pause, fast forward, etc) just didn't appear in the notification area at all! There it was, Google Assistant's voice reading news with no possibility whatsoever to control it. I have around 30 news sources going that way, which results in literally hours of news, and usually I just stop 15-25 minutes into it from the above-mentioned management panel in the notification area. As the window seems missing now, I just had to restart the phone to shut up those news. Anyone else with the same issue?\n\nP.S. General afterthought on the update. I found myself to be a die-hard fan of clean Android and Google recently, and I've been recommending all my friends to switch to Android. Now this update came, and it has so many bugs that frankly left me shocked. It feels like a throwback into nightmares of 2010s, when Android on third-manufacturer devices was so buggy it was barely usable.  Clean Android is awesome for everyday use, but I only now realized it's the first major update I received since my romance with Google's devices. And no, it's no better than those old days when an update would introduce more bugs than good features. Really, Google? You disappointed me so much that I started to think about switching to iPhone instead - and that comes from a person who is never ever said one good word about Apple in her entire life. Heck, I was given a free iPhone X twice in the last 6 months, and both times I ended up giving it up after 2 weeks and buying Pixels (3a and now 4a) instead. \nYeah, I know Google is going to fix these bugs soon, but just the general attitude of pushing an update that is half-baked and making customers struggle for several days is what makes me think about my choice of phones for the future. With Apple, I won't enjoy the simplicity and customization Android has to offer, but I won't struggle after each update either.

But I keep running into one annoying problem on the 4a that wasn't an issue on the 2.\n\nWhen I leave the house with my Bluetooth ear buds on to walk the dog or go for a run or whatever, I like to use the button on ear buds to trigger Google Assistant to do various things: lock the front door, close the garage door, play some music, etc. This was never a problem with the Pixel 2. However, I am frequently running into an issue on the Pixel 4a where Assistant quickly turns off without responding when launched from Bluetooth. The cause appears to be that launching the newer version of Assistant this way always turns on the screen, and with the phone in my pocket I believe something is touching the screen and canceling the Assistant. I never have an issue when the phone isn't in my pocket. \n\nIs there any sort of setting to tell Assistant to not turn the screen on when launched from Bluetooth? I shouldn't have to take my phone or if my outfit to launch Assistant.", "is_img": 0, "category": "Google Assistant and Voice Actions, Google Pixel 4a", "post_time": "2020-08-29T03:17:38.542498+00:00", "reply": "0 Replies"}

If I minimize google maps, the voice command works fine and will actually ask if I want to end navigation before I start the new route.\n\nGoogle support has just said they would send it up the line and asked me to send feedback via the google maps app and google assistant app.  The issue still persists and I'm able to reproduce it on a freshly factory reset Pixel 4 and on other Pixel 4s.", "is_img": 0, "category": "Google Assistant and Voice Actions, Google Pixel 4 XL", "post_time": "2020-04-29T11:45:23.692829+00:00", "reply": "5 Replies"}

Having a earbud headphone plugged in with a microphone on it results in the volume (most often) going down to mute automatically, sometimes up.....and with the ok google / google assistant being throttle triggered. This behavior persists with the phone screen off and with various permissions removed.\nThis issue is not the result of dirty or malfunctioning headphones and doesn't appear to be a faulty headphone jack either. Headphones work perfectly fine in mulitple phones including my wife's identical original pixel running the same exact OS version (android 10). I also tested with multiple different branded headphones all have caused the same issue. I went and grabbed a non-mic 99 cent pair of headphones (harder and harder to find) and the issue does not persist.\n\nI ordered a replacement headphone jack that appeared brand new (ebay purchase) and replaced it and thought that would be the end of my problems. The issue persisted after replacing with a new jack.\nSince I replaced the jack, as well as tested multiple headphones and confirmed the issue does not exist with a non-mic headphone, this must mean that there is some software confliction going on that is driving my phone crazy due to mic input.\n\nI have spent the last week googling various situations (faulty headset, ok google randomly occuring, volume up/down during audio playback, etc) and tried a dozen + different solutions.\nIf I remove microphone permission from the \"google\" it does not resolve the issue. It does prevent me from using voice to text however, which to me is a essential function of the phone. This part confuses me. There must be a separate permission that handles the microphone through the headphone. I've looked up the various ways to disable the \"ok google\" function but none of them appear to stop the behavior.\n\nHere are some screenshots showing exactly how annoying this issue is -\nhttps://imgur.com/a/xwOayZU\n\nThe first two images are examples of what happens when I deny google microphone permissions. Instead of just blocking it, it just constantly nags me to enable permissions but not only does it nag in the notification pull down it also nags with audio....so it is impossible to listen to music. I installed volume lock to prevent audio volume from being changed thinking I was being smart, only to find out that the constant ok google nag interrupts the audio.\n\nThe 3rd image is what happens if I disable voice assistant from google > settings > assistant tab > assistant device (pixel)\n\nIt still does the same thing, except instead of giving me the standard ok google response it just pops it up and asks for me to enable permission. Such a worthless feature (permission management) if the same exact problem occurs when you refuse to give it permissions.\n\nIf anyone has any idea's for me to try, please advise, I've spent weeks on this now and im completely out of idea's. I love the phone. I love my headjack port. I don't want a new phone....I can replace this phone's screen for $25 if I break it, parts are dirt cheap and its a easy phone to repair.

To summarize, I have called google every day since last Friday, luckily I still have a land line to call them with. I have spoken with very nice operators who tell me that their tool that generates the RMA to email me a return label is failing when they try to enter my information.

Additionally, every night the support person promises to send me an email status (after asking for my mobile number, duh! my phone is dead) and I have yet to receive any information from google. Does anyone know what I can do next?

Very convenient.\n\nRecently I paired the phone with a new pair of Google 3 earbuds (my original pair was broken), and after the setup I found that the earbud buttons can be used to control Google Assistant. For example when new notifications come in, I can press the top button to listen to the notification, without taking the phone out of my pocket, which is very cool.\n\nBut then I bump into another problem: nowadays when I listen to ebooks in the @Voice Aloud Reader app, and press the middle button to pause the ebook, next time I press the middle button the ebook doesn't resume, instead the audio news starts playing. This often forces me to stop whatever I'm doing, take the phone out of the pocket, and manually close the Google app, to resume the ebook.\n\nIs there an easy way to make the middle button only pause/resume the ebook in @Voice,  instead of always triggering the audio news? Or do I have to completely turn off the earbuds control with Google Assistant, to get back the convenience to pause/resume ebooks in @Voice with the middle button?", "is_img": 0, "category": "Google Assistant and Voice Actions, Google Pixel 3", "post_time": "2019-07-22T00:44:10.423183+00:00", "reply": "7 Replies"}

Assistant triggers when I take pixel 2 xl out of my pocket even w/ max sqz setting", "content": "I recently got a new Pixel 2XL under warranty. This new phone triggers Google assistant whenever I take the phone out from my pocket. I have been experimenting and observing this for a week now. I'm talking hours of obsession - including factory resets to experiment with fresh settings. I can (95% or more often) reproduce the problem with no fingerprints (to ensure I'm not accidentally hitting that sensor - but the problem exists with or without fingerprints) and Squeeze sensitivity at the max - but doesn't matter what the sensitivity is.\n\nWith the phone on and screen unlocked*, I can turn the phone off, turn it upside down, rest the top edge on of the now upside down phone on a table, with the back of the phone resting on my index finger (far away from the fingerprint sensor) and wait some time for the ambient display to turn off - basically simulating the phone being in my pocket. When the ambient display turns off, I gently hold the phone so as not to trigger the Active Edge, lift the phone up and hold it flat like you would when taking it our of the pocket. When the display turns on the Google assistant pops up.\n\nAlso, I am pretty sure this issue has something to do with the Always on ambient display, because if you turn it off in settings, then the screen won't wake when you take the phone out of your pocket and the assistant won't appear. If you do have ambient display on, simply picking it up from the table when it is \"ambient\" on will not trigger the assistant. It has to come out of your pocket - or simulated pocket as per above.\n\nLastly, prior to breaking my old phone I know I turned off Ambient display and did not use it the past year because at the time i did not like it. When I got this new one I thought I'd give it a try. So that is why ran into this issue.\n\n*\"the phone on and screen unlocked\" --- during my \"testing\" I noticed that if I did not start from this state, I could not reliably reproduce the problem. For example if the phone was off and flat on the table with the ambient display on, sometimes when I rested the top edge on the table to simulate being in my pocket and then lifted it, i could not trigger the assistant . . . but sometimes I could . So, i don't really know what the exact initial states needs to be to get assistant to trigger - it happens to me 95% or more of the time and I know I'm not accidentally triggering active edge.\n\n-------------\n:-) And if you read this far you probably think I'm crazy. Oh well, I hope someone can reproduce this issue too. If not then I'd have to guess my new phone is broken and send it back.again.", "is_img": 0, "category": "Google Assistant and Voice Actions, Google Pixel 2", "post_time": "2019-07-18T14:47:06.646805+00:00", "reply": "2 Replies"}
