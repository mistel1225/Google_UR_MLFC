All of my frequent callers (e.g. family members) hear a dial/ring tone. If I test from my desk landline I hear no ringing sound, and have had this issue confirmed by several others including my carrier.\n\nI've tried troubleshooting with the carrier (including SIM replacement which has not solved the issue) and have an open case with them but I am wondering if this is a known issue and any possible solutions?\n\nTo be very clear - the phone rings at my end and I am able to answer the call as normal.

I have learned that I can switch to a Bluetooth headset and so far every time that works. So I am using that as a work around in the meantime.\n\nThis is a new issue that has recently started after doing a factory reset of my phone in an attempt to resolve another issue. Calls for some callers on the same carrier will always present the issue, and for other callers it is an inconsistent issue (yet to be seen if it is a consistent issue once it starts).\n\nWhat I have tried so far: I have already done a factory reset (but can do again if I must), I have cleared the phone app cache and storage, tried turning Bluetooth off (issue still present), removed all Bluetooth devices and then reconnected, and removed any app that I could live without. The only Bluetooth devices that are paired now are my Plantronics V5200 headset and a Garmin Fenix 5X.\n\nNext to try is to answer and switch to speaker phone as a test.\n\nAny ideas or suggestions are welcome. Hoping to resolve this and upgrade to a Pixel 6 later this fall but if it cannot be resolved I may need to purchase a Samsung device before the Pixel 6 is released. My phone must be reliable as a phone above anything else and right now it is not.\n\nThanks!\n\nFrank", "is_img": 0, "category": "Contacts, Calls, Voicemail, Google Pixel 2", "post_time": "2021-06-02T16:44:44.654378+00:00", "reply": "4 Replies"}

The call's sound comes out through the upper speaker at a normal phone call level, obviously not loud enough for talking over video chat.\n\nThe problem is remedied by turning off bluetooth, even mid chat. Once bluetooth is off, the bottom speaker immediately turns on, usually with the volume set very low and needing to be turned up.\n\nI suspect there is an internal issue with identifying what speaker should be playing, because in regular phone calls the UI allows for a three-way selection of sound source: 1) Phone 2) Speakerphone 3) Bluetooth (watch); however in video calls there is only an off/on button for the speakerphone.\n\nI searched forums for anyone else experiencing this issue but did not identify it. Though I suspect this may just be because of the difficulty of describing the issue in a succinct enough manner to find the appropriate search keywords.\n\nIt is mostly just an annoyance as I can fix it as needed, but any solution would be appreciated, thanks.", "is_img": 0, "category": "Contacts, Calls, Voicemail, Google Pixel 5", "post_time": "2021-03-09T22:47:09.40187+00:00", "reply": "0 Replies"}

But my bill was getting insane.  I had some months of our bill approaching $600!  So, I started dropping lines to get it down.

Think I'm a pixel guy now.  But, the pixel has the option when people call you that it will prompt the caller to state who's calling and why.

Even if the device is set to \"vibrate\" \"silent\" \"do not disturb\" or \"low volume.\"\n\nOn Pixel 3, there is only the option to make it so that if your phone is on \"do not disturb\" your Favorite contacts calling will still make the phone ring. Useful for if you're going to sleep maybe, or in a meeting.\n\nHOWEVER, very often I leave my phone on vibrate or low volume. Sometimes though, you miss a call when you don't feel it vibrating, or its laying on a desk where the vibration can't be felt and you're away from table. Or being on a low volume can be too low for you to hear phone if you're somewhere noisy. Even if most of the time (like 80-90% you catch the call, there's 10-20% of time where you miss it because it wasn't ringing on loud when a particular person, ie: girlfriend, called).\n\nThis means that occasionally, I miss calls from my girlfriend, and she gets pissed. I'd imagine a good number of other girlfriends/wives may also face this issue of not having their calls to their men sound a loud alert so guys never miss the call...\n\niPhone has this \"girlfriend/wife mode\" feature, please replicate it on Pixel. Otherwise I can't get Pixel 4 and have to switch to an iPhone...\n\nI already checked app store for an app to do this.

Over the past month or more (maybe since an update? I'm not sure), it happens EVERY time to those same contacts when they 1) send me an MMS (pic, gif, etc) or 2) are on a groupt text.  I can send texts normally, but the problems arise when they respond.\n1)  Weird thing is their SMS and MMS normally shows up in the same text thread (almost like there's 3 ppl in the group) and sometimes shows up as a separate thread, but either way the SMS shows up as them (ie their contact pic, correct contact info), but the MMS texts just show up as the 044 # as if it's a stranger.\n2) When I create a group text (2+ people) it goes out normally, but when anyone on the thread responds, it creates a new thread with the 044 # instead of the contacts real #.\n\nI called Verizon and had a nice guy help with trying to research but he was just google searching like me.  I've tried the below to no avail:\n1) Erasing the contact completely from my phone & from contacts.google.com\n2) IT 101 stuff: making sure OS is up to date, restarting device (I really don't want to \"factory reset\" without good logic behind that, grr)\n3) checked the \"region\" settings. It's set to \"automatic\" and says  \"Automatically Detected (United States)\"\n\nThanks in advance for help!

And, honestly, I see other people saying this issue is happening on Pixel 4s too so while I like Pixel I'm not sure I could go Google again when the most important features of a PHONE aren't working.\n\nThanks for advice.", "is_img": 0, "category": "Contacts, Calls, Voicemail, Google Pixel 3", "post_time": "2020-11-20T16:01:41.561596+00:00", "reply": "1 Reply"}

I'm looking for advice on how to fix these issues. List as follows\n\nFirst update to android 11:\nspotify wouldnt close\nsirius xm wouldnt open or close\nchrome wouldnt close or would crash randomly\nwouldnt receive texts randomly from people. not all the time just a random text here or there. i use the built in messages app for texting\nphone wouldnt connect to wifi sometimes. it would say its connected but i actually had to signal\ni couldnt make wifi change to a different network\nphone wouldnt connect to data when i turned off wifi\nbluetooth on my hands free headset wouldnt work sometimes but other times it did. bluetooth in my car worked fine though all the time? (like pausing or skipping songs)\nAll the issues above could be temporarily fixed by rebooting the phone. usually needed to do so about 3-4 times per day. So I was running out of patience waiting for updates to fix this and decided to factory reset.\nAfter factory reset some issues are solved for now. These still remain:\nfirst and foremost I GET HALF TEXTS NOW FOR NO REASON!?!?!?! I will literally get the end of a text but not the first part of it so it makes it a BIT confusing????\nSpotify still doesnt work properly, wont close sometimes, displays wrong song thats playing\nbluetooth headset still fails to pause and skip songs correctly\nchrome now refuses to reload a webpage when it has downloaded it for offline use (this is a new feature since factory reset)\nThis is all the new issues since the factory reset (I did this about 2 days from time of writing) and I am completely fed up with this update. Like really? I get that the 3rd party app issues are probably not Google's domain to fix but MESSAGES??? The main function of a cellphone is to contact people through voice or text and the one that is used most is now VERY unreliable!!!!\n\nI'm sick of this update and I've only had it for about 2 weeks now. I'm at a loss for what to do next because as far as I can tell I've done everything short of getting a new phone. Which is what... 1 year old? Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!", "is_img": 0, "category": "Contacts, Calls, Voicemail, Google Pixel 4 XL", "post_time": "2020-10-09T00:03:16.580104+00:00", "reply": "1 Reply"}

I am not using a headphone or bluetooth speaker just plain handheld phone call not on speaker (think: deaf person!).\n\nLong story short, I received the phone on 9/24/20 and followed all the steps to insert SIM, connect to WiFi, copy content from my old phone via cable, let it update all my apps, etc.  \nIt is running Android 10.   \n\nSo I just wondered if this possibly needed Android 11 to work, and since my phone said an update was available...

Is it a bug?  Or am I just missing the right steps to accomplish this?\n\nI do love this phone, but it is frustrating not being able to identify what the notification without having to look at the phone each time.\n\nNO THIS IS NOT A DUPLICATE, there is another similar thread, but it is LOCKED without a Solution - which is useless if you actually want resolution to this issue.", "is_img": 0, "category": "Contacts, Calls, Voicemail, Google Pixel 4 XL", "post_time": "2020-08-19T13:27:33.4555+00:00", "reply": "3 Replies"}

My phone is connected to my headphones for calls (but I don't necessarily know that for certain).\n\n2. I begin dialing, but dialpad tones sound through the phone speaker, which makes me think I may not be BT connected. \n\n3.

So every time I dial, I have a heart-stopping moment of Uh oh, I'm not on bluetooth, I better rip these headphones off before someone answers!\n\nSounds trivial, but my headphones (Bose 700) are multi-device and switch from one sound source to another, so it's possible it's not a BT call. I'd like the dial tones to sound though BT (so I'm reassured my phone is actually using my headphones), and I'd like to see some visual confirmation *before* the call actually connects. I know I can check \"Connected devices\" before initiating each call, and that's what I end up doing because I'm paranoid.

Why?", "content": "How does a Canadian subscriber to carrier Telus Mobility activate ...\n\nAUTOMATIC CALL SCREENING, and \nEmergency 911 automated automobile crash detection and automated dialing to 911 with conveyance of GPS spatial coordinates.\n\nGoogle is doing some very remarkable things and not with the intention of making money.\n\nSo I have no objection to Google and their surveillance device on me as long as these features are available to me.  I'm very fond of their Pixel lineup of phones even though it would be great if they had a stylus.  If they did Samsung could go peel potatoes with its Notes.\n\nI have to really bow in respect for what Google is doing now and I now have a very favorable opinion of them.  I thought their location tracking was an invasion of privacy and you know what? ... it worked to my advantage when some creep doctor denied that I was at his office on a certain day at a certain time and I shoved the phone in his face.\n\nBut what's killing me is that these new safety services are not available to me and my question is why and if there is a hack, a hack that Google will not object to.\n\nOther questions\n\nWho changed Voice 2 of the Google Assistant?\nWe have manual call screening in Canada and suddenly Voice 2 changes to one that is less pleasant.  Put the original back per favor.\n\nWhy is Wi-Fi necessary to activate Google Call Screen after a power off situation resulting from Battery to 0?\n\nThis cannot be a regulatory issue with automatic not available in this frozen Arctic tundra because we had a very similar feature called Who's Calling on wireline TWENTY YEARS AGO.\n\nIt was developed by Nortel on their Digital Multiplex System 100.\n\nIt intercepted all calls from unknown and private callers and asked them to state their names.\n\nDMS would proxy the call to the end subscriber and offer him disposition options.\n\nIt later changed.  If you were calling private you had to press a key on a Digitone telephone to release the number ... the number is always transmitted regardless of whether the call is private or not ... there is simply a privacy indicator that is turned on or off.\n\nOn the unknown you would have to actually key in your number using a touch-tone set and then DMS would relay that number to the subscriber telephone with a greater than sign  on the name line to indicate that the call might be spoofed.\n\nSo then we called that person back at that number to verify that that was accurately entered as the true number.\n\nThere are databases out there that know which telephone numbers are wireless and which ones are wireline even after they've been ported and it would be nice if we got a call and we knew.  I don't want to send a text message to a wireline device if you know what I mean.\n\nAnd one last suggestion ... why not include an integrated barcode scanner in the Google keyboard ... that would be so nice.", "is_img": 0, "category": "Contacts, Calls, Voicemail, Google Pixel 3 XL", "post_time": "2020-06-14T03:10:42.208013+00:00", "reply": "5 Replies"}

With my older Pixel 2 it did work, and I would manually trigger a Contacts or Calendar sync when I wanted to. I have checked and double-checked all the settings (see below)... but it still syncs without me triggering a sync.\nThe settings I make are as follows ... Via Settings -> Accounts At the bottom of the main accounts page, there is a toggle named \"Automatically sync data\" with the text \"Let apps sync data automatically\". If this \"Automatically sync data\" toggle is ON and you then select your GMail account, and press the \"Account sync\" button, you are able to edit the(Google) apps you don't want to auto-sync (i.e. turn sync OFF). I do this (I switch all Google apps to off), and return to my GMail account page. I then see \"Sync OFF for all items\" in grey text under the \"Account Sync\" button (my upper case for OFF above). I then go back up to a higher level .. that is back to the main accounts page. The toggle \"Automatically sync data\" is still ON of course, and the grey text under it says \"Let apps sync data automatically\". I don't want this to happen, so I now set this \"Automatically sync data\" toggle to OFF. Here's the problem: after making this last change (i.e. \"Automatically sync data\" toggle to OFF), when I select my GMail account again, I now see \"Sync ON for all items\" in grey text under the \"Account sync\" button(my upper case for ON above)!! This is completely contradictory! How can it be that after first disabling auto-sync on all the Google apps and then switching off \"Automatically sync data\" Google signals \"Sync on for all items\" ?!?\nAnd here's the bigger problem: the above message is correct. Because if I leave the settings as above the Contacts does indeed continue periodically auto-syncing. (I know this because if I delete one of my contacts in the Google Contacts app in the cloud after a short period the same contacts on my phone disappear too! The \"short period\" can be anything from 3 to 30 hours).\nI have tried removing my Google account and adding it again, but without success. It seems to me that this is either (a) a bug in the \"Automatically sync data\" implementation .. OR .. (b) a deliberate implementation to either check data or mislead users.\nI have also tried all sorts of variations and checked Google account settings in the cloud too (not much there!), all to no avail. It seems I cannot now disable auto-syncing of Contacts ...

The proximity sensor works a little bit, but often allows the screen to be active while I'm talking on the phone.  My ear and cheek hit the screen and cause havoc.  It will open all sorts of stuff up, and the most frequent problem is that it hits the mute button causing me to cut out to the other caller.\n\nI have seen other posts about the screen staying locked, but this is the opposite problem.\n\nHere is what I have tried.\n- I thought it was a hardware issue but this is my THIRD replacement phone and all three have had the issue.  I have NEVER had this issue with any other cell phone and previously had a Pixel 2 with no issue.  I don't have a weird shaped face, but I'll admit to having larger than average ears.\n\n- I have tried resetting the proximity sensor, adjusting the sensitivity, and even installed 3rd party apps that adjust the proximity sensor.  This didn't work.\n\n- I booted in safe mode and the issue still happened.\n\n- I have tried moving to the beta phone app to see if the new version in beta fixes it.  It did not.\n\n- I have installed every patch as soon as it's out and am currently on the latest January release.\n\n- On my third replacement phone I didn't transfer anything over in case an app was causing the problem.  The issue still happened using the phone straight out of the box with nothing added to it.\n\nI am at a loss.

The ones that still do have a number associated with a contact are sync'd to my gmail account, while I guess the others (which were generally more recent and added to my phone) appear not to be in my gmail.  \n\nI think it had to do with yesterday trying to edit a contact and selecting a gmail account, now a good portion of the contacts have just completely disappeared.  It is quite annoying and I don't want to manually re-add them in by looking through my texts and then inferring which contact it is.  \n\nAny help would be appreciated.

When installing and personalizing my pixel XL via my carrier, there was a problem getting the MMS downloads in my messages. When I clicked the blue icon with a downward arrow  to access a download, it would act as though it was 'working on retrieving' it (actively circling w/I icon) and failed to retrieve the download. The active circling within the icon continued endlessly without any results. I literally had to close page to get it to stop. My carrier said that the SMS is working properly but whenever we try to download MMS it was unsuccessful. I must have called five different times to get help on how to correct the problem and no one could figure out how to make it work. My previous phone, Samsung Galaxy 7 edge, was stolen so I had no way of transferring my contacts, photos, etc from that phone on to my pixel XL. Fortunately I had backed up everything onto Google so I could restore all my info in case my Galaxy 7 edge was ever lost or stolen. When it came to retrieving all that info, some of it was not retrieved. I originally had 173 + contacts and only about 70 we're actually retrieved. Things just got more screwed up from there. For some reason they had me sync my partners contacts in with mine (that's a long story) but basically what happened is all of his contacts were deleted, I guess during the syncing, and that's when I lost over a hundred of my contacts as well. So here I sit after 5 calls for technical support from my carrier and I am left with a partial list of my contacts, my partner's contacts are nowhere to be found along with the rest of my contacts and it's still can't download MMS messages. My phone still processes SMS texting in message without any problems. Finally the last few people I spoke to told me I needed to contact Google to correct the problem. I don't know how to contact Google, technical support and I'm at the point that I'm overthinking everything and very little makes any sense right now. I think that's called burnout and I've only had this phone a week.\nI'm hoping to at least get a phone number for Google technical support. Ideally there might be a miracle worker out there who can guide me through the process of locating the problem correcting those things that need fixin and retrieving all of the lost contacts not to mention photos, etc plus a large amount of journaling & lots of otther notes. \nCan anyone out there help out...I'd be grateful for just a Google # & delighted if they could guide me in fixing anything. I was so excited to get a Pixel.\nI've got the time and patience to try this again with someone out there in 'answer land'.\nThanks for reading my hugely lengthy message. \u270c\ufe0f", "is_img": 0, "category": "Contacts, Calls, Voicemail, Google Pixel", "post_time": "2019-04-19T01:56:02.135207+00:00", "reply": "4 Replies"}

Still with no solution in site.\n\nAnd so i've followed the next step of sending it back to them and getting a replacement.  Three times!

Sometimes right at the start of the call, other times after several minutes. Both on incoming and ongoing calls. I looked up the apps that have access to my phone calls, and there are only six (all google apps: Android Auto, Contacts, Google, Google Play Store, Messages, and Phone). I've noticed that when I call using Whatsapp the calls don't hang up. At least not so far.

Some minor issues", "content": "Is the feature available on the Pixel 4?  Nice job on Visual Voicemail also.  It should respond with the party you are trying to reach and not the word THEY when I press the \"I'll call you back later\" button.  It also seems to be missing the canned response 'take me off your calling list' and 'is this urgent?'. Is it possible for users to respond with a dynamic custom response?  That would be a nice future enhancement.  Can call screen automatically take the call if inbound caller identification is absent and ask the calling party to identify themselves verbally?  This could apply in the absence of calling name delivery if the calling party's nyx-nnx-xxxx (now npa-nxx-xxxx) is not in the contact list of the recipient or the name was not transmitted by the telco, or was not retrievable through a tcap dip.  I have received spoofed calls using illegal numbers and this can be baked into the logic ... for example ... no area code can have a 9 as a middle digit; no area code can start with a 1 or 0; if an area code has a 1 in the middle digit (n1x) the third digit (x) cannot be a 1; no central office code (the 4th 5th and 6th digit) can be 1xx or x11 or 0xx.  And you will not see telephone numbers such as 416-416-xxxx (were the area code and central office code are identical), or in NYC for example you would never see 212-718-xxxx because 212 is the area code for Manhattan and 718 is the area code for Brooklyn.  n=2-9 x=0-9.  Hope this info helps.  I don't know if ANI delivery still exists but it can be a way of determining if the call is spoofed, but the logic there is kind of fuzzy.  Automatic Nmber Identification and Caller Identification are two different things. ANI is the billing caller ID ... for example a company's ANI and main switchboard number could be (416) UNiversity 2 - 2000 (416-862-2000) but for direct inward dial the PBX would be programmed to transmit 416-862-2134 so that dialable directory number delivery and reverse translation would work.  Note that the first six digits in most cases will be identical.  The cellular industry, and regulatory authorities CRTC and FCC have certainly done a fine job messing up everything that was previously sophisticated ... from a telecommunications standpoint.  There's no way for Google to send a call to the bit bucket unless its servers act as a proxy.  It would also be interesting if the Google phone app could be enhanced to recognize alphabetic mnemonics as they previously existed eons ago.\n\nie  1 800 GOF EDEX\n1 800 FLO WERS\n1 415 PIX EL3A (749-3532)", "is_img": 0, "category": "Contacts, Calls, Voicemail, Google Pixel 3 XL", "post_time": "2019-10-31T18:11:19.412285+00:00", "reply": "1 Recommended Answer"}

When I requested for help, google support asked they suggested some troubleshoot and nothing worked for 2 months. After 2 months, they agreed to provide replacement phone. \n   When I ordered replacement phone, it showed as if they are going to provide new phone and they had put $800+ on hold in my card. When I received a mail about replacement phone it showed as refurbished phone. I was requesting to stop the order and even after speaking with google customer support for 4 or 5 times, they proceeded with the order.\n   When I received the replacement refurbished device, i setup everything (took backup etc., spend another 2 to 3 hours of time) and tried calling my friend. As soon as I call, display goes off and my friend couldn't hear what I am speaking and from myside i am barely hearing what he is speaking.\n   Now I had two problems to solve:\n  1) Whether I need to return replacement phone\n  2) Also I am supposed to send the original phone (for which they put $800 on hold). If i don't return on time they deduct the $800 (for the phone currently worth not even $400)\n  I have been dealing with GOOGLE CUSTOMER SUPPORT endlessly and it is going in loop. At one point i am thinking in future not go for PIXEL phones as their customer support SUCKS.\n   THOUGH PHONE IS UNDER 1 YEAR WARRANTY WHY THE HELL I AM SUPPOSED TO GET REFURBISHED PHONE!!!!

So this isn't a question so much as an answer that I hope Google takes notice of, or at least will allow to stay up for others to reference, because I believe it's the source of a variety of audio issues users are experiencing.\n\nSo after a couple of years of apparently annoying all my friends and family with my painfully loud and unfiltered phone calls on my Pixel 2, I finally figured out why: those tiny holes on the top and bottom of the phone are ambient mics that WORK TOGETHER to cancel out background noise.* My phone case has openings for the mics, but apparently the HOLES IN MY PHONE CASE WERE TOO SMALL for the mics to work properly. \n\nSo basically I've been calling people with no noise cancelling functionality, and the tiniest of sounds were apparently getting picked up and amplified by the Pixel 2's impressively sensitive front-facing mics (they could literally hear me swipe on the phone, no matter how softly I touched it).\n\nSo tonight during a phone call with my long-suffering BFF, I took my phone out of its case. She immediately noticed a difference. She could no longer hear my shoes on the pavement, nor the boxes I was moving, nor the tap-tap-tapping on my phone. And for reasons unbeknownst to me, it even improved the audio when I used the mic on my Bluetooth headphones. I suspect the Pixel continues to do noise-cancelling through its ambient mics even when using an external mic.\n\nSo if you're having a problem with your end of the phone conversation being garbled, try removing your phone from its case and see if it helps.\n\nI'm gonna need to try and drill bigger openings in this case...\n\n*So this is just a hunch, but I think the way it works is since there's two front-facing mics next to the top and bottom speakers, those tiny holes filter out ambient noise for the adjacent main mics. Which is why you need to make sure both are clear of obstructions.", "is_img": 0, "category": "Contacts, Calls, Voicemail, Google Pixel 2", "post_time": "2019-09-19T08:35:09.173246+00:00", "reply": "1 Reply"}

The app worked pretty good on older phones but on my Pixel 3 not so good.  To block calls on your phone Call Control requires that it be the default dialer.  With the integration of contacts and voicemail withing the default Google dialer I want it to be the default which makes call control pretty much worthless.  Is there a call blocker that doesn't require that it be the default dialer that works well on the Pixel 3?  If there is none that will block the call outright, is there an app that will at least identify known spammers as the call comes in so you can disregard the call and then blacklisted yourself?  I was hoping that Verizon's call blocking app would work but when I go out to the store the app doesn't even show up to download and I've been told it doesn't even work with the Pixel 3 that's why it's not available to download from the store.\n\nIf anyone has any idea's or solutions let me know.

It is impossible to get in contact with a support from Google as I cannot contact the support from phone directly and after trying 100 times via internet, it always redirect em to some information which is really basics. \nBy the end of 2016 I bought the first Google Pixel XL for USD 1026 in the UK, after having all Nexus devices before. I'm a long standing Android and Google fan since the first Android phone and Nexus.\nAfter 1 1/2 years I got difficulties with Pixel XL. I could hear the other party on the phone, but they could not hear me. It took me almost 6 month finding out what exactly the problem is. After that I read in the internet/newspaper that a large number of owners are affected. Google Pixel XL has sever microphone issue which cannot be fixed via a software update. The device has a hardware problem, the motherboard has be replaced. Google confirmed the problem officially.\nNow I sent my device to teh Repair Center in Germany to be checked and I receive an offer to have the motherboard replaced for USD 381, so In total I would paid USD 1407 for this device. This reply was absolutely disapointing from Google.\n\nThis absolutely not acceptable from a customer view. I was not able to find out the root cause within the 2 years guarantee time. I could not use the phoen even for the first 2 years! Google did not infomed me that my device is impacted.  I do not want to pay for any problems not caused by myself, but solely caused by Google. \n\nI would appreciate your asstance . I would like to get a working phone as soon as possbile. Germany Repair center do not want to help me. They say, I need to adress my issues to Google. They are forwarding me to the internet and there I cannot reach out to Google. There is a class action where the users could file a claim against Google, unfortunately only in the US. \n\nThank you in advance and kind regards,\nV", "is_img": 0, "category": "Contacts, Calls, Voicemail, Google Pixel", "post_time": "2019-08-28T18:35:23.549597+00:00", "reply": "2 Replies"}

I have been having problems with the phone for months now. I can't make or receive calls. When I receive a call, I answer and then the phone freezes and I have to restart the device by holding the power button long enough. Sometimes I answer it and it just returns me to the call menu (I don't know what its called, the menu when you receive a call where you can accept or reject the call). Sometimes it does successfully accept the call but there is no sound. And very rarely I accept it and I can hear the other person but the sound cuts like 20 seconds into the call. Same problems when I try to make a call as well. And not just with the Phone app, same problems occur when trying to use WhatsApp call. I have tried disabling some services, tried deleting the updates for the Phone app, tried deleting some apps and then all apps, tried Safe Mode, Factory Reset with my apps restored and Factory Reset with none of my apps/settings restored. None of it worked so far. The screen is cracked on the top left corner (I don't know if its related). I would like to know, is this a hardware issue or a software issue? Because (as I live in Turkey), there won't be much I can do in terms of repair if it is a hardware issue. So depending on that I will buy a new phone.\n\nThanks in advance.", "is_img": 0, "category": "Contacts, Calls, Voicemail, Google Pixel", "post_time": "2019-09-04T17:39:31.084968+00:00", "reply": "1 Recommended Answer"}

Every new phone, software update, Android version update is full of bugs and hidden and later discovered problems. Sometimes we see them before we give you money but sometimes its just so stupid that makes me question my own decisions with Android.... BTW i saw some people are recommending turning off BT or NFC or Safe Mode and then playing inspectors and searching for \"ROUGE\" apps.

I called Google support & the woman sent me a return label to affix to my package in the email!  We had been experiencing intermittent Internet outages while this was going on so I was not able to print the PDF out right away!  Now my email from the Google tech support is gone, as tho the email disappeared or I could have been hacked too!  If you remember AOL back in the day, you could UNSEND messages in email!  I know Google had some sort of brief unsending at one time!  I don't want to be charged for not returning it on time!    \n\nTwo pixels would be great,  with my living room HOME FI project, to string across the living room!  Sorta like the game of telephone, where you put a string, a knot in two styrefoam cups, pull the string tight, &  you can hear the other person!

If a mobile computer gets lost, stolen or a person gets arrested, & police illegally confiscate a persons mobile computer, then they police have the persons credit card information & pay pal information, account passwords, which are monetary payment methods that can cause financial harm to that person!  The reason I had my credit card account information there was to Pay Google Adwords when I was advertising my youtube channel!  Yes, having the payments saved is convenient!  But I was arrested by the police, & when the police illegally confiscate computer equipment, that can cause harm to a citizen, private and public, that is crossing the line & violates the constitution!  Passwords are intellectual property! Banking & monetary payment are intellectual property!  Our mobile computers become a credit card!  So thru the police, all my history is exposed to the police, including pictures & video!   I am still a fan of the new media & new technology, because more people have a voice to speak out!  Doesn't using the police to obstruct private citizens based on content being made for our online jobs violate the first amendment, since traditional corporate media has done the same thing in their content creation?  I lost my YouTube job, then I lost my computer equipment, because corporate media is threatened by new digital media!

But they only appear to work on numbers that are \"known\" as incoming spam numbers. Makes sense. But seeing as how spammers change their numbers all day every day, I keep getting about 5-7 calls per day that are not known by Google's filters as spam. Meaning, I have to check my phone, and block these numbers every single day. Get's pretty old, pretty fast. And there's no end to how many phone numbers the \"social security scam\" business possesses, in case you haven't noticed. lol. My question is, why isn't there a simple feature within this wonderful built in spam filter to only accept calls from my contact list? Meaning, \"block ALL BUT my contacts.\" This way, if it's someone I don't know, they can simply leave a message and I'll click \"add to contacts\" and all is well. It'd keep me from having to listen to my phone ring several times a day with numbers I already know are spam. And yes, I know I can use a call blocking app to do this, and I did just that with my Samsung Galaxy phone, but in my experience, using a third party call blocking app that lays over your phone just slows everything down and often interferes with other apps, I found. The spam features are a big reason for me switching to Pixel 3XL. And I don't mind being a part of the community that \"fights spam\" but I'd rather not have to report every single call that comes in on my phone. Especially when \"white listing\" your entire contact list seems like such an obviously easy feature to add to this already good built in spam filter.

All contacts and accounts have transferred successfully to the Pixel.  I tried a message transfer using SMS backup and Restore (has worked on perfectly on multiple android devices) - all the messages are in the generated backup file and they can be viewed in the SMS Backup and Restore app, and can be restored perfectly on my old Android device, but the Unknown Sender shows up again in Android Messages on the Pixel 3XL.   Is there a workaround to this issue?  I tried a) deleting the app data and the cache ; and b) uninstalled updates to the Android Messages App.  The issue did not go away in either case.

Maybe this was Placebo, but the mic on my Pixel 2 did sound more muffled after I called myself vs a naked phone or my old case. Is the location of the mic beside the USBC port or in the speaker slot? Also, is it normal for Live Cases to not include this mic cutout?
