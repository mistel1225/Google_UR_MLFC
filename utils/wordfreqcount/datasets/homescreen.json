The back and home buttons stops to work, using 2 buttons navigation bar, every time i switch from 2 apps using the slide gesture. In the bug tracker there is a video, which is more than explanatory.

If I open it every day, is there any hope that at least someone from google will show up, if only to ban me?

{"url": "https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/98885777/feature-request?hl=en", "title": "Feature Request", "content": "I'm running the Pixel Launcher on Android 11 on a Pixel 3. I've tried other launchers but keep coming back to the stock launcher because I just love the overall feel of it.\n\nBut it is so bare-bones with such limited options for any sort of customization, it could definitely be improved. I suggest you consider the Lawnchair Launcher, which is open source but which is on the verge of going defunct because of a lack of support. You could mine it for gold in the form of features.\n\nSome things that would be awesome:\n\n - The ability to arrange the home pages, and to set our own default page rather than being locked in to the farthest left page as the default. For example, I prefer the center page to be my default, making for shorter travel back and forth to the extremes, and because so many wallpapers are center-weighted, they look weird when you default to the farthest left page and cause the wallpaper to scroll to the right.\n\n- Make the placement of the At-a-Glance widget optional. Currently, it takes up real estate at the top of the default page, with no way to move it or remove it.\n\n- The ability to set an action for sliding your finger up or down on an icon, rather than just opening when tapping on it. This is a great option for (for example) quick access to the most frequently used app in a folder.\n\n- The ability to hide apps in the app drawer.

I switched to another charging outlet, but the phone still would not start up. I decided to attempt a factory reset, so I held down POWER + VOLUME DOWN for a few seconds, after which I got the \"no command\" screen. I pressed POWER + VOLUME UP to get the menu options. At this point the phone started acting erratically. It would only show the menu options for a very short amount of time before rebooting and kicking me back to the \"no command\" screen. Finally I got it to actually begin the factory reboot. It displayed a black screen with small white text at the bottom saying something like \"wiping /data...\" It seemed to be stuck in this state, but I was afraid to interrupt the process, so I left it overnight (plugged into a working charger).\n\nThis morning I woke up to find nothing had changed, so I used POWER + VOLUME DOWN to restart the device again. Once again I ended up at the \"no command\" screen, so I used POWER + VOLUME UP to get to the menu. The phone seemed to be acting less erratically now, and I was able to select Factory Reset again easily. This time I got the \"wiping /data...\" message again, and it only lasted a few seconds before prompting me to restart. After restarting, I was able to begin the account setup process normally, so I thought I was in the clear.\n\nOne thing worth mentioning is that this is a company phone, and I had previously been using my company-managed gmail address for it, but during the reset process I had trouble with the 2-Auth on that account, so I switched to my personal gmail address instead. Nevertheless, everything seemed to be going smoothly, I was able to connect to wifi and set up my fingerprint again, and then the phone started downloading some recommended apps. I could see that the battery was fully charged, so I left it to finish the app downloads.\n\nWithin less than half an hour, the phone shut itself down again. This time I was unable to restart it no matter what I tried: holding POWER for over 30 seconds, holding POWER + VOLUME DOWN for over 30 seconds, holding POWER + VOLUME UP for over 30 seconds, holding POWER + VOLUME DOWN + VOLUME UP for over 30 seconds, plugging it into the power charger again, etc.\n\nAs far as I can tell the phone is completely unresponsive, and to make it more frustrating, any attempt at searching the web for solutions to this problem just leads me to instructions on how to do a factory reset, which I already did twice, and which is now impossible to attempt again because I can't even get into that boot menu anymore.\n\nIF YOU ARE READING THIS AND PLANNING TO TELL ME TO DO A FACTORY RESET, PLEASE READ AGAIN THOROUGHLY FROM THE TOP. I HAVE ALREADY DONE A FACTORY RESET, IT SEEMED TO WORK, AND NOW I CANNOT EVEN ACCESS THE MENU TO ATTEMPT ANOTHER FACTORY RESET.

I know the previous messenger chat heads which the bubbles are styled after had an element of machine learning in which the app learnt where you moved the bubble to and made that the new default.\n\nNotification panel:\nRelated to the updated notification UI you are now required to swipe each individual message to dismiss, or click \"clear all\" as opposed to the previous option where you could swipe away all notifications grouped within a specific app. For example Whatsapp where I have several chats which I do not regularly check, every time the app refreshes I have to swipe each chat seperately or click clear all which then clears other app notifications as well.

I typically buy them refurbished and have never really had many problems, up until recently.\n\nWhen my trusty Nexus 6P started having battery life problems, I got the next iteration, the Pixel XL.\n\nEverything was fine until last week when the Pixel started boot-looping. Figured it was hardware related as I dropped it, but it worked fine for a couple of days after the drop.\n\nI ordered myself a refurbished Pixel 2 XL and then popped my SIM card into the Nexus 6P so I could answer texts in the meantime - the Nexus 6P works, but just has to stay plugged in all the time.\n\nThe Nexus 6P has been sitting on my desk, plugged in. It worked just peachy for 2 days, then that started boot looping too - which tells me this might be app / software related and not hardware related.\n\nThe conspiracy theorist in me says that Google can somehow actively brick older phones so that I'll buy a new one...coincidentally the Android 11 update and Pixel 5 are coming out...guess that's a gripe for a different post, but thought I'd throw that out there.\n\nWhat I'd like to know is the following:\n\n#1 - Is there a way to recover any data from either of these phones? I believe the vast majority of my data gets cloud backup, but I think some of the unsaved pics in messages might be gone forever.\n\n#2 - Once my Pixel 2 XL arrives, I'm going to dispose of both of these. Aside from physically destroying them, how can I wipe them clean of my data?\n\n#3 - Can I avoid this happening in the future? Do I have to listen to my iPhone shaming friends and go to the Dark side?\n\nThank you,\n\nMark", "is_img": 0, "category": "Homescreen and Launcher, Google Pixel", "post_time": "2020-10-01T14:44:29.24817+00:00", "reply": "1 Recommended Answer"}

These kind of AI features is the main reason why I bought a Pixel (and why people love Pixel phones - because of their unique AI features which other phones don't have). Having the app suggestions only on the dock now seems like a step back. Also, losing access to the search bar and app drawer from anywhere were really handy features, especially seeing how much space there is on the bottom of the recents screen, where now you can only find a \"screenshot\" and \"select\" button. \n\nSome sources which prove that people loved the feature:\n- AndroidPolice post about the introduction of dynamic app suggestions on the home screen, top upvoted comments:\n\"What they should really add (back) is app suggestions to recents\" \n\"I really hope they add these suggestions back to the recents menu; that's where I find them useful.\"\n\"It saves me from having to swipe up the app drawer because the app I want to open is probably already going to be suggested at the bottom. I can't believe they removed that and for what, a screenshot button.\"\n\n- Reddit post about introduction of Android 11, top upvoted comments:\n\"I'm not a big fan of the change to the recent apps menu. The view seems a lot more clunky now that you can no longer use the Google search bar, click on a suggested app or go to your app drawer.\" \n\"The search and suggested apps in the recent apps menu was one of my most used features. Really hating that those are gone.\n\"Suggested apps as an option on all my home screens seems like a step back.\" \n\"Oh god, the bottom bit for the launcher is actually gone? I've been so accustomed to tapping the suggestions (because they're that good) that I don't even scroll through the previous apps anymore.\"\n\"Damn I wouldn't have updated if I'd known \ud83d\ude16 What a dumb change. Hopefully they add an option to get these features back\"\n\nAlso on 9to5google's Android 11 feature overview, they are mainly talking about losing this feature:\n- \"RIP overview suggestions. Used it daily.\"\n- \"You can turn it off in Home settings luckily. I love suggested apps but didn't like them on the home screen\"\n\nI really appreciate all the hard work that went into developing Android 11. But to me, and a lot of other people, it would be a good decision to bring this feature back, maybe as a toggle which you can turn on or off. \n\nThank you.", "is_img": 0, "category": "Homescreen and Launcher, Google Pixel 2", "post_time": "2020-09-09T10:34:18.470391+00:00", "reply": "4 Recommended Answers"}

Why going so far with wellbeing and settings that is way too intrusive that I can't deactivate it with 11 even if this release work with my phone? \n\nAnd when can we expect a real good release for 11? \n\nI'm discouraged. \n\nLove ideas, like conversations, like bubbles, even wellbeing is a good idea if people need it!\nBUT... I HATE when you force ideas everywhere, especially Wellbeing and sound settings.\nAnd for now, all I want is a fresh and GOOD update for Android 11 that will work, and at least, less wellbeing dependant, and obviously... 2 settings for notifications sounds and ringtone AGAIN.\n\n\nP.s.: sorry if I made mistakes, English is not my first language.\n\nSeph\u00ee.", "is_img": 0, "category": "Homescreen and Launcher, Google Pixel 3 XL", "post_time": "2020-09-24T17:03:40.199221+00:00", "reply": "0 Replies"}

The non Carrier version has had almost no issues, and it's frustrating that I am missing out on so many different features that OnePlus has to offer. I have heard that other phone manufacturers have had similar issues. But apple doesn't seem to have these issues. My question is will pixel phones have the same issues if so are there any android phones that don't", "is_img": 0, "category": "Homescreen and Launcher, Google Pixel", "post_time": "2020-08-13T05:27:18.16508+00:00", "reply": "1 Recommended Answer"}

Additionally, it no longer allows me to scroll the list of notifications within the drawer. As such, the notifications in the drawer are squished and some scroll off the bottom of the drawer and I cannot see them at all. See sample screenshots at the bottom of this message.\n\nNormally, I would just use my fingers (have tried 1, 2, 3, 4 fingers) to expand the drawer down to the full height of the screen (and once it's full height, I used to be able to scroll the list of notifications independently) but now it just expands the shortcut buttons section (the top row of the open notification drawer) rather than the notifications section itself.\n\nI've not changed any settings relating to the notification drawer, and in fact, I cannot even find any settings to customised the look/feel/layout of the notification draw so I believe it was a change made as part of an update rather than something I've changed.\n\nI've also tested with my launcher (I use Nova Launcher Pro) and the default pixel launcher - the notification drawer doesn't change and works the same no matter which launcher I use so I don't think it's an issue with Nova Launcher.\n\nExample screenshots (two with FB messenger, one with YT music)\nhttps://imgur.com/F48r6Xm\nhttps://imgur.com/41YpqyX\nhttps://imgur.com/P1lxXE4\n\nThis is what happens when I try to expand the drawer - it just expands the shortcut icons row at the top\nhttps://imgur.com/ZnVWXiQ", "is_img": 0, "category": "Homescreen and Launcher, Google Pixel 4 XL", "post_time": "2020-07-28T00:13:40.328039+00:00", "reply": "2 Recommended Answers"}

The 5 main icons on the home screen become unresponsive and do not respond accurately to touch at times. When I do the same thing but exit out swiping to the left part of the screen instead, the issue never happens. Also, this is one way of fixing the issue whenever it happens.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've recorded videos to help visualize the issue.  They're basically the same, but I made one while on safe mode and after a reset.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URGlfZlnCvw&feature=share](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URGlfZlnCvw&feature=share)  \\- safe mode\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1r9LNINohHA&feature=share](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1r9LNINohHA&feature=share)  \\- factory reset\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou don't have to press the buttons at the start to replicate the bug.

The notifications are very delayed but only sometimes (more often then not though).  The prime examples of this are as follows:\n\n1) YouTube Music - When I have been listening to music and I swipe up to close the app YouTube Music still appears in the notification drawer for up to 10 seconds after the app has been closed.  \n2)  Phone Calls - After I end a phone call it will still appear in the notification drawer for up to 10 seconds afterward as if the call is still in progress even after the call has ended and the phone app has been closed.\n\nLast night a new issue also appeared.  I swiped down my notification drawer and all the items were blank (see picture).  I have already tried a factory reset and the issue still persists.  I tried booting into safe mode and it didn't do it, then I booted back into regular mode and it didn't do it either, but after a day or so it is back to doing the same thing again.  This is not a memory issue and the only apps running in the background are Reddit and the Ring app.\n\nThis is extremely annoying.  Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

I got my Pixel in October and I absolutely love it. There's only one flaw though. I've been a lifetime user of Nova Launcher, which has always been consistently up to date with gestures and the latest aesthetics to come to Android. However, I noticed that in Android 10 (and Android Pie as well) transitions and animations between the Overview menu and the home screen are very choppy. \n\nI've done some research and discovered that this issue is caused by Google integrating the Overview menu with the launcher, which is a fantastic idea. However, it cripples third-party launchers because the app has to have system permissions in order to modify the Overview menu. So, this makes the Pixel Launcher the only launcher that supports Android 10 animations and gestures properly. The only way to solve this is by rooting your device, which I don't want to do. \n\nI know that Google had a similar issue introducing the Android 10 gesture nav system and making it compatible with 3rd party launchers. My question: is Google going to eventually fix this, and allow third-party launchers to modify the Overview menu? I would really hate to see Android turn into iOS, with no options available.\n\nThanks!", "is_img": 0, "category": "Homescreen and Launcher, Google Pixel 3a XL", "post_time": "2020-02-11T08:46:19.948718+00:00", "reply": "1 Reply"}

I didn't know gesture swiping would be different than my current 3xl. \n\nI'm getting used to it. But I noticed one glaring problem. Holding down the home button before would bring up what's on my screen and assistant. Now there seems to be no way to do that. I really liked that feature.\n\nTo be honest all the continual changes to navigation is leaving me a tech junky kinda tired. I loved the 3 buttons. But I got pretty used to whatever the gesture mode was on 3xl. This new 4xl version is just way to complicated and non-intuitive. In a sense I see how it can be but it's also not. Maybe I'll learn the curve. My mom gets pixel phones, she would lose her mind on the 4. Thank you for at least having the option to switch to the old buttons. \n\nI think you need to work on gesture more or at least a long press should activate the home button as well work a way to get the what's on my screen or the Google lens more easily into the picture.\n\nAnd ive owned every single Google production phone since Android one. \n\nAlso one other thing. You guys have ruined autocorrect. Go back to the older ones that worked. I hear others saying the same thing. It just doesn't work right anymore.

Soon after I upgraded to Pie, my wallpaper started reverting to a certain (stock) wallpaper every day or every time it restarted. After it did that [assuming I didn't change the wallpaper back], the next day or next time it restarted, there would be a black bar across the bottom of the wallpaper on the home screen. Then every day or restart, the black bar would cover more and more of the screen until the wallpaper was only visible at the very top.

Yesterday when I woke up, the wallpaper had reverted to the stock wallpaper that was showing when I first got the phone (the pink sky with mountains at the bottom). I changed it back to a (stock) wallpaper. This morning when I woke up, the wallpaper is now a different stock wallpaper (that I've used before, but not the one I set yesterday), AND there is a black bar covering nearly all of the screen.\n\nI don't have any wallpaper apps installed (except Zedge, but I don't use their wallpaper). I had not downloaded any new apps or installed anything the day this started.

{"url": "https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/1872144/any-way-to-fix-bad-rotation-behavior-on-the-app-switching-screen-without-disabling-auto-rotate?hl=en", "title": "Any way to fix bad rotation behavior on the app switching screen without disabling auto-rotate?", "content": "This seems to be a problem whenever auto rotate is enabled.  By default the home-screen is landscape-only, which is fine and how I prefer it.  The issue is that this 'default' does not apply to the recent app view/app switcher.  \n\nThe way this behavior manifests is that if my phone is on a desk or other flat surface, it will be in portrait view in the home screen, but if I swipe up to get to the recent app view, there seems to be a 50/50 chance it will switch that specific view to landscape, turning everything 90 degrees and changing the direction needed to swipe to close etc.  \n\nIf you are holding the phone vertically in-front of you, its not an issue as obviously the sensor will indicate everything should remain portrait, but if it is on the desk you can't tell if the sensors feel it is technically 'portrait' or 'landscape' since its just laying flat there to begin with and you might as well flip a coin as to what orientation that the app switch screen will come up.\n\nIn prior versions of android that screen seemed to be 'informed' not just from the sensor but also what the orientation of the last 'view' or app you were in when you launched it.  i.e. if playing a game locked to landscape mode and opening that screen, it would still open landscape, even if the device was flat on a table and/or the 'sensor' last read was a portrait one.\n\nIn android 9 it seems like it always favors the sensor readings which is causing kind of random/guesswork behavior if the phone is set down and it means I kind of cringe every time I go to open the screen because I never know whether its going to sit there and then rotate 90 degrees on me or not.  So instead of a quick flick like the gesture is supposed to be its always a flick, sit there, wait, see if it turns, if it turns re-adjust my internal perspective and change all my swipe options by 90 degrees, or just try and pick the phone up off the desk to have it turn back etc, then swipe to the other/recent app I want. \n\nEither way it takes what used to be a half-second near-thoughtless navigation gesture and makes it a 4-5 second series of steps I need to focus/concentrate on.  Having the 'last seen' screens all be in their original orientation doesn't help matters because even if it switches to landscape view and navigation the apps will still 'look' portrait and its just the main phone status bar etc that will be visually rotated and serve as an indicator that the UI is now turned 90 degrees from what it was a half-second ago.\n\nBasically instead of observing the orientation of the app (or home screen) that it is opening from, it is *always* subservient to the sensor data, which can disagree when the app is 'locking' the orientation (either portrait or landscape) and/or the sensor data is ambiguous (laying flat on a desk, so neither definitively portrait nor landscape) and that causes delays or directional ambiguity when they don't match and things start rotating in unexpected ways.", "is_img": 0, "category": "Homescreen and Launcher, Google Pixel 3", "post_time": "2019-02-25T23:18:52.582211+00:00", "reply": "0 Replies"}
