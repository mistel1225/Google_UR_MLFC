Once it gets down to about 50% it has now been randomly resetting. If it gets lower than 50%, sometime around 20% or so it will just rapidly start counting down the % as the seconds go by: 19%, 18%, 17% etc. Does this indicate its time to buy a new battery? I've had the phone for about 1 yr 8 mon.\n\nThanks,\nChris", "is_img": 0, "category": "Battery and Power, Google Pixel 3", "post_time": "2021-05-26T13:20:05.896343+00:00", "reply": "5 Replies"}

I will describe the issue after I explain the steps that I have gone through:\nRestarted the device (cold start)\nStarted the device in Safe mode\nFactory reset the device (based on email from Google support)\nUninstalled several applications\n\nThe issue is as follows. When I plug the phone into the wall to charge, it does not charge. I am using the original cable. If I go into settings and look for the USB settings, the item for \"controlled by\"  \"connected device\" is often active. Sometimes when I attempt to switch to \"This device\" it switches and charges OK. Sometimes it refuses to switch. And occasionally, even when the phone is plugged in, both \"Connected device\" and \"This device\" are grayed out. The strange effect is that I do not connect the phone to a PC.\n\nIn conducting another experiment, it appears to matter which way up I insert the charging cable. Insertimg the cable one way up, the phone charges fine (does not switch to \"USB controlled by Conneted device\". However inserted the other way up it either reverts to USB controlled by Connected device, or it simply does not detect that a cable is plugged in at all.\n\nI have tried with other USB-C cables (purchased from Verizon), and the behavior is consistent. \n\nThis has been happening quite consistently for several weeks.

Then it will crash and reboot constantly.\nFirst it happened at 23% battery. Plugging in the phone to charge restored full normal operation.\nThen after unplugging, the phenomenon occurred at 13% with constant rebooting. It also occurred in Safe Mode.\n\nI was able to boot the phone into recovery, and when it's in in the bootloader, the device does not crash, freeze, or go into boot loop!\n\nThinking maybe I needed to calibrate the battery, I left it in the boot loader for a while to drain the battery for about 30 minutes. I rebooted to normal and after booting successfully it was at 9% battery but it froze while still in the lock screen and went back into boot loop until it shut down. Turned on the phone several times until I got the icon showing a battery with red on the bottom. Plugged it in and it started charging, but started at 9% still. Charged fully to 100% and used it normally.\n\nWhen the phone got to 2%, the issue occurred again. This situation reminds me of two historical issues: The Nexus 6P (that I owned) battery failure that caused shutdown between 20-25% battery remaining; and the old nickel-cadmium \"battery memory\" plague.\n\nI have already performed a factory reset.", "is_img": 0, "category": "Battery and Power, Google Pixel 4a", "post_time": "2021-06-17T05:34:32.97419+00:00", "reply": "1 Reply"}

It\u2019s worked very well and I\u2019ve had no issues with it. However, wireless charging has suddenly become extremely slow. I use a Pixel Stand at my computer desk and a 3rd party wireless charger bedside and charging at both locations has slowed down significantly. However, direct USB-C charging is as fast as ever.\n\nI\u2019m not sure what has caused this slow wireless charging all of a sudden. I\u2019ve done everything to troubleshoot. I have removed the thin phone case to try again (previous, there was no issues with leaving the case on) and have also rebooted the phone twice. I\u2019ve called Google support and they are less than helpful. They just give me very generic steps to try.\n\nI believe this change in wireless charging behaviour came about after the May 2021 security update. However, I admit that this problem might date back a couple of months. Since a couple of months ago, I sometimes wake up in the morning and take my phone off the bedside wireless charger and noticed it was not at 100%. This was intermittent behaviour and I had attributed to possibly not having my Pixel 5 aligned properly overnight. But since the May update, it seems like it is a constant behaviour.\n\nAnyone with any ideas or has observed similar issues with their charging?", "is_img": 0, "category": "Battery and Power, Google Pixel 5", "post_time": "2021-05-08T16:20:42.224321+00:00", "reply": "3 Replies"}

Not surprising to me since it's a 3 year old phone with the original battery, so I started thinking about replacing the battery. Fast forward to 3/9, and off of a fresh charge, I mounted my phone to my bicycle and fired up the Adidas app to track my bike ride (a fairly battery intensive activity). Within an hour, the phone was 50%. After 90 minutes, I noticed the phone was completely dead. I didn't pay attention to the phone while riding. When I returned home, I plugged in the phone to charge it... no signs of life. I then plugged in the phone overnight using the original charger and cable that came with the phone. Also, no luck.\n\nOn 3/10, I took the phone UBreakifix (the nearest Google authorized repair center) figuring the replacement battery would fix the problem. Unfortunately, their replacement battery did NOT fix the issue - they were never able to get the phone to turn on again. The tech found some internal knowledge base articles which indicate a problem regarding the March Feature Update for certain Pixel phones - including the 3XL, 4, and 4XL. \n\nI have since contacted Google support directly and as a result of that discussion mailed the phone in for a repair. I am hoping they can fix what their authorized service provider couldn't, but the phone has never been damaged, and was in excellent condition prior to its final shutdown on 3/9.\n\nAlthough I don't think there's much the community here can suggest in my specific case, I am wondering if others are affected by the same issue on their phones, since, according to Ubreakifix, the issue is pretty new, and I wasn't able to find anything elsewhere in these forums.", "is_img": 0, "category": "Battery and Power, Google Pixel 3 XL", "post_time": "2021-03-15T23:00:21.564297+00:00", "reply": "5 Replies"}

{"url": "https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/104609310/is-there-any-way-to-backup-a-pixel-that-will-not-charge-turn-on?hl=en", "title": "Is there any way to backup a Pixel that will not charge/turn on?", "content": "So over the past couple months, I've been having issues with my Pixel 4 XL's battery that have only been getting more frequent and more substantial. Specifically, sometimes the phone would say it is having a \"problem reading the battery meter.\" This would result in the phone displaying an inaccurate battery percentage or simply refusing to charge (displaying a \"?\" on the battery icon when turned off and plugged in). Sometimes I would be able to temporarily fix the issue by using a tip I read online where you apply slight pressure to the battery area. While that worked the first few times, it quickly became less reliable. Fast forward to today, my phone said it was at 87% but must have not been reading from the battery correctly, because the phone suddenly shut off from low power. Now, whatever I do, I cannot get the phone to charge again. Hard rebooting doesn't do anything, the pressure trick has run its course, I have tried everything I have found suggested online and nothing has gotten the phone to accept charge again. The phone recognizes it is charging (when plugged in it will display the charging battery icon for a split second as opposed to the red \"low battery\" icon when unplugged) but due to the issues with reading the battery meter the phone simply will not allow the battery to be charged. I discovered online that this is a very common hardware flaw with the 4 XL involving the battery FPC connector and that it will have to be repaired/replaced by a professional.\n So, at this point, I've come to terms that I will have to send in my phone for repair. My 1-year warranty unfortunately ended in December, but I'm willing to pay the repair cost considering how much I have enjoyed my time with the 4 XL and would rather not shell out the money for a new phone. However, my dilemma is that I do not have a backup of my phone. I was prepared to do so after the issues becoming more frequent these past few days, but the phone shutting off at \"87%\" blindsided me and I missed my opportunity. Since from what I've read, repairing the phone involves a complete wipe and reset, I am curious if there exists any way to back up my phone in the current state it is in. There is some data on my phone apart from the cloud services that I would be really upset to lose and if I could obtain a backup of it I would be much more comfortable with having it repaired. So if there is either a way to retrieve backup data from the phone while it is dead, a way to repair it without wiping the data, or a secret way of getting it to charge just one last time so I can get a backup before sending it in, that would ease a lot of my worries. Thank you.\n\nEdit: I did just discover the \"one year extended warranty program\" regarding these battery issues, which I believe I fall under and would be exempt from repair costs, which is fantastic to hear. So I still just need to know if there is any way to preserve my data before taking it to the local uBreakiFix.", "is_img": 0, "category": "Battery and Power, Google Pixel 4 XL", "post_time": "2021-04-01T03:06:27.607658+00:00", "reply": "1 Reply"}

After talking to customer support and tried every possible troubleshooting even factory reset now I am facing new problem that my phone doesn't charge more than 50% and not even battery draining off as well as I can not see battery percentage at the top of my screen but I can see at the bottom of my lock screen.

I place it in the stand, the little stand light comes on and my phone charges.\n\nHowever, a while ago now (maybe around the time I updates to Android 11, maybe earlier) it does nothing. I place the phone on the stand (vertical or horizontal) and it doesn't register - no light, no charging.\n\nIf I place my wife's iPhone on the stand it starts charging immediately, so it just seems to be my phone. Unfortunately I haven't had the opportunity to try my phone on another wireless charger to rule out hardware issues.\n\nHowever, a month ago I did a bunch of things and managed to get the Pixel Stand working, but now it's stopped again. I tried to repeat what I did last time but have had no luck.\n\nPreviously, I cleared the data (storage and cache) for the Pixel Stand app, and also uninstalled all its updates, and \"forgot\" the stand from my Bluetooth connected devices list. I also tried safe mode. After a restart or two I found that putting my phone on the stand prompted the Pixel Stand to start charging and it opened the Pixel Stand assistant setup.\n\nI then updated the Pixel Stand app again and it still worked for a while but maybe a week later it stopped. Now I've repeated all the same steps and still nothing.\n\nHas anyone managed to figure this out?", "is_img": 0, "category": "Battery and Power, Google Pixel 3", "post_time": "2021-03-19T19:07:51.403491+00:00", "reply": "0 Replies"}

I have almost always charged it with the original charger, I have tried it few times to charge it with others and it has not given any problem. 10 days ago I tried to charge it with one and it didn't give any signal (i tried charge with the 4a turned off and it seemed to drain the battery faster), only when I got home did I manage to charge it again with the original charger. Since then, I can't load it with one other than the original. And 5 days ago the message \"Unplug charger\" or \"Liquid or debris\" started to appear, and appears every time i take the usb and i have to activate the usb. I do not leave home because of the covid and I have never subjected or wet it, I have already cleaned and vacuumed it and the message still appears. Today I did a factory reset because it was not even charging with the original charger, but in the end the message continues to appear. After a while it started to load but it seems to be more difficult (don't charge ate the first time). The only unusual thing I did on the phone was to put a skin  for more than 1 month.

Checking battery usage it says that no apps are draining power faster than normal. With normal use, my phone will go from 100% to 60% in about 30 minutes. The thing that is the most strange, however, is that it doesn't gradually drain -- It will suddenly drop to 20% and then 3% in literally seconds. It happens in safemode, too. I have noticed that it is much more likely to do this if I use Chrome or the camera app at all. I used my phone to record a 15 second video in the video app and it went from 70% to 3% all of a sudden. The most bizarre part of all is that it will stay at 3% for a very long time. The day it dropped to 3% when I used my camera, I put it in my pocket and didn't touch it again until I got home 2 hours later, assuming it would be dead based off the fact that it will lose battery in idle so quickly, but it hadn't drained any further. I used it for a couple of minutes and it then dropped to 1%. When I charge it (using an official charger) it charges way faster than normal, too. I can go from 1% to fully charged in around 30 minutes. Yesterday I used my phone at 1% for around an hour and a half and it didn't die. It appears that there's some strange bug with the battery percentage indicator, indicating that it's losing power faster than it actually is. That's all I can think of that accounts for the weird sudden decreases (there's no pattern to it, either, it's never the same percentage that it jumps to), it staying at low percentage for a very long time, the very rapid charging and the fact that Android says no app is pulling more battery than usual.", "is_img": 0, "category": "Battery and Power, Google Pixel 3 XL", "post_time": "2021-01-14T17:16:40.93969+00:00", "reply": "1 Reply"}

{"url": "https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/93102249/massive-standby-battery-drain-on-pixel-3a?hl=en", "title": "Massive standby battery drain on Pixel 3a", "content": "Sometime in the late summer or early fall of 2020, right around when Android 11 dropped (although I'm not sure if it perfectly coincided with upgrading to Android 11), I started to notice a pretty heavy standby battery drain on my Pixel 3a (2-3% per hour). Instead of lasting two days with 6-8 hours SOT, as it had for the first year I owned it, my battery was discharging so quickly on standby that it would die in about two days with the screen off.\n\nI dealt with the battery drain for few months on stock Android 11. Eventually I was at my wits end trying and failing to find solutions, so I decided to downgrade to Android 10 and switch to CalyxOS (a private near-stock Android ROM) with the thought that removing Google's spyware might help. Unfortunately, the drain persisted. I have since upgraded to Android 11 on CalyxOS and the drain is still here. My battery stats constantly show high usage from Android System (usually more than the screen), Wi-Fi, Standby, and sometimes Android OS.\n\nLet me give you a rundown of some of my settings to make it clear how ridiculous this battery drain is:\nBluetooth and Wi-Fi scanning off.\nWi-Fi on, but with Mobile Data Always Active off.\nBluetooth off.\nNFC off.\nLocation services off.\nAmbient display off.\nHotspot/tethering off.\nVPN off.\n\"Ok Google\" off (the Google app is actually uninstalled).\nAll gestures off (e.g. Lift to check phone).\nCell signal is great. It's consistently three or four bars in my apartment.\nOnly 9 apps registered for push notifications (turning off push notifications doesn't solve the drain): Bitwarden, Duolingo, GroupMe, Nanoleaf, Photos, ProtonMail, Signal, YouTube, YouTube Music\nOnly 7 accounts syncing (turning off auto-sync doesn't solve the drain): Two DAVx5 accounts (for contact/calendar sync), Duolingo, Google, GroupMe, NextCloud, and Signal\n\nHere are some of the things I've tried that haven't stopped the drain:\nBattery saver mode\nSafe mode\nFactory reset\nReverting to Android 10 (I did this before moving to Calyx OS and then ran Calyx OS on Android 10 for a month or two before upgrading to Android 11 again)\nSwitching to microG for Google Play Services (bundled with Calyx OS)\nSwitching to 5GHz Wi-Fi (I usually connect to 2.4GHz)\n\nThe one thing I've done to successfully stop the drain has been the following:\nTurn off Wi-Fi.\nRestart the phone.\nLeave Wi-Fi off.\n\nHowever, I only have a 4GB data plan and I use probably 20-30GB of Wi-Fi data per month. This is at best an extremely short term workaround. I also don't think this has worked every time, but I know it's at least worked a couple of times for me.\n\n----\n\nThe following screenshots are battery stats from two days ago. To get these, I turned on safe mode, charged my phone to full, and then just sat it on my desk with the screen off all afternoon (aside from turning on the screen once in the middle to check the battery). I had 1 minute of SOT over the entire charge and I lost 17% battery. There are an insane amount of wakelocks going on, leading to almost two hours of screen-off uptime of the ~6.5 hours it was sitting on my table. Almost all of these seem to be coming from the Wi-Fi radio.\n\n\n\n---\n\nAny suggestions of things to try or solutions would be very welcome. I'd also be happy to share more stats from this charge (or a non-safe-mode charge) if that would be helpful.\n\nI'm just so tired and frustrated at this point. The longer this goes on, the more charge cycles get added to my battery, and the worse my battery life is going to be over time. This same exact thing massacred my old Nexus 5's battery and I really don't want to have that happen again :(", "is_img": 1, "category": "Battery and Power, Google Pixel 3a", "post_time": "2021-01-12T06:23:19.660991+00:00", "reply": "1 Recommended Answer"}

Until today, when the phone would power off, it would not turn on unless charging, but that is no longer the case.

The battery also seems to be draining abnormally fast despite no apps reporting high usage.\n\nI intend to do a factory reset this weekend as I have run out of options. I found two users on the forum that described a similar issue but neither had helpful replies as one was under warranty and one was on beta.\n\nThank you for any and all help.

It was working fine for nearly 16 months.  I went through ALL options including 3 chat assistants. No resolution and/or fix.\n\nLet me help others so you don't waste your time.  This is a \"baked in\" issue that is in ALL Pixel phones.  It's like a time bomb.  When you research this issue nothing works as a fix...short or long term and Google has said it will send out a fix at some point for the 5.  Well...for those of us with earlier models that tells you all you need to know. Again...this is a persistent, fundamental flaw.\n\nOf course...Google will lean on the warranty but, if this is a baked in issue, it was there across builds from the start.  They'll then say...\"buy an upgraded model\".  Well...when researched...the issue will still be in any upgrade as well.\n\nI can't say this enough...avoid the Pixel.  What's frustrating is this is a well documented issue across the years.  Its a 50/50 shot it will probably hit your phone post warranty...so.. you're spending a LOT of money for an already flawed phone that will at some point have this issue.   There will be no recourse on the back end unless you're in warranty AND your replacement will still be flawed.\n\nI'm just sayin'!", "is_img": 0, "category": "Battery and Power, Google Pixel 3", "post_time": "2020-12-30T16:09:36.119103+00:00", "reply": "0 Replies"}

A few days ago it would constantly notify me it was charging, stop charging (according to the charge status icon) continuously.  I eventually stopped keeping it plugged into my laptop.\n\nA couple of days ago the phone started getting much warmer.  Today, I took it out of my protective case and noticed that the right side of the case where the power button and volume control are.  It looks like the battery has expanded from the heat, splitting the seal on the case.  The phone is still working, but I don't think it will be working for long if I can't reseal the phone case and stop the overheating.  Here's a picture of the split phone case:  (couldn't add a link to my picture in Google Photos of the split phone).", "is_img": 0, "category": "Battery and Power, Google Pixel 3 XL", "post_time": "2020-09-14T21:41:29.826112+00:00", "reply": "1 Recommended Answer"}

My two biggest factors for upgrading to it are the battery of course, the RAM, and the 90 Hz refresh rate. I' not a HUGE gamer by any stretch of the imagination on my phone. I have a few 3rd party apps on my phone including Pandora, Slack (for work), and Tapatalk for Android Central forums. I have noticed that with my moderate to light usage on my phone, whenever I am checking the battery break-down usage for my battery per charge, Google Play Services in the \"show system apps\" part of the battery break-down is ALWAYS the top contender. Now, i would love for something to explain to me if this is normal or not. I mean for my 4,080 mAh battery, I am getting 1 1/2 on heavy usage  t 2 full days on my average moderate usage. However, EVERY Single full battery charge cycle Google Play Services along with Android Messages is at the top. Whenever I am not using my phone, idle time seems great; meaning that the phone is sipping battery power which is good. I am just worried that something might be wrong. I did boot my phone yesterday into Safe Mode in order to test out my OS, and it seemed to use battery a little less. I'm not sure if it's my Slack, or my Tapatalk app which could be using Google Play Services in the background. What' I've done for those two apps, is restrict background usage in the hokes of the Google Play Services battery drain being less. Is this a good idea, or is there something else I can be doing to help my phones battery out? Thank you very much for any support!

I currently have a two line Fi plan with unlimited data. I recently bought two Pixel 4a's and one of them stopped charging within the first two months of ownership so I started a warranty request and shipped it back for replacement or repair. The device was essentially brand new and undamaged, aside from this issue. Upon receipt of the device Google tech support sent an automated email asking me to pay $129 for fixing a cracked screen which my device didn't have when I mailed it in (using Google-provided packaging). I contacted support and explained the issue. I was transferred between five representatives, each had me start over explaining the issue again. I eventually asked to be connected to a supervisor. I was told they would email me within 48 hours. I waited. Eventually I received an email. Again I explained the issue. By the time the supposed supervisor replied, another automated email was sent saying my device was being shipped back to me. I explained what was happening. I had no continuity of communication with the supposed supervisor, instead each time I got a reply from someone, each days apart, i would hear from a different person. None of them seemed to have any inclination or ability to address the situation. Communication was extremely poor. I wound up shipping the device back for repair a second time. Again, I got the same series of automated emails. Again, no response or action taken by Google support personnel. I am now awaiting any response at all. I am now about one month without this brand new phone and not any closer to resolution. There seems to be absolutely no recourse for consumers and no support line to talk to a human, just email and chat and extremely long delays between emails without any progress.

This is the second time the 4 XL has stopped working properly for me -- I bought one originally direct from Google in April 2020, then had to get it replaced once in July 2020 when it started switching itself off in my pocket. That one was replaced in July and now this issue has started.\nI've chatted with Google Support, who said that I bought my phone from a retailer (I didn't -- bought it direct from Google), and I keep being told the issue is being investigated and they'll have an update 'soon'. I've been waiting three days now, and have this morning emailed through the original email receipts for the original purchase, then the replacement purchase in July.\nIn the meantime, I'm using an old backup device with a dodgy battery. In short, I totally regret purchasing the Pixel 4 XL and want to know what my options are. I've paid more money than I ever have before for this phone with which I am totally dissatisfied. \nCheers,\nPatrick", "is_img": 0, "category": "Battery and Power, Google Pixel 4 XL", "post_time": "2020-12-07T02:48:27.72893+00:00", "reply": "2 Replies"}

This new replacement they gave me, had no accidents and I have taken very good care of it. I am aware that if there are problems within the 90 days, there is no fee for any defects etc. But since it has been over the 90 days, my options are to pay again a service fee of $225 CAD, or go to ibreakufix store to have it diagnosed, the Assurant support person said. I even have preferred care, which was an additional $200 and if I get charged again for a service fee, then this phone has costed me $2k. At this point I could have gotten a better phone from a different carrier. I even found many threads on reddit about people reporting the swollen batteries, shouldn't these be recalled since many users are reporting this? Is there anyone that can help me? I already called customer support (Assurant), they literally just gave me generic responses, when this clearly is a manufacturer defect.

But I've found out that some apps still run in the background despite restricting background battery usage and using battery optimization (ofc with adaptive battery on).\nOn my previous daily driver which used Android 10, it worked flawlessly. Some apps would run in the background but would be put to sleep after about 15 minutes.\nOn the Pixel 4a I currently use Greenify to force stop some apps I don't need to run in the background and my battery life is pretty amazing as you can see in this screenshot and this screenshot.\n Fast forward to today, without Greenify apps still run in the background (force stop in app info is clickable) and the \"while in background\" timer just goes up. I've restricted those apps but they still run in background even though I only use them once a day for about 5-10 minutes as you can see here in this screenshot. Keep in mind that I forced closed the app after discovering that the app still run in the background.\n So now my battery life looks like this. Which isn't really good. Some people might say that it is maybe an app, that drains the battery. Well guess what, no apps installed only the default apps and here you can see the madness. I charged my phone up to 95% and after about 4 hours in idle and 12 minutes SoT, it dropped down to 81%.\nCurrently it looks like this. As you can see now I only have 74% with 6 hours and 30 minutes in idle with 40 minutes SoT.\n So what the heck is going on?", "is_img": 0, "category": "Battery and Power, Google Pixel 4a", "post_time": "2020-11-09T15:57:05.166562+00:00", "reply": "0 Replies"}

Note: It doesn't happen everytime\nThen, things went back to normal for a couple of days. However, it's happening again. About 3-4 times per day, my phone flashes lines on the top part of the screen, shaped like thunder (black and a little bit of green, direction: left to right)  In addition, it turns off sometimes, but this usually happens whenever I charge my phone. Also, I sometimes try to unlock my phone while it's charging, and it sometimes turns off. \n\nI'm afraid that my phone won't turn on someday.\n\nBackground: I've had this phone since July 2019. Never had an issue. My phone is in perfect condition, with no cracks. no major accidents, etc. However, I do believe small changes (speed, lagging) started occurring in July of this year, but nothing major.

But, I haven't seen a report of my specific symptoms so I thought I'd add them.\n\nA lot of the time wireless charging seems to work well on the multiple Qi chargers I have around the house. All support Qi EPP at up to 15W with a 25W QC adapter, or \"12-13W\" with the QC 2.0 adapter curiously supplied with the charger.\n\nOccasionally though, for seemingly no good reason charging will rapidly grind to a halt, for example saying that the phone is at x% (50, 60, 80, 90 - it doesn't seem specific to a particular battery level), with an estimated many, many hours to completion eg. 13 hours. Even rebooting the phone or moving it to another charger does not seem to fix it. The back of the phone in this situation is kinda warm, so maybe it has thermally throttled. But, there is no good reason why this would have happened - the phone is not being heavily used at the time, it is not in a hot location, really nothing is different to the other times when charging works perfectly.\n\nUsing a tool to look at the battery the charging power has dropped to 0.2-0.5W, which explains the long charging time! The battery temperature is shown at about 38C. I'm unaware of what temperature thermal throttling should occur.\n\nSo, it seems, at times the Pixel 5 (and other Android 11 phones?) seems to just about shut down wireless charging, even in circumstances of use and location, when this should not be necessary. It may possibly be caused by overheating. I guess this could be caused by one or more processors being stuck in a high power state.\n\nHopefully, this may help in identifying the issue.", "is_img": 0, "category": "Battery and Power, Google Pixel 5", "post_time": "2020-10-31T14:49:55.183111+00:00", "reply": "0 Replies"}

Now, I've replugged in the phone and the following loop happens\n\n1. Charging logo (Bolt and white battery) pops up for 1-2 seconds \n2. The lightning bolt disappears and the battery greys out, making it seem like the charger was disconnected (it isn't)\n3. At about the same time, a white bar appears at the top of the screen, about halfway across. Then it quickly 'loads' across the screen, and the screen turns black for about 10-15 seconds, and the cycle repeats.\n\nI've waited a bit, and when I try to turn on the phone, it boots to the G logo, then turns off, presumably it doesn't have a charge. I've tried another charger and the same loop happens. \n\nThis all seems like a charger issue, but this only happened when upgrading to Android 11, and the loop sequences makes it seem like a software one. Any ideas? My phone is 100% unusable as is.\n\n\nEDIT: After trouble shooting more, using a slow charging method works fine, but only when the phone is powered off. However, my battery is now draining super fast and plugging in any charger when on literally instantly turns off my phone, lol. This is a horrendous update if it makes any charger instantly make your phone stop working and crash.

My complaint was that the headset and charger USB cable getting disconnected abruptly while being used and that I could hear the noise as if the port was rusted while attaching and detaching the cable from my phone. My complaint was addressed when a B2X service engineer came to my place and cleaned the USB port there itself. I told him about the same and he said that the cleaning would work, and it did for a temporary basis. But after a month or so the problem was still there with the charging function, as I had to keep my phone in one position while it was being charged, I thought that the issue was due to some problem in the cable and thus didn't bother much. But then suddenly after sometime in August 2020. My phone stopped charging completely with the OEM charger and cable, and even the Headset dongle wasn't working. I registered a complaint and my fone was sent for repair outside the warranty, costing me about Rs. 2100/-. As stated in my complaint this time the fault was written as \"corrosion in a USB port\".\nHad my issue been taken seriously the first time, when my phone was under warranty I could have been saved from this extra spending and the hassle of going through the process, again and again, I am a layman and not an engineer myself to diagnose my phone for the issues and problems. It is your job to provide me with that service, at which you have failed. If the issue had been taken seriously the first time I indicated it was not working well!I don't know whether it was your lethargy or incompetence, but it has cost me. My phone is currently under repair at the B2X center in Mumbai, and I am attaching my service id for this time and also for the previous time. Hoping that you would take this issue seriously now.\nYashdeep Singh Ahluwalia", "is_img": 0, "category": "Battery and Power, Google Pixel 2", "post_time": "2020-09-04T03:09:48.506459+00:00", "reply": "1 Reply"}

After about 48 hours on the charger, it turned on. Everything worked fine. \n\nA few weeks after the phone died and turned back on, the phone shut down again, but this time I was able to power it back on after a few minutes of charging, which brought it back up to about 75% (oddly swift). Shortly after powering up the phone and pulling it from the charger, I watched as the percentage dropped from 75% to 1% in only a few seconds. \n\nAfter some charging and use, I realized that the battery itself is actually fine. The phone remains functional through my regular use, and for about as long as it always did, before the percentage drop issue. \n\nI've done all of the troubleshooting steps, including an FDR. I've noticed that the percentage begins it's cascade any time I receive an in-bound notification. I tampered with notifications a bit, including turning off notifications entirely. I had my lady send me a few messages, and even when I've got notifications off, the percentage drops.  \n\nI'm happy the phone is still functional. However, it's frustrating that I never actually have an accurate reflection of the battery life.

Now the bottom volume button does not work at all, it's as if it's been smashed/pressed in to the point where it's unable to be pressed. The increase volume button works though, and the power button still works.\nHowever, now whenever my phone runs out of battery or is hut down, it goes into fastboot mode. \n\nThe problem now is that I can't select any options in the fastboot menu using the power button. Instead of the power button acting as the 'select option' button, it instead cycles between the options in the same way that the volume button does. So the only thing I can do while in fastboot, is cycle between all of the boot options, and never actually select any of them, it's like there two volume up buttons. I usually have to wait for it to completely run out of battery while in fastboot, wait for it to charge completely and wait around 12 hours, but this takes quite some time as power usage is very low in this mode, and even then, it doesn't have a 100% success rate as sometimes it'll launch back into fastboot mode and I'll have to wait for my battery to go flat while in this mode.\n I have tried using Android Multi Tools and the minimal ADB fastboot tools to try and manually get my phone out of fastboot while plugged into my pc, but that didn't work either. It turns the screen off for a second, then immeadiately launches back into fastboot mode again. I have not tried wiping my data/cache using these programs, I consider this a last resort, at the current rate I don't think it'll do anything though.\n\nAny help would be appreciated, my hope is that perhaps I can plug in an external device like a small phone keyboard or mouse to cycle through the menu instead.", "is_img": 0, "category": "Battery and Power, Google Pixel 3 XL", "post_time": "2020-08-30T22:42:46.616643+00:00", "reply": "1 Reply"}

I woke up to my phone being at 12%. I thought it was a fluke with my cord because it is the original charger that came with the phone so it is a tad bit worn. However, I plugged in another USB-C charger and still nothing. I was able to charge intermittently with my car charger, but that stopped working and now I am reduced to a wireless charger which literally takes the entire night to get to 100%. \nAlso, my battery is draining quickly. I lost 12% in less than 30 minutes with immediately turning on the phone it goes to 99%. The brightness is on adaptive or I adjust to at most 50% (I don't like bright screens so if it goes to high I turn it down). \nI have started in Safe Mode and the battery was slipping but a little slower. \nDiagnosis says all apps are fine and nothing is draining my batter. When I restarted no apps were running other than Chrome and Google Messages. I don't download new apps often and the last one I downloaded was Zelle and have since removed it. \nThen add to that, Google Messages won't download pictures. I am updated to the last system update.\nI really liked this phone and wasn't having any issues until the previous update and started seeing the battery drainage which after a couple of resets seem to be a bit better, but now its back. \n\nIs the next step a factory refresh and if that doesnt help just be with a bum phone?

My observations are as follows:\n\n1) The phone was at 100%, and still present on the wireless dock (Pixel Stand). Turned on Hotspot and was downloading a few things (at a speed of 1-2 MB/s for most of the time, sometimes beyond 5MB/s). After some 10 mins, the charge starts reducing to 99%, 98% and keeps going down (and also the device heats a little, I agree with heating using hotspot). But even when the heat is negligible, wireless charging is unable to go forward. I was at least expecting it to stay at 100% because Pixel Stand outputs 11W.\nTried this many times with different charge levels, all the time the charge reduces.\n\n2) The phone was at 20%, plugged in the wired charger. For the entire 90 mins duration of hotspot usage, the charge increased from 20% - 23%. This is frankly shocking, given the output is 18 W charger and it managed to raise only 3%. Repeated this numerous times at 50%, 35%, all the time the maximum increase during hotspot usage is 5%.\n\nBefore buying the Pixel 4 XL, was using the HTC U11. It also comes with an 18W charger. I remember my HTC charging fast enough as I use the hotspot. I wanted to repeat it again and tried with my HTC U11. At 20% turned on the hotspot and connected wall charger. It went to 50% in approx 35 mins and it continued to fast charge. \n\nAs I type this right now, have been using Hotspot over the past 2-3 hours, the device is on PIxel Stand and the charge is now at 40%, the original charge level was 92%.\n\nRight now using Android 11 beta 3 on Pixel 4 XL.

Why? Because if I don't, my phone heats up a lot when placed on the Pixel Stand and it starts to discharge.\n\nBefore some \"expert\" (or rather PR agent) of Google comes with a simple list of steps to help and then marks it as a solution... Here's why I think it's simply software. The phone is placed on the Pixel stand (straight). The phone heats up and then starts to (fast) discharge. This is something I can reproduce almost daily. Then, without moving the phone, so I'm not taking it off the Stand, or changing the position, I hold down the power off button and reboot the phone. After that, the phone is still hot, but starts to actually charge. So the problem is not heat, case, position, charging cable, or whatever. It's pretty sure the software.\n\nI already did a full system wipe and side loaded the latest stock ROM on the phone. No effect. This problem is likely a software bug, which Google simply ignores. I've been sending feedback with the system details for months.\n\nWhen a reboot solves it, without changing any other variables, my guess is that it really is a software issue. So please, PR agent (or \"expert\"), don't copy paste your sh*tty list here of things to do and mark it as a solution (as is done here). Poke the Google developers and let them debug this issue.

Restart the phone. No help. The phone still does not recognize that it is plugged in. \n\n2. Boot to safe mode. No help. The phone still does not recognize that it is plugged in.\n 3. Tried my pixel charger for the pixel 4xl. No help. The phone still does not recognize that it is plugged in. \n\n4. Turned off the phone and plugged it in to the charger. The phone charges just fine until I turn the phone back on. Then the phone no longer recognizes that it is plugged in. \n\n5. I read many forum postings that show similar issues. Tried to charge with a USB C to USB A cable. The phone charges slowly. This is not an acceptable solution. \n\n6. Turned on developer mode and checked \"usb preferences settings\". It is already set to \"this device\" as is suggested in several forums. This has not fixed the issue. \n\n7. Today the phone is now recognizing that it is plugged in when I put the cable in to charge with the pixel charger. It will cycle between charging and not charging every 1.5 seconds for about 1 minute. Then sometimes it starts to charge and sometimes it stops recognizing that it is plugged in. \n\nFrom this basic troubleshooting, I do not believe the problem is hardware since it will charge slowly via a USB C to USB A cable. It is definitely not the charger since both the charger that came with the Pixel 3a and my Pixel 4xl work on my 4xl without any trouble. I do not believe it is an app since safe mode did not help. \n\nI would rather not do another warranty phone since that was a disaster the first time (FedEx delivered my package to the wrong address and it took 6 hours and 2 weeks to resolve). 1:1 support seems to be a waste of time based on my experience. They are nice but not very knowledgeable or helpful. I'm feeling kind of stuck at this point.", "is_img": 0, "category": "Battery and Power, Google Pixel 3", "post_time": "2020-07-30T16:48:09.382173+00:00", "reply": "1 Recommended Answer"}

Last Friday my Pixel died. It stuck, I try to restart it pressing Power button + volume down, it shutdown but never turned it on again. I took it to a random repair shop here, they tested the battery and it seems that is not taking proper amperage or something like that. Anyways, phone won't turn on again. \n\nI was contacting MediaMarkt but they told me to contact Google so can I ship the Pixel back or something like since I live in Poland and not in Germany. I tried to contact Google via Twitter (@MadeByGoogle). Here is the answer:\n\n\"Thanks for the info. It looks like you're currently in a location where we have limited support options. Please note that we offer warranty support only in countries where we sell devices. You can get in touch with our team directly when you're back in a country where we sell Pixel phones or ask a friend (in a country where we sell devices) to do so on your behalf by clicking on \u201cContact Us\u201d in the bottom of this page: https://goo.gle/2Eqys1z Appreciate your understanding.\"\n\nAnyways, my question is: how to do it? Google tells me I need to get back to Germany so I can get support. It should be simple, no? Give me an address, I will ship and that's it. \n\nAny help or clues? Hope I was clear enough. \nThanks all!", "is_img": 0, "category": "Battery and Power, Google Pixel 3 XL", "post_time": "2020-07-21T15:27:25.354908+00:00", "reply": "3 Replies"}

The phone will periodically not charge, I called google about this when it was still under warranty and got the run around so I said F it, I'll just deal with it.  A subsequent update and all was well for several months, hell probably a year.  However, this latest version of Android has brought a host of issues to my phone, most of which have been fixable.  Most of my settings were lost for example, google assistant no longer recognizes my voice, my news feed and Gmail had to be setup again.  \n\nHowever, the larger problem is with charging.  If I charge the unit with the google included chargers it does not work.  The chargers aren't the problem, my wife's Pixel charges just fine.  Mine was charging until the update in June (and everything went wonky).  I can't charge when using USBC to USBC the phone just shuts off.  When using USBA to USBC it works some of the time but will periodically shut the phone down, I can't figure out the trigger on that one.  For example it shut down Monday overnight and again last night, but has worked well a half dozen times in between.  \n\nOn the car charger it will usually charge but I have to go through a restart before it will charge.  The restart happens within a minute or two of plugging the phone in.  \n\nThis appears to be a very common problem but the threads appear to be locked for discussion.  I'm running out of ideas and hoping someone here has a suggestion that I've overlooked?  \n\nSo far I've tried safe mode which still has the issue, I've put no new apps on my phone and as such don't believe this is a third party app issue.  This appears to be a google problem, especially given the high volume of issues and complaints I've found.  \n\nTips/Tricks would be nice if anyone has them.

I keep those buttons pressed for over 60 seconds and nothing will happen.\n\nCan anybody help? thanks", "is_img": 0, "category": "Battery and Power, Google Pixel 2", "post_time": "2020-07-15T13:56:29.805647+00:00", "reply": "1 Reply"}

Prior to the issue, my phone battery usually last about 1 day and half (I usually use my phone for texts and reading news). Now the battery will last less than a day with the same kind of usage. I did not make any changes to system settings before the issue started so originally I thought it was due to one of the apps, I did multiple tests by killing vary apps and retest but nothing worked. I went to camping last weekend and I immediately noticed how my phone battery performance is back to normal and I figured out the only difference on my phone that weekend is not being connected to wifi. After returning to home, I decided to turn off wifi to test the battery for a couple of days and the battery performance was normal. When I turn wifi back on, it drains the battery quickly. \n\nI looked around the Pixel Community forums for the same issue and I saw a few threads (for different Pixel model) and apparently they identified the issue being static IPs and solved it by switching to DHCP mode. I tried that but I couldn't find any setting related to DHCP on my Pixel 3. I'm not sure if it's because of the model? \n\nI already sent feedback to Google via phone system feedback. I also contacted Google customer support and the rep seemed to be following a troubleshooting script without any knowledge and now he wants me to do factory reset but I highly doubt it will resolve the issue since I tried resetting the network settings so I'm hoping one of you guys will have a real solution.", "is_img": 0, "category": "Battery and Power, Google Pixel 3", "post_time": "2020-06-18T13:24:07.604637+00:00", "reply": "1 Recommended Answer"}

It also never seems to die at night when it is plugged in charging, although it will die if it is plugged in and I am using it.  When it does die, I sometimes have to press and hold the power button several times before it will fire back up.\nUsing other posts, I have so far done the following:\nUpdated to the latest version (Android 10, most recent security update)\nRan my phone in Safe Mode (issue still occurs)\nDone a factory reset (no change)\n    \nI bought the phone in Feb 2019, so it is less than 1.5 years old.

Purchased it one and half years ago IN NOVEMBER 2018 & I'm constantly facing problems. Previously, even before the device completed one year of purchase, the device showed a display pixelation issue along with a battery issue. This issue was before even one year of purchase. I sent the device to Mumbai(B2X; google authorized service). They repaired it, replaced the battery and display and sent the device back. Within another 3 days of repair, the display pixelation issue started again, not as intense as the previous issue, but slightly. I contacted the customer service people again, and I didnt get a prompt response from them. Note that this was within a few days of repair. \n\nAnd now, it has not even been one year after repair and replacement of the battery, the battery has started BULGING! Ive been facing constant problems after purchasing this phone.  I am facing the headache of always contacting the customer care and always facing some issue or the other. The device truly has some issue. The customer support is truly useless, with no proper support. How can I escalate this issue to higher authorities and how can I get this done. How can I even approach for a replacement of the device since I faced problems often.

The main issue is that the power button does not power the screen off most of the time. I have to click it 5-10 times before it accepts the click. And sometimes as I do that, the camera app launches with a single click. \n\nI looked this issue up back then and there weren't many complaints so I decided it to accept it. Now there are tons of others having the issue. \n\nAnother thing started happening a few months ago. I would be on a call with the phone near my ear and I need to look at something on the phone (usually email or a map). So I move the phone away from my ear and the screen remains pitch black. Clicking the power button doesn't turn the screen on. This issue persists until the other person hangs up. Sometimes if they don't hang up, I have to reboot with a long press.\n\nThe phone getting stuck in screen-off mode happens so often now, I usually end up rebooting the phone every other day. The reboots don't fix the inconsistent power button. These phone sometimes behaves normally and sometimes the power button feels like it's asleep. I also think the lack of responsiveness increases after watching a YouTube video. It's almost impossible to turn the phone off right after closing YouTube.\n\nThat and the launching of the camera app with a single click make me feel like I'm using a junk phone not a high end phone. I LOVE Android but these issues (I've had other hardware issues with previous Google phones... this is my 4th) make me strongly and I say this VERY sadly but strongly consider another maker for my next phone. I am one of few people in my company that use a Google phone. Everyone else uses an iPhone or a Samsung. I usually brag to them about the power of Android and how my Pixel gives me the vanilla experience. Google got too many chances and I feel this is it for my Google phone buying streak. UNLESS they make it right. Not sure if this is the right forum to request support directly from Google or not. The \"Contact Us\" option was for chat. I don't feel like typing back and forth for hours.\n\nHere are some links of others experiencing the issue... there are many more:\nhttps://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/41669909?hl=en\nhttps://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/17067447?hl=en\nhttps://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/17067447?hl=en\nhttps://forums.androidcentral.com/google-pixel-2-pixel-2-xl/950305-power-button-2-xl.html\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/987idi/pixel_2_xl_power_button_not_responding_most_of/", "is_img": 0, "category": "Battery and Power, Google Pixel 2", "post_time": "2020-06-05T19:55:29.07312+00:00", "reply": "1 Reply"}

Finding that highly odd, I rebooted the phone and removed it from the charger.  \n\nA day of minimal use dropped to about 50%.  Now here's where the concerning part started.  Hopped in the car, started a bluetooth audio to the car, and brought up google maps.  The battery went from 49% to dead within five minutes.  I saw the \"your phone will run out of battery soon\" pop up on the screen and tick from 7% to 6% to dead within 30 seconds.

Scrolled over to the google feed to check news and watched it drop almost instantaneously to 17%.  Saw an article about Stadia, clicked into it, and got the battery warning pop up, watched it drop from 11% to zero in a matter of seconds.\n\nI've reset the phone multiple times.  High battery drain is happening no matter what condition: wifi on/off, bluetooth on/off, location services, airplane mode, etc.\n\nOn the latest software version, no new apps installed, only app updates since I started noticing the issue.

The morning after, I woke to find the phone, its buttons, and the screen completely unreponsive (including power+down button). I cleaned all my cables and ports thoroughly, and still nothing.   I looked for on this support forum and Reddit for answers and left my phone to charge between the 3-foot charger and the phone's original charger for around 30 minutes, with the red LED light flashing the entire time.\n\nAfter 30 minutes, I pressed power+down button and was finally able the bootloader menu to appear and selected start. After this, the phone restarts or turns off immediately upon plugging in the 3' charger. Then, I plugged in the original phone charger but this only charges the phone for 30 seconds to 1 minute before the charging stops completely.  I tried both USB-C to USB-C chargers with several electrical outlets with the same results. The only way the phone keeps charging is with an old Google USB-C to USB-A connected to my PC. \n\nI called Google support and was told to re-try everything I've already tried before, the last part resulted in the phone restarting during the call because I plugged the 3' charger.  I was never contacted again from Google support despite assurances that I would be within an hour and despite having given the tech a second phone number to call.\n\nI tried a factory reset yesterday and nothing's changed.  I tried using the phone's original USB-C/USB-C cable with an old LG Nexus 5X wall charger and was able to keep a charge so far, like with the USB-C/USB-A port on my PC.  I keep an old Anker USB-C/USB-C cable (Nexus 5X approved) with a portable battery on my car to charge the phone with sometimes, and this also works to keep a charge.  \nIt seems like this is only an issue with the new Google cables/chargers or my USB port is going bad.  \n\nAny help would be great.

I purchased a Pixel 3 XL from a private seller online.  I have no idea what someone did to this phone but here's the problem(s).  It won't turn on except for one screen that says \"Can't find a valid operating system, phone won't start.\"  I can access the bootloader but that's basically it.  I can get fastboot to recognize the device, I can even get chrome to see the device too.  But the bootloader is locked and it won't let me unlock it.  I use the command \"fastboot flashing unlock\" and it throws an error.  I can't flash a factory image because it says the bootloader is locked.  And the worst part of all, is there is no recovery at all on the phone!  When you select recovery mode, it just boots to that screen saying there is no operating system.  So therefore I can't even adb sideload a recovery or an OTA or anything!  So I'm kinda stuck between a rock and a hard place here.  I even took the phone to ubreakifix and the dude gave me a link to a site that will flash a factory image to the phone and I was so excited about it but it won't work because apparently the phone was never updated to android 10 because there is no Rescue mode.  There has GOT to be some kind of backdoor.  Some way to at least get a recovery back on the phone.  Some kind of command that'll work.  Also, I might add the phone is no longer under warranty as of like 2 weeks ago, ugh.  I hope somebody here has a solution.  Otherwise I guess I just have me a rather expensive paperweight.

Once the battery drops below 50%, the phones will randomly shut down at any given time between 50% and 0% battery. We will plug the phones back into the charger, and after powering on, the batteries will show at up to 50% charge when plugged in, but will drop down to 3% / 2%/ 1% as soon as the cable is unplugged. We have to let the phones charge back to 100% for reliable function. \n\nWe have tried everything that Google suggests, but we have not found any permanent fix if a phone is already experiencing the behavior. It seems the only thing that worked was to get a brand new replacement phone. But this issue took about a year or two of use to manifest, so who knows if a replacement phone is even a true solution at this point. \n\nBetween my spouse and I, we have had this same issue with THREE different models of the 1st Gen Google Pixel 128GB 2016.\n\nThis issue would be easy to fix with a simple refurb replacement from Google, except they only offer a 1 year manufacturer warranty for a $750 product, and they won't accept responsibility for this major hardware defect...\n\nLuckily my spouse paid for insurance with Verizon, so we received a replacement for her 1st phone that seems to be working OK so far.\n\nI did not have insurance, so I bought an out-of-warranty refurbished unit and within a week it was displaying the same behavior. So I sent it back.\n\nI took my original phone to the Google authorized 3rd party repair center to try a battery swap. Three days passed for a supposed 2 hour repair. I called to get a status update and they admitted that even after the battery was replaced with a brand new one, it was still randomly shutting down once battery was under 50%.\n\nI asked the tech what next steps would be to fix the issue, and he said if they can't diagnose the issue, there's nothing else they can do and I would have to contact Google support. So here I am. But it seems that Google is not offering any real solutions to this issue. \n\nWhat we have tried per Google instructions:\n- boot into safe mode\n- factory reset\n- replace chargers and cables\n- request replacement device under Verizon extended warranty (only option working OK so far)\n- replace battery via approved 3rd party\n- contact Google support\n\nThe only solution offered by Google is to buy a new phone!?\n\nWe did not even finish making the monthly payments on my wife's phone before the issues began. We bought these phones brand new at launch for $750 each. Her insurance cost us another $350. I bought the refurb phone for $150. The battery replacement was $100. The replacement cables and chargers were another $40. So I have spent over $2000 on maintaining two Google Pixel phones that did not last 3 years, and are only 50% reliable. Terrible.\n\nMy phone has turned off during business calls, once in a lifetime family photos, time-sensitive moments of need, and many more unforgivable circumstances. I regret buying a Google Pixel phone because this power issue has been negatively affecting our daily quality of life for nearly a year now. \n\nI was a huge fan of the Google Pixel / Daydream / Fi line of products and I guess this is the price I paid as an early adopter. I will be going back to flip phones and a GPS because flagship phones are too expensive and risky when manufacturer warranty terms are shorter than their typical device payment plan terms. Only way this consumer exploitation will change is if the customers vote with their dollar and take their business somewhere else. \n\nI see this same hardware issue is affecting other Pixel models, even with latest gen releases. Shame on the Google Pixel team for poor communication and accountability for such a major hardware defect on multiple devices across a flagship product line.", "is_img": 0, "category": "Battery and Power, Google Pixel", "post_time": "2019-07-20T00:01:12.576136+00:00", "reply": "1 Recommended Answer"}

I can now cause my phone to crash by listening to bluetooth audio (spotify) and taking a picture (snapchat) below 60% battery.

Since the start of this year, I've been having issues that shut down my phone at around 25% battery or less whenever I play audio on my phone speakers/alarm sounds/or sometimes a vibrate from a incoming call. Whenever it shuts down, it does sort of a like a sudden screen blackout without warning, with a few horizontal white lines in the middle; then if its somewhat >10%, it just restarts, but otherwise will stay off. I've downloaded some apps to check battery life (Accubattery), and it seems to be at around \\~65% battery lifespan (though I'm not sure if this is an accurate measurement). However, I'm now very aware of when my phone is at low percentages, and am curious to know what could be causing the audio in low percent shutdowns to occur. As for physical damage to the phone, since a year ago ,I've only had one major drop to the phone's bottom left, with it landing screen side down causing a minor crack, but all parts of the screen still touchable and usable. Not sure if this is a common occurrence among the first set of Pixel2 phones, or this is just unique to my case. I've tried battery saver and turning it on/off to no avail, and also did a full battery charge to full drain to no improvement on the audio shutdown problem. I don't want to do a factory reset yet, as i am not sure if that's the fix for the problem, and would only waste time setting up stuff again if that's nit the solution. I need some direction to look into what I can troubleshoot or if this is a hardware defect, if someone has come across this before. Any and all help on this with this would be appreciated.

Played with it all day and installed my apps.\nThen I went to sleep at night and it had about 13% battery percentage left and I put it on the charger.\nThis morning the device was turned off and when I pulled the charger out and plugged it back in it said it had 0% battery. But I could turn it back on again and then it said it was 100%. So I left it in the charger while it was turned on for a few minutes and when I came back to it, it was turned off again. If I removed the charger it wouldn't even start up. It would at first give me an icon that the battery was too low. And if I waited a few minutes it doesn't show anything on the screen. After that I put it on the charger again and when I booted the device it immediately shut down when it was on the lockscreen. I even had it shut down while booting. Also every time I wanted to boot the phone I needed to pull the charger out and put it back in. After this I tried booting it in safe mode, but the same story here. It turned off after a minute or so. So I went to work and left it off for about 45 minutes. I put it on the charger at work and turned it on while leaving it still on the table and it stayed on for a few minutes. A colleague suggested to shake the device to see if it would shut down suddenly and it did. He thinks it is a battery connector issue.\nSo I tried the last thing I could do, a factory reset. It shut down when the device wanted to start erasing all data. Then when starting it up again it erased all data and I was in the welcome screen. The battery was 100% and I pulled out the charger and it turned off again.\n\nTo sum up what I tried:\nBoot without charger (doesn't boot up at all)\nBoot with charger connected (shuts down after a minute or so)\nBoot in safe mode (shuts down after a minute or so)\nFactory reset (shuts down in start screen as well)\n\nI really don't know what to do right now. I just received it yesterday :(. Also I ordered it from the UK and I live in the Netherlands, so if there is anything I can do without sending it back that would be awesome.\nIf I do need to send it back, how will that work? Do I need to send it back to my friend in the UK which will send it back to Google? And how do I start the send back procedure?\n\nI hope someone can give me some more information about what's happening.

(Can not turn on)", "content": "The thing is, it is not my first phone having some sort of weird stuff of that kind.\nMy previous Nexus 5X from Google went on an endless boot loop too... but from a different cause probably...\n\nAnyway, I was using my Pixel 2 normally, It was charged to around 40-48% I went away for a sec, came back and out of nowhere my phone just died. The battery probably completely drained.\nMust mention, my battery was operating perfectly all of the time before, so while it was strange, I thought I'll just come home and charge it regularly...\nI considered this as a pretty weird anomaly since usually when the battery goes to 0% there is usually some red light that toggles to show that the battery is dead when PWR Button is pressed.\nNothing like that this time.\n\nOnce I plugged in my Pixel 2, it started charging and turned again for the last time to show it had 47% that switched to 0 % that immediately turned off the phone. Since then the phone was showing that it is charging the battery, turning on and to maybe show `Google` (from Android 10 dark theme) or something that looks like a loading bar and immediately fading out and showing that the battery was dead.\n\nDetails (details that came to my attention that might be helpful to resolve or better understand the problem)\nNothing turns on to show that the battery is dead (the Red LED in the bottom doesn't turn on, neither the one on the right top corner of the phone) When unplugged at least.\nCharging Pixel 2 using USB - Type C that connects to PC made the red led in the top right corner of the phone flash. Nothing became functional though.\nWhen plugged, the screen shows it is charging and tries to automatically boot up the system.\nOnce it tries displaying Google or some loading bar instead, everything on the screen immediately fades away slowly. (image seems to be stuck and brightness fading down shortly)\nThen the top right LED flashes once completing that cycle and starting right from the beginning where it showed that the phone is charging.\nWhen attempting to turn on sometimes it shows something that reminds me of a very thin loading bar or sometimes it shows \"Google\" before fading out.\nI was almost sure it had charge before suddenly showing 0%\nI tried letting it charge for some long time already without any new result\nI have/had Android 10 on my Pixel 2 ( I updated from Android 10 Beta to Android 10) - I don't think it is related to the problem but I am trying to mention every little detail\nThe decorative glass in the top back of the phone cover is slightly cracked - it was in the same condition for a long time and kept working.\nThe phone was wet several hours before the incident - but Pixel 2 has some waterproofing.\nit wasn't submerged but just had some little splashes on it for a short time. - once again it is not the first time it was wet with the cracked back cover glass.\nI loved my Pixel 2 very much and it was perfect all of the time, keeping it in the almost best condition possible - software-wise and planned on repairing the back cover glass on the screen myself since it seems like nobody is repairing Pixel phones in the place I live in\n\nWhat I suspect:\nSince it doesn't have any response at all when unplugged: might be some unique malfunction with the battery?\nLower probability but I'd still mention that it had Android 10 - after all my previous Google phone Nexus 5X died from a software update...\nGoing from 48 or 47 % to 0% seems to be like a symptom of the phone having water in the wrong places maybe. In that case, replacing the battery is still a good idea right?\nI am completely lost\nMy Pixel 2 is yet in some sort of coma. It could just wake up randomly, say hello and then going back into that phone coma breaking my heart once again.\n\nI am planning on buying a new battery and trying to replace it. I don't have any special tools for heating up the adhesive layer so I'd probably use just a hairdryer for that.\nOther tools are usually coming in battery replacements kits with the battery.\nHopefully, that surgical procedure will fix it up...\nThere is still risk that it won't and I'll just waste more time and money while trying to revive the dead.\nI don't know if it is a good idea yet so please let me know.\n\nSo now I finally came here to write a thread and ask for help.

Use daily for work.  After the Android 10, the battery life was cut in half.  At the most I am getting approximately 2 hours of active use.  The battery under Android 9 would run approximately 4 to 5 hours of heavy use.\n\nRecently, the phone started shutting down with between 20% and 30% of power still shown on the indicator.  After reading through the troubleshooting notes, I performed a hard reboot after I had charged the phone to 100%.  After the phone rebooted, the battery indicator showed 73% battery life.  I placed the phone on the charger and it charged another 25 min approx and reached 100 percent again.  Another hard reboot, and the phone still showed 100%.  If I use the phone under heavy use after the hard reboot, my battery life is closer to 4 hours again.  However, it seems there is an App or a setting under Android 10 that is affecting both the battery life and the accuracy of the battery indicator, because after some use, the phone will return to it's previous behavior and require another hard reboot.\n\nI have two Pixel XL phones and these issues only started after the upgrade to Android 10.  I also own a Nexus 6, still going strong and recently purchased a Pixel 4 XL.\n\nI am hoping that Google is paying attention to these posts and provides a fix for their original Pixel customers instead of leaving them hanging with a final update to Android 10 with inherent battery issues.

This was another symptom that points to a software issue specific to Power Delivery. It also makes updating the phone via the laptop and adb very difficult. My Phone constantly crashes when plugged into my laptop or 3rd party USB C chargers if Power Delivery in enabled from that source. I have tried cables numerous different brand and quality of cables and the behavior remains the same. If a USB C charger does not use Power Delivery the phone charges, however not rapidly.\n\nAnother strange aspect, but I cannot pin down if it is random or there is a pattern is how Power Delivery chargers work. When I use a charger type for the first time all seems well, power delivery or not. However subsequent attempts with that charger will fail. AN example of this was using the USB C port on the back of my LG monitor. It worked yesterday while I was testing, however when I attempted to use it today it did not work and my phone shutdowns immediately when it's plugged in. The same behavior has been seen with my mac book pro charger and my ZEROLEMON or AUKEY desktop chargers. \n\nI can get my phone to work with a USB C charger/port with Power Delivery randomly, however the majority of times it crashes. When it does crash it goes to the block screen, flashing the charging icon (with the bolt) repeatedly until unplugged, it cannot be started while it remains connected. Once unplugged it shows the battery symbol with the current charge and turns off, at this point the phone can be restarted as normal. \n\nUSB A to USB C is fine for the most part. USB C to USB C without Power Delivery is fine however, even with these chargers the phone does crash randomly. That means alarms are now useless because on a few occasions I have woken up to the phone in a powered-off state, because it crashed overnight while plugged in (USB A to USB C). I have tested this numerous times, with numerous chargers. All theses changers still work fine with any other devices that support USB C and Power Delivery. \n\nThis behavior began after the May update and it would seem this is a software issue and I am trying to figure out how to get it properly escalated so it can be fixed.", "is_img": 0, "category": "Battery and Power, Google Pixel 2", "post_time": "2019-06-10T22:27:35.959401+00:00", "reply": "7 Replies"}

I've tried to contact them over the mail, visit their site - it's offline since few weeks, no one picks up the phone..\n\nI've even tried the Facebook, and the story is the same, the page was removed.

Although the notificaiton isn't much of a problem this makes it so that my pixel 3 now cannot charge wired. I tried booting the phone into safe mode, disabling the non-exsistent audio device through the bluetooth section in settings, tried cleaning the port with some sharpened toothpicks, tried deleting apps that might affect the port, and lastly after everything failed I factor resetted my phone, and still the notification just comes back up. I've literally searched through the entire internet for any solutions but I genuinely could not find anyone with solid evidence that worked. I know that multiple posts about this same problem have been posted but I still made this post hopefully to see whether any progress had been made on the problem. A patch recently came in for the pxel 3 but with no luck fixing the problem, hopefully someone found a solution here in the forums.", "is_img": 0, "category": "Battery and Power, Google Pixel 3", "post_time": "2019-11-07T12:53:57.555787+00:00", "reply": "1 Recommended Answer"}

When the issue happened yesterday, the charging symbol would show for a second and then vanish, indicating the phone was detecting the charger\nIt's not an app causing the issue:  I restarted the phone in safe mode and tried charging and it made no difference.\nI've also tried it with another identical google pixel charger from a friend's phone, and with the fast charger that came with my Pixelbook (which works on the Pixelbook) - no charging. Tried connecting the cable to the Pixelbook to draw charge from the computer, that didn't help either. My phone's cable will work on my Pixelbook, so it's definitely an issue with my phone.\nHowever I it will take charge from a generic cheap USB-C to USB-A cable stuck into a socket - but only extremely slowly (much slower than this cable used to work). \nI really think that all of the above means the issue is with some software.

Just thought maybe there is an update on a new fix for this? \n\nSince my phone is almost 3 years old now, I guess I am only a bit devastated at the loss of my phone (since I replaced battery this year hoping to go for 5 years). But now I worry about the quality of the build for purchasing future Pixel phones ..\n\nPlease let me know if there are any updates to this problem! Still holding on to some hope.", "is_img": 0, "category": "Battery and Power, Google Pixel", "post_time": "2019-08-30T06:32:43.785408+00:00", "reply": "1 Recommended Answer"}

Basically, the battery usage information is just not very helpful or actionable. I have never had a mysteriously warm phone and found an explanation for it through this interface.\nMy brand new Pixel 3 has been warm, warm, warm. This morning I looked at Settings->Battery and chose \"Battery usage\" from the \"...\" menu. I also selected \"Show full device usage\" in the \"...\" menu on the \"Battery usage\" screen. The top results are:\nScreen: 3 hr, 35 min; 23%\nGoogle: 14 min; 17%\nAndroid System: 4%\nAndroid OS: 2%\nGoogle Play services: 3 hr, 35 min: 2 %\nOkay, \"Screen\". No, I did not have my screen an and full bright for 3.5 hours. So I don't know how to interpret that.\nBut here's another thing: I've never seen this before, but back on the Settings->Battery screen I have the warning \"Phone used more than usual\". When I click on that message, a pop-up appears and says this:\nTop 3 apps you used since full charge:\nDIGI Clock Widget 3 hr, 29 min\nAudible 1 hr, 33 min\nPocket Casts 51 min\nSo two items in Settings->Battery give me two different takes on what is using my battery. I do suspect that the DIGI Clock Widget is my problem. Is that not reported on the other list because it is a widget and exists as part of \"Screen\"? Who knows? I can say that the DIGI Clock Widget does NOT appear anywhere on the regular \"Battery usage\" list. If that app is responsible, then it's only because of that (incidental) \"Phone used more than usual\" message that I learned that. And I have never seen that message until today.\nFWIW I use the DIGI Clock Widget because it shows seconds. I do wish the system's clock widget had that option.", "is_img": 0, "category": "Battery and Power, Google Pixel 3", "post_time": "2019-08-08T16:34:11.871315+00:00", "reply": "1 Recommended Answer"}

The second one at least looked like OEM with the exterior but since it came from Amazon, it's not 100% certain.\nIs it possible that it's not a battery issue but maybe a different issue--perhaps motherboard?

I did the Android 9 update back in March but only started to experience very annoying problems a month ago.\n\nAfter the update, I first noticed the battery drain, it wasn't much at first and since my phone isn't recent I was kind of not surprised but now it's at the point that my phone will be completely drained after 2 hours without even using it ! If I use it, for example in the commute to work (45min), Spotify + browsing social media it's drained before I get to my office ! I have to walk around with a bunch of power banks or pray I'll find a plug when going out so I can charge my phone. Sometimes it shut down at 20% or more.\n\nThere's also another issue, when it's battery drained it will shut down \"normaly\" with the turning off message BUT sometimes I will have 20%, 30% or even 50% left and the screen will turn black.... Even worse if I try to turn it back on, sometimes it will work but the battery will somehow be at 1% or sometimes I can't turn it on at all (sometimes I manage to turn it on again after a few try but battery will be at 1% anyway) THEN when I will plug it to charge it will start normally and the battery will magically be back at the same % before the blakc screen... It's really stressful because it happens literally on random, when I open an app, take a picture, unlock my phone \"too fast\", receive a msg... \n\nAnyway, I saw a lot of people complaining of the battery drain since the Android 9 update but haven't found a lot of related issues with the black screen thing, so I'm not sure if my problem is because of the update or just my phone being \"too old\"\nShould I wait for the new Android ? Change the battery ? Or just buy a new phone ?

Is it Google Fi?", "content": "Hello guys! Excuse the long post, but I wanted to be very detailed. AccuBattery and GSAM screenshots here: https://imgur.com/a/a7pJkgI\n\nI had an original Pixel XL for about a year and a half, battery life was great. When the screen was off, generally, AccuBattery would show I was only using about .5%, and my battery stats in the settings menu would show a nearly flat battery usage line. \n\nI upgraded to a Pixel 3 (non-XL), installed the same (and even less) apps, and my battery drain on average is over 2% an hour with screen off, sometimes all the way up to 5%. If I leave my phone off-charge overnight, I'll loose about 12-15% (compared to 5% max with my Pixel XL). Every time I check my battery stats in the settings menu, there's a noticeable down angle to the battery line, there's no nearly flat lines like with my old Pixel XL.\n\nI have tried disabling Digital Wellbeing because I had seen some other people have issues with it, but that did not help. Most of my apps are \"Optimized\" for battery usage, except my messaging / mail apps, just like on my original Pixel XL.\n\nI understand that the battery on my new Pixel 3 is smaller than my original Pixel XL, but I figured that the smaller / lower resolution screen and newer / more efficient chipset would at least make up for that.\n\nThe one difference between my Pixel XL and Pixel 3 is Google Fi. I was on T-Mobile on the Pixel XL, and I went to Google Fi when I upgraded to the Pixel 3. In some of the battery usage screenshots, you can see that \"carrier services\" is usually high on the list for battery usage. I never remember seeing this on my Pixel XL.\n\nThe screenshots were after a full night of the phone being unplugged. The average screen off usage is relatively low at 1.7%, during the day it is usually 2-4%. Also, I just installed an app a couple of days ago called Cut It (super addicting), so just ignore that in the battery usage stats :) I promise by battery was draining just as fast before it was installed.\n\nDoes anyone have any ideas?", "is_img": 0, "category": "Battery and Power, Google Pixel 3", "post_time": "2019-05-26T16:32:43.499642+00:00", "reply": "5 Replies"}

I know some can be .5A input / 3A output bricks, some are 1A input/3A output, etc.  What old chargers are safe to use without buying a new $65 dollar one from the Google Store?", "is_img": 0, "category": "Battery and Power, Google Pixel 3a XL", "post_time": "2019-05-13T18:51:51.995691+00:00", "reply": "2 Recommended Answers"}

Most of the time, I'm successful, but this one has me stumped.\n\nMy wife was walking around with the phone in her pocket, then she went to pull it out and then noticed the screen was all black. Initially confused, she thought maybe it had turned off somehow. She checked the battery about an hour prior and it wasn't even to the half-way point yet, so no reason to think the battery could drain that fast. She tried turning it on, but then I noticed something as she tried this. After precisely 12 seconds after she would touch the power button once, the screen would flash some garbled contents(red and yellow streaks) for about 20 milliseconds(I work on video games, so I guess I have a trained eye for these sorts of things). This told me two things. First of all, the device wasn't \"dead\", it was just in some sort of garbled state which leads me to the second thing; what we were seeing on screen was a bad memory copy which suggests to me that the graphics card/driver is messed up. After fiddling with it some more, and watching people online shut down their pixel 2 device, I decided I would try to shut down the device.\n\nI tapped the power button once, then long pressed it for 5 seconds, then tapped the screen where the power-off should be. Success! The phone vibrated, and I thought that might be the end of it, but when I tried to turn it back on, the same thing happened. There was no google screen, or any screen for that matter, and it was just all black. I tried it again, this time I tried to use the lower volume+power key combo to no avail. I tried all sorts of permutations of it as well. I \"shut down\" the device using the method I spoke about above, then tried powering it back on using the lower button method to hopefully get me in to safe mode. I tried shutting it down using the lower volume+power button combo and that didn't appear to do anything. I'm all out of ideas.\n\nI'd like to get back in to the phone to get any pictures from today(thankfully, the pictures from yesterday were all backed up) but I can't without the screen.

I use the original charger as often as possible and only charge it when I need to. I've tried every solution Google says and other people's solutions.

I'm not sure what's causing all of this. Should I talk to Google about a replacement phone, replacement battery, or go through uBreakiFix? I can spend any amount of money, reasonably.

My 1st generation Pixel phone shuts off above 10% power pretty regularly - including sometimes at 20% or more, but other times goes all the way down to 1-2% (then I charge it, I never intentionally let it run out of battery).  Sometimes it's right as I turn on the camera, sometimes I'm on a website, sometimes I haven't touched it in 10+ minutes and when I go to turn it on it immediately shuts off.  When I plug it in, if I immediately turn it back on it shows the last percentage that it was at (like the 20% it just shut off at, about 10 minutes ago).  It charges fine, but I'm nervous to use it when the battery gets low because I can't trust if I actually have 100% of my power.  Around the same time the battery became untrustworthy, it seemed like the screen brightness became less bright as a whole (I rarely keep it at 100% brightness, even before these issues) and the camera became much, much slower (sometimes 1-2 seconds between pushing the button and it taking the picture).  It makes me think it was an update from a couple of months ago that caused this, but I'm not sure, I have no real indication if it is software (update) or hardware (battery).

I was having to charge the device multiple times just to make it through a day of general use when I used to be able to last on a single charge.

The report came back that basically they couldn't see the battery drain but the device was overheating so that may be causing the issue. I'm unsure which parts where changed and which weren't as they wouldn't tell me this. \n\nI got the phone back yesterday and, as a test, thought I'd run the \"safe mode overnight\" and see what happened. It was charged to 87% at 12:52 am and not touched throught the night. \n\nI woke up this morning at 10:05am so just over 9 hours and was sitting at 60%.

I'm talking ~15% per hour just on standby with the screen off, although I do get a fair few notifications coming through.\n\nI'm no novice to Android, and unfortunately the bugs that seem to come with it. My first instinct therefore was to check with apps were using power - absolutely nothing out of the norm, even system processes like Google Play Services were behaving. So I started to uninstall various apps to see whether anything made a difference. However, over several charges it had literally no impact whatsoever. I should probably also mention; I keep my phone lean at the best of times - I don't have any of the big draining apps like Facebook installed in the first place.\n\nThis is when I turned to a factory reset, I hate doing factory resets because they take far too long, and 2FA makes signing back into all my services nothing short of a nightmare. After this I was sure everything would have solved itself, but alas no. It's still draining away.\n\nI went to bed last night at midnight with 30% in the tank after two charges during the day (haven't had to do that since my Nexus 4), I obviously don't receive notifications during the night, and normally I would only use about 8% of my battery overnight, but I woke up at 7 this morning to find my battery completely drained flat. 0%\n\nWhat's the next step? I really don't want to have to deal with an RMA if I can help it. Is anyone else dealing with a similar issue? Like I say, it's very much come out of nowhere, I haven't recently installed a new app or done a system update. It's just randomly appeared.\n\nAny help would be massively appreciated.\n\nTIA,\nBen", "is_img": 0, "category": "Battery and Power, Google Pixel 3 XL", "post_time": "2019-01-23T09:23:31.300641+00:00", "reply": "4 Replies"}
