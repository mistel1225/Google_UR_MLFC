I've utilized both physical SIM cards and the ESIMs before, all without issues.\n\nHowever, three weeks ago I went to activate my new Pixel, as my previous one that I just activated in April of this year was badly damaged. The damaged device was activated via physical SIM, as Sprint decided to send me one, and that activation took about five minutes total in order to be successful. Yet, I received an error on Sprint's website when attempting to activate my new Pixel. I called in to customer service, and they explained that somehow both my old and new Pixels were active on my line at the same time. Hence, their system messed up during the activation process.\n\nThey claimed they would clear this up, yet the new Pixel is still refusing to activate despite clearly showing compatibility on their BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) query. They are receiving a \"trace error\" in the system, which contradicts their initial successful BYOD check.\n\nWhile speaking with technical support yesterday, they claimed that if my device still isn't working after Monday then I should return it to Google.\n\nI've never had this problem before, but the technician claims they've run into this numerous times before with phones from \"third parties\", including Google. Obviously, there's no reason why a Google phone shouldn't work with Sprint, either via ESIM or a physical SIM card, and I'm honestly wondering why this is even an issue.\n\nIf this latest support ticket doesn't fix the issue via Sprint, then I'm honestly at a loss for what I can do anymore. Nothing is making sense here, and there's certainly no reason for why my Google device should have to be returned.\n\nI'm simply looking for advice and guidance here as to what my next steps should be, and whether any of what I have so far been told makes any sense or sounds accurate.\n\nThanks.", "is_img": 0, "category": "Setting up and Personalizing your Device, Google Pixel 3", "post_time": "2021-06-05T10:43:57.568771+00:00", "reply": "0 Replies"}

{"url": "https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/110807291/control-over-own-phone-google-pixel-vs-samsung-galaxy?hl=en", "title": "Control over own phone: Google Pixel vs. Samsung Galaxy", "content": "I am a Samsung Galaxy user who has gotten increasingly mad at Samsung over years about the phone doing more and more its own thing without me as the owner having any control.\n\n[TINY RANT START] The last drop was when I was getting daily notifications to migrate from Samsung Cloud to One Drive, even though I had nothing in Samsung Cloud, nor I wanted to have to do anything with either of them. The notifications were saying they would end from March 31. Nopes, in April that got an extension to April 30. Disabling those things from pinging me daily was a disabled option in the settings. So that's it, I decided that I needed to move off somewhere where I get more control. [TINY RANT END].\n\nHere, I would like to ask and get answers about a few basics about Google Pixel, as I consider getting the Google Pixel 6 later this year. Please, go sensitive about the below things, as they had been quite some pain points for me in the last few years:\n\nSometime in 2017/18, Samsung Galaxies started randomly requiring pin check to unlock instead of biometrics, for security purposes they say. One would argue that this wasn't random, but that's how it feels to me. Does Google Pixel enforce things like that, or can the user set up to always unlock the phone with biometrics, and only need a pin verification when the biometric check fails enough times? That's a selling point for me.\nSometime in 2019, some parts of Samsung Health didn't want to work anymore without having access to my contact list. That was when I emptied my contact list in order to use all of the Samsung Health. Does Google Fit exercise similar behavior?\nAlso, Galaxy Store started requiring access to my contact list in order to update the apps. That is just bonkers, but luckily I had already wiped my contact list and the phone remained 'functional' in the sense that Samsung apps could get an update. Does Google Pixel exercise any similar behavior of asking for unreasonable things (e.g., my contact list) in order to provide basic functionality, such as updating the apps?\nSometime in 2021, Samsung Health didn't want to work anymore without 2FA. That is how I lost access to my Samsung Health. Does Google Fit do the same? In general, how is enforcing 2FA bad at Google Pixel? A phone that lets me choose 2FA or not is a selling point.\n\nHope this wasn't too painful to read. Thanks in advance for telling me how those points work out on Google Pixel!", "is_img": 0, "category": "Setting up and Personalizing your Device", "post_time": "2021-05-22T15:56:09.69244+00:00", "reply": "1 Reply"}

My problem is that I can't change the typing layout from English US to Bulgarian. I added both layouts on the physical keyboard settings, but when I try to type on text field, can't switch the layout. I tried shortcuts as Control+Space, Shift+Space, Control+Shift, Alt+Shift and so on. I also installed Microsoft swift keyboard, but result is the same. When the virtual keyboard is showing, when I press the shortcut for layout change, it switches only on the screen. But on the physical keyboard it remains english US.

Tried deleting google account from device then entering in Gmail but that just logged me back in then gave me the same error.  Also tried clearing Google play data and storage then restarting as suggested by a forum online which didn't work.  Any help greatly appreciated :)", "is_img": 0, "category": "Setting up and Personalizing your Device, Google Pixel 4a", "post_time": "2021-02-21T04:36:48.823724+00:00", "reply": "1 Reply"}

When there is a whole bunch of apps, each with a load of \"permissions\" (including things like location tracking \"at all times\"), It is not practical to go over permission settings for each of them in the evening and in the morning.\n\nThe idea I had, was to just create a second user on my Android phone and activate the apps I want to use, only while logged in as such a second user. Can this work? Will the apps shut off completely (in the same way as if I power off the phone) when I log out of such a second user account and log back in as a primary user?\n\nAny advice, any other recommendations to achieve the goal?", "is_img": 0, "category": "Setting up and Personalizing your Device, Google Pixel 5", "post_time": "2020-12-06T01:50:11.998703+00:00", "reply": "2 Replies"}

I would like to see the icon on the screen telling me there's new messages, but not have it constantly vibrate.\n\nI've upgraded to Android 11 recently, re-started the phone, uninstalled Whatsapp and reinstalled, cleared the cache, updated settings within the app and on my Notifications settings. I don't want to switch Vibrate off completely as I don't use a ringtone, I rely on vibrate for incoming calls.\n\nWhat seems to be happening is when I change Notification settings from Alert > Silent, they seem to automatically change back to Alert as soon as a new message comes in.\n\nI've noticed this issue only with Whatsapp, all other apps behave accordingly. I read that phone settings override apps so please heeeeelp!\n\nThank you in advance for any tips, I will try them all!", "is_img": 0, "category": "Setting up and Personalizing your Device, Google Pixel 3a", "post_time": "2020-11-10T10:09:49.533931+00:00", "reply": "3 Replies"}

After reaching out to support team and following all their steps (including the final step of doing a factory reset) the problem still remained and the team finally conveyed the phone can be replaced.\nNow I have been given an RMA and I have ordered the replacement phone but I realised I have been charged $1267  (as a hold amount) - which is the price of a brand new Pixel 4 XL - while I would be getting a refurbished phone as a replacement.\n\nI tried several time to call up the support team to explain that I should not be charged the full price of the phone (it should either be a reduced price or I should be given a brand new phone as a replacement) - even though the price is technically a block which would be released. However, in a situation where if a customer is not able to return the phone (due to any reason) then Google would be charging the price of a brand new phone for a refurbished device which is not correct.\n\nMy multiple attempts to call the support team have just resulted in me being on hold for nearly an hour with someone eventually 'promising' that someone will get back and email the response - but till date no one has bothered to reply.\n\nIs there anyway to escalate a grievance related to a Google Pixel?

I long press the middle button and nothing happens. If I take the phone out of my pocket swipe up so my phone is on then I can long press and the assistant appears.   I give up. If anyone knows of a phone and a wired headset that can just send a text while the phone is locked or the screen is off please let me know. I'm done with the pixels.  I ride a bicycle and this is pretty much the only thing I use a phone for.  I don't need to deal with pulling my bicycle off to the side every time someone sends me a text just so I can respond. \n\nMy assistant doesn't work on the lock screen. I am using the forums to walk through a solution but every \"community expert's\" advice is wrong.  The people who reply actually use the correct steps which is very helpful. This is so frustrating it reminds me of when I used to own an iphone and wanted to change one little thing and had to spend hours only to hit a dead end bc they lock everything down which was the reason I switched to android.  The ironic thing is when I used the iphone assistant to text it was amazing and worked 100% of the time with no lag.  Here I am with pixel 3 and a pixel 4a and can no longer use a simple feature like that.  All I want to do is click my middle WIRED headset button so the google assistant appears and I can say \"text so and so\".  \n Have you confirmed that the \"Allow responses while phone is locked\" option is enabled? You can find this at Settings > Apps & notifications > Assistant > See all Assistant settings > Assistant (tab) > Pixel USB-C earbuds > Allow responses while phone is locked.\n I found this in one of the forums but when I go to settings, apps, assistant, see all assistant settings then there is NO assistant (tab) there is a long list of every single option except assistant tab. I just need to find where I can click allow responses while phone is locked for Pixel USB C earbuds because I have followed the other 97 steps just so I can try to send a hands free voice text while my phone is locked. This is ridiculous.  I have already clicked turned on locked screen personal results and I have already turned on allow wired headset request with device locked and the button to call google assistant still doesnt work on lockscreen. It immediately works if I take the phone out of my pocket unlock the phone and then press it but by then what is the use of having a button to call google assistant if I have to go through all of the steps manually on the phone anyway.  \n \nHere is what I see when I follow the instructions above.\nHey google sensitivity\nAssignable reminders\nAssistant voice (I checked this it just lets me pick if I want a British Assistant)\nBasic Info\nCalendar\nContinued Conversation\nExplore\nFace Match\nFamily Bell\nFinances\nFood Preferences\nGeneral\nGetting Around\nHome Control\nLanguages\nMusic\nNews\nNotes and Lists\nNotifications\nPayments\nPersonalization\nPodcasts\nPurchases\nRadio\nReminders\nReservations\nRoutines\nShopping List\nShortcuts\nSnapshot\nVideos and Photos\nVoice and Video Calls\nVoice Match\nWeather\nYour data in the Assistant\nYour People\nYour places", "is_img": 0, "category": "Setting up and Personalizing your Device, Google Pixel 3", "post_time": "2020-10-16T01:33:59.001719+00:00", "reply": "1 Reply"}

Since the day i setup up my pixel 3a it has had soft and hardware issues.  Could be multiple issues but i have identified a few and realise a new one that is causing problems. Google play music since day one seems to notify me it trying to update.  I don't use it and have not for years. Had one song one it.  But seeing as they are phasing it out and starting YouTube music.  Why have they bothered to preinstalled it on my device. Issues got worse when i opted to enjoy a free 6 month trial with apple music offered by my network provider.  Honestly i don't think the apple music app does well on a pixel anyway. But it has affected hardware mainly volume of music and various other software issue. issues. But last night i decided to access Google dashboard to try and wipe permanently the play list it claim i have in play music account that are not.  It offered to transfer them to yt music so i though go for it.  What is did was transfer playlists i had set up in apple music. So clearly a clash between and Google play music and yt music app issues. And now all those playlist are on yt music . With the one song i had in Google account. But yt music app setting are now clashing in the triangle of google play music, apple music and yt music app.   I am finding the yt music web page has amazing play back volume through chrome of all browsers, but absolute shockingly low and the equaliser settings seem to be like a petulant toddler that change themselves or do not change at all in the app. This has had a profound affect on my device and has definitely caused it to  suffer before its time .  So how do i get them to accept this and get a replacement that has not suffered the strain due to Google not thinking this through.   40gb data plan a month and i ain't using more than 12% because i just have given up with my phone.     It really has not helped with all the ways Google back up you data in various ways as you can not getting it clear enough. Device personalisation services just another spanner in the works that pushes the issue even after factory reset.   Feel so let down as i have been an android user since htc first released smart phones . Now Google the creator of android have come so far and messed up spectacularly.  And honestly i really hope i am right about this because if not then not only have they left use with a worse os than year gone by but clearly are producing poor quality hardware.  I am one of thousands having similar issues. This is not a user issue, but a google problem \ud83d\ude25\n\n\nP.s. they also have the nerve to call this a community but yet i can not comment on others questions that are having the similar issues.

I am forced to press home button to get to the home (secondary or tertiary) screen, in which PIP occurs then I an switch to a different app to keep PIP. I frequently forget to go to the home screen as I'm used to quickly switching between apps. Is there some setting that allows for PIP to always automatically happen when I leave the maps app?\n\nWith 3 button I can: Select navigation in Maps, tap recents button and PIP pops up, then swipe to another app (since I can't select a frequently used app in the bottom 5 row that used to exist and was poorly removed), PIP stays throughout.\nWith 2 button I have to: Select navigation in Maps, tap home button and PIP pops up, gesture swipe up to access frequently used apps, then select an app.\nThe extra step is very inconvenient.\n\nThis may all be moot though since Pixel 5 has a decreased chipset and I'm now eying Oneplus and may go back to Nova launcher.", "is_img": 0, "category": "Setting up and Personalizing your Device, Google Pixel 2", "post_time": "2020-10-09T23:38:32.658352+00:00", "reply": "3 Replies"}

This would allow factory reset to the current factory Android 10 image. I was never able to pin down the issue but I suspect it may not occur if I did a complete Hard Reset (delete all data,  start with a pristine image).\n\nI'm now installing the final release an an OTA update. If it fails in similar fashion, can I do a factory reset that clears all data, apps., settings, etc., that will then install the Android 11 image?

Generally I set two alarms, about 15 minutes apart, because sometimes I press snooze or sometimes I just turn off the first one. I've set both of the alarms with sounds that are distinctly alarms, but not jarring. Recently, the first alarm is fine but when the second alarm (or snoozed alarm) goes off, the sound is a super annoying, blaring sound that is not the sound I chose. It wakes me up, but it also ruins my morning because I wake up feeling pissed off! I tried resetting the sounds, reordering the alarms, etc. It still does it. I tested the alarms when the phone wasn't docked on the Stand, and the alarms sounded with the sounds I chose, so now I think it's something the Stand is doing, but I don't see any settings that would cause it to do this. (I did, however, see 3 versions of the Stand settings, some of which were contradictory, so I deleted 2 of them). \n\nI'm using the Google Clock app, and I thought about uninstalling it and trying something else, but a) I'm not convinced that will help and b) most of the other alarm apps out there seem to be designed to be MORE annoying.\n\nAny suggestions?

Before sending it in I performed (what I thought) to be a backup and factory reset my device. I send it in, and get a new device backup today. It is not the same device as I sent in. I go through the normal activation with my old SIM and run into a couple of issues that required me to call Verizon support. Currently the tech thinks my device has not been made available to the Verizon database as acceptable (though it shows it is Verizon enabled). I don't know that this is related. I can't connect to 4G/LTE or wifi yet.\n\nThe problem lies with the backup I thought I created. It is not available in my backup list, only my Chromebook. From what I have gathered the backup should be there. Even if it weren't the most recent I should still see one, right? Does the factory reset affect this? The new device? The lack of actual wifi set up? I had a recovery email set up but I don't think that's where my backup was located. I'm just truly lost. The whole point, to me, of a backup is to keep it there. A Google rep on chat indicated that the backup may expire which is 2 weeks. It's already been one. What else can I do? I set a backup to be able to recover everything and when I delete my device via factory reset it deleted the backup?? That's not the point! \n\nHappy to provide whatever info I can.", "is_img": 0, "category": "Setting up and Personalizing your Device, Google Pixel 2", "post_time": "2020-05-05T02:48:51.20765+00:00", "reply": "1 Recommended Answer"}

On April 7 I did a factory reset of my 4XL. Phone has never been in any betas. I checked the Settings->Advanced->Backups before the reset and it showed that my phone backed up device settings, sms, call logs, and the app settings. \n\nWhen I try to restore, the only backup the 4XL sees is an old Chromebook I have. It does not see the 4XL that I backed up. That said, I have backed up and restored this phone successfully in January.\n\nI had the exact same problem with my 2XL back last fall. That 2XL had been on a beta (I did unenroll the device), but I figured that restore might have been still affected by the beta. I am concerned now as my 4XL which was set up as a fresh new device when I purchased it, is now having the same issue. I am paying for Google One additional support and space.\n\nI contacted Google 1:1 support 2 days ago and all they would do is tell me that if my device was backed up I could restore. At the time the tech told me that I could no longer see Pixel backups in Drive because that functionality was removed. I learned since that this is not true, and I can clearly see the backup in my Google Drive that the 4XL could not see. \n\nI asked for this to be escalated and I am waiting still. I also asked for my case to be escalated last fall and I got no response at that time either.\n\nIs there anything else I can check for these backups? I was smart this time and backed up my texts via 3rd party, but I still had to manually reinstall the 120 apps I have, as well as set up device settings. The Google support tech also suggested that I use a 3rd party backup solution.\n\nAlso, what do folks do when Google support does not get back to you? I have not had much luck getting accurate information or promised followups.

This means I can not install and update Apps now.\n\nI have tried cleaning the cache and data of both Play Store as Play Store Services. Have tried Safe Mode.

{"url": "https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/14920605/google-refurbished-pixel-2-is-always-defective-bootloader-unlock?hl=en", "title": "Google Refurbished Pixel 2 is Always Defective (bootloader unlock)", "content": "There is an obscure feature that few phone makers other than Google include in their phones. According to the internet forums and my personal experience so far, this feature is broken in most of the warranty replacement phones shipped by Google. Nobody but Google can repair it. Because of its obscurity and technical nature, few support personnel are understanding or sympathetic. I think there may be some kind of bureaucratic disconnect that is preventing this issue from being addressed, or Google has decided the number of affected users is too small to be worth the resources needed to fix the flaw in their refurbishment process. The name of the feature is \"unlockable bootloader\".\n\nGoogle has shipped me 2 broken phones so far in their attempt to remedy an unrelated defect in my original Pixel 2. I just finished the phone call to have the second replacement exchanged for a third replacement. Both times the support technician has in the end told me that there's nothing they are allowed to do for me other than fill out an order form for another refurbished phone and leave a comment in the order for the fulfillment team to read. Requesting an unlockable bootloader in the comment didn't work the first time and, based on the forum posts I've seen, I have my doubts that it will ever change anything.\n\nI don't know what else to do, so I intend to keep sending them in for a replacement until I receive one that isn't broken.\n\nFor community reference, I can see on the RMA information that the refurbishment is being handled by an external company, \"Cynergy\". A quick web search shows that this is probably their website: http://www.cynergyus.com/. Anyone else interested in devices with unlockable bootloaders should probably be wary of manufacturers that partner with Cynergy.\n\nTechnical log:\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\nC:\\Program Files (x86)\\Android\\android-sdk\\platform-tools>fastboot flashing get_unlock_ability\n                                                   (bootloader) get_unlock_ability: 1\nOKAY [  0.001s]\nFinished. Total time: 0.003s\n\nC:\\Program Files (x86)\\Android\\android-sdk\\platform-tools>fastboot flashing unlock\n                                                   FAILED (remote: 'Flashing Unlock is not allowed\n')\nfastboot: error: Command failed\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1. Acquire a refurbished Google Pixel 2. (GA00126-US-RA)\n\n2. Power it on without inserting a SIM card and skip everything in the initial setup.\n\n3. Unlock the secret \"Developer options\" by tapping 7 times on \"Build number\" in the \"About phone\" settings page.\n\n4. Enter the \"System\" settings page, enter the \"Developer options\" sub-page, and find the \"OEM unlocking\" setting near the top.\n\n5. Because OEM unlocking is greyed out and says \"Connect to the internet or contact your carrier\", connect the phone to a Wi-Fi. (Set the connection to \"metered\" while adding the Wi-Fi to prevent it from wastefully downloading updates.)\n\n6. After some time, reopen developer options and enable OEM unlocking. (Note: I have found that the setting of this slider and the state of get_unlock_ability persists across factory resets. At this step after doing a factory reset, you will find the slider is already enabled from the last time. The setting being greyed out or not does not affect get_unlock_ability.)\n\n7. Completely shut down the device by holding the power button for a few seconds and selecting \"Power off\".\n\nhttps://source.android.com/setup/build/running#booting-into-fastboot-mode\n\n8. Enter fastboot mode: \"Press and hold Volume Down, then press and hold Power.\" Let go of the power button once the phone vibrates but keep holding the volume button. (If you continue holding the power button you will accidentally trigger the \"Start\" command from the fastboot menu.)\n\n9. Connect the device to a PC with \"Android SDK\" and \"Google USB Driver\" installed.\n\n10. Open Command Prompt on the PC.\n\n11. Run a command to navigate to the SDK platform tools folder: cd /d \"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Android\\android-sdk\\platform-tools\"\n\n12. Run the command to verify that you have enabled OEM unlocking: fastboot flashing get_unlock_ability\n\nCommand response should be: (bootloader) get_unlock_ability: 1\nIf it responds \"get_unlock_ability: 0\" then OEM unlocking was not enabled properly at step 6.\n\n13. Run the command to unlock the bootloader: fastboot flashing unlock\n\nInstead of initiating the bootloader unlock process on the phone screen, command response is: FAILED (remote: 'Flashing Unlock is not allowed')\n\nIf you boot back to the normal system at this point, you will find the \"OEM unlocking\" slider is greyed out again no matter what the internet state is. get_unlock_ability is still 1. It can only be un-greyed by doing a factory reset and starting over from step 1, but you will find at step 6 that it is already enabled. Disabling, rebooting, and enabling again does not help.\n\n\nFurther reading:\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRMA phone from Google is not unlocking the bootloader\nhttps://forum.xda-developers.com/pixel-2/help/rma-phone-google-unlocking-bootloader-t3937931\n\nOEM Unlocking Grayed out on non-VZW Pixel 2.\nhttps://forum.xda-developers.com/pixel-2/help/oem-unlocking-grayed-vzw-pixel-2-t3776763\n\nPSA: RMA refurbished Pixel 2's can NOT be bootloader unlocked.\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/9xcdle/psa_rma_refurbished_pixel_2s_can_not_be/\n\nCannot unlock Pixel 2 bootloader\nhttps://issuetracker.google.com/issues/73217322\n\nWeb Search: \"get_unlock_ability: 1\" \"Flashing Unlock is not allowed\"\nhttps://www.google.com/search?q=\"get_unlock_ability%3A+1\"+\"Flashing+Unlock+is+not+allowed\"\n\n(Unrelated bug: This message board does not support links ending in a quote mark, even if you manually set the link target in the editor.)", "is_img": 0, "category": "Setting up and Personalizing your Device, Google Pixel 2", "post_time": "2019-09-21T06:31:52.837124+00:00", "reply": "19 Replies"}

(e.x. block all sounds except Spotify)", "content": "General problem: \nI want to block all notification sounds from ALL APPS EXCEPT for the \"business-related\" ones. Do not Disturb does not allow me to do this. I have to choose between all  sounds or no sounds.  \nWhat I'd like is a white-list.  Is there an app to do this (or an Android way to do it)?\n\nIt used to work on Android 8.1 and earlier: \nAndroid 8.1 and earlier had a feature that went along with \"Do not Disturb\" called \"priority only allows\" and it is described in the \"Do not disturb\" help pages.  This allowed you to allow apps through the do not disturb sound barrier. However I am on a newer version of Android and I can no longer use this feature. \nThis was a whitelisting feature I would like on the latest version of Android. \n\nit's been a few years and I am fed up with having to choose between being distracted all day and missing important messages and phone calls. \n\nSpecific problems: \n1. Do not disturb blocks my Google Play music songs.. I can choose to \"allow media sounds\" but I have to choose between allowing ALL sounds and NO sounds at all. \nI would like my music to play but I would not like web-pages with popup videos I am viewing to blare out at max volume in a quiet office. \nDo not Disturb in its modern form blocks either \"all messaging app notifications\" or \"no messaging app notifications.\" \nWhat if I want to receive notifications for the (text) \"messages\" app but not facebook messenger and whatsapp?\n(Messages is for business, whatsapp is for family and friends). \nI am aware that you can manage sounds for notifications in the App settings, but I have 141 apps on my phone (and am deleting a bunch now so that I don't have to manage their sounds). I cannot go through each one and disable notification sounds one by one and modify them, especially because each app has a different notification options menu. \nCan the default for all new apps be changed to \"no notification sounds!!??\" - How? \n Is there any way to manage a whitelist instead of a blacklist?", "is_img": 0, "category": "Setting up and Personalizing your Device, Google Pixel 3", "post_time": "2020-01-21T16:20:43.256151+00:00", "reply": "2 Replies"}

However, if someone wants more security, then the Smart Lock features can be disabled by using the Lockdown option from the power menu.\n\nThe Lockdown feature also applies to the fingerprint reader. But I don't want to be conscious all the time of when to disable the fingerprint reader with the Lockdown option everywhere and all the time. This can be done much smarter by combining it with the Smart Lock features.\n\nFor example, I think it would be great to combine trusted places with the fingerprint reader. Thus creating e.g. the policy that a pincode is always needed to unlock the device, except for when at home or other trusted places. Such as at home, at work or at university you can then conveniently use the fingerprint reader. But not when on the go. It would also be great (for some users I suppose) to even enforce the pincode + fingerprint (or any other combination possible on a device) for extra two factor authentication at e.g. a sensitive workplace or country.\n\nThis would greatly improve Android's security smarts.

You have said that you do not want to lose data, so that is not a solution for you.\n Anyway, even if you did decide you need to Factory Reset without knowing the pattern, you would need to know the password of your Google Account in order to get back into the device (for theft security purposes).", "is_img": 0, "category": "Setting up and Personalizing your Device, Google Pixel 3a XL", "post_time": "2019-09-12T01:46:14.87746+00:00", "reply": "1 Reply"}

I need to manually select these options instead of having them auto selected.\n\nHello all!\n\nIn using my pixel 3a, I have noticed that it will automatically select options in dialog boxes for me. For example, when an app will ask for access or permissions, the phone will select an option without me touching the screen. This happens with almost every pop-up box of that nature. (\"use this app just once or always\" is not affected by this). Also, if the app requests multiple permissions, only the first will be auto-selected.\n\nI've been fine to live with the issue until now, but last night I needed to connect my phone to my laptop with bluetooth, but the phone was autoselecting the \"cancel\" option, and I couldn't tap \"connect\" fast enough. (the permission screen will display for a fraction of a second before an option is selected, so I know it appears but I cannot do anything about it). I assumed it was a setting I enabled when I set up the phone, so I reset all my app settings/permissions, but this has done nothing to help the problem.\n\nI'm generally a pretty tech-savvy person, but this has me clueless.

The only way I've found to silence notifications is with Do Not Disturb mode.\nI've looked pretty exhaustively through the settings menu's and think this might be a glitch as when I have the phone on vibrate mode and attempt to change the default notification sound the notification sound won't play (clearly attempting to respect volume settings) but when a notification comes through normally it plays at full volume. This leads me to think there is some decoupling of the actual call to play a notification from the sound settings at any given time.\nI've searched around and can't find any threads with a similar issue so I'm not sure if this is a glitch or whether this is just some specific settings I've toggled accidentally.\nAny help would be much appreciated.", "is_img": 0, "category": "Setting up and Personalizing your Device, Google Pixel 3", "post_time": "2019-05-28T23:29:30.401212+00:00", "reply": "1 Recommended Answer"}

I don't want her account to be the admin on the phone, I want it to be mine so that I can apply parental controls without the possibility of her disabling it. I have setup the phone as follows:\n\n1. Logged onto the device using my google account. I then add her google account as well (because we're using google fi and can only have one line per google account, so I need her account on my admin user so the line works).\n2. I go to Settings -> System -> Advanced -> Multiple Users and create a new user for my daughter, turning on phone calls & SMS as well.\n3. I setup her user by signing into her google account. She has her own PIN, different from the admin account.\n\nSwitching between users, phone calls and text messages all work fine. The problem is when the phone is restarted. The phone demands I enter the \"admin\" user account PIN before I can do anything else. I try swiping down on the top menu, selecting the \"person\" icon, and I can see her user account as an option, but it's grayed out and tapping it does nothing. The only thing I can do is select the admin user and enter that PIN. After this is done, I can then switch to her user without issue.\n\nNeedless to say, my concern is if she's out and happens to restart the phone (runs out of battery, perhaps a software glitch crashes the device, whatever), that I would have to provide her the admin pin in order for her to use the phone again. This defeats the purpose of creating an account for her to begin with.\n\nIs there any way to allow her to sign onto the device post-restart without having the admin enter a PIN first?", "is_img": 0, "category": "Setting up and Personalizing your Device, Google Pixel 2", "post_time": "2019-04-11T15:20:13.608192+00:00", "reply": "1 Recommended Answer"}

I hope that we'll keep our navigation buttons; I personally hate how iphones users have to navigate through their phones with swipes which is one of the reasons why I'll never switch.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/as38pz/i_love_the_back_button/\n\nIf anyone from Google reads these posts: Please, for the love of all that is holy, leave the back button alone!\nI just read an article that the back button might disappear from the next Android release. Personally, I don't like gesture navigation, and I'll be incredibly angry (and avoid updating) if the back button is removed. I'm a huge fan of giving people the option to choose between gesture and normal navigation, but I hope Google doesn't try to force everyone to use gestures. Sadly, it seems a lot of the more recent Android changes have been all about removing the ability to choose and customize...\nWhy would I ever want to have to make a sweeping gesture to do something when I can make a simple tap? The back button is a beautiful thing, and I absolutely hate using phones without it (most of my family are a bunch of quitters and have iPhones).
