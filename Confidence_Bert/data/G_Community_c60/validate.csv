My Google Pixel 2 died and won't turn on,"My phone died earlier today when it was at two percent, so nothing out of the ordinary. I was using Instagram when it died if that would offer any help. I also got caught in the rain beforehand, so my phone was slightly wet, but not wet enough to damage anything, especially since it is marketed as waterproof. I plugged it in for about 5 minutes and went to turn it on but the battery sign kept flashing and turning into what seemed to be the loading bar after updating, but then flashed back to the battery sign. I eventually got it to turn on once, but it just turned back off/died again. This didn't stop til I held down the power button, but continued when I plugged it back in. Then I left it plugged in for over an hour, but this same thing happened when I held down the power button. However, this time it was accompanied by a red flashing light in the upper right corner. I don't know what's going on, so please help if you have any advice. It would be greatly appreciated.",Battery and Power

Pixel 3XL Overnight Probems,"(Sorry long post) My Pixel 3xl magically stopped charging the other night. I woke up to my phone being at 12%. I thought it was a fluke with my cord because it is the original charger that came with the phone so it is a tad bit worn. However, I plugged in another USB-C charger and still nothing. I was able to charge intermittently with my car charger, but that stopped working and now I am reduced to a wireless charger which literally takes the entire night to get to 100%. 
Also, my battery is draining quickly. I lost 12% in less than 30 minutes with immediately turning on the phone it goes to 99%. The brightness is on adaptive or I adjust to at most 50% (I don't like bright screens so if it goes to high I turn it down). 
I have started in Safe Mode and the battery was slipping but a little slower. 
Diagnosis says all apps are fine and nothing is draining my batter. When I restarted no apps were running other than Chrome and Google Messages. I don't download new apps often and the last one I downloaded was Zelle and have since removed it. 
Then add to that, Google Messages won't download pictures. I am updated to the last system update.
I really liked this phone and wasn't having any issues until the previous update and started seeing the battery drainage which after a couple of resets seem to be a bit better, but now its back.

Pixel 4 XL WiFi Disconnects after Android 11 Upgrade,"After upgrading my P4 XL to Android 11, I've started noticing WiFi disconnects on the regular.

DTMF Tones Not Accepted By All Services,"I have a Pixel 2 and most dialer systems accept the tones from my phone just time.

2) seit dem Update habe ich Probleme mit Headsets jeglicher Art. Die Verbindung geht verloren und sporadisch verloren. @Google entfernen liegt euer Problem mit den Pixel Buds nicht an den Pixel Buds, statt an den letzten Patches?

Weird charge/discharge issues over last 72 hours (P3XL),"I noticed it about three days ago when I was streaming audio to a bluetooth speaker: after about an hour, the battery went from 70% down to 50%.  After eight hours of it sitting on the nightstand, the battery went from 40% to 19%.  Plugged it into the OEM charger and it went from 19% to 80% in about six minutes.  Finding that highly odd, I rebooted the phone and removed it from the charger.  

A day of minimal use dropped to about 50%.  Now here's where the concerning part started.  Hopped in the car, started a bluetooth audio to the car, and brought up google maps.  The battery went from 49% to dead within five minutes.  I saw the ""your phone will run out of battery soon"" pop up on the screen and tick from 7% to 6% to dead within 30 seconds.  Plugged it into the OEM charger with the phone off and watched it go from 0% to 83% within five minutes.

Same scenario for this past evening: went to bed with about an 80% charge, woke up to 41% charge.  Scrolled over to the google feed to check news and watched it drop almost instantaneously to 17%.  Saw an article about Stadia, clicked into it, and got the battery warning pop up, watched it drop from 11% to zero in a matter of seconds.

I've reset the phone multiple times.  High battery drain is happening no matter what condition: wifi on/off, bluetooth on/off, location services, airplane mode, etc.

On the latest software version, no new apps installed, only app updates since I started noticing the issue.  Factory reset the phone and it has to remain on the charger cause pulling updates (apps) drains the battery just sitting there.

I have been using Accubattery Pro to ""condition"" the battery (keeping it between 20% and 80%) for about a month now, which is when I started noticing some battery issues.  I was really hoping this thing would last till the P5 came out, but now I'm stuck using my old Droid Turbo...man how technology has changed.

Google Pixel (all models) Have Very Bad Car Bluetooth Interactivity.,"So for quite some time now I've noticed that every car I've driven has never offered me the full range of music playing options on the infotainment screens in the cars. At first, I thought that maybe it was just the cars I was driving at the time not being too great with Bluetooth on Android devices (iPhones seemed to always have this feature in my cars and it made me jealous of my friends a little from time to time). 

However, 3-4 cars down the line I find myself still stuck with this problem of only having the options of ""Next Song"", ""Previous Song"", ""Pause / Play"", and that's it. I thought the problem would then be that I was using Spotify instead of the phone's built-in music players; so I have switched from Spotify to Google Play Music as I currently use a Pixel 2 XL. This also hasn't fixed the issue though as I am still only given the same options. 

But when two of my friends got in my car I let them connect their phones to cars to play music and oddly enough, they had a lot more features than I ever have with any of my Google phones. Both of my friends were able to shuffle, repeat, browse playlist and queue, and also select other playlists entirely. Those friends have a Samsung and an iPhone, meaning both Android and Apple devices are capable of the technology. It just seems that while I am very impressed with my Google phone so far, they are also very basic in terms of quality of life aspects. 

I'm here to ask if anyone knows any workarounds or ways to improve the features that a Pixel gives off as a media player when connected through Bluetooth? 

Cheers.","Connectivity, Network, Bluetooth"

Getting 5G working internationally,"So, I know there's a compatibility list of a dozen or so territories that have official support for 5G.

My question is if there is any way to connect to 5G in the rest of the world without root. I've been told that it's relatively simple with root to connect to 5G networks where I currently live in Hong Kong, but I would prefer it if it was just an option in settings. 

Other phones from other manufacturers have far wider 5G support, and it's disheartening that Google might never choose to give us the option to try to connect to a network outside of their select list.

Fortunately the phone still has LTE support internationally. Imagine if that had been blocked too 😂

Pixel 3a diverts to voicemail. Seems invisibly stuck on Do not Disturb.,"I would really appreciate some help:

am a foster carer and must not miss calls.
I have worked for a few weeks to sort this out.

I have changed SIM (on the old phone).  Google then kindly switched the phone.
Problem repeated itself.

Do not Disturb is not (officially) on.

I have tested the phone by phoning from a selection of other phones. None of the numbers are set to Divert to Voicemail. First call from each number goes to voicemail (If they leave message I get a notification). If they do not leave a message I have no idea they have called.

I have gone into phone app, clicked 3 dots, gone to calls and calling accounts and ensure ""receiving incoming calls"" is on.

I wonder if an error was backing up to the replacement phone  (thus potentially introducing the error back to this new/refurbished phone?).

I only have three Blocked numbers on the phone. none are the ones I was calling from (to test it).

My call forwarding options are showing as follows:
always forward: off
fwd to voicemail when.....busy, unanswered, unreachable. 

This morning I did a reset of network & app settings . There was no visible benefit to doing this. 

My wife uses the same network as me (albeit on an apple phoen0 and has no reception issues).

The original Pixel3a worked perfectly for about 9 months before suddenly ""getting invisibly stuck on Do not Disturb""). This replacement only arrived a couple of days ago but has same problem. 

One suggestion I have read on another forum (another user had similar problem) is that maybe a third party app is causing the problem. But where would I start tracking this down?

My next action was going to be to launch in Safe mode to see if that allows phone to ring. (is this a logical test?)

"VoWiFi, 5G and overall support for markets that actually care for Pixel 5.","Hi. I had to sell my Pixel 5 due to not working VoWiFi in Poland. 

I know - altough i don't understand why - Pixels are too ""exclusive"" to reach certain markets. In central and eastern Europe there are lots of customers who would really love to have a top camera clean android phone for a price lower than Apple or Samsung has. In my opinion Pixels would sell better in developing countries rather than in countries dominated by Apple or Samsung. I think that Google's policy when it comes to phones is not prioritized to sell phones and make profit.

Anyway, is there a chance that modern or future Pixels will get a support for 5G / VoWiFi / VoLTE for network operators outside Germany, France and UK? I can import the Pixel from Germany on my own, but it's useless for me as long as it doesnt at least have working Wi-Fi calling and I can't make it work on my own.

"Blurry photos using ""Far"" Focus mode in Night Sight","In Night Signt, with focus set on ""Far"", pictures will be consistently blurry: instead of being correctly focused on far items, the camera will be correctly focused for objects at a 1 meter distance approximately.

This brings the main problem: when in astrophotography mode, it is very hard to correctly focus on the sky using autofocus, intuitively I would lock the focus to ""far"": this however makes all photos consistently blurry as the focus is not being correctly applied, by the app, to infinity.

Taken with Night Sight + focus set to ""far""

Disable 'Enable Voice Match' prompt permanently,"I want to disable the pop-up screen which asks me to enable voice match. I have two Google Home devices and I got sick and tired of my device unlocking every time I wanted to turn on my lights. My solution? Turn off Voice Match and turn off 'Okay Google' on my Pixel.

To my demise, no matter where I'm at on my phone, the words ""Hey Google"" will bring up the enable voice match prompt. Why doesn't this remember my selection? Does Google think I am stupid for saying no? This is completely ridiculous why I can't say no to a feature I absolutely do not want. 

Even when I've completely disabled Google Assistant on my phone it still listens to those keywords. I know that the experts will say it should only be listening in the Google App or on the home screen but this is NOT the case. It is listening all the time and it's driving me crazy that my phone has this annoying pop-up every time I say the words (to control home devices).

I still use voice search as an accessibility feature so disabling the voice permission is absolutely not a valid solution.

Speakerphone issue when using bluetooth watch,"I have a Pixel 5 now, but this issue also occurred with my previous Pixel 3, and possibly the Pixel 1, though I never investigated it more thoroughly.

When my phone is bluetooth paired with my Samsung Gear S3 watch, and I make or receive a Duo video call, the bottom speaker won't activate despite the icon being appropriately highlighted on the screen.  The call's sound comes out through the upper speaker at a normal phone call level, obviously not loud enough for talking over video chat.

The problem is remedied by turning off bluetooth, even mid chat. Once bluetooth is off, the bottom speaker immediately turns on, usually with the volume set very low and needing to be turned up.

I suspect there is an internal issue with identifying what speaker should be playing, because in regular phone calls the UI allows for a three-way selection of sound source: 1) Phone 2) Speakerphone 3) Bluetooth (watch); however in video calls there is only an off/on button for the speakerphone.

I searched forums for anyone else experiencing this issue but did not identify it. Though I suspect this may just be because of the difficulty of describing the issue in a succinct enough manner to find the appropriate search keywords.

It is mostly just an annoyance as I can fix it as needed, but any solution would be appreciated, thanks.","Contacts, Calls, Voicemail"

"Bluetooth repeatedly disconnecting from Fossil smartwatch, won't reconnect without reboot","Hi,
I recently bought a new smartwatch, a Fossil Hybrid Collider. I'm having problems with it repeatedly disconnecting. At least once a day, I notice that the widgets are not updating and notifications aren't being received. When I open the Fossil app, the phone is disconnected. When I try to connect, I get a failure message. Under Bluetooth settings, I can see the watch, but can't connect to it there either.

Then the really strange behavior begins: I can toggle Bluetooth off system-wide, but then I'm unable to turn it back on. It simply doesn't respond at all.

The only way to reactivate Bluetooth and reconnect the watch is by rebooting my phone.

Following recommendations online, I've disabled battery optimization for the Fossil app and Bluetooth, but the problem persists. I found a Reddit thread indicating that this is an issue with the Pixel's Android 10 update, specifically the Bluetooth LE stack, and allegedly the developers told users that they have no plans to address the problem. Anybody know of a workaround? Am I going to have to buy a non-Pixel phone to use LE devices?","Connectivity, Network, Bluetooth"

Could use some help with this.  I have done a lot of troubleshooting and will try to describe everything.

The camera roll is not showing any pictures.  I take a picture, see it hit the camera roll to the right, then click the roll and the picture will load.  I see a progress circle in the bottom left then the camera app closes and photos opens, the new picture is not there.  I reopen the camera and the camera roll is grey with no pictures.  If I touch to open nothing happens.  I have Astro file manager installed and can see the picture saved to the DCIM/Camera folder fine, in JPG format.  

Videos work fine with MP4 format, videos actually show fine in the camera roll

I have tried the RAW thing, this gets the pictures to show up in photos but not the camera roll, but creates 3 pictures for every one taken and is not practical for space.  

I have cleared the cache in both Photos and Camera, I have booted in Safe mode, same issue.

I have factory reset my phone.  After this and before restoring from a backup I tested one picture.  I was able to see the picture in the camera roll and clicked it to open and it showed fine.  I did not test photos as it needed to be set up yet.  

I restored from a backup before the reset, the issue returned

The camera folder is not showing up as selected in the backup folders but I don't think this matters because the camera folder is the default and is backed up by default.  

Permissions are showing fully allowed for each app.  However, if I go to Permission Manager/Additional Permissions I see access Google Photos and 0 of 0 apps allowed.  I am unable to select any apps to allow this.

Yesterday I had a Mophie mobile charger with me to try and make it through the day. The Mophie is rated at 14 hours. The Pixel 3 XL drained the Mophie dead in 3 hours. 

Moderators... please don't give me a list of common things to check. This is clearly a problem with Android 10 and Pixel devices. As people accept the upgrade more and more reports flow in.

Charging issue on the Pixel 2 xl,My Pixel 2 xl is giving me charging issues since 2 days.The phone tends to reboot after plugging into the charger(the original one). Plugging in the charger and restarting it manually doesn't help either. The phone shows me the charging battery icon (without any animation) and reboots again and the thing goes on till my phone battery completely drains. I have tried all troubleshooting options. The charger in itslef is fine as it charges the other phones. When plugged into a generic usb type-c charger the phone tends to reboot and charge but at a very slow rate (10-60% in 3 hours). Factory resetting the phone or draining the battery all the way and then trying to charge hasn't helped either. What should i do now?,Battery and Power
Pixel 4 XL Issues with Texting when Connected to WiFi,"Like many others, I enjoyed RCS on the the Pixel 3 XL. However, until it's implemented on the 4XL, we are stuck with SMS. I do use the stock Google Messages app.  My 4XL has never been able to send SMS text when connected to WiFi. Anytime a text is sent and WiFi is connected, it will try to send and then just state the error that the message has not been sent. You can try to send it again, but it will not send. As soon as WiFi is turned off, the message will send.

Pixel 3 front facing camera blurry + static noise,"Essentially every time I start the Pixel 3 front camera, either from the camera app itself or using ANY 3rd party app, the camera starts up blurry and with a loud static noise.

"Pixel 2 Camera App Crashing/Flashlight greyed out, other dependent apps not loading","Just recently I noticed my camera app would crash, reboot the phone and sometimes it'd work but now it will consistently crash upon opening.

I'd like to thank Google for making Call Screen available to Canadian customers. Some minor issues,"Is the feature available on the Pixel 4?  Nice job on Visual Voicemail also.  It should respond with the party you are trying to reach and not the word THEY when I press the ""I'll call you back later"" button.  It also seems to be missing the canned response 'take me off your calling list' and 'is this urgent?'. Is it possible for users to respond with a dynamic custom response?  That would be a nice future enhancement.  Can call screen automatically take the call if inbound caller identification is absent and ask the calling party to identify themselves verbally?  This could apply in the absence of calling name delivery if the calling party's nyx-nnx-xxxx (now npa-nxx-xxxx) is not in the contact list of the recipient or the name was not transmitted by the telco, or was not retrievable through a tcap dip.  I have received spoofed calls using illegal numbers and this can be baked into the logic ... for example ... no area code can have a 9 as a middle digit; no area code can start with a 1 or 0; if an area code has a 1 in the middle digit (n1x) the third digit (x) cannot be a 1; no central office code (the 4th 5th and 6th digit) can be 1xx or x11 or 0xx.  And you will not see telephone numbers such as 416-416-xxxx (were the area code and central office code are identical), or in NYC for example you would never see 212-718-xxxx because 212 is the area code for Manhattan and 718 is the area code for Brooklyn.  n=2-9 x=0-9.  Hope this info helps.  I don't know if ANI delivery still exists but it can be a way of determining if the call is spoofed, but the logic there is kind of fuzzy.  Automatic Nmber Identification and Caller Identification are two different things. ANI is the billing caller ID ... for example a company's ANI and main switchboard number could be (416) UNiversity 2 - 2000 (416-862-2000) but for direct inward dial the PBX would be programmed to transmit 416-862-2134 so that dialable directory number delivery and reverse translation would work.  Note that the first six digits in most cases will be identical.  The cellular industry, and regulatory authorities CRTC and FCC have certainly done a fine job messing up everything that was previously sophisticated ... from a telecommunications standpoint.  There's no way for Google to send a call to the bit bucket unless its servers act as a proxy.  It would also be interesting if the Google phone app could be enhanced to recognize alphabetic mnemonics as they previously existed eons ago.

Poor and degrading battery life on original Google Pixel.,"First off, the battery used to be great. But over the past few months, the battery has degraded rather quickly and now won't last more than a few hours. The battery will last for about 2 hours of screen time, and around 4 if it is asleep. 

I have tried clearing app caches, uninstalling unused apps, and restarting my phone. All of these have not worked. My pixel is on the latest Android version, and there are no new updates available at this time. 

When my pixel was new, it had much longer battery life, at least 6-8 hours. I've been using an external battery lately so I can continue to use my phone throughout the day, and I end up charging my pixel 4-5 times per day, not including me charging it at night.

*HEALTH HAZARD* Google Pixel 3a Bluetooth headset volume increases to maximum upon screen unlock.,"Since I first began using my Google Pixel 3a, upon turning on my headphones, the volume switches to maximum and nearly blows out my eardrums if I'm not prepared to turn down the volume before I play music. This happens about half the time. When I'm playing music at a low volume through my Bluetooth headset and I unlock my device, the volume again switches to maximum and nearly blows out my eardrums. This happens most of the time when I unlock my device with my headset on.

This is not influenced by other apps open on the device, as it still occurs when all other apps are closed. It still occurs when the device is started in safe mode. From what others have said, it still occurs with other Bluetooth headsets and others/myself have demonstrated that this does not occur using the same headset on other devices. This is absolutely an issue with the Google Pixel 3a and probably the 3 and 3XL as well.

A temporary fix would be nice (for my safety and the safety of others), but there really should be a permanent update to address this issue. Google has been made aware of this issue in the past and I'm really concerned about Google's neglect to take action on this.

Camera shaky and trying to auto focus,"Hello

Hope someone can help here. 

My Wife & I both have the Pixel 3 phone and are both experiencing issues with the back camera.

Her phone whilst recording goes all shaky as if she was in an Earthquake even with the steady function switched on.  It's also trying to continuously auto focus all the time and looks terrible on playback.

With my phone it cannot take still pictures properly.  Video recording is ok and taking pictures whilst in video mode is ok but going into camera mode and taking still pictures is a nightmare. My screen goes all fuzzy as if you were trying to record a video via a television or VDU screen, you get those fuzzy lines that go across. 

I've done safe mode and factory resets on both phones and still no joy

Battery drained in minutes. Not Charging.,"I had experienced a weird behavior with my Pixel2 phone. When am using the Pixel2 phone, within 2-5 minutes, the battery started draining from 20% to 0% instantly. To my surprise, I could see the drainage very fast within minutes. 
I tried to charge, ofcourse with original charger, but the device is not charging. 
As mentioned in these forums, I tried to charge the device for an hour and pressed Power button & volume down button to restart. But it didn't switched On at all.

I had charged for 4 hours and tried the above approach. It vibrated once and the red light was constant. It blinked for 3 times and it was constant most of the times. After 4 hours of charging, I don't see the red light at all. 

Later I tried to change the charger to see if the issue is with charger and charged for 5 hours. The issue is still the same.

One thing happened good to me is that the device is still under warranty, bought in Dec-2017 and Google gave 2 years of Warranty. When discussed with tech support, they raised a pick up request, and it's 3 days there is no update on the device. The device is still with courier and is in transit. Hoping the best that Google would repair or replace the device so that I can continue to use the device for some more month.

Has anyone here experienced these issues? Would you recommend the Pixel 3 to someone who has such strict performance requirements for the camera app?

Can call blocking be improved?,"I've got both 'Caller id and Spam,' and 'Filter Spam calls' boxes checked in my phone setting and they appear to work. But they only appear to work on numbers that are ""known"" as incoming spam numbers. Makes sense. But seeing as how spammers change their numbers all day every day, I keep getting about 5-7 calls per day that are not known by Google's filters as spam. Meaning, I have to check my phone, and block these numbers every single day. Get's pretty old, pretty fast. And there's no end to how many phone numbers the ""social security scam"" business possesses, in case you haven't noticed. lol. My question is, why isn't there a simple feature within this wonderful built in spam filter to only accept calls from my contact list? Meaning, ""block ALL BUT my contacts."" This way, if it's someone I don't know, they can simply leave a message and I'll click ""add to contacts"" and all is well. It'd keep me from having to listen to my phone ring several times a day with numbers I already know are spam. And yes, I know I can use a call blocking app to do this, and I did just that with my Samsung Galaxy phone, but in my experience, using a third party call blocking app that lays over your phone just slows everything down and often interferes with other apps, I found. The spam features are a big reason for me switching to Pixel 3XL. And I don't mind being a part of the community that ""fights spam"" but I'd rather not have to report every single call that comes in on my phone.

Front-facing camera: blurry and terrible static noise,"Very often, when my front-facing camera on my Pixel 3 is activated, the camera both: goes terribly blurry (like static on a TV) and there is a horrible static noise that is very audible and very annoying. Essentially the front-facing camera is completely unusable while this is occurring.

Eventually, if I hit the flip camera icon enough times, it stops. But it will trigger again randomly.

This has been written about in numerous other places with no clear solution. It is something that seems to be a software issue, not a hardware issue.

It happened randomly ~4 months ago. I wasn't using the front-facing camera much then (pre-coronavirus), so I didn't make a big deal of it.

I've tried other solutions written about on other threads and Reddit, including clearing my camera's cache (in storage), deleting my phone's voice match for Google Assistant (which I now have off), removed Google Home entirely, etc.

Any other troubleshooting tips for this? Help would be infinitely appreciated; this issue is horribly annoying and is a daily problem now.

I won't be clearing my entire storage (too annoying). But one thing that's interesting is that I did boot my phone in safe mode and this still happened.

So I'm wondering if it's some sort of Android / Pixel software setting I can roll back - rather than an app causing a problem.

I am not interested in sending my phone in for a refurbished model.

And naturally, during this pandemic, Google's 1:1 support is unavailable and their response time is...well, not helpful.

I did a factory reset using some guidance from google support and when that did not work they told me they could not help me as the phone just passed 2 years from purchase. I am pretty disappointed considering Apple fixed my iPhone 6 when it had a hardware issue 4 years after its purchase. I will be switching back to Apple as Google support was no help for a phone that was very expensive, not abused, and barely over 2 years of use.",Battery and Power

Wifi and bluetooth not working anymore on Pixel A4 - get turned off automatically,"Hello,
The wifi is not working anymore on my month-old Google Pixel 4A.
Turning wifi is impossible: when I try, it crashes the user interface and the wifi is still turned off.
The same applies for bluetooth, whereas 4G mobile data is still working fine.
I'm really confused. I tried starting the phone in safe mode: no  change. Turning airplane mode on and off has no effect either. Resetting all network settings didnt fix the issue.
It's not related to my home wifi network as other devices are working fine.
I'm clueless and frustrated at this point, especially because it's a brand new phone.
Did anyone else experience the same issue?  Suggestions are highly welcome :)

Please unlock the future with an update. It's up to Google!

Without VOLTE call drops to 3G, you cannot use the internet also you don't have HD call. The carriers will soon stop using 3G so then we will have serious problems.

"Pixel 2 XL Android 10 networking continues to malfunction. Bluetooth, LTE, Wifi all are unreliable","Since the Android 10 update, my Pixel 2XL has had continuous problems with ALL its network connections staying reliable, persistent, connected, and actually working.  Symptoms are consistently inconsistent, and its become super annoying.  US based on Verizon.

First on basic phone calls, the relationship between 4G/LTE and Wifi calling is pretty broken.  If making a phone call, when there's what appears to be a somewhat weak 4G signal, but a strong Wifi signal, calls will not go through.  The calling process either hangs or times out.  It can take several retries to get connected.  Android's phone subsystem cannot differentiate between bad 4G and good Wifi.  It gets confused.

Next, if indeed a call connects, the handoff from 4G to Wifi causes a 3-10 second blackout, where either side cannot hear each other, causing people to hang up on the far end.  It can take several tries to just get the call connected and both parties speaking.

Similarly, when trying to use basic broadband data services (ie, downloading a file or podcast as an example), the phone gets confused as well.  If both 4G and Wifi are strong, downloads of say a podcast, may take 10-15 minutes.  If I shut off either 4G OR Wifi, the download happens in seconds.  Again, Android 10 cannot handle 4G/Wifi selection correctly.  It simply gets confused and stalls everything.  

Now, on to Bluetooth, which also misbehaves consistently when either 4G or Wifi state changes.  Bluetooth as an example, will disconnect when the LTE modem throttles between 4G and 3G, or when an cellular signal cuts out completely in a rural area.  The same is true for Bluetooth audio.  Bluetooth audio (like a podcast or music) will simply STOP playing, when the LTE modem is modulating between 4G, 3G or no signal.   When driving in a rural area as an example, and cellular signal is choppy, Bluetooth consistently disconnects, stalls, or simply hangs.

While I like the phone in general, it was a much more reliable networked experience under previous Android versions.  I imagine its a set of poorly tested code blocks that control the Snapdragon 835's networking stack, and that handoff routines are clearly broken.   No idea if its drivers or something else, but basically networked reliability is terrible.  

Its clearly an Android code problem.  The Snapdragon 835 uses a combined MAC for all networking layers AFAIK (definitely LTE and Wifi do).","Connectivity, Network, Bluetooth"

Ridiculous battery drain on Pixel XL after updating to Android 10,"Every since updating to Android 10 on my Pixel XL (the OG Pixel) I've experienced a ridiculous amount of battery drain.

I've done all the usual troubleshooting (factory reset, safe mode, setting all apps to auto update, etc.) but nothing has worked.

Weird connection problems Pixel 3aXL,"I am having very difficult to diagnose connection problems with pixel 3aXL running Android 10. Basically, the connection seems to stop working very regularly even if my toolbar icons show me connected at full strength to an LTE network or a known, working WiFi network. Doesn't seem to matter if one of those two connection types is on or off on the phone, nor does it matter how strong the signal is reported by the phone.

It can happen in many apps but what usually happens is when I try to get some sort of data to the phone, without warning, whatever app it is just spends a long time trying to get the data it needs. In other words, YouTube videos will never start or move forward when this happens.
When I open the MLB app, I can't even get the news page (which is basically a list of headlines). Or, maybe I have that app open and I read a couple of articles then tap to go listen to a game. Suddenly, the list of available audio feeds just doesn't load.
If I look at the Google News feed to the left of my main home screen, it's a crap shoot whether or not any article I tap on will actually load. Note: I am clicking on articles from major sites, not the clickbait, algorithm whores. The same can happen if I use the search bar Maybe results come up, maybe they don't and the process bar just stops at maybe  25% loaded.

You get the idea, but the worst example I can think of was from this weekend when I couldn't find my phone anywhere. I did the Where's My Phone stuff in Google from my laptop and although I got multiple rings before going to voicemail when I called from another phone (indicating it was turned on and ringing somewhere), Google could not connect to the phone to geolocate it for several tries. It also took a few tries to get actually get it to ring it constantly for five minutes. 

Currently, I can't open Messages.Android.com/web on my laptop because it wants me to connect my phone to a network. But it is on a network, both wifi and LTE. I am sitting here at my kitchen table in the middle of Seattle. I have a strong signal.

Any suggestions are welcome. Thanks!","Connectivity, Network, Bluetooth"

Pixel wired earbuds wont work on lock screen,"update***  I even tried just doing away with a lock screen and set it so I dont have a pin and the pixel wired headset still doesn't call the google assistant when the screen is displaying the clock.  I long press the middle button and nothing happens. If I take the phone out of my pocket swipe up so my phone is on then I can long press and the assistant appears.   I give up. If anyone knows of a phone and a wired headset that can just send a text while the phone is locked or the screen is off please let me know. I'm done with the pixels.  I ride a bicycle and this is pretty much the only thing I use a phone for.  I don't need to deal with pulling my bicycle off to the side every time someone sends me a text just so I can respond. 

My assistant doesn't work on the lock screen. I am using the forums to walk through a solution but every ""community expert's"" advice is wrong.  The people who reply actually use the correct steps which is very helpful. This is so frustrating it reminds me of when I used to own an iphone and wanted to change one little thing and had to spend hours only to hit a dead end bc they lock everything down which was the reason I switched to android.  The ironic thing is when I used the iphone assistant to text it was amazing and worked 100% of the time with no lag.  Here I am with pixel 3 and a pixel 4a and can no longer use a simple feature like that.  All I want to do is click my middle WIRED headset button so the google assistant appears and I can say ""text so and so"".  
 Have you confirmed that the ""Allow responses while phone is locked"" option is enabled? You can find this at Settings > Apps & notifications > Assistant > See all Assistant settings > Assistant (tab) > Pixel USB-C earbuds > Allow responses while phone is locked.
 I found this in one of the forums but when I go to settings, apps, assistant, see all assistant settings then there is NO assistant (tab) there is a long list of every single option except assistant tab. I just need to find where I can click allow responses while phone is locked for Pixel USB C earbuds because I have followed the other 97 steps just so I can try to send a hands free voice text while my phone is locked. This is ridiculous.  I have already clicked turned on locked screen personal results and I have already turned on allow wired headset request with device locked and the button to call google assistant still doesnt work on lockscreen. It immediately works if I take the phone out of my pocket unlock the phone and then press it but by then what is the use of having a button to call google assistant if I have to go through all of the steps manually on the phone anyway.

Pixel 5 won't connect to Laptop via USB,"So as above, my Pixel 5 wont connect to my laptop with a USB cable.

Now, my laptop doesn't have USB C ports, so I used a USB A to USB C cable.

Why would my WIFI and Mobile data stop working at the same time?,"I have already discussed this with a Google tech specialist, and we ended up trying all the usual troubleshooting steps including rebooting it into safe mode, trying the SIM card in another phone (it worked), resetting network settings, and, finally, a factory reset.  I  now have an appointment for a phone repair, but I just wanted to see if anyone knows what this could be and if I could get it running sooner.  

I was texting my Dad when my messages randomly stopped sending.  I noticed that my wifi was turned off, and it said ""no SIM card"" under the mobile data option.  When I tried to turn WIFI back on, the toggle switch turned to the on position, but the wifi remained off.  It did not show any networks, and when I left settings and came back, the toggle switch was flipped off again.  Here's the really weird part: I went to a restaurant, and my phone displayed the song name on my lock screen (while claiming it has no network connection of any kind).  Surely Google has not downloaded a complete neural net of every song in existence to my phone: this feature must require network connectivity of some sort. 

My first instinct is to think this is a software problem, but I did a factory reset... twice, so I think we can rule that out.  Next, I wonder about a hardware issue, but I would assume the WIFI antenna and the mobile data antennas are two different parts, so what is the chance they both break at the same time?  This leads me back to thinking it is a software issue.  Could it be possible that somebody installed a virus on an app I downloaded that is able to protect itself from a factory reset (or maybe hacked into my phone through other means)?  Can anyone think of any other explanations/troubleshooting tips?","Connectivity, Network, Bluetooth"

"Maps PIP, when using 2-button nav doesn't work with direct app changes","So I have this dilema: I prefer 3-button nav, but with the recent Android 11 decision to remove frequently used app suggestions I had to change to 2-button nav. The big problem is that I use Google Maps Picture-In-Picture (PIP) daily and for hours, but when I switch to another app PIP does not automatically happen like it does when I use 3-button nav. I am forced to press home button to get to the home (secondary or tertiary) screen, in which PIP occurs then I an switch to a different app to keep PIP. I frequently forget to go to the home screen as I'm used to quickly switching between apps. Is there some setting that allows for PIP to always automatically happen when I leave the maps app?

With 3 button I can: Select navigation in Maps, tap recents button and PIP pops up, then swipe to another app (since I can't select a frequently used app in the bottom 5 row that used to exist and was poorly removed), PIP stays throughout.
With 2 button I have to: Select navigation in Maps, tap home button and PIP pops up, gesture swipe up to access frequently used apps, then select an app.
The extra step is very inconvenient.

This may all be moot though since Pixel 5 has a decreased chipset and I'm now eying Oneplus and may go back to Nova launcher.",Setting up and Personalizing your Device

Your Pixel can help save battery life by switching between 5G and 4G based on the app you’re using. It’ll choose 4G for things like browsing the web or sending texts, and switch to 5G when you’re watching movies or downloading large files*[5][9].",Battery and Power

About LTE Band supported by Pixel 3,"Question:
I would like to know, does Pixel 3 (bought from Google Store Japan) support TD-LTE Band 39?

Description:
I know Pixel 3 was not published in mainland China, but since I am a fan of Google product, I bought one from Google store when I was in Japan, and brought it back to China. However, my carrier, CMCC, is using TD-LTE Band 39 mainly for the LTE network coverage. Unfortunately, it seems that Pixel 3 does not support Band 39 ---- I have never seen it using Band 39, hence the signal/data link sucks!
So, does Pixel bought from Japan REALLY support TD-LTE Band 39? And... if the answer is NO, is there any solution to make it support Band 39?

Android 10 update on Pixel 2 XL breaks WiFi,"UPDATE 12/18/19:
Might have a workaround for us. Reset your network settings, reboot in safe mode (power off, power on, hold volume down button), open wifi and I attached to an older 2.4ghz only router. It still said ""no internet"" but I set the advanced settings MAC to my phone's MAC, and that didn't immediately work, but I then changed it to an ""unmetered"" network setting and boom....full network activity.  This has survived 2 reboots so far.

UPDATE 12/15/19:
Issue has returned after the ""Phone"" app was updated on 12/15/19.  No wifi's work...2.4ghz, 5ghz, nothing. And I'm actually connecting to a google fiber box. Reset network settings, reboot phone, reboot router....nothing. I need wifi to work or this fails to be a useful device in my life!
Google Engineering.....please fix this....quickly.



Android 10 update on Pixel 2 XL caused a WiFi issue where all wifi networks report ""Connected, no internet access.""

Tried to connect in Safe Mode to eliminate apps and antivirus (NOD32 ESET) from being a culprit...no change. I'm on Google Fiber with a google fiber router and I wondered if that had something to do with it. Reset router twice. Rebooted phone multiple times. Wiped network settings and restarted.  Tried an alternate router (but same WAN). Set MAC to fixed device mode. Toggled airplane mode on and off. Flushed DNS.

Resolution:  Factory Reset  :(

Further discussion: I am wondering if ESET had something to do with it as it had no permissions for device location and was flagging all my home networks as an ""open"" or ""public"" wifi hotspot. This error occurred immediately after update to Android 10, and after factory wipe. Changing location permission to allow fixed it. Consider uninstalling it BEFORE updating the OS....","Connectivity, Network, Bluetooth"
Google Assistant Unlock while on Pixel Stand,"When Google Assistant is triggered via headset without using ""Hey or Okay Google"" it does not unlock phone when it's on the Pixel Stand.  Any actions I dictate are carried out by the assistant but since the phone doesn't unlock it fails.  

It seems to be unaware the phone didn't unlock to carry out the commands.  For example it will say calling xxx-xxx-xxxx number in my headset but it never dials.

If I take the phone off the stand Google Assistant works properly even if it's locked.

If I unlock the phone while on the stand and use the Assistant it works perfectly.

If I use the wake words for the assistant it unlocks the phone on the stand and works perfectly.  (Problem with this is that I have other devices in the room and they always pick up my commands instead of the phone.  I tested by muting the other devices.)

If I use a non Pixel wireless charging stand it works perfectly when the phone is locked.

So its something specific about the Pixel stand.

I dabbled in the beta and always ended up opting out due to crashes when running any Bluetooth connection. This would allow factory reset to the current factory Android 10 image. I was never able to pin down the issue but I suspect it may not occur if I did a complete Hard Reset (delete all data,  start with a pristine image).

I'm now installing the final release an an OTA update. If it fails in similar fashion, can I do a factory reset that clears all data, apps., settings, etc., that will then install the Android 11 image? As a follow-up question, in the event that fails what options may I have to factory reset back to a known stable Android 10 image.",Setting up and Personalizing your Device

Pixel 2 Battery Drain,"I've had my Pixel 2 since release and far it has been a great experience! Over the past month or so I've noticed the battery draining fast and charging slow. To the point where it will only charge with the rapid charger. Charging via USB from my PC or car does not charge my phone anymore (they used to charge it fine, just slower of course) because my phone is using more power than those ports can provide! ""Carrier Services"" and ""Google Play Services"" usages are high for some reason.  My understanding is that other apps piggyback off them so there could be some app that is draining my battery in the background. Problem is I have no idea which app it mignt be.  Is there any way to find which apps are piggybacking off Carrier/Google Play Services?

What I've tried:
-Rebooting phone (no effect)
-Safe mode (used for about a day with no unusual battery drain so appears to be a third party app)

Pixel 3 Assistant voice issues since update to Android 10,"TL;DR: Spoken notifications using USB-C headphones on Pixel 3 are using an otherwise unseen robotic assistant and Assistant voice is not changing when switched in settings.

Since I have updated to Android 10, I have had continuous issues with the Assistant voices. I used to have the voice set to Sydney Harbour, which worked on my phone but not on my Google Home (I was okay with this). Since the update, my phone has been set to the default voice (Red?) and my Google Home has been set to Sydney Harbour. As much as I want to find a solution to this, I am fine with bearing with this as it is still pleasant to listen to and is probably a bug of Android 10.

However when having using spoken notifications on my USB-C earphones with the Pixel 3, the voice used is a horrible, almost robotic sounding voice that only seems to come through the earphones and does not appear anywhere else. This voice is not selectable on the voice selection screen in settings. Is anyone else having this issue and are they aware of a solution to this? I have trawled the settings for Assistant and Voice and spoken notifications but I have not been able to find a solution.

I have also tried a different pair of the same earphones, no change.

Mike",Google Assistant and Voice Actions

Pixel keeps restarting - won't boot up - Here is what worked for me,"I've seen many, many posts about Pixels that will not boot up and continually restart before booting up. (all were locked or I would have posted on one of those)
I just suffered from this issue for the last 12 hours. I could not even get it in safe mode and did not try Factory Reset since so many had reported it NOT fixing the issue. Basically my phone was a brick restarting over and over and nothing worked. Fully charging it, etc.

First, what used to work was fully powering off from the screen where you get to factory reset, then wait 30 seconds, then full on until I hear the vibrate in the power button (only with no charging cable applied - if cable was connected it would not work). Well, this did not even work today.

What finally DID work for me today was the same dropping of my phone flat on it's back from 12"" to 18"" on a carpeted floor... just as I write in my posts in this thread (GatorAndroid):
https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!topic/phone-by-google/usWaieQt_7I
(be careful, I'm not responsible if something goes wrong)
I did it this time while powered off, and on my next power up, it FINALLY allowed my 12-hour bricked phone to come out of the repeated reboots.

I'm on my way out of this Pixel. I have it for 2.25 years and just too many problems to list and self-debugging like this. Easily 80-120 hours of my time over the 2 years. Unfortunately could not even consider a Pixel 3 because of the issues I've had over the past 2 years. Good luck.",Battery and Power

Pixel 3 with Pixel Stand charging very slowly since December update,"Since the December update, I've noticed the battery on my Pixel 3 is often running low.  Prior to the December update, and certainly prior to Android 10, charging on the Pixel Stand was quite quick, but it's not now.  Right now, it says ""30% - Charging wirelessly (8 hours until full)""

In the past when experiencing problems, others have solved it by unplugging the power from the Pixel Stand, which I've tried, or clearing the cache on the Pixel Stand App.  This app is no longer available, so I'm not sure if it's possible to clear its cache.  It seems since Android 10 the Pixel Stand app has been integrated into the OS.

I did notice a couple of days ago it seemingly randomly asked me to verify the stand, I clicked Verify and seemingly nothing happened... I think that happened twice or three times.

Have tried removing the Pixel Stand from the Connected Device list, which caused it to go through its setup questionnaire again, which interestingly did not include the question about verifying, but seemed OK.  But the problem remaining.

Pixel 2 Rear Camera Autofocus Issues then Stopped Working; Selfie Camera Still Fine,"Hi, I have a Pixel 2 that is almost two years old.

This week the rear camera began having autofocus issues. The focus looked like it was stuck in macro mode. It'd focus on extremely close objects but not close to distant objects. When shooting video, the camera would go in and out of focus. Closing and reopening the app solved the focus issues.

Last night, launching the camera app stopped working altogether. Clicking the camera icon results in the app launching then immediately dying. Sometimes there's an error message, sometimes there's a request for feedback, but most of the time the app just silently dies.

If I hold down the camera app icon and select take a selfie, the camera app usually launches and works. this leads me to believe that whatever is happening is limited to the rear camera.

Sometimes if I force stop the camera app then open it up a bunch of times (four to ten), the rear camera will start working perfectly again. The next time I go to use the rear camera though, the app starts the crashing again.

Camera app version is 6.2.030.244457635. I tried clearing cache, clearing storage, safe mode, everything short of a factory reset with no success.

In the past I have factory reset my phone, reset my network settings, changed random settings one at a time to see if that makes a difference but it seems to happen more often.  The other day i was listening to music (siriusxm or pandora) the phone crashed and rebooted and now my phone doesnt always charge like it had before.  I have been rebooting it throughout the week and that seems to help but i shouldnt have to reboot my phone a lot for it to work properly.","Connectivity, Network, Bluetooth"

I am not able to set up or use my Google Pixel 3 XL whatsoever.,"I recently purchased a Google Pixel 3 XL phone as I needed a newer version of the Android operating system to use the applications required for my job. I was astonished when I realized that I was not even capable of setting up the device. I feel the need to mention that I am not able to use cellular data on this device as it does not have a SIM card in it (I primarily use WI-FI as a substitute for cellular data). I was able to skip the activation portion of the phone's set-up sequence, however, as I was configuring the phone, a message popped up saying that bluetooth was not functioning properly. I ignore it, and moved on to the next step. It asked me for a WI-FI network because I could not use cellular data, but none of them were appearing. It's telling me that there are no WI-FI hotspots in my location, and that both my IP address as well as my MAC address are unavailable. I hope you see my predicament here. I can't use cellular data because I have no service or SIM card & I can't use WI-FI because no networks are appearing. I was told that this was due to my router being misconfigured, but that's literally impossible considering I have 12 other devices that are running perfectly & are connected to it as we speak. It also doesn't make sense that it wouldn't show any of my neighbors' networks if it was truly just mine that was affected. I have spent hours on the community forums & help guides written by Google to no avail. I have tried going into ""safe mode,"" I have tried wiping all data from the device & factory resetting it, and nothing works. I even had an actual Google customer service employee try to tell me that I needed to update my device's operating system... Let me ask you this, genius, how can you expect me to update my device using WI-FI when the whole reason I contacted you was because I couldn't connect to it on said device in the first place?

Pixel 4 - Camera: 30 fps video has more detail than 60 fps,"I have Pixel 2 and Pixel 4. Both devices have similar issue.  I am working with 1080p.

When selecting 30 FPS to shoot a video, the quality is better than selecting 60 FPS.  The 30 fps file has better overall detail(look at texture for example).  I took few sample videos with 30 and 60 fps and they came out with consistent results. The 60 fps does have better frame rate but lacks in quality/details of the content being shot.  I have checked file details and 60 fps file shows better bit rate which is about 6K+ more than 30 fps.  This is not isolated to my devices or the lack of app/system updates.

I am personally forced to select 30 fps because of the above.  The issue is present since owning Pixel 2 and I thought Google did something to make 60 fps as the name implies.

Is anybody having an issue with the assistant confirming commands you give it?,"When I give the assistant a voice command, I use to get a confirmation back as to what command It heard.  Is this something new for the Pixel 4a 5G?  My pixel 2 always worked fine in this regard.",Google Assistant and Voice Actions
"3rd Party charger wont charge My New google pixel 4 xl, only the original, is that normal?","I have tried with brand New USB-C to USB-A cables with 2.4A and an 1A wall charger, non of these works?",Battery and Power
Pixel 2 cannot see Gen 3 chromecast,"I was able to use it fine for a few days.  But suddenly the home app says the chromecast is not available.  

It works from an iPhone using the same google account. 
It works from my laptops Chrome browser again with the same google account.  

I have tried:
Factory reset on both chromecast and pixel 
Rebooting the router
Ensuring both are on the same wifi band (I used the phone to setup the chromecast: it's the same network)

Why can the iPhone see it just fine but my pixel can't?  I would figure google devices should integrate better with each other.","Connectivity, Network, Bluetooth"
