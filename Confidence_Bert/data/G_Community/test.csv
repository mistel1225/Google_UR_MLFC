why is t-mobile telling me my unlocked pixel 3a is not compatible with their network?,"For over a year I used my pixel 3a (that I bought from Amazon as unlocked and able to work with any carrier) with Sprint.  Now Sprint users are migrating to T-mobile.  When I tried to get a new sim at the Sprint/T-mobile store, they told me my phone is not compatible with their network and I would have to buy a new phone soon.  My phone has an esim right now.  I have talked to Sprint tech support and T-Mobile tech support.  Both have told me, after being transferred to several techs, that a pixel 3a phone is not compatible with T-mobile even though they sell pixel 4a phones.  So I contacted Google support.  They tell me my phone will work with any carrier.  As per their instructions I have refreshed the sim and reset the mobile network.  What could be the problem?  Is it the esim?  I really like this phone and planned on keeping it for at least 2 more years.  Why is T-mobile insisting it is not compatible?","Connectivity, Network, Bluetooth"
What sites are used on a Pixel when undertaking the internet connection test on a WiFi Service,"We have a captive portal on the business network that users must authenticate to before gaining access to the internet.  The Android phones will connect to the WiFi no problems but then advise there is no internet on that connection as they cannot access the internet as they have not authenticated via the captive portal.
I assume the Pixel handset undertakes a test to specific sites to see if there is internet access, i am trying to find out what they are so we can allow them through the firewall so the phone then thinks it has a connection and then will bring up the captive portal.","Connectivity, Network, Bluetooth"

Set Important Contacts to always RING your phone even if device set to vibrate,"My girlfriend is literally going to force me to get an iPhone since Pixel 3 doesn't have this feature...

On iPhone, there is a setting to make it so that when select contacts call you, the phone ALWAYS rings on loud. Even if the device is set to ""vibrate"" ""silent"" ""do not disturb"" or ""low volume.""

On Pixel 3, there is only the option to make it so that if your phone is on ""do not disturb"" your Favorite contacts calling will still make the phone ring. Useful for if you're going to sleep maybe, or in a meeting.

HOWEVER, very often I leave my phone on vibrate or low volume. Sometimes though, you miss a call when you don't feel it vibrating, or its laying on a desk where the vibration can't be felt and you're away from table. Or being on a low volume can be too low for you to hear phone if you're somewhere noisy. Even if most of the time (like 80-90% you catch the call, there's 10-20% of time where you miss it because it wasn't ringing on loud when a particular person, ie: girlfriend, called).

This means that occasionally, I miss calls from my girlfriend, and she gets pissed. I'd imagine a good number of other girlfriends/wives may also face this issue of not having their calls to their men sound a loud alert so guys never miss the call...

iPhone has this ""girlfriend/wife mode"" feature, please replicate it on Pixel. Otherwise I can't get Pixel 4 and have to switch to an iPhone...

I already checked app store for an app to do this. There doesn't seem to be anything and I think new Android software blocks these types of app's permissions.","Contacts, Calls, Voicemail"

Google Pixel 2 (Non XL) Shuts down if the battery is under 70% / under 80% if I enter Camera App.,"Hello. I've brought a Google Pixel 2 on the 27.07.2018 in Germany, so by the laws of the European Union the phone is still under the warranty.
Since then I've moved to Slovenia - there is no official repair service or official Google Store.
I have a receipt from the seller, but the problem now is that they simply don't exist anymore. I've tried to contact them over the mail, visit their site - it's offline since few weeks, no one picks up the phone..

I've even tried the Facebook, and the story is the same, the page was removed. I am a long time Google user, I've owned Nexus 5 - Hammerhead, Nexus 5X Bullhead, Nexus 6 - Shamu, Nexus 6P Angler, and Pixel 1, Pixel 1 XL, Pixel 2 XL and lastly Pixel 2 - the one I have a problem with. I am hopping that the battery is faulty, it started to happen a few days ago, once the phone dropped under the 60% it would start to shutdown randomly, now it just shuts down once it's under 70% and if I open the camera once is under 80%. I've done a factory reset, updated the phone, updated the apps, my phone drops like 30% in less then 20mins without me using it.

The phone is in pristine condition, always in a Spigen case and with a screen protector, never damaged or in service. I'm still a student so paying 612€ for a phone a little more than a year ago and now needing to buy a new phone is a no go for me. I mean I've worked night job to be able to afford this phone. Now I am walking around with the powerbank so I am able to call someone if I'm in need or something happens to me. I'm a big Google fan, always was, worked my a** off to be able to afford the products as I love stock Android and the things that it offers.

I am also in no position currently to afford a new phone. What can be done? I can sent the receipt, and pictures of the phone, or anything else you may need. I do have all of the original things, as well as the box. I'm getting desperate as everywhere I turn to help, there is no answer whatsoever.

https://drive.google.com/open?id=10MNDbvBZngxx7G4z4-hQFki-JqgGsKMt… here is the video of the problem.

I've as well installed accubattery to check my battery health (I don't know how accurate it is) It says that the battery is on 28% of the original capacity.

Personally, I don't like gesture navigation, and I'll be incredibly angry (and avoid updating) if the back button is removed. I'm a huge fan of giving people the option to choose between gesture and normal navigation, but I hope Google doesn't try to force everyone to use gestures. Sadly, it seems a lot of the more recent Android changes have been all about removing the ability to choose and customize...
Why would I ever want to have to make a sweeping gesture to do something when I can make a simple tap?

I open up the Sound settings. All volume controls set to max. I call my number from another phone and while it's ringing, the Ring & notification volume slider goes 3/4ths of the way to the left!! I hang up without answering and the slider goes back to max.

What is going on??? This is very repeatable. Both Google Voice and Sim number calls come into this phone and the same things happens no matter which actual number I call. There are no rules set on this phone.

How can I keep the volume on max?","Contacts, Calls, Voicemail"

I found Google Pixel 3 XL eSIM card flaw and contact google support and nobody care,"In conclusion: Pixel 3 xl eSIM card function has a flaw and can't work as physical SIM card.

About two months ago, I switched to Sprint. Because pixel 3 xl support eSIM card, I download the eSIM card and active the service. Everything looks good. Until I use WellsFargo app in a ATM, I can't log in this app. I made sure signal is great, other apps including Youtube was working fast excep WellsFargo. First time I was mad with WellsFargo. I though WellsFargo's server was down.
Soon after, I found App Line also didn't work in cell data connection.
Then, again, I found if I use wifi, wellsfargo app works great. When I switch data, it never works.
I call Sprint many times to figure out what problems. Sprint can't find anything.

After two months' all kind of try, I know problem should be in the phone itself. Then I noticed I used eSIM card. This is the only different when I switched to Sprint. Then I looked for pixel phone support. Not surprised, like before, they insisted they are everything great. I need to talk to every app company to find the app problems. Google is always disappointed me every time now.

Finally, I asked Sprint to send me a physical SIM card. I just got it and put it on. All problems go away.

I never think Google will become a so terrible company. Google doesn't know how to make hardware and doesn't care any feedback from customer.

Google Connectivity Service used almost a gig of data on my last cycle. Is this normal?,"My data usage was much higher this month due to just starting to drive for Lyft. Top data usage was 1. Spotify: 2.20gb, 2. Lyft Driver: 1.01gb, and 3. Google Connectivity Services:700mb.

Spotify usage makes sense. Lyft Driver makes sense - if they are disregarding my downloaded Google map of the city I drive in, even though their map is supposed to be an integration of Google Maps. 

However, Google Connectivity Services seems a bit high to me, and I don't know what's making it so high, yet nowhere near the others in quantity. The only thing close is messenger, at 693mb, from sharing photos. It seems like, as a VPN service provided by Google that we might not get charged data for using it. it also seems like if it is protecting us all the time the data usage would be much higher, since there are apps on the list that have used more data.

Sometimes they come back after a few seconds if the notification shade has been kept open. Also if I close the notification shade and then reopen it sometimes they come right back, but again might disappear for a few seconds.

Pixel 5 Visual Voicemail not working on Telstra (Australia),"After a few weeks of having the Pixel 5, I've only just realised that my voicemail has gone from being delivered as an audio file into Messages on my Pixel 4XL to now getting a text from my carrier (Telstra - Australia) asking me to call their voicemail number (101) to retrieve my voicemail manually.

After scouring Telstra's support site, there was a lot of conjecture about RCS and it not working and being a cause / contributing factor to Visual Voicemail also not working. It appears this has now been fixed by the rollout of ""Chat features from Google provided by Jibe Mobile"". 

However this has left the Visual Voicemail in limbo as Telstra is saying that as they are no longer supported by Google to provide the RCS from their end, they can't offer visual voicemail anymore.

Following Google's own support articles, the settings to turn it on are simply not showing.

I do not receive messages from service providers. In particular, the apps and services that sends a text with a code in order to proceed in the given wizard. For instance Googles Duo app. I need to type in my Chilean phone number but I never receive the text from Google. The same happens for Twilio, Twitter, etc. I have spoken with my local carrier several times and they have assured me that everything looks fine from their end. I do receive these texts if I insert my sim in any other phone. My phone is registered on the Chilean network. Even my wife's pixel 3 receives these texts but mine doesn't.

Looking for a Call Blocker solution for my Pixel 3,"When I got my first Android Smartphone I installed a program called Call Control to block known spammers callers in their database and to block calls I add to my black list.  The app worked pretty good on older phones but on my Pixel 3 not so good.  To block calls on your phone Call Control requires that it be the default dialer.  With the integration of contacts and voicemail withing the default Google dialer I want it to be the default which makes call control pretty much worthless.  Is there a call blocker that doesn't require that it be the default dialer that works well on the Pixel 3?  If there is none that will block the call outright, is there an app that will at least identify known spammers as the call comes in so you can disregard the call and then blacklisted yourself?  I was hoping that Verizon's call blocking app would work but when I go out to the store the app doesn't even show up to download and I've been told it doesn't even work with the Pixel 3 that's why it's not available to download from the store.

If anyone has any idea's or solutions let me know.  Thanks.","Contacts, Calls, Voicemail"

He has cleaned the lens and updated all apps. This was the first thing he tried as this was an important part of the phone he likes to use a lot but says it is not as good as the pixel 2 which can't be right surely?

No sound on one recorded video. Is there any way to recover it?,"I took a video earlier today and the video seems to be partially corrupted. When I view the video the first 40 seconds are just one still frame. The last 20 seconds of the video work, but there is no sound.

I downloaded MP4Fix but it said nothing was wrong with the video. I also downloaded VLC for Android but the video had the same issue there too.

I also transferred the file to my laptop and tried saving it as an AVI to have VLC fix it, but this didn't work either.

When I look at the video in the first screen of Google photos the duration in the corner reflects the length of the video that actually works. When I click into the video, it's longer but the first part doesn't play.

Alarm routine misbehaves after Android 11 update.,"I am one of the people who ran into all sorts of trouble after the recent update to Android 11. The biggest issue is with the touchscreen that is oversensitive now and results in a million of fathom presses per minute. That aside, I just noticed another quirky thing today. 
In the morning, when the alarm goes off, it automatically triggers a routine of providing details on the day's tasks, weather, and alike, and then it starts playing news. All worked fine until the update. Today, the routine started as usual, but when it came to news, the management window for it (pause, fast forward, etc) just didn't appear in the notification area at all! There it was, Google Assistant's voice reading news with no possibility whatsoever to control it. I have around 30 news sources going that way, which results in literally hours of news, and usually I just stop 15-25 minutes into it from the above-mentioned management panel in the notification area. As the window seems missing now, I just had to restart the phone to shut up those news. Anyone else with the same issue?

P.S. General afterthought on the update. I found myself to be a die-hard fan of clean Android and Google recently, and I've been recommending all my friends to switch to Android. Now this update came, and it has so many bugs that frankly left me shocked. It feels like a throwback into nightmares of 2010s, when Android on third-manufacturer devices was so buggy it was barely usable.  Clean Android is awesome for everyday use, but I only now realized it's the first major update I received since my romance with Google's devices. And no, it's no better than those old days when an update would introduce more bugs than good features. Really, Google? You disappointed me so much that I started to think about switching to iPhone instead - and that comes from a person who is never ever said one good word about Apple in her entire life. Heck, I was given a free iPhone X twice in the last 6 months, and both times I ended up giving it up after 2 weeks and buying Pixels (3a and now 4a) instead. 
Yeah, I know Google is going to fix these bugs soon, but just the general attitude of pushing an update that is half-baked and making customers struggle for several days is what makes me think about my choice of phones for the future. With Apple, I won't enjoy the simplicity and customization Android has to offer, but I won't struggle after each update either. If the entire selling point of Pixels is just how simpler they make our lives, then sorry, it ain't it.",Google Assistant and Voice Actions

When I'm in the US and I respond to the ones with the 044 they do not get those messages. There seems to be no rhyme or reason to when it comes from which phone number.

Pixel 5 wireless charging has suddenly become extremely slow,"I have had a Pixel 5 since December 2020. It’s worked very well and I’ve had no issues with it. However, wireless charging has suddenly become extremely slow. I use a Pixel Stand at my computer desk and a 3rd party wireless charger bedside and charging at both locations has slowed down significantly. However, direct USB-C charging is as fast as ever.

I’m not sure what has caused this slow wireless charging all of a sudden. I’ve done everything to troubleshoot. I have removed the thin phone case to try again (previous, there was no issues with leaving the case on) and have also rebooted the phone twice. I’ve called Google support and they are less than helpful. They just give me very generic steps to try.

I believe this change in wireless charging behaviour came about after the May 2021 security update. However, I admit that this problem might date back a couple of months. Since a couple of months ago, I sometimes wake up in the morning and take my phone off the bedside wireless charger and noticed it was not at 100%. This was intermittent behaviour and I had attributed to possibly not having my Pixel 5 aligned properly overnight. But since the May update, it seems like it is a constant behaviour.

Feature request: bring back the suggested apps/search bar/app drawer access on the recents screen.,"A lot of Pixel people (including myself) absolutely loved the feature in Android 10 of having suggested apps, a search bar and access to the app drawer from anywhere, as they were present on the recents screen. 

Personally, I really like the suggested apps because they were really accurate. These kind of AI features is the main reason why I bought a Pixel (and why people love Pixel phones - because of their unique AI features which other phones don't have). Having the app suggestions only on the dock now seems like a step back. Also, losing access to the search bar and app drawer from anywhere were really handy features, especially seeing how much space there is on the bottom of the recents screen, where now you can only find a ""screenshot"" and ""select"" button. 

Some sources which prove that people loved the feature:
- AndroidPolice post about the introduction of dynamic app suggestions on the home screen, top upvoted comments:
""What they should really add (back) is app suggestions to recents"" 
""I really hope they add these suggestions back to the recents menu; that's where I find them useful.""
""It saves me from having to swipe up the app drawer because the app I want to open is probably already going to be suggested at the bottom. I can't believe they removed that and for what, a screenshot button.""

- Reddit post about introduction of Android 11, top upvoted comments:
""I'm not a big fan of the change to the recent apps menu. The view seems a lot more clunky now that you can no longer use the Google search bar, click on a suggested app or go to your app drawer."" 
""The search and suggested apps in the recent apps menu was one of my most used features. Really hating that those are gone.
""Suggested apps as an option on all my home screens seems like a step back."" 
""Oh god, the bottom bit for the launcher is actually gone? I've been so accustomed to tapping the suggestions (because they're that good) that I don't even scroll through the previous apps anymore.""
""Damn I wouldn't have updated if I'd known 😖 What a dumb change. Hopefully they add an option to get these features back""

Also on 9to5google's Android 11 feature overview, they are mainly talking about losing this feature:
- ""RIP overview suggestions. Used it daily.""
- ""You can turn it off in Home settings luckily. I love suggested apps but didn't like them on the home screen""

I really appreciate all the hard work that went into developing Android 11. But to me, and a lot of other people, it would be a good decision to bring this feature back, maybe as a toggle which you can turn on or off. 

Thank you.",Homescreen and Launcher

Pixel 4XL Charges wirelessly to 100% and then stops charging and discharges on Pixel Stand.,"Recently purchased a Pixel 4xl last month along with a pixel stand. Over the past two days I've noticed the pixel will charge to 100% while on the stand and then stops charging and starts discharging while still on the stand. I do not have a case on it. The pixel will show it's charging wirelessly until it reaches 100% and then shows ""not charging"" and then appears to discharge as if not on the stand at all. Pixel stand features such as the photo show continue to work which drains the battery even faster.

I have a WiFi not working issue with my Pixel 4.,The WiFi on my Pixel 4 will randomly stop working. I have tried all the fixes I can find on the internet with no success. I factory reset my phone and that worked for a few hours but im not going to constantly factory reset my phone all the time . So I started experimenting with my own fix. I finally found a fix that works every time and uncovered a manufacturing defect in the proccess. When my WiFi stops working I will shut the phone off and place an icepack on it for approximately 3 to 5 minutes. then turn the phone on and the WiFi works again every time. It will work for about 2 days and then I have to do it again. This leads me to believe it is a manufacturing defect. most likely a solder connection that gets just hot enough that the connection separates causing a loss of WiFi.

Camera Pixel 4,"Compared to the Pixel 3, the fourth family has only one selfie camera and autofocus has been removed from it, this is a minus, why remove it, what works better?  The question is open!  Everyone puts ultra-wide-angle cameras on smartphones, but Google thinks that zoom is more important to users - that's why the Pixel 4 just has a dual camera with the zoom that Apple has had since 2016, although Google insisted that they did not need a second camera for optical zoom, each  year they contradict themselves.  Next year, they will add a third ultra-wide camera and a self-focusing camera with autofocus.  Maybe the main camera in Pixel 4 is very good and it is slightly better than in the previous generation, but it would have been earlier if Apple had not worked out its deep fusion and night mode as it should on iPhone 11, in pixel 4 there is no such separation from competitors as  was earlier in comparison with pixel 2-3 versions, competitors worked out software algorithms.  The video, as it was 4K 30 frames, remained, the competitors already have 4K 60 frames on the front camera, but what the hell is Google?  put another sensor that can record 4K video 60 frames, purely for video, if the IMX 363 is so good for the photo part, leave it too, there is only two cameras in the back, and on the front, put the sensor up to 4K 60 frames, the prices are almost the same  same as Apple, but in the aggregate and in general worse!",Camera

In my case, haven taken hundreds of portrait photos, there were hundreds of these folders I needed to delete.

Despite years of complaints, Google and its camera app developers have done nothing in terms of issuing a fix. The problem has persisted throughout each new iteration of the Google phone. This is unacceptable.

PLEASE if you are having this issue, contact Google developers through the camera app, by tapping More--->Settings---->Send feedback and politely ask for an immediate fix. Or consider telling them you will not be purchasing another Pixel phone until this issue is resolved.

When a fixable feature has this many complaints, it's hostile to users for nothing to be done. Let's force Google developers to finally pay attention.

I don't want her account to be the admin on the phone, I want it to be mine so that I can apply parental controls without the possibility of her disabling it. I have setup the phone as follows:

1. Logged onto the device using my google account. I then add her google account as well (because we're using google fi and can only have one line per google account, so I need her account on my admin user so the line works).
2. I go to Settings -> System -> Advanced -> Multiple Users and create a new user for my daughter, turning on phone calls & SMS as well.
3. I setup her user by signing into her google account. She has her own PIN, different from the admin account.

Switching between users, phone calls and text messages all work fine. The problem is when the phone is restarted. The phone demands I enter the ""admin"" user account PIN before I can do anything else. I try swiping down on the top menu, selecting the ""person"" icon, and I can see her user account as an option, but it's grayed out and tapping it does nothing. The only thing I can do is select the admin user and enter that PIN. After this is done, I can then switch to her user without issue.

Needless to say, my concern is if she's out and happens to restart the phone (runs out of battery, perhaps a software glitch crashes the device, whatever), that I would have to provide her the admin pin in order for her to use the phone again.

Does Live Caption on 4a during phone CALLs needs Android 11 ? (Not 10 as shipped)?,"I just unboxed an unlocked 4a (from BBuy) for my almost deaf mother just for the ability for her to use Live Caption during a phone call.

Note that it works for other video content but not on phone calls.  I am not using a headphone or bluetooth speaker just plain handheld phone call not on speaker (think: deaf person!).

Long story short, I received the phone on 9/24/20 and followed all the steps to insert SIM, connect to WiFi, copy content from my old phone via cable, let it update all my apps, etc.  
It is running Android 10.   

So I just wondered if this possibly needed Android 11 to work, and since my phone said an update was available... I updated 11 and NOW IT WORKS!  

Is Android 11 stable?  If so why didn't Google release the 4a with it on it?
This phone will be sent to my 92 year old mother with no tech support and no T-Mobile store even if she had one nearby.  She needs a reliable phone so should I wait and not buy it yet?

NOTE added: After I wrote this I have learned that Google only released Android 11 on Pixel a couple of weeks ago... so these phones have probably been in the supplier pipeline so still have 10 on them.

Phone shuts off well above 0% power,"I've submitted at least a dozen feedbacks via the phone and received no inputs from Google, so I'm turning to the community.  My 1st generation Pixel phone shuts off above 10% power pretty regularly - including sometimes at 20% or more, but other times goes all the way down to 1-2% (then I charge it, I never intentionally let it run out of battery).  Sometimes it's right as I turn on the camera, sometimes I'm on a website, sometimes I haven't touched it in 10+ minutes and when I go to turn it on it immediately shuts off.  When I plug it in, if I immediately turn it back on it shows the last percentage that it was at (like the 20% it just shut off at, about 10 minutes ago).  It charges fine, but I'm nervous to use it when the battery gets low because I can't trust if I actually have 100% of my power.  Around the same time the battery became untrustworthy, it seemed like the screen brightness became less bright as a whole (I rarely keep it at 100% brightness, even before these issues) and the camera became much, much slower (sometimes 1-2 seconds between pushing the button and it taking the picture).  It makes me think it was an update from a couple of months ago that caused this, but I'm not sure, I have no real indication if it is software (update) or hardware (battery).

Battery Percentage Not Changing,"As of 2 days ago my Pixel 3 battery percentage has stayed the same - 59%. It was working fine for nearly 16 months.  I went through ALL options including 3 chat assistants. No resolution and/or fix.

Let me help others so you don't waste your time.  This is a ""baked in"" issue that is in ALL Pixel phones.  It's like a time bomb.  When you research this issue nothing works as a fix...short or long term and Google has said it will send out a fix at some point for the 5.  Well...for those of us with earlier models that tells you all you need to know. Again...this is a persistent, fundamental flaw.

Of course...Google will lean on the warranty but, if this is a baked in issue, it was there across builds from the start.  They'll then say...""buy an upgraded model"".  Well...when researched...the issue will still be in any upgrade as well.

I can't say this enough...avoid the Pixel.  What's frustrating is this is a well documented issue across the years.  Its a 50/50 shot it will probably hit your phone post warranty...so.. you're spending a LOT of money for an already flawed phone that will at some point have this issue.   There will be no recourse on the back end unless you're in warranty AND your replacement will still be flawed.

Disable Contacts sync does not work,"I have found that with my Pixel 4XL (or maybe it's Android 10) disabling Contacts syncing NO LONGER WORKS! With my older Pixel 2 it did work, and I would manually trigger a Contacts or Calendar sync when I wanted to. I have checked and double-checked all the settings (see below)... but it still syncs without me triggering a sync.
The settings I make are as follows ... Via Settings -> Accounts At the bottom of the main accounts page, there is a toggle named ""Automatically sync data"" with the text ""Let apps sync data automatically"". If this ""Automatically sync data"" toggle is ON and you then select your GMail account, and press the ""Account sync"" button, you are able to edit the(Google) apps you don't want to auto-sync (i.e. turn sync OFF). I do this (I switch all Google apps to off), and return to my GMail account page. I then see ""Sync OFF for all items"" in grey text under the ""Account Sync"" button (my upper case for OFF above). I then go back up to a higher level .. that is back to the main accounts page. The toggle ""Automatically sync data"" is still ON of course, and the grey text under it says ""Let apps sync data automatically"". I don't want this to happen, so I now set this ""Automatically sync data"" toggle to OFF. Here's the problem: after making this last change (i.e. ""Automatically sync data"" toggle to OFF), when I select my GMail account again, I now see ""Sync ON for all items"" in grey text under the ""Account sync"" button(my upper case for ON above)!! This is completely contradictory! How can it be that after first disabling auto-sync on all the Google apps and then switching off ""Automatically sync data"" Google signals ""Sync on for all items"" ?!?
And here's the bigger problem: the above message is correct. Because if I leave the settings as above the Contacts does indeed continue periodically auto-syncing. (I know this because if I delete one of my contacts in the Google Contacts app in the cloud after a short period the same contacts on my phone disappear too! The ""short period"" can be anything from 3 to 30 hours).
I have tried removing my Google account and adding it again, but without success. It seems to me that this is either (a) a bug in the ""Automatically sync data"" implementation .. OR .. (b) a deliberate implementation to either check data or mislead users.
I have also tried all sorts of variations and checked Google account settings in the cloud too (not much there!), all to no avail. It seems I cannot now disable auto-syncing of Contacts ... If somebody thinks I'm missing something help would be appreciated?","Contacts, Calls, Voicemail"

Pixel Stand stopped working (does not detect phone),"Echoing what some other posters are noticing, with a few more details.

As of this morning, my Pixel 3 stopped working with both of my Pixel Stands.

Here's what I've done so far:

1. I updated settings to forget both stands.
2. I rebooted my phone.
3. Confirmed Bluetooth was on.
4. Removed my case (even though it's an approved Google case).
5. I unplugged and replugged the stand with the original charger.
6. I placed my phone back on one of my stands.

Here is what happens:

Most often, nothing. The phone will not pair.

However, three times (of about 15 attempts), the phone begins charging briefly and I see the pairing setup launch. But then I get a modal telling me to place the phone on the stand. If I tap okay, the screen clears and the phone stops charging. If I remove the phone and replace it on the stand, the phone stops charging.

Note I've repeated the above for both stands.

Note also that I no longer have an app to manage Pixel settings. I'm pretty sure I didn't use it to pair (when it existed).

Thank you!

Bluetooth connection to Volvo radio causes car radio reboot,"I frequently use Bluetooth from my Pixel 3 to connect to my 2015 Volvo S80. I've never had any problems,  at least until yesterday, March 10th 2020. Streaming YouTube to my car radio will cause the car radio software to crash and reboot pretty reliably after about 30 seconds or so (I haven't timed it yet). Streaming other apps, such as VLC, over Bluetooth causes the same thing to happen. Simply having Bluetooth connected and using the car's radio did not cause reboots, however I did hear the radio drop out completely and return several times.

Battery is dead - Trying to send my Pixel 3 XL to warranty living in Poland,"Hi all, hope you are safe and taking care of yourselves during these days. 

Long story short: I have bought my Pixel 3 XL in Jan 2019 in Media Markt Germany, warranty goes until 2021. Last Friday my Pixel died. It stuck, I try to restart it pressing Power button + volume down, it shutdown but never turned it on again. I took it to a random repair shop here, they tested the battery and it seems that is not taking proper amperage or something like that. Anyways, phone won't turn on again. 

I was contacting MediaMarkt but they told me to contact Google so can I ship the Pixel back or something like since I live in Poland and not in Germany. I tried to contact Google via Twitter (@MadeByGoogle). Here is the answer:

""Thanks for the info. It looks like you're currently in a location where we have limited support options. Please note that we offer warranty support only in countries where we sell devices.

Anyways, my question is: how to do it? Google tells me I need to get back to Germany so I can get support. It should be simple, no? Give me an address, I will ship and that's it.

Poor microphone quality via GSM and any other calling apps,"Hi there,

I was told several time by interceptors that they can hear me really bad, all because of poor quality sound.

I went to my carrier provider and have changed the sim card - but it is the same thing. I have almost all the time 4G antenna so I don't think I have issues with that. Via WiFi I have exactly the same issue.

It is either the soft (but I have done many updates since I have the phone) or the issue is with the microphone itself.

Quality / Call Issues - other side cant hear me for the first 2-3 seconds,"Hey everyone,
I'd appreciate some help with this issue, because the Google Support team has not helped at all unfortunately:

The issue:
Every time I make a call or receive one - in the first few seconds of the call the other party/side can't hear me. I say ""Hey"", but they can't hear me. They say ""Hello?"", and I reply ""Hey!"", and only then we can start the conversation.

The Google Support solution:
I was told to try and turn on the phone in Safe Mode. Once I did, the issue seemed to have been resolved.
The CSR said this is probably due to an App that I have installed that's causing this, however - there is no way of knowing which. I have so many that it doesnt make sense to uninstall one-by-one and check if that helped or not.

My Solution (didn't work)
Factory Reset. Very annoying, as its a pain in the A**. I had to make sure that once I log in to my google account after the Reset - it doesnt re-install the apps automatically. I did some test calls and it seems to have worked for a while. so I thought the issue was fixed, so I installed all my important apps when I needed them.

After a while, I started experiencing the old issue again and again. No idea which app is causing it (if an app is even to blame, that is), or if it is and issue with the software of hardware. This SHOULD NOT HAPPEN in any case. Why does Google approve apps to its Google Play Store if they are (in theory) not compatible with the Google Phones or OS? 

I had the Nexus 6P before that and had call issues that were never resolved. I had hoped replacing it with the Pixel 3 would do the trick but it didnt. I am very frustrated and really like the Google phones, but I might not have a choice but to switch to and iPhone...  :(

Please prevent me from switching to and iPhone by helping my find a solution....
Thanks a lot in advance :)

Massive standby battery drain on Pixel 3a,"Sometime in the late summer or early fall of 2020, right around when Android 11 dropped (although I'm not sure if it perfectly coincided with upgrading to Android 11), I started to notice a pretty heavy standby battery drain on my Pixel 3a (2-3% per hour). Instead of lasting two days with 6-8 hours SOT, as it had for the first year I owned it, my battery was discharging so quickly on standby that it would die in about two days with the screen off.

I dealt with the battery drain for few months on stock Android 11. Eventually I was at my wits end trying and failing to find solutions, so I decided to downgrade to Android 10 and switch to CalyxOS (a private near-stock Android ROM) with the thought that removing Google's spyware might help. Unfortunately, the drain persisted. I have since upgraded to Android 11 on CalyxOS and the drain is still here. My battery stats constantly show high usage from Android System (usually more than the screen), Wi-Fi, Standby, and sometimes Android OS.

Let me give you a rundown of some of my settings to make it clear how ridiculous this battery drain is:
Bluetooth and Wi-Fi scanning off.
Wi-Fi on, but with Mobile Data Always Active off.
Bluetooth off.
NFC off.
Location services off.
Ambient display off.
Hotspot/tethering off.
VPN off.
""Ok Google"" off (the Google app is actually uninstalled).
All gestures off (e.g. Lift to check phone).
Cell signal is great. It's consistently three or four bars in my apartment.
Only 9 apps registered for push notifications (turning off push notifications doesn't solve the drain): Bitwarden, Duolingo, GroupMe, Nanoleaf, Photos, ProtonMail, Signal, YouTube, YouTube Music
Only 7 accounts syncing (turning off auto-sync doesn't solve the drain): Two DAVx5 accounts (for contact/calendar sync), Duolingo, Google, GroupMe, NextCloud, and Signal

Here are some of the things I've tried that haven't stopped the drain:
Battery saver mode
Safe mode
Factory reset
Reverting to Android 10 (I did this before moving to Calyx OS and then ran Calyx OS on Android 10 for a month or two before upgrading to Android 11 again)
Switching to microG for Google Play Services (bundled with Calyx OS)
Switching to 5GHz Wi-Fi (I usually connect to 2.4GHz)

The one thing I've done to successfully stop the drain has been the following:
Turn off Wi-Fi.
Restart the phone.
Leave Wi-Fi off.

However, I only have a 4GB data plan and I use probably 20-30GB of Wi-Fi data per month. This is at best an extremely short term workaround. I also don't think this has worked every time, but I know it's at least worked a couple of times for me.

----

The following screenshots are battery stats from two days ago. To get these, I turned on safe mode, charged my phone to full, and then just sat it on my desk with the screen off all afternoon (aside from turning on the screen once in the middle to check the battery). I had 1 minute of SOT over the entire charge and I lost 17% battery. There are an insane amount of wakelocks going on, leading to almost two hours of screen-off uptime of the ~6.5 hours it was sitting on my table. Almost all of these seem to be coming from the Wi-Fi radio.



---

Any suggestions of things to try or solutions would be very welcome. I'd also be happy to share more stats from this charge (or a non-safe-mode charge) if that would be helpful.

I'm just so tired and frustrated at this point. The longer this goes on, the more charge cycles get added to my battery, and the worse my battery life is going to be over time. This same exact thing massacred my old Nexus 5's battery and I really don't want to have that happen again :(",Battery and Power

Issue charging phone,"I have a new Verizon branded ixel 4a 5G. I like the form factor and the phone. But there is an issue when I try to charge it. I will describe the issue after I explain the steps that I have gone through:
Restarted the device (cold start)
Started the device in Safe mode
Factory reset the device (based on email from Google support)
Uninstalled several applications

The issue is as follows. When I plug the phone into the wall to charge, it does not charge. I am using the original cable. If I go into settings and look for the USB settings, the item for ""controlled by""  ""connected device"" is often active. Sometimes when I attempt to switch to ""This device"" it switches and charges OK. Sometimes it refuses to switch. And occasionally, even when the phone is plugged in, both ""Connected device"" and ""This device"" are grayed out. The strange effect is that I do not connect the phone to a PC.

In conducting another experiment, it appears to matter which way up I insert the charging cable. Insertimg the cable one way up, the phone charges fine (does not switch to ""USB controlled by Conneted device"". However inserted the other way up it either reverts to USB controlled by Connected device, or it simply does not detect that a cable is plugged in at all.

I have tried with other USB-C cables (purchased from Verizon), and the behavior is consistent. 

This has been happening quite consistently for several weeks. Does anyone have any thoughts as to why?",Battery and Power

"Pixel 2 charges more slowly once it's been to sleep, even after waking again","I just got a USB power meter, to compare my USB-C cables, and I noticed something strange: when my Pixel 2 goes to sleep, it starts drawing less power—and then CONTINUES drawing less power, even after I've woken it up again!

When I plug the cable in, I get about 1.5A, and as soon as I put it to sleep, it drops to around 0.7A, and then DOESN'T go up again upon wake (sometimes it'll briefly go up as high as 1.0A, but it only stays there momentarily before dropping back to 0.7A again, and staying there).

My first thought was ""maybe the sleep shut down something power-hungry in the background"", but all I have to do to get it back up to 1.5A is disconnect and reconnect the cable one more time, and it'll stay at 1.5A until its next sleep, just like before (and then stay down at 0.7A after waking again, just like before.)

How to tune new Pixel Buds for higher frequencies?,"I can't seem to get Google support for my new Google Pixel Buds?

Google's app, Sound Amplifier, has an email address on the Play store
for support.  That email address does not work!   The reply I got was:
""You have emailed to an address that is no longer being monitored.
To get help, please visit https://support.google.com/.""
However, Support does not know how to address these issues.

Today I just got a new pair of Google Pixel Buds from Google, to use with my Pixel 3 XL Android.

At my age of 79, it is common for high frequencies to drop, so I was hoping that the new Pixel Buds together with my Pixel 3 XL might help ""punch up"" these frequencies.  I have already tried  your using Google Sound Amplifier Sound and the Accessibility options (including the Google  Accessibility Scanner), but they only provide a sketch of how I might modify sounds?

I also am trying the Bass Booster Pro  app, and I would like feedback on the settings, to see if I am reasonably addressing my problem on both apps?  Google support recommended that I add an equalizer app to Sound Amplifier?

The basic problem is that although Sound Amplifier has a setting for ""Sound around you"", this does not work very well at all and all sounds are muffled by the buds.

I also have tinnitus which I know makes it more difficult to address these issues.

If I can't get support, I'll just return the buds.",Setting up and Personalizing your Device

Any way to fix bad rotation behavior on the app switching screen without disabling auto-rotate?,"This seems to be a problem whenever auto rotate is enabled.  By default the home-screen is landscape-only, which is fine and how I prefer it.  The issue is that this 'default' does not apply to the recent app view/app switcher.  

The way this behavior manifests is that if my phone is on a desk or other flat surface, it will be in portrait view in the home screen, but if I swipe up to get to the recent app view, there seems to be a 50/50 chance it will switch that specific view to landscape, turning everything 90 degrees and changing the direction needed to swipe to close etc.  

If you are holding the phone vertically in-front of you, its not an issue as obviously the sensor will indicate everything should remain portrait, but if it is on the desk you can't tell if the sensors feel it is technically 'portrait' or 'landscape' since its just laying flat there to begin with and you might as well flip a coin as to what orientation that the app switch screen will come up.

In prior versions of android that screen seemed to be 'informed' not just from the sensor but also what the orientation of the last 'view' or app you were in when you launched it.  i.e. if playing a game locked to landscape mode and opening that screen, it would still open landscape, even if the device was flat on a table and/or the 'sensor' last read was a portrait one.

In android 9 it seems like it always favors the sensor readings which is causing kind of random/guesswork behavior if the phone is set down and it means I kind of cringe every time I go to open the screen because I never know whether its going to sit there and then rotate 90 degrees on me or not.  So instead of a quick flick like the gesture is supposed to be its always a flick, sit there, wait, see if it turns, if it turns re-adjust my internal perspective and change all my swipe options by 90 degrees, or just try and pick the phone up off the desk to have it turn back etc, then swipe to the other/recent app I want. 

Either way it takes what used to be a half-second near-thoughtless navigation gesture and makes it a 4-5 second series of steps I need to focus/concentrate on.  Having the 'last seen' screens all be in their original orientation doesn't help matters because even if it switches to landscape view and navigation the apps will still 'look' portrait and its just the main phone status bar etc that will be visually rotated and serve as an indicator that the UI is now turned 90 degrees from what it was a half-second ago.

Basically instead of observing the orientation of the app (or home screen) that it is opening from, it is *always* subservient to the sensor data, which can disagree when the app is 'locking' the orientation (either portrait or landscape) and/or the sensor data is ambiguous (laying flat on a desk, so neither definitively portrait nor landscape) and that causes delays or directional ambiguity when they don't match and things start rotating in unexpected ways.",Homescreen and Launcher

There's a way to get around it  by going to taskbar then to settings, a choice to unlock the screen will popup taking you to settings and from then the call can be bubbled, But there has to be another way as I don't think this is an intended way to open the phone.

Able 2 receive text msgs w/ Wi-Fi & data turned OFF. Unable 2 receive msgs w/ WiFi+Airplane both on.,"I can send and receive text messages with both Wi-Fi and cellular data turned off (native ""messages"" app for Google Android Pie latest update). I cannot send or receive text messages when Wi-Fi is on and airplane mode is also on simultaneously. This could not be a more inconvenient setup for me. When I don't want to receive text messages or phone calls I have always turned off cellular data and Wi-Fi, but now I can receive these messages when I have nothing turned on. In addition I often leave airplane mode on and just use Wi-Fi so everything else is not using battery, but now I can't receive text messages or send them when airplane mode is on as well as Wi-Fi, this happened all of a sudden after the last Pie update or thereabouts. Every other app including my other texting apps work with airplane mode and Wi-Fi turned on. The only app that is having an issue is Google's native Messages app. 

This humongous bug has cost me tremendously financially because I've missed important business-related phone calls and I do plan to sue for monetary damages. I want compensation. Being able to receive text messages with Wi-Fi on is a basic right of buying an expensive phone and paying for service and this is a Google related issue as well as Verizon, you are both culpable.

This BUG also means that the network is connecting to my phone and using MY battery when I don't want it to EVEN WHEN I have turned the cellular data and WiFi off❕ I have definitely noticed that my battery has been draining significantly faster since I have been able to receive and send text messages with my cellular data and WiFi turned off❕

How to stop Play Store from crashing within 30 seconds of opening?,"Hi, I have upgraded (OTA) my Pixel 2 from Android 9 to Android 10. When I now launch the Play Store, it comes up and crashes within 30 seconds. Sometimes it gets to ""Download Pending"", sometimes to ""Downloading"", but never actually started a download. This means I can not install and update Apps now.

I have tried cleaning the cache and data of both Play Store as Play Store Services. Have tried Safe Mode. Have uninstalled Play Store and Play Store Services updates. All to no avail. When looking at the process list, it appears that the underlying Play Store Service process suddenly dies. All permissions are enabled.

Anything else that I can try. I am afraid of doing a factory reset. Besides the extra work re-instating something that I already have, what if that does not fix the Play Store issue. That would mean that I can no longer use my phone.

When you regain service the phone no longer attempts to connect to LTE it defaults to 3G.  


Once this starts to happen to you... It doesn't go away...

Go to settings app
Go to network / internet
Go to mobile network
Go down to bottom
Click advanced
Click carrier settings on bottom

Click Update Device Config

This will take a few seconds then fix the issue.

"Doesn't work Telegram incoming calls in Do Not Disturb mode with enabled ""override DND""","I've faced the problem of Telegram incoming calls in Do Not Disturb mode. The problem is when I turn 'override DND' on for Telegram incoming calls, there is no call sound. And when I have missed call, override DND becomes disable.

To reproduce this bug you need:
1. Enable DND mode;
2. Turn 'override DND' on for Telegram incoming calls in Android notification settings;
3. Call yourself from someone else's phone (there will be no sound - this is the bug);
4. Check Telegram incoming calls in Android notification settings (there will be disabled 'override DND mode' - this is the bug).

Here's the video I recorded to demonstrate you this bug - https://photos.app.goo.gl/nToCKJ8zzquuzLcw8.

When is Google going to fix the notorious battery drain problem on the older pixels they caused?,"It seems everyone knows there is a phone destroying battery drain problem with these phones. They went from acting normally to going from 100% to 0 in no time for no reason. I did an update one night that literally bricked my phone. It couldn't even start up again when it was acting normally just the day before.         
I'm assuming it's a firmware update or a hardware incompatibility issue with the new Pi or Andriod 9. Here's the thing:  I've done everything they said to try to fix battery life. I've tried only using stock apps safe mode looking at every battery drain issue turning off literally everything and nothing works. I've changed from adaptive battery to non-adaptive. I've bought three different units of the exact same phone. ( 128 silver original pixel)  I replaced the battery. Nothing. Same issue. If google is going to purposely nerf phones as soon as they're out of warranty I think everyone should either boycott google and their products and just assume they've gone downhill as fast as these batteries or we get an answer on this and a real fix  I mean this month because this is an environmental disaster, unfair to their customers and downright evil.

Pixel 1 manual and auto focus aren't working,"Ok so, for unrelated reasons, a few years ago I had my first pixel replaced with a refurbished version.

The refurbished phone had issues with focusing within a month of using it.

By that point, I was out of warranty to get it fixed. Google support staff had me try everything including clear my cache, reinstall the camera app, use safe mode, factory reset, etc. None of those steps worked.

* Critical Point: A third party app called Open Camera allows you to manually control the camera focus. This is NOT automatic focus. It's manual. Manual focus on the third party app couldn't even adjust the focus. So the issue isn't the laser sensors. It's the camera itself.

What I want is simple: an acknowledgment that this phone has a fundamental fault with its camera that isn't a software issue.

For years, you guys have refused to acknowledge that it's a hardware problem, and have consistently insisted the problem is from software.

You guys wouldn't stand by your product or acknowledge it was faulty, and tried to get me to pay for repairs on a phone that was broken out of the box.

All I know is that, until you acknowledge my complete disgust with the way you handled this, I'll never buy a pixel as long as I live.

How can I get the phone app to only display contacts from one google account?,"I have two google accounts on my phone and as a result, I've ended up with duplicate and useless contacts on my phone list. (The contacts app works very well [as it allows viewing contacts from individual accounts];  but the phone app merges all the disparate account contacts into one giant mess.) This isn't ideal.

I have tried removing one account, turning off sync, adding the account back, turning on airplane mode, turning sync back on and then turning off sync for contacts. But this does not work because the contacts are synced immediately when the account is added. Evidently there is no getting around this.

I have also tried clearing the cache and data for both the phone and contacts list. But this does not remove the synced contact data either.

The only effective solutions I've found are either, removing one of the google accounts or deleting contacts from one or the other account. Neither of these are good solutions.

tl;dr: How can I get the phone app to only display contacts from one google account (on a phone with two accounts signed in)?","Contacts, Calls, Voicemail"

Pixel 2XL turns off when the screen is off. Odd charging and battery statistics,"Hello all,

My 2XL has performed flawlessly until this past week. It is now crashing and turning off throughout the day, but only when the screen is off. Sometimes it is able to sit idle, and others it powers off the second the screen also turns off. The battery level does not seem to be a factor as it has happened minutes off the charger at 100% and when below 20%. The phone was pre-ordered so it is 3 years old, the battery was replaced last November through Ubreakifix so it's only a year old.

Google support suggested safe moe, however that did not fix the issue.

As for the odd charging and battery statistics. Until today, when the phone would power off, it would not turn on unless charging, but that is no longer the case. When plugged in, it would initially quickly cycle between red, green, white charging icons before turning off with no led light. My battery statistics are saying that it has been 65 days since being at 100% but that's not true as I charged to full last night. The battery also seems to be draining abnormally fast despite no apps reporting high usage.

I intend to do a factory reset this weekend as I have run out of options. I found two users on the forum that described a similar issue but neither had helpful replies as one was under warranty and one was on beta.

Thank you for any and all help. My 2XL has been incredible and I was hoping to have a few more months with it.",Battery and Power

Notifications squished and not expanding properly in pull-down notification drawer,"In the last ~3 weeks (I think since the July 2020 security update) I've noticed my notification drawer (which you drag down with your fingers) is no longer expanding further than about 50% the height of the screen. Additionally, it no longer allows me to scroll the list of notifications within the drawer. As such, the notifications in the drawer are squished and some scroll off the bottom of the drawer and I cannot see them at all. See sample screenshots at the bottom of this message.

Normally, I would just use my fingers (have tried 1, 2, 3, 4 fingers) to expand the drawer down to the full height of the screen (and once it's full height, I used to be able to scroll the list of notifications independently) but now it just expands the shortcut buttons section (the top row of the open notification drawer) rather than the notifications section itself.

I've not changed any settings relating to the notification drawer, and in fact, I cannot even find any settings to customised the look/feel/layout of the notification draw so I believe it was a change made as part of an update rather than something I've changed.

I've also tested with my launcher (I use Nova Launcher Pro) and the default pixel launcher - the notification drawer doesn't change and works the same no matter which launcher I use so I don't think it's an issue with Nova Launcher.

Pixel (1) Stuck in On-Off Loop,"Was watching a youtube video (using the default app) when screen suddenly glitched up and pixel froze.

After about 10 seconds, pixel started reboot cycle:  Google logo appears, stays there for 19--21 seconds, phone screen goes blank for 4--5 seconds, and then back to the google logo in an endless loop.  No interaction with phone screen or buttons.

1.  Tried plugging phone into charger, no impact.  Does not seem to register that charger is plugged in.

2.  Attempted to power phone off by holding down power button.  No effect; reboot cycle just continues.

3.  Attempted to hold power button and volume button, screen goes blank after 19--21 seconds.  After 35ish seconds, phone vibrates slightly.  Released both buttons after vibration, reboot loop resumes within a few seconds.

4.  Attempted to hold down volume button, screen goes blank after a while with a small line appearing in the middle (like when you shut off an old TV set and the line appeared there) briefly.  This happens every 25 seconds or so until I release the volume button, and then the reboot loop resumes.

5.  Going to allow phone battery to drain completely and allow to sit for 12 hours, but doubtful that this will help (unless a full closed boot is required).

Edit:
6.  Able to enter boot menu (power and down volume); selected recovery mode.  Reboot loop resumes.

I have a complaint about camera in my Pixel XL which I have been using for 1.5 years with great care,"Pixel XL is not listed in the list so I chose Pixel instead.

I'm having problem for a few months now actually. Sometimes it disappears but it is always there when I open my camera and goes away after a while but not always.

Thick parallel vertical lines (four to five) appear in camera and remain there after taking a photo. Although, the effect is hardly visible in broad daylight but one can notice indoors, and if I take a photo of bright light then it's pretty clear as in the photo I've attached below.

"Pixel 4 XL no longer shows ""Charging rapidly""","My Pixel 4 XL is pretty new.  I bought it early Oct 2020.
In the Settings > Battery screen, it used to briefly show ""Charging rapidly"" when charging began.
It was just brief.  Then the estimated charging time would replace it, I recall.

It was useful info.
I could tell if the phone was plugged into a usb PD port.
Or the phone was on a good Qi wireless charger.

But since recently, I think since this recent Dec update, it no longer displays that.
Was that text string ""Charging rapidly"" removed by this update?
Or is my phone suddenly broken?

I'm attaching a screenshot from Oct 15 which shows it.
I don't know if the pic will show in this post.
If the pic is in this post, you'll see what I mean.
That ""Charging rapidly"" text no longer appears while charging.




Now the icon looks really different.  (Dec 16).
See below.



I just checked.  Right now at this very moment, I get that same ""59 min left until charged""  (pic above) regardless if I plug into the original Pixel 18W charger, or into an unpowered USB 2.0 port, or put the phone on a 15W Qi wireless charger.

This seems to mean the phone can only slow-charge now by any charging method.  The USB 2.0 port can supply only 2.5W max.  Yet the Pixel 18W charger is estimated to fully charge at the same speed as the USB 2.0 port.",Battery and Power
Text Messages not working through bluetooth (car or fitbit) but other notifications work,"Both my wife and I just got a pair of Pixel 3a's through Google Fi.  We're enjoying the phones as they're a huge step up from the Moto X 4 in terms of speed and taking pictures.

All other bluetooth functionality works.  I can make calls/listen to music in the car no problem.  The fitbit notifies me of calls and when I get a message from other apps like Facebook Messenger and gmail (I can read and take actions like replying.)

Severe microphone issues on Pixel XL,"Dear All
I'm trying to get someone's support from Google directly. It is impossible to get in contact with a support from Google as I cannot contact the support from phone directly and after trying 100 times via internet, it always redirect em to some information which is really basics. 
By the end of 2016 I bought the first Google Pixel XL for USD 1026 in the UK, after having all Nexus devices before. I'm a long standing Android and Google fan since the first Android phone and Nexus.
After 1 1/2 years I got difficulties with Pixel XL. I could hear the other party on the phone, but they could not hear me. It took me almost 6 month finding out what exactly the problem is. After that I read in the internet/newspaper that a large number of owners are affected. Google Pixel XL has sever microphone issue which cannot be fixed via a software update. The device has a hardware problem, the motherboard has be replaced. Google confirmed the problem officially.
Now I sent my device to teh Repair Center in Germany to be checked and I receive an offer to have the motherboard replaced for USD 381, so In total I would paid USD 1407 for this device. This reply was absolutely disapointing from Google.

This absolutely not acceptable from a customer view. I was not able to find out the root cause within the 2 years guarantee time. I could not use the phoen even for the first 2 years! Google did not infomed me that my device is impacted.  I do not want to pay for any problems not caused by myself, but solely caused by Google. 

I would appreciate your asstance . I would like to get a working phone as soon as possbile. Germany Repair center do not want to help me. They say, I need to adress my issues to Google. They are forwarding me to the internet and there I cannot reach out to Google. There is a class action where the users could file a claim against Google, unfortunately only in the US.

USB-C jack headphones don't work during phone call,"Before few days ago, I was able to connect headphones/speakers through usb-c/jack adapter and make a phone call. My callers voice would be played via speaker, whereas my phone mic would capture my voice.

Recently, this stopped working. I am still able to listen to podcasts on the speakers, but once I make a call neither my caller hears me, neither I hear what he says. If I switch to internal phone speaker, then all works. The issue is problematic to me, as I used that setup in my car. Internal speaker is not loud enough to be comfortabily used while driving. 

This issue is reproducible also on a pixel 4 my friend has (so that's not my handset related). I also tried different usb-c/jack adapters (should not be adapter specific). Everytime we have the same problem. 

Additionally, I can make calls via Bluetooth headset (but can't use it while driving, as I wouldn't be able to hear the outside world at all).

I tried uninstalling updates to phone app and clearing it's data and cache. Got no improvements.

Проблема с Google Assistant,"Добрый день.

Не поможете разобраться с пооблемой Гугл-ассистента на телефоне Google Pixel 3a.

С недавних пор, примерно как месяц, после одного из обновлений при вызове ассистента при заблокированном экране фразой окей, гугл - он включается и тут же зависает. Якобы ждет моего запроса, но пиктограма, которая появляется вместо микрофона статично висит. После чего ассистент переходит в меню типовых запросов, думая, что я молчал.

При повторном вызове ассистента он нормально воспринимает речь и начинает поиск.

Пробовал делать сброс к заводским настройкам - проблема вернулась на следующий день.
При использовании active edge так же отрабатывает без ошибок.

Проблема наблюдается только при вызове ассистента фразой и только в момент, когда телефон заблокирован.


Так же, если вам это чем-то поможет, если запустить с заблокированного экрана ассистента, например через active edge и задать поисковой запрос, то ассистент пусть и отработает но первые 5-6 секунд не слышно, что он проговаривает. Звук включается через указанное время и, если ассистент выдает длинное предложение, ты слышишь его концовку.

Low Volume/Audio when connected via bluetooth,"Ever since the January 1, 2018 patch the volume on my phone is much lower than it previously was when the phone was new. Especially in my car I now have to crank the volume up about 80% to get the same audio output I was getting in Oct-Dec at 55-60%.

Also watching video or playing any audio out of the phone speakers is now substantially lower. I know Google created some kind of patch to lessen a ""vibration"" issue people claimed to have but the speakers within the phone have a much lesser output as well. This is disappointing.

And let me save you some time, no it's not network settings. It's not the connected device, yes the volume is up at 100% on the phone, yes certain settings have been reset, yes the phone has been tested in safe mode, etc...

"Pixel 3 XL not detecting any Wi-Fi networks, temporarily freezes when I try to turn Wi-Fi on.","Hello. My Pixel 3 XL is no longer able to detect any nearby networks when Wi-Fi is turned on. Usually, attempting to turn Wi-Fi on causes the Settings app to hang or crash. I can't think of any apps or downloads that might have caused this, and the problem persisted both in Safe Mode and through a factory reset.

I have heard that Android 11 has caused similar Wi-Fi issues in Pixels, so I'm guessing this is either a firmware or hardware problem.

Google Play Services Battery Usage,"Hello, my name is Eric and I have a Pixel 5 which I upgraded from a 3 XL and I am an advanced Android geeky user haha....I absolutely LOVE everything about it. My two biggest factors for upgrading to it are the battery of course, the RAM, and the 90 Hz refresh rate. I' not a HUGE gamer by any stretch of the imagination on my phone. I have a few 3rd party apps on my phone including Pandora, Slack (for work), and Tapatalk for Android Central forums. I have noticed that with my moderate to light usage on my phone, whenever I am checking the battery break-down usage for my battery per charge, Google Play Services in the ""show system apps"" part of the battery break-down is ALWAYS the top contender. Now, i would love for something to explain to me if this is normal or not. I mean for my 4,080 mAh battery, I am getting 1 1/2 on heavy usage  t 2 full days on my average moderate usage. However, EVERY Single full battery charge cycle Google Play Services along with Android Messages is at the top. Whenever I am not using my phone, idle time seems great; meaning that the phone is sipping battery power which is good. I am just worried that something might be wrong. I did boot my phone yesterday into Safe Mode in order to test out my OS, and it seemed to use battery a little less. I'm not sure if it's my Slack, or my Tapatalk app which could be using Google Play Services in the background. What' I've done for those two apps, is restrict background usage in the hokes of the Google Play Services battery drain being less. Is this a good idea, or is there something else I can be doing to help my phones battery out? Thank you very much for any support! I really appreciate it!",Battery and Power

Pixel II XL Bluetooth issues,"For the last 4 months, I have been having problems with my bluetooth connection from my Pixel II XL to my 2011 BMW 3 series.  I keep the operating system up to date and am currently on 9.  As odd as this sounds, I think that my phone corrupted my car's bluetooth system somehow in its two way communication.  My car first would drop the connection 10-30sec into playing a song with an unpleasant high pitch beep.  Then overnight, my car would forget all phones connected, including my wife's phone.  I had the car battery replaced, and had the whole communication system reprogrammed in the car.  But the issue was still there.  BMW is quoting $1,400 to replace the whole communication system;  but, I have a sneaky feeling that this will not fix the problem and that the phone has something to do with this.  As you can imagine, I do not want to spend $1,400 that I won't be able to get back, only to find out that there either is a problem with the phone or that the phone somehow corrupted the bluetooth in my car.

[Pixel 2 Android 9] No Backups Available after Factory Reset/New Phone,"Hello all,

I received a new phone via RMA. I backed up my old one and checked to see the backup was listed in Google Drive. When I was setting up the new phone, it said no backups found. I finished the set up and went to update the OS all the way. There were 2 or 3 updates and reboots. Did another factory reset and it still shows no backups. 

I remember back in the day iPhones wouldn't let you use an iCloud Backup restore file if the iOS version was dramatically different. But, it would still show the restore there, but it would be grayed out and actually say ""iOS version mismatch"". I assume the same is true for Android?

I placed the phone on the charger and it charged another 25 min approx and reached 100 percent again.  Another hard reboot, and the phone still showed 100%.  If I use the phone under heavy use after the hard reboot, my battery life is closer to 4 hours again.  However, it seems there is an App or a setting under Android 10 that is affecting both the battery life and the accuracy of the battery indicator, because after some use, the phone will return to it's previous behavior and require another hard reboot.

I have two Pixel XL phones and these issues only started after the upgrade to Android 10.  I also own a Nexus 6, still going strong and recently purchased a Pixel 4 XL.

I am hoping that Google is paying attention to these posts and provides a fix for their original Pixel customers instead of leaving them hanging with a final update to Android 10 with inherent battery issues.  Their loyal Pixel / Nexus customers don't deserve this issue to be ignored.",Battery and Power

"Pixel 3 XL LTE Connection keeps restarting (RMA'd Device, New one resolved issue)","I'm hoping someone has seen this and knows the solution.
I have a Pixel 3XL, bought Nov.`18. Unit has a case, never dropped outside, it's in immaculate condition.
A few weeks ago, I noticed the LTE Connection would restart every 8 to 12 seconds (going from LTE - LTE+, back to LTE)
I did a ton of things (restarted device, safe mode, Factory Reset with stock setup (no backup) and even did a Factory Image restore of Android 10 from September)
Nothing has resolved this issue. The case has been removed, a different SIM Card was purchased.
Even when changing the connection to 3G, it changes from HSPA - to 3G every 10-15 seconds. I've disabled VoLTE and even used the phone after factory image restore, with a new google account (to make sure no settings were copied over from previous install). Checked APN settings, all good there. I've had every PIXEL phone on my carrier (Rogers, in Toronto) without any issues like this.
Wifi calling is Off/ phone updated to December Android 10 Build.

Video of LTE Connection:
https://streamable.com/zsylg

At this point, I am thinking hardware.
Does anyone have any insight into why this would just start randomly in November? I see others have had this issue without a real solution.. If a full factory image restore (from September, Android 10 build) won't resolve the issue, it must be a hardware issue. Can this be escalated to Google Engineers? I have called Google Support, but they cannot help. This needs to be escalated through the proper channels somehow.

UPDATE:
Google sent me another device since mine was in warranty, and the new device works perfectly. So as I suspected, this is a hardware issue and Google needs to look into this because a lot of people are experiencing it.","Connectivity, Network, Bluetooth"

Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL cannot read Mifare Plus tag,"I have a NFC key in Mifare Plus type format.

Is this a limitation of Pixel 3/XL? Or it can be some problem else?

Pixel 3 eSim Error Message,"Hello friends, 

My year-old Pixel 3, successfully running in the past with an eSIM connected to Google Fi, popped up with a ""No SIM Card"" message five days ago. I show no Mobile Network available. Before chatting with a tech I tried everything from a restart in Safe Mode to a factory reset. I also tried the suggested advice found in this community to use the dialer (*#*#4636#*#*) to get to the Network Settings, but my choices on the Phone Information drop down menu differed from those cited by original poster Brandon Dendinger. I spent two hours chatting with a tech the first night of the problem, and we additionally ran through all the app permissions. I was then told my ticket would be escalated, and I should hear from a ""specialist"" in 72 hours. I'm now at 120 hours and no further along in resolving this problem. I have checked back in twice,  and each time I was told a specialist would get back to me ""at the earliest."" (Such a polite phrase from the playbook that says absolutely nothing.) I get the impression that after you have been ""escalated,"" no one else can touch the issue or offer other solutions. If anyone here has a suggestion or advice that I might have missed, I would be appreciative to hear from you.","Connectivity, Network, Bluetooth"

Awful Google Support Experience,"I got a Google Pixel 4XL on release day (Oct 2019).  It failed with the 50% battery issue in May of this year and was replaced.  So far, so good.

It's just failed again - same problem with the battery stuck at 50% and won't charge.  This time Google are telling me my 2 year warranty expired in a year.  They accept this is a problem, since Sunday it has been 'escalated to another team'.

They seem to be utterly secretive about what is going on.  Does anyone know of any processes or ways of communicating with Google support outside of the chat channel?

Or even how long these sort of incidents last?  I don;t have a spare handset - and no indication of what is going on, should I buy a cheap refurb to see me through, or will they sort this out tomorrow?
