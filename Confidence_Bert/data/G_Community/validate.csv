Android 10 update causes swipe-to-unlock issue,"Before the Android 10 update, you could easily flick your thumb up to reach the unlock screen. You needed to only swipe about 5-10% of the length of the screen, and could do it with one hand.

Since the update, it now requires a much longer swipe. I can get it on the first try every time, IF I SWIPE 20 or 30% OF THE SCREEN LENGTH OR MORE. It sometimes takes two hands to unlock the phone now, or some awkward contorting to try to cover that much in a single swipe, but always requires being cognizant of how long my swipe is. 

Basically, the update took something that was easy and user friendly and made it awkward and sometimes difficult. And being that the fingerprint scanner is so abysmal that it only works for a day or two after it's programmed, this swiping issue is a real problem.",Homescreen and Launcher

My Google Pixel 2 died and won't turn on,"My phone died earlier today when it was at two percent, so nothing out of the ordinary. I was using Instagram when it died if that would offer any help. I also got caught in the rain beforehand, so my phone was slightly wet, but not wet enough to damage anything, especially since it is marketed as waterproof. I plugged it in for about 5 minutes and went to turn it on but the battery sign kept flashing and turning into what seemed to be the loading bar after updating, but then flashed back to the battery sign. I eventually got it to turn on once, but it just turned back off/died again. This didn't stop til I held down the power button, but continued when I plugged it back in. Then I left it plugged in for over an hour, but this same thing happened when I held down the power button. However, this time it was accompanied by a red flashing light in the upper right corner.

Pixel 3XL Overnight Probems,"(Sorry long post) My Pixel 3xl magically stopped charging the other night. I woke up to my phone being at 12%.

I have started in Safe Mode and the battery was slipping but a little slower. 
Diagnosis says all apps are fine and nothing is draining my batter. When I restarted no apps were running other than Chrome and Google Messages. I don't download new apps often and the last one I downloaded was Zelle and have since removed it. 
Then add to that, Google Messages won't download pictures. I am updated to the last system update.

After the update, I still have the lag, but my battery is now AWEFUL. my phone battery is at 60% when I get to work now whereas before it would be in the 90s with the same usage. Last night I no joke watched my battery count down from 10% to 1% in under 20 seconds (being kind) when I was on the home screen and no apps running in the background, no joke it went as fast as the NASA rocket launch countdown because that was the voice I was imitating in my head lol and I just looked up the audio of it and its dead on with the battery dropping... I have noticed it in the past where I would see that I have 17% battery, and two minutes later I am running to put my phone on life support because its on 1%, just last night was the first time I saw it dropping.  Like I said in the question, no new apps were downloaded, only the update to Android 11. I say that because I looked at battery help on the Google website and it said to check any new app's battery usage in settings. I also looked at the warranty page and I am out of warranty, has anyone else experienced this problem and is there anything I can do?",Battery and Power

Does Google Sell a Pixel that is Unlocked outside of an account?,"I stumbled across an issue today, where our Internet service was interrupted,  when my new Pixel came to the house!  Without Internet service, I can't set up my Google Pixel Replacement, so this is feedback related to the product, for a broad portion of people in the USA, who have no WIFI & Internet service is to expensive!  I have consistently been using mobile computers for media content creation, using hot spots, home wifi, without a data plan, which they can be really expensive!  Can Google make a stand alone Pixel, where we don't need to be signed in to an account, yet we can still used the mobile computer! I've used Samsung before, & I would be able to turn on a Samsung Galaxy immediately, & use it without signing in to an account!  I started panicing a bit, thinking 5 G meant taking away our cable & all we would have is WIFI service, & then I would not be able to use my Google Pixel at all!!   If I had no Google Account, previous to receiving my Google Pixel, I can't use it anyway for pictures, video, journaling & note taking!  Can Google make a Google Single Pixel,  which means the computer can be used, without an account & you don't need to be signed in to someone else's account to use the Google Single Pixel!? You just turn it on & use it, then sign in to your Google Account if you have one!   

Ideally, I still wish we had free internet so everyone can use the Internet due to the folks on fixed incomes as they age!   On a fixed income, how do retired seniors, & US Military Veterans get their pay, & social security benefits, without  Internet Service in rural parts of the country & the price of inflated internet service, with monetary growth in mind for wall street profits, yet retired folks, millennials, veterans pay are on a fixed income & won't be able to keep up with inflated Internet Service!  

Another concern I have is, without Internet service, I would not be able to detach the Google Pixel 3a I am returning to Google, from my Google Account!  Currently I won't add any banking for this reason due to the security risks of a 3rd party accessing my financial account by law enforcement taking mobile computers!   I keep revisiting in my mind, when I was arrested,  & the local law enforcement had full access to my Google Account including Google Adsense & my Banking & all my passwords to other accounts! While I was in jail, I had no way to shut off my mobile computer from my Google Account! My husband said that should teach what not to write, & it serves me right!  He said he don't care about the First Amendment when what I say brings the police around!  He approves of violating the first amendment using censorship, because he is using it as a control mechanism to gas light, to yell & scream in a man baby fit of rage!   He threw me under the bus, & has threatened divorce, several times since I was arrested, after I used my youtube revenue to help pay for the house, when times were really good! When the police got a search warrant & my husband would not stand up for me, & defend my first amendment, & he told the police to keep me, the police then had my banking information, & youtube pay information!  HE even broke a new computer 2 weeks later, because I had to buy a new computer, not having a computer, over a video I made about discrimination in advertising!  The last time he threatened to break my computer equipment was about 4-6 weeks ago, when he was raging! Maybe its the medications or his medical issues, I don't know but he is over medicated & I have no help for him!  I have no place to share feedback, where I feel safe, away from, ""SPOUSE RETALIATION"", over how I feel!   For 14+ months, they have had my computer equipment,  confiscated for an on going investigation!  Funny how that works, when I was being carefree, thought I has a real relationship, but I see things a lot different now!  Why would I help pay for a house, if I knew 16 years ago, all he thought of our relationship is me as a throwaway renter, serving some sick twisted agenda of his, which he kept hidden!  How can someone you thought cared about you, disassociate so swiftly, due to his own discomfort, using it as control in a relationship?  

Thank you to those who have shown me something different, & empowered my life education to my 2nd marriage because it was not at all what I thought!  If I would have know this, I would have put the $366,000+ I earned on youtube in to the bank, instead of buying the house in a fema flood zone & paying off vehicles! Hindsight is 20/20!  That way I could have quietly left, which is what he has told me to do on several occasions!  I am just at a point of indifference towards marriage & indentured servitude thru marriage, which violates the 13th amendment, & is slavery!","Connectivity, Network, Bluetooth"

Pixel 3XL Camera Taking Blurry Photos,"I have the Pixel 3XL mobile phone, and everything was fine with it until a few months earlier. All of a sudden, my rear camera started to take blurry photos (for the distance above of 5-8cm).
I have contacted to Made By Google team, and was requested to clear the cache, update the camera app, install a new app and even a factory reset. I have followed all the steps, and the issue remained. 
I have requested from team to direct me to a repair shop, but they told me that I can't get a coverage as I am currently a resident in UAE. This is a super annoying situation, as I have paid more than 800 EUR for a phone and can't take photos, and even can't get it fixed. Below was the latest message I got from the support team, and then they have stopped responding my messages. I just don't know what to do with a super expensive and malfunctioning device in hand. Super annoyed and sad. And a very bad customer experience for Google.

My Pixel 2xl won't charge after June update,"Good morning Community!

After the June update, my Pixel 2xl experienced charging issues: even if plugged in it won't charge. I was able to back up all my data until in reached 1% and shut down. Now, when i try to turn it on, it won't as not enough battery.

What can i do? Is there an email address to contact Google directly (phone and chat options are not available). I could also mail it for repair, but what is the address, as I cannot find the prepaid label anymore.

Pixel 4 - Using App-Specific Notification Sounds,"Ran into a bit of a head scratcher.

In My Sounds, it shows a list of app notification sounds; Facebook Pop, Hangouts Message, Slack - Boing, Slack - Ding, etc. 

However, this is the same list regardless of what app I'm in. For example, in my previous phone, the Duo Mobile (2FA) app had its own notification sound. In the Pixel 4, I don't seem to be able to access this sound anymore. Duo Mobile uses the Default Notification tone instead. 

Going into the app's settings to notifications just takes me to the system's settings screen, and the Duo Mobile sound isn't listed in any of the categories, and tapping on the ""+"" doesn't give access to it either.

Weird charge/discharge issues over last 72 hours (P3XL),"I noticed it about three days ago when I was streaming audio to a bluetooth speaker: after about an hour, the battery went from 70% down to 50%.  After eight hours of it sitting on the nightstand, the battery went from 40% to 19%.  Plugged it into the OEM charger and it went from 19% to 80% in about six minutes.  Finding that highly odd, I rebooted the phone and removed it from the charger.  

A day of minimal use dropped to about 50%.  Now here's where the concerning part started.  Hopped in the car, started a bluetooth audio to the car, and brought up google maps.  The battery went from 49% to dead within five minutes.  I saw the ""your phone will run out of battery soon"" pop up on the screen and tick from 7% to 6% to dead within 30 seconds.  Plugged it into the OEM charger with the phone off and watched it go from 0% to 83% within five minutes.

Same scenario for this past evening: went to bed with about an 80% charge, woke up to 41% charge.  Scrolled over to the google feed to check news and watched it drop almost instantaneously to 17%.  Saw an article about Stadia, clicked into it, and got the battery warning pop up, watched it drop from 11% to zero in a matter of seconds.

I've reset the phone multiple times.  High battery drain is happening no matter what condition: wifi on/off, bluetooth on/off, location services, airplane mode, etc.

On the latest software version, no new apps installed, only app updates since I started noticing the issue.  Factory reset the phone and it has to remain on the charger cause pulling updates (apps) drains the battery just sitting there.

I have been using Accubattery Pro to ""condition"" the battery (keeping it between 20% and 80%) for about a month now, which is when I started noticing some battery issues.  I was really hoping this thing would last till the P5 came out, but now I'm stuck using my old Droid Turbo...man how technology has changed.

Any advice to see what is causing the issue would be greatly appreciated!

Google Pixel (all models) Have Very Bad Car Bluetooth Interactivity.,"So for quite some time now I've noticed that every car I've driven has never offered me the full range of music playing options on the infotainment screens in the cars. At first, I thought that maybe it was just the cars I was driving at the time not being too great with Bluetooth on Android devices (iPhones seemed to always have this feature in my cars and it made me jealous of my friends a little from time to time). 

However, 3-4 cars down the line I find myself still stuck with this problem of only having the options of ""Next Song"", ""Previous Song"", ""Pause / Play"", and that's it. I thought the problem would then be that I was using Spotify instead of the phone's built-in music players; so I have switched from Spotify to Google Play Music as I currently use a Pixel 2 XL. This also hasn't fixed the issue though as I am still only given the same options. 

But when two of my friends got in my car I let them connect their phones to cars to play music and oddly enough, they had a lot more features than I ever have with any of my Google phones. Both of my friends were able to shuffle, repeat, browse playlist and queue, and also select other playlists entirely. Those friends have a Samsung and an iPhone, meaning both Android and Apple devices are capable of the technology. It just seems that while I am very impressed with my Google phone so far, they are also very basic in terms of quality of life aspects. 

I'm here to ask if anyone knows any workarounds or ways to improve the features that a Pixel gives off as a media player when connected through Bluetooth? 

Cheers.","Connectivity, Network, Bluetooth"

Many posts about Pixel phone power button issues - not working consistently or 1-click camera launch,"I am surprised how many posts (Google Support forums, Reddit, tech sites) I found online with the same problem and it doesn't seem like Google got the issue resolved.

I have a Pixel 2 XL that started having this issue maybe a year ago. The main issue is that the power button does not power the screen off most of the time. I have to click it 5-10 times before it accepts the click. And sometimes as I do that, the camera app launches with a single click. 

I looked this issue up back then and there weren't many complaints so I decided it to accept it. Now there are tons of others having the issue. 

Another thing started happening a few months ago. I would be on a call with the phone near my ear and I need to look at something on the phone (usually email or a map). So I move the phone away from my ear and the screen remains pitch black. Clicking the power button doesn't turn the screen on. This issue persists until the other person hangs up. Sometimes if they don't hang up, I have to reboot with a long press.

The phone getting stuck in screen-off mode happens so often now, I usually end up rebooting the phone every other day. The reboots don't fix the inconsistent power button. These phone sometimes behaves normally and sometimes the power button feels like it's asleep. I also think the lack of responsiveness increases after watching a YouTube video. It's almost impossible to turn the phone off right after closing YouTube.

That and the launching of the camera app with a single click make me feel like I'm using a junk phone not a high end phone. I LOVE Android but these issues (I've had other hardware issues with previous Google phones... this is my 4th) make me strongly and I say this VERY sadly but strongly consider another maker for my next phone. I am one of few people in my company that use a Google phone. Everyone else uses an iPhone or a Samsung. I usually brag to them about the power of Android and how my Pixel gives me the vanilla experience. Google got too many chances and I feel this is it for my Google phone buying streak. UNLESS they make it right. Not sure if this is the right forum to request support directly from Google or not. The ""Contact Us"" option was for chat. I don't feel like typing back and forth for hours.

Getting 5G working internationally,"So, I know there's a compatibility list of a dozen or so territories that have official support for 5G.

My question is if there is any way to connect to 5G in the rest of the world without root. I've been told that it's relatively simple with root to connect to 5G networks where I currently live in Hong Kong, but I would prefer it if it was just an option in settings. 

Other phones from other manufacturers have far wider 5G support, and it's disheartening that Google might never choose to give us the option to try to connect to a network outside of their select list.

Fortunately the phone still has LTE support internationally. Imagine if that had been blocked too 😂

Pixel 3a diverts to voicemail. Seems invisibly stuck on Do not Disturb.,"I would really appreciate some help:

am a foster carer and must not miss calls.
I have worked for a few weeks to sort this out.

I have changed SIM (on the old phone).  Google then kindly switched the phone.
Problem repeated itself.

Do not Disturb is not (officially) on.

I have tested the phone by phoning from a selection of other phones. None of the numbers are set to Divert to Voicemail. First call from each number goes to voicemail (If they leave message I get a notification). If they do not leave a message I have no idea they have called.

I have gone into phone app, clicked 3 dots, gone to calls and calling accounts and ensure ""receiving incoming calls"" is on.

I wonder if an error was backing up to the replacement phone  (thus potentially introducing the error back to this new/refurbished phone?).

I only have three Blocked numbers on the phone. none are the ones I was calling from (to test it).

My call forwarding options are showing as follows:
always forward: off
fwd to voicemail when.....busy, unanswered, unreachable. 

This morning I did a reset of network & app settings . There was no visible benefit to doing this. 

My wife uses the same network as me (albeit on an apple phoen0 and has no reception issues).

The original Pixel3a worked perfectly for about 9 months before suddenly ""getting invisibly stuck on Do not Disturb""). This replacement only arrived a couple of days ago but has same problem. 

One suggestion I have read on another forum (another user had similar problem) is that maybe a third party app is causing the problem. But where would I start tracking this down?

My next action was going to be to launch in Safe mode to see if that allows phone to ring. (is this a logical test?)

"VoWiFi, 5G and overall support for markets that actually care for Pixel 5.","Hi. I had to sell my Pixel 5 due to not working VoWiFi in Poland. 

I know - altough i don't understand why - Pixels are too ""exclusive"" to reach certain markets. In central and eastern Europe there are lots of customers who would really love to have a top camera clean android phone for a price lower than Apple or Samsung has. In my opinion Pixels would sell better in developing countries rather than in countries dominated by Apple or Samsung. I think that Google's policy when it comes to phones is not prioritized to sell phones and make profit.

Anyway, is there a chance that modern or future Pixels will get a support for 5G / VoWiFi / VoLTE for network operators outside Germany, France and UK? I can import the Pixel from Germany on my own, but it's useless for me as long as it doesnt at least have working Wi-Fi calling and I can't make it work on my own.

"Blurry photos using ""Far"" Focus mode in Night Sight","In Night Signt, with focus set on ""Far"", pictures will be consistently blurry: instead of being correctly focused on far items, the camera will be correctly focused for objects at a 1 meter distance approximately.

This brings the main problem: when in astrophotography mode, it is very hard to correctly focus on the sky using autofocus, intuitively I would lock the focus to ""far"": this however makes all photos consistently blurry as the focus is not being correctly applied, by the app, to infinity.
Some pictures for example:

Taken with Night Sight + focus set to ""far""


Taken with Night Sight + focus set to ""auto""

Left: Taken with Night Sight with Astrophotography + focus set to ""far"" (on a tripod)
Right: Taken with Night Sight with Astrophotography + focus set to ""auto"" (on a tripod)



This seems to be a software issue with the camera (it assumes it is focused to far when set to ""far"" while it is not. How should I do to fix this problem?",Camera

I still use voice search as an accessibility feature so disabling the voice permission is absolutely not a valid solution.  

Will this/can this be fixed? Just give us a 'remember this option'.",Google Assistant and Voice Actions
How to get your pixel 3 to display notifications on gear fit 2,"So I recently upgraded from a galaxy note 5 to a Google Pixel 3 and connected my Gear fit 2 to the pixel 3 seemingly with no issue.
However when I get notifications on my pixel 3 the Gear fit 2 does not display them despite both the phone and the gear fit 2 having ""show notifications"" turned on. How do I fix this so that my gear fit 2 isn't Just a glorified watch??

Speakerphone issue when using bluetooth watch,"I have a Pixel 5 now, but this issue also occurred with my previous Pixel 3, and possibly the Pixel 1, though I never investigated it more thoroughly.

When my phone is bluetooth paired with my Samsung Gear S3 watch, and I make or receive a Duo video call, the bottom speaker won't activate despite the icon being appropriately highlighted on the screen.  The call's sound comes out through the upper speaker at a normal phone call level, obviously not loud enough for talking over video chat.

The problem is remedied by turning off bluetooth, even mid chat. Once bluetooth is off, the bottom speaker immediately turns on, usually with the volume set very low and needing to be turned up.

I suspect there is an internal issue with identifying what speaker should be playing, because in regular phone calls the UI allows for a three-way selection of sound source: 1) Phone 2) Speakerphone 3) Bluetooth (watch); however in video calls there is only an off/on button for the speakerphone.

I searched forums for anyone else experiencing this issue but did not identify it. Though I suspect this may just be because of the difficulty of describing the issue in a succinct enough manner to find the appropriate search keywords.

It is mostly just an annoyance as I can fix it as needed, but any solution would be appreciated, thanks.","Contacts, Calls, Voicemail"

"Bluetooth repeatedly disconnecting from Fossil smartwatch, won't reconnect without reboot","Hi,
I recently bought a new smartwatch, a Fossil Hybrid Collider. I'm having problems with it repeatedly disconnecting. At least once a day, I notice that the widgets are not updating and notifications aren't being received. When I open the Fossil app, the phone is disconnected. When I try to connect, I get a failure message. Under Bluetooth settings, I can see the watch, but can't connect to it there either.

Then the really strange behavior begins: I can toggle Bluetooth off system-wide, but then I'm unable to turn it back on. It simply doesn't respond at all.

The only way to reactivate Bluetooth and reconnect the watch is by rebooting my phone.

Following recommendations online, I've disabled battery optimization for the Fossil app and Bluetooth, but the problem persists. I found a Reddit thread indicating that this is an issue with the Pixel's Android 10 update, specifically the Bluetooth LE stack, and allegedly the developers told users that they have no plans to address the problem.

The phone has also become very unstable due to repeated reboots to try and get calls to work and battery life has gone down. I have gone through all the standard self-care steps ( Safe mode/ factory reset/ updates etc)

I have called google support and sent to B2X service factory Mumbai, India. The service center informed me that the motherboard would need to be replaced as a result of a paid diagnostic. This problem occurs very frequently, with almost all the pixels when i asked a local service center.

In my own research on the google forum it seems several people are facing this issue, with a significant number from India who seem to have no recourse but to pay for a replacement. The consensus seems to be this is a hardware issue not a software problem and that it is related to problems in manufacturing most likely (https://www.greenbot.com/article/3179145/android/google-responds-to-pixel-microphone-issues-with-official-replacement-program.html)

I see a progress circle in the bottom left then the camera app closes and photos opens, the new picture is not there.  I reopen the camera and the camera roll is grey with no pictures.

Videos work fine with MP4 format, videos actually show fine in the camera roll

I have cleared the cache in both Photos and Camera, I have booted in Safe mode, same issue.

I have factory reset my phone.  After this and before restoring from a backup I tested one picture.  I was able to see the picture in the camera roll and clicked it to open and it showed fine.  I did not test photos as it needed to be set up yet.  

I restored from a backup before the reset, the issue returned

The camera folder is not showing up as selected in the backup folders but I don't think this matters because the camera folder is the default and is backed up by default.  

Permissions are showing fully allowed for each app.  However, if I go to Permission Manager/Additional Permissions I see access Google Photos and 0 of 0 apps allowed.  I am unable to select any apps to allow this.  
 Any help is appreciated.
Thanks,

Not all apps transferred when updating from Pixel to Pixel 5,"hi - can you help/have you experienced something similar?
I recently bought new Pixel 5 and followed instructions to transfer data and apps from my old Pixel 2. 
I used the transfer cable.
Some, but not all, of the apps came across.
There are a large number still not come across - like 30+. Which is too many to reload manually.
I've updated phone software, all apps were bought from Google Play Store.

Adding to the Android 10/Pixel woes. Pixel 3XL drained a 14-hour Mophie in 3 hours,"I'm experiencing the same battery problems that are being reported far and wide. I've gone as far as performing the factory reset and spent half the day getting my apps reconfigured. It worked for a while but the battery drain issue came back.

Yesterday I had a Mophie mobile charger with me to try and make it through the day. The Mophie is rated at 14 hours. The Pixel 3 XL drained the Mophie dead in 3 hours.

Photos in camera roll just disappeared,"Yesterday I tried taking a video and got a notification that I didn't have enough storage. I started deleting photos but made sure to only delete some that were already backed up (my back up is turned on automatically). After deleting 20-30, I tried deleting more and it said it could not delete them. I went to check my phone storage, and it said the total phone was only at 73%, so something happened to the 27% that was there when I was trying to take the video. I had guessed that I somehow accidentally selected to ""Free Up Space"", which from my understanding would only have removed photos that were already backed up, so I wasn't worried about it. Later that night I looked at my photos, and all of the photos I had taken that day said ""Not backed up. Too big or unknown type"" (which didn't make sense because one photo had that message, but the next photo that I had taken 5 minutes later didn't). I searched the internet and someone suggested to clear the cache, and confirmed this would do nothing to harm any photos. I did that and then went back to my ""camera"" album and only the first 32 photos appeared, and the rest were grey squares. If I went to ""photos"", it appears that all of the pictures that are saved to my device won't appear, but any photos that aren't, appeared correctly.  In ""camera"" when I clicked on a photo that isn't displaying, it just gave me a black screen. If I tried editing the photo it said ""unable to edit, check your connection"". I was connected to both wifi and data so that shouldn't be an issue. If I tried to share the photo, it just gave me a white screen. 

I decided to try restarting my phone because presumably that fixes everything, but then ALL of my photos, except for those first 32 were gone from my camera album. The ones that weren't backed up because they were ""too big or unknown type"" (even though my camera was the one that took them) were completely gone. 

I'm guessing there's nothing I can do and that those pictures are just gone forever? Any one have any ideas at all of what happened or anything I could do to get those pictures back?",Camera

How can I keep the volume setting when I listen to audible book and music.,"Dear all,

I have a problem with my Pixel 3XL(till latest update). It sometimes happen not to keep the volume setting when I play contents by Audible app or Google Play Music. It's usually getting small that seems to be threshold for controlling the volume. It's happened since last year. At the first time, I got the issue was that the volume was getting small by degree. But, After feedback, The volume sudden small. I don't remember it's after updating Android or not. 

If Google controls the volume automatically, It's no mean to handle our volume setting without owner's setting. It's troublesome for us. Also, I don't want to be asked by a message to control the volume by Google. 

I've been having problems when I use Google cloud services and products. Also after feedback, I will get strange issues and that a one of them is mentioned above. 

If Google give us a choice for controlling our Android by ourself, We will be happy more. Especially when we listen to the AUDIBLE BOOK and face the matter, What we will get from the matter into the brain? It will kill our concentration at least. 

There is no pattern. But, It will occur again within several days.

I'd like to thank Google for making Call Screen available to Canadian customers. Some minor issues,"Is the feature available on the Pixel 4?  Nice job on Visual Voicemail also.  It should respond with the party you are trying to reach and not the word THEY when I press the ""I'll call you back later"" button.  It also seems to be missing the canned response 'take me off your calling list' and 'is this urgent?'. Is it possible for users to respond with a dynamic custom response?  That would be a nice future enhancement.  Can call screen automatically take the call if inbound caller identification is absent and ask the calling party to identify themselves verbally?  This could apply in the absence of calling name delivery if the calling party's nyx-nnx-xxxx (now npa-nxx-xxxx) is not in the contact list of the recipient or the name was not transmitted by the telco, or was not retrievable through a tcap dip.  I have received spoofed calls using illegal numbers and this can be baked into the logic ... for example ... no area code can have a 9 as a middle digit; no area code can start with a 1 or 0; if an area code has a 1 in the middle digit (n1x) the third digit (x) cannot be a 1; no central office code (the 4th 5th and 6th digit) can be 1xx or x11 or 0xx.  And you will not see telephone numbers such as 416-416-xxxx (were the area code and central office code are identical), or in NYC for example you would never see 212-718-xxxx because 212 is the area code for Manhattan and 718 is the area code for Brooklyn.  n=2-9 x=0-9.  Hope this info helps.  I don't know if ANI delivery still exists but it can be a way of determining if the call is spoofed, but the logic there is kind of fuzzy.  Automatic Nmber Identification and Caller Identification are two different things. ANI is the billing caller ID ... for example a company's ANI and main switchboard number could be (416) UNiversity 2 - 2000 (416-862-2000) but for direct inward dial the PBX would be programmed to transmit 416-862-2134 so that dialable directory number delivery and reverse translation would work.  Note that the first six digits in most cases will be identical.  The cellular industry, and regulatory authorities CRTC and FCC have certainly done a fine job messing up everything that was previously sophisticated ... from a telecommunications standpoint.  There's no way for Google to send a call to the bit bucket unless its servers act as a proxy.  It would also be interesting if the Google phone app could be enhanced to recognize alphabetic mnemonics as they previously existed eons ago.

Poor and degrading battery life on original Google Pixel.,"First off, the battery used to be great. But over the past few months, the battery has degraded rather quickly and now won't last more than a few hours. The battery will last for about 2 hours of screen time, and around 4 if it is asleep.

A brand new Pixel 3a is NOT TURNING ON AT ALL,"I just received my Pixel 3a. As soon as I unboxed it, I tried to turn the phone on. However, there was no response at all. I then figured out that the battery was not charged at all. (it was weird as usually even a brand new phone has its battery charged when shipped.) So, I did charge it with the charger that came with it. After about 20% of battery charged, I was able to turn it on. Then, took a couple of picture to test the portrait modes. Then, I turned it off, and tried to let it fully charged. As it gets charged up to around 80%, the phone just stopped showing the battery status on the screen. The most importantly, It is not turning on at all! No responsive at all now.

I tried this document. (https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/7167687?hl=en-GB)
- Long press-and-hold power button more than 30 sec.
- Press both power and volume down button for more than 20 sec.

cleaning charging port (although my case has a charge port cover and it was clean)

*HEALTH HAZARD* Google Pixel 3a Bluetooth headset volume increases to maximum upon screen unlock.,"Since I first began using my Google Pixel 3a, upon turning on my headphones, the volume switches to maximum and nearly blows out my eardrums if I'm not prepared to turn down the volume before I play music. This happens about half the time. When I'm playing music at a low volume through my Bluetooth headset and I unlock my device, the volume again switches to maximum and nearly blows out my eardrums. This happens most of the time when I unlock my device with my headset on.

This is not influenced by other apps open on the device, as it still occurs when all other apps are closed. It still occurs when the device is started in safe mode. From what others have said, it still occurs with other Bluetooth headsets and others/myself have demonstrated that this does not occur using the same headset on other devices. This is absolutely an issue with the Google Pixel 3a and probably the 3 and 3XL as well.

A temporary fix would be nice (for my safety and the safety of others), but there really should be a permanent update to address this issue. Google has been made aware of this issue in the past and I'm really concerned about Google's neglect to take action on this. Its only a matter of time before somebody files a lawsuit for permanent hearing damage.","Connectivity, Network, Bluetooth"

Battery drained in minutes. Not Charging.,"I had experienced a weird behavior with my Pixel2 phone. When am using the Pixel2 phone, within 2-5 minutes, the battery started draining from 20% to 0% instantly. To my surprise, I could see the drainage very fast within minutes. 
I tried to charge, ofcourse with original charger, but the device is not charging. 
As mentioned in these forums, I tried to charge the device for an hour and pressed Power button & volume down button to restart. But it didn't switched On at all.

I had charged for 4 hours and tried the above approach. It vibrated once and the red light was constant. It blinked for 3 times and it was constant most of the times. After 4 hours of charging, I don't see the red light at all. 

Later I tried to change the charger to see if the issue is with charger and charged for 5 hours. The issue is still the same.

One thing happened good to me is that the device is still under warranty, bought in Dec-2017 and Google gave 2 years of Warranty. When discussed with tech support, they raised a pick up request, and it's 3 days there is no update on the device. The device is still with courier and is in transit. Hoping the best that Google would repair or replace the device so that I can continue to use the device for some more month.

Last time it happened the same with Nexus, Pixel devices that the MotherBoard crashed on the next day of the warranty expiration., and I ended up spending thousands of rupees for Motherboard replacement. 
Wish Google would help me in this aspect and not let me to spend thousands again and again.",Battery and Power

How to disable developer-hubris features and unwanted behaviour,"Started out just looking for a way to make sure volume buttons on the phone only control media volume instead of constantly but not consistently muting notifications.

Google help pages describe this glitch/bug/issue but without a suggested solution:
""When you press a volume button, the volume that changes depends on what you're doing. For example, if you're watching a movie, the movie volume changes. If you press your volume buttons when you're not listening to anything, your media volume changes.""

Besides the obvious mistake that movie volume and media volume are the same thing... 🤦🏼
It seems to be saying there is a glitch that causes the OS to exhibit unwanted behaviours in the form of ""developer-hubris"" features that try to guess what I want the device to do instead of what I was telling it to do.

Any way to disable this unwanted-behaviour-generating algorithm?

Usb C pixel buds not working after initial setup.,"After factory resetting my phone it usually allows me to setup my pixel buds once. After doing so it would never detect my pixel buds or any usb c audio.

Pixel 3 camera slow to start / shooting lag,"I love my Pixel 1 and I'm considering an upgrade to the Pixel 3.
The camera performance is the most important aspect I'm looking at, so I want to make sure I'm not making the wrong move here. I read in a number of different forums that the Pixel 3 camera app sometimes takes a few seconds to start, which will often make you miss a shot involving  kids moving rapidly. Another issue I've read about is that once you tap the ""shoot"" button, the actual shot is not instantaneous, but it happens a few hundreds milliseconds later. Again, when you have a moving kid, a ~200ms lag can too much.
Has anyone here experienced these issues? Would you recommend the Pixel 3 to someone who has such strict performance requirements for the camera app?

Can call blocking be improved?,"I've got both 'Caller id and Spam,' and 'Filter Spam calls' boxes checked in my phone setting and they appear to work. But they only appear to work on numbers that are ""known"" as incoming spam numbers. Makes sense. But seeing as how spammers change their numbers all day every day, I keep getting about 5-7 calls per day that are not known by Google's filters as spam. Meaning, I have to check my phone, and block these numbers every single day. Get's pretty old, pretty fast. And there's no end to how many phone numbers the ""social security scam"" business possesses, in case you haven't noticed. lol. My question is, why isn't there a simple feature within this wonderful built in spam filter to only accept calls from my contact list? Meaning, ""block ALL BUT my contacts."" This way, if it's someone I don't know, they can simply leave a message and I'll click ""add to contacts"" and all is well. It'd keep me from having to listen to my phone ring several times a day with numbers I already know are spam. And yes, I know I can use a call blocking app to do this, and I did just that with my Samsung Galaxy phone, but in my experience, using a third party call blocking app that lays over your phone just slows everything down and often interferes with other apps, I found. The spam features are a big reason for me switching to Pixel 3XL. And I don't mind being a part of the community that ""fights spam"" but I'd rather not have to report every single call that comes in on my phone.

Front-facing camera: blurry and terrible static noise,"Very often, when my front-facing camera on my Pixel 3 is activated, the camera both: goes terribly blurry (like static on a TV) and there is a horrible static noise that is very audible and very annoying. Essentially the front-facing camera is completely unusable while this is occurring.

Eventually, if I hit the flip camera icon enough times, it stops. But it will trigger again randomly.

This has been written about in numerous other places with no clear solution. It is something that seems to be a software issue, not a hardware issue.

It happened randomly ~4 months ago. I wasn't using the front-facing camera much then (pre-coronavirus), so I didn't make a big deal of it.

I've tried other solutions written about on other threads and Reddit, including clearing my camera's cache (in storage), deleting my phone's voice match for Google Assistant (which I now have off), removed Google Home entirely, etc.

Any other troubleshooting tips for this? Help would be infinitely appreciated; this issue is horribly annoying and is a daily problem now.

I won't be clearing my entire storage (too annoying). But one thing that's interesting is that I did boot my phone in safe mode and this still happened.

So I'm wondering if it's some sort of Android / Pixel software setting I can roll back - rather than an app causing a problem.

Used phone cleaner to reduce files just in case that might help. I tried switching styles within the app (camera, portrait) & no improvement. Have not downloaded any new apps.

pixel 5 camera image quality. HDR and sensor reflection,"Good day,
I use my pixel devices for all my photography on social media and work. I loved my Pixel 3 and thought to upgrade to the Pixel 5 for the wide angle back camera. I purchased a pixel 5 a few months back and right away I noticed two main issues with the Pixel 5's images. 
1) The HDR bracketing is really bad and not even very noticeable when compared to the Pixel 3 
2) When editing photos (raw or jpeg) and you adjust contrast, darkness or exposure you can start to see a grid pattern in the image. This is really evident when increasing the HDR in a third party app like Snapseed. 

Note: this issue is present using both the wide angle and regular lens

For the past 2-3 months or so, whenever i leave the house or work (anywhere really where i've been on wifi for a prolonged time), my pixel 3 seems to have issues automatically connecting to regular t-mobile mobile data. it still shows as connected but as soon as i try to actually use any app like spotify or instagram or do a search it either just keeps spinning or says ""no network available"". 

Everything seems to work just fine as soon as i do a restart (and luckily that doesn't take too long) but it's still pretty damn annoying to have to do that ... every ... time.

curious if anyone has had the same issues and if there's a solution to it? didn't have this issue when i first got my phone so i would assume it's an issue from a software update maybe?

appreciate the help!","Connectivity, Network, Bluetooth"

DND not only suppresses ringing it also makes it impossible to answer phone.,"When I have DND on it's impossible to answer the phone - meaning I can not see a way to do it.  If DND is on then of course I do not want the phone to ring.  But I can't even see that someone is calling me.  In fact I only know that there is a call because my Chrome browser tells me.  (That might happen because I use Project Fi)  So today I was in a Zoom mtg so of course I turned on DND.  But then I couldn't answer an important call that I would like to have taken.  Since DND is under ""Sound"" it doesn't seem logical to me that I don't even see that someone is calling me.  I'd sure like to see this fixed.","Contacts, Calls, Voicemail"

VOLTE don't work on Greece (Cosmote).,"VOLTE does not work on Greece (also in another countries) because it's locked by Google.

Why Google has locked the option for VOLTE? 

Any other brand working fine. I have contact with my carrier and of course they said that they done everything they can to enable this option but it is locked by Google because Google pixel phones has enabled this option only for known carriers. Why is that?

Please don't tell me that is carrier (Cosmote) problem because this is not the case. This is a known issue that is going on from a long time and many users has mentioned it in forums but we don't have an official answer. 

Please unlock the future with an update. It's up to Google!

Without VOLTE call drops to 3G, you cannot use the internet also you don't have HD call. The carriers will soon stop using 3G so then we will have serious problems.

As far as I know the problem will continue with 5G voice calls at the future if Google do not enable this option too like he did with 4G voice call (VOLTE).

Please help us, we are so many users of pixel phones that we don't live in US and we like to have VOLTE and Wi-Fi calling to our phones.

"Pixel 2 XL Android 10 networking continues to malfunction. Bluetooth, LTE, Wifi all are unreliable","Since the Android 10 update, my Pixel 2XL has had continuous problems with ALL its network connections staying reliable, persistent, connected, and actually working.  Symptoms are consistently inconsistent, and its become super annoying.  US based on Verizon.

First on basic phone calls, the relationship between 4G/LTE and Wifi calling is pretty broken.  If making a phone call, when there's what appears to be a somewhat weak 4G signal, but a strong Wifi signal, calls will not go through.  The calling process either hangs or times out.  It can take several retries to get connected.  Android's phone subsystem cannot differentiate between bad 4G and good Wifi.  It gets confused.

Next, if indeed a call connects, the handoff from 4G to Wifi causes a 3-10 second blackout, where either side cannot hear each other, causing people to hang up on the far end.  It can take several tries to just get the call connected and both parties speaking.

Similarly, when trying to use basic broadband data services (ie, downloading a file or podcast as an example), the phone gets confused as well.  If both 4G and Wifi are strong, downloads of say a podcast, may take 10-15 minutes.  If I shut off either 4G OR Wifi, the download happens in seconds.  Again, Android 10 cannot handle 4G/Wifi selection correctly.  It simply gets confused and stalls everything.  

Now, on to Bluetooth, which also misbehaves consistently when either 4G or Wifi state changes.  Bluetooth as an example, will disconnect when the LTE modem throttles between 4G and 3G, or when an cellular signal cuts out completely in a rural area.  The same is true for Bluetooth audio.  Bluetooth audio (like a podcast or music) will simply STOP playing, when the LTE modem is modulating between 4G, 3G or no signal.   When driving in a rural area as an example, and cellular signal is choppy, Bluetooth consistently disconnects, stalls, or simply hangs.

While I like the phone in general, it was a much more reliable networked experience under previous Android versions.  I imagine its a set of poorly tested code blocks that control the Snapdragon 835's networking stack, and that handoff routines are clearly broken.   No idea if its drivers or something else, but basically networked reliability is terrible.  

Its clearly an Android code problem.  The Snapdragon 835 uses a combined MAC for all networking layers AFAIK (definitely LTE and Wifi do).","Connectivity, Network, Bluetooth"

Ridiculous battery drain on Pixel XL after updating to Android 10,"Every since updating to Android 10 on my Pixel XL (the OG Pixel) I've experienced a ridiculous amount of battery drain.

Now I can see the battery dropping without doing anything.

I've done all the usual troubleshooting (factory reset, safe mode, setting all apps to auto update, etc.) but nothing has worked.

Doesn't seem to matter if one of those two connection types is on or off on the phone, nor does it matter how strong the signal is reported by the phone.

It can happen in many apps but what usually happens is when I try to get some sort of data to the phone, without warning, whatever app it is just spends a long time trying to get the data it needs. In other words, YouTube videos will never start or move forward when this happens.
When I open the MLB app, I can't even get the news page (which is basically a list of headlines). Or, maybe I have that app open and I read a couple of articles then tap to go listen to a game. Suddenly, the list of available audio feeds just doesn't load.
If I look at the Google News feed to the left of my main home screen, it's a crap shoot whether or not any article I tap on will actually load. Note: I am clicking on articles from major sites, not the clickbait, algorithm whores. The same can happen if I use the search bar Maybe results come up, maybe they don't and the process bar just stops at maybe  25% loaded.

You get the idea, but the worst example I can think of was from this weekend when I couldn't find my phone anywhere. I did the Where's My Phone stuff in Google from my laptop and although I got multiple rings before going to voicemail when I called from another phone (indicating it was turned on and ringing somewhere), Google could not connect to the phone to geolocate it for several tries. It also took a few tries to get actually get it to ring it constantly for five minutes. 

Currently, I can't open Messages.Android.com/web on my laptop because it wants me to connect my phone to a network. But it is on a network, both wifi and LTE. I am sitting here at my kitchen table in the middle of Seattle. I have a strong signal.

Any suggestions are welcome. Thanks!","Connectivity, Network, Bluetooth"

Pixel wired earbuds wont work on lock screen,"update***  I even tried just doing away with a lock screen and set it so I dont have a pin and the pixel wired headset still doesn't call the google assistant when the screen is displaying the clock.  I long press the middle button and nothing happens. If I take the phone out of my pocket swipe up so my phone is on then I can long press and the assistant appears.   I give up. If anyone knows of a phone and a wired headset that can just send a text while the phone is locked or the screen is off please let me know. I'm done with the pixels.  I ride a bicycle and this is pretty much the only thing I use a phone for.  I don't need to deal with pulling my bicycle off to the side every time someone sends me a text just so I can respond. 

My assistant doesn't work on the lock screen. I am using the forums to walk through a solution but every ""community expert's"" advice is wrong.  The people who reply actually use the correct steps which is very helpful. This is so frustrating it reminds me of when I used to own an iphone and wanted to change one little thing and had to spend hours only to hit a dead end bc they lock everything down which was the reason I switched to android.  The ironic thing is when I used the iphone assistant to text it was amazing and worked 100% of the time with no lag.  Here I am with pixel 3 and a pixel 4a and can no longer use a simple feature like that.  All I want to do is click my middle WIRED headset button so the google assistant appears and I can say ""text so and so"".  
 Have you confirmed that the ""Allow responses while phone is locked"" option is enabled? You can find this at Settings > Apps & notifications > Assistant > See all Assistant settings > Assistant (tab) > Pixel USB-C earbuds > Allow responses while phone is locked.
 I found this in one of the forums but when I go to settings, apps, assistant, see all assistant settings then there is NO assistant (tab) there is a long list of every single option except assistant tab. I just need to find where I can click allow responses while phone is locked for Pixel USB C earbuds because I have followed the other 97 steps just so I can try to send a hands free voice text while my phone is locked. This is ridiculous.  I have already clicked turned on locked screen personal results and I have already turned on allow wired headset request with device locked and the button to call google assistant still doesnt work on lockscreen. It immediately works if I take the phone out of my pocket unlock the phone and then press it but by then what is the use of having a button to call google assistant if I have to go through all of the steps manually on the phone anyway.  
 
Here is what I see when I follow the instructions above.

Pixel 5 won't connect to Laptop via USB,"So as above, my Pixel 5 wont connect to my laptop with a USB cable.

Now, my laptop doesn't have USB C ports, so I used a USB A to USB C cable.
The cable I used works for data transfer for all my other android phones, but not the Pixel 5.

I searched the internet for solutions and not one worked.

So I contacted Google Support and after a couple of hours of chatting, they said they'd replace it under warranty.
That device arrived today and guess what...

August SmartLock Bluetooth Connectivity,"I am having connection issues with the Pixel 4 XL and the August WiFi SmartLock (4th gen). This lock uses both WiFI and Bluetooth to detect your proximity to home for the ""auto unlock"" feature.

August support just offers their standard suggestions to clear the app cache/memory, switch BT off/on, restart the phone, power cycle and recalibrate the lock. This sometimes works for a while and then the BT connectivity begins to fail again.

There must be others with Pixel 4 and August Smartlock. Has anyone else had this problem and found a solution?","Connectivity, Network, Bluetooth"

Pixel 3 Home App very slow to respond to button press,"I have several Hue lights, some Wemo switches, Harmony hub, Nest thermostat.  When trying to control the devices directly through the Home App on my Pixel 3, it may take 2-3 minutes to turn a light on.  Voice commands work instantly, as do the individual apps (Hue, Wemo, etc.).  Only when pushing the ""ON"" or ""OFF"" button from the Home App do I see this delay.  

For instance, I can say ""Turn on my dining room lights"", and they will come on instantly.  I can turn them on instantly from the Hue app.  But if I go to Dining Room in the Home App and just press ""ON"", I can set the phone down and go about my business, and the lights may come on several minutes later.

Yesterday reset the phone.  I only put back on the apps necessary to to control the devices.  Same issue.  Any thoughts on where this delay may be coming from, and why it only seems to affect the Home app?

Pixel 3 Notification sounds not obeying silent and vibrate rules,"Hi all,

I bought a Pixel 3 about a week ago after having a Nexus 5x for years. The device is up to date with security patches and Android version.
The issue I'm having at the moment is that when I activate the ""vibrate"" shortcut it will silence the ringtone and set it to vibrate but notifications still play at full volume. The only way I've found to silence notifications is with Do Not Disturb mode.
I've looked pretty exhaustively through the settings menu's and think this might be a glitch as when I have the phone on vibrate mode and attempt to change the default notification sound the notification sound won't play (clearly attempting to respect volume settings) but when a notification comes through normally it plays at full volume. This leads me to think there is some decoupling of the actual call to play a notification from the sound settings at any given time.
I've searched around and can't find any threads with a similar issue so I'm not sure if this is a glitch or whether this is just some specific settings I've toggled accidentally.
Any help would be much appreciated.",Setting up and Personalizing your Device

Why would my WIFI and Mobile data stop working at the same time?,"I have already discussed this with a Google tech specialist, and we ended up trying all the usual troubleshooting steps including rebooting it into safe mode, trying the SIM card in another phone (it worked), resetting network settings, and, finally, a factory reset.  I  now have an appointment for a phone repair, but I just wanted to see if anyone knows what this could be and if I could get it running sooner.  

I was texting my Dad when my messages randomly stopped sending.  I noticed that my wifi was turned off, and it said ""no SIM card"" under the mobile data option.  When I tried to turn WIFI back on, the toggle switch turned to the on position, but the wifi remained off.  It did not show any networks, and when I left settings and came back, the toggle switch was flipped off again.  Here's the really weird part: I went to a restaurant, and my phone displayed the song name on my lock screen (while claiming it has no network connection of any kind).  Surely Google has not downloaded a complete neural net of every song in existence to my phone: this feature must require network connectivity of some sort. 

My first instinct is to think this is a software problem, but I did a factory reset... twice, so I think we can rule that out.  Next, I wonder about a hardware issue, but I would assume the WIFI antenna and the mobile data antennas are two different parts, so what is the chance they both break at the same time?  This leads me back to thinking it is a software issue.  Could it be possible that somebody installed a virus on an app I downloaded that is able to protect itself from a factory reset (or maybe hacked into my phone through other means)?  Can anyone think of any other explanations/troubleshooting tips?","Connectivity, Network, Bluetooth"

"Maps PIP, when using 2-button nav doesn't work with direct app changes","So I have this dilema: I prefer 3-button nav, but with the recent Android 11 decision to remove frequently used app suggestions I had to change to 2-button nav. The big problem is that I use Google Maps Picture-In-Picture (PIP) daily and for hours, but when I switch to another app PIP does not automatically happen like it does when I use 3-button nav. I am forced to press home button to get to the home (secondary or tertiary) screen, in which PIP occurs then I an switch to a different app to keep PIP. I frequently forget to go to the home screen as I'm used to quickly switching between apps. Is there some setting that allows for PIP to always automatically happen when I leave the maps app?

With 3 button I can: Select navigation in Maps, tap recents button and PIP pops up, then swipe to another app (since I can't select a frequently used app in the bottom 5 row that used to exist and was poorly removed), PIP stays throughout.
With 2 button I have to: Select navigation in Maps, tap home button and PIP pops up, gesture swipe up to access frequently used apps, then select an app.
The extra step is very inconvenient.

This may all be moot though since Pixel 5 has a decreased chipset and I'm now eying Oneplus and may go back to Nova launcher.",Setting up and Personalizing your Device

About LTE Band supported by Pixel 3,"Question:
I would like to know, does Pixel 3 (bought from Google Store Japan) support TD-LTE Band 39?

Description:
I know Pixel 3 was not published in mainland China, but since I am a fan of Google product, I bought one from Google store when I was in Japan, and brought it back to China. However, my carrier, CMCC, is using TD-LTE Band 39 mainly for the LTE network coverage. Unfortunately, it seems that Pixel 3 does not support Band 39 ---- I have never seen it using Band 39, hence the signal/data link sucks!
So, does Pixel bought from Japan REALLY support TD-LTE Band 39? And... if the answer is NO, is there any solution to make it support Band 39?

Android 10 update on Pixel 2 XL breaks WiFi,"UPDATE 12/18/19:
Might have a workaround for us. Reset your network settings, reboot in safe mode (power off, power on, hold volume down button), open wifi and I attached to an older 2.4ghz only router. It still said ""no internet"" but I set the advanced settings MAC to my phone's MAC, and that didn't immediately work, but I then changed it to an ""unmetered"" network setting and boom....full network activity.  This has survived 2 reboots so far.

UPDATE 12/15/19:
Issue has returned after the ""Phone"" app was updated on 12/15/19.  No wifi's work...2.4ghz, 5ghz, nothing. And I'm actually connecting to a google fiber box. Reset network settings, reboot phone, reboot router....nothing. I need wifi to work or this fails to be a useful device in my life!
Google Engineering.....please fix this....quickly.



Android 10 update on Pixel 2 XL caused a WiFi issue where all wifi networks report ""Connected, no internet access.""

Tried to connect in Safe Mode to eliminate apps and antivirus (NOD32 ESET) from being a culprit...no change. I'm on Google Fiber with a google fiber router and I wondered if that had something to do with it. Reset router twice. Rebooted phone multiple times. Wiped network settings and restarted.  Tried an alternate router (but same WAN). Set MAC to fixed device mode. Toggled airplane mode on and off. Flushed DNS.

Resolution:  Factory Reset  :(

Further discussion: I am wondering if ESET had something to do with it as it had no permissions for device location and was flagging all my home networks as an ""open"" or ""public"" wifi hotspot. This error occurred immediately after update to Android 10, and after factory wipe. Changing location permission to allow fixed it. Consider uninstalling it BEFORE updating the OS....","Connectivity, Network, Bluetooth"

BATTERY BULGING AND MULTIPLE ISSUES WITH GOOGLE PIXEL 3XL,"Hello,

I'm a Pixel 3XL user! Purchased it one and half years ago IN NOVEMBER 2018 & I'm constantly facing problems. Previously, even before the device completed one year of purchase, the device showed a display pixelation issue along with a battery issue. This issue was before even one year of purchase. I sent the device to Mumbai(B2X; google authorized service). They repaired it, replaced the battery and display and sent the device back. Within another 3 days of repair, the display pixelation issue started again, not as intense as the previous issue, but slightly. I contacted the customer service people again, and I didnt get a prompt response from them. Note that this was within a few days of repair. 

And now, it has not even been one year after repair and replacement of the battery, the battery has started BULGING! Ive been facing constant problems after purchasing this phone.  I am facing the headache of always contacting the customer care and always facing some issue or the other. The device truly has some issue. The customer support is truly useless, with no proper support. How can I escalate this issue to higher authorities and how can I get this done. How can I even approach for a replacement of the device since I faced problems often. Please help.

Pixel 3 Assistant voice issues since update to Android 10,"TL;DR: Spoken notifications using USB-C headphones on Pixel 3 are using an otherwise unseen robotic assistant and Assistant voice is not changing when switched in settings.

Since I have updated to Android 10, I have had continuous issues with the Assistant voices. I used to have the voice set to Sydney Harbour, which worked on my phone but not on my Google Home (I was okay with this). Since the update, my phone has been set to the default voice (Red?) and my Google Home has been set to Sydney Harbour. As much as I want to find a solution to this, I am fine with bearing with this as it is still pleasant to listen to and is probably a bug of Android 10.

However when having using spoken notifications on my USB-C earphones with the Pixel 3, the voice used is a horrible, almost robotic sounding voice that only seems to come through the earphones and does not appear anywhere else. This voice is not selectable on the voice selection screen in settings. Is anyone else having this issue and are they aware of a solution to this? I have trawled the settings for Assistant and Voice and spoken notifications but I have not been able to find a solution.

I have also tried a different pair of the same earphones, no change.

Echo during calls. Эхо при разговоре. Співрозмовник чує ехо.,"Echo problem on my Google  Pixel  3 XL 128gb imei 990012011057590.

When calling people, sound quality on my end is fine but the quality on the receiver's end is hearing echo. It disappears after 30 sec when speaking with Phone app. It also works with Signal call, Signal video call, Viber call. And it is least annoying  for my receiver when I down the volume of the call.

I tried -
1. Change sim card
2. Check for latest updates apps and android
3. Take off any cases
4. Turn off Bluetooth
5. Reboot into Safe Mode
6. Factory reset
7. Updating Android with a help of ADB and USB cable and flashed A and B slots. So unlock and then lock bootloader.
8. Tried different aps which tested hardware and no problems find.
9. Changed LTE to H+ also in Ukraine ower operators doesn't have VoLTE so any manipulation with it will not work too.

12. *#*#4636#*#* and change protocols

Nothing help.

When i close down mic and speaker more echoing on another side(receiver side). So i speak a little time with rear mic out of face and then 30 sec later use as normal. I think it is issue with software. Because hardware checked and it is alright.

My mother using Pixel 2 XL and she is very happy, no problems with it. I bought my (new) month ago and have this issue through the box. I like everything of this Pixel  3XL but this thing is killing it as phone  so  not working as actual telephone. It has call quality issues.

I live in Ukraine so i cannot send phone to google to change it or repair. Our repairing masters dont know what issue.

I like this phone very much and believe that Google will do something with new Android 12. I think also can do app that will turn off(with myself programally) some of the speakers or mic when calling. I think it can help too. Find out what speaker or mic has issue and turn it off in Phone app with a help of another app. So maybe create something this. You have this app(button https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_rRFsZCAFk  4. Locate and go into the ""Developer Options"" menu [01:40] 5.

We need to turn off only one and the problem will solve i think. Need a fix for echo during calls!!! This phone are too good for this little bag.



Проблема с эхом на моем  Goggle Pixel 3 XL 128gb imei 990012011057590.

Когда я звоню людям, качество звука на моем конце хорошее, но качество звука на стороне получателя слышно эхо. Оно исчезает через 30 секунд при разговоре с приложением ""Телефон"". Проблема также есть с Signal вызовом, Signal видеозвонком, вызовом Viber.

И меньше всего раздражает моего  получателя, когда я уменьшаю громкость разговора.

Я старался -
1. Поменять сим-карту
2. Проверял последние обновления приложений и Android.
3. Снимите все кейсы.
4. Выключал Bluetooth.
5. Загружал в безопасном режиме.
6. Восстановление заводских настроек
7. Обновление Android с помощью ADB и USB кабеля и прошитых слотов A и B. Так что разблокируйте, а затем заблокируйте загрузчик.
8. Пробовал разные приложения, проверял оборудование(железо) и никаких проблем не обнаружил.
9. Сменили LTE на H +. Также в Украине у других операторов нет VoLTE, поэтому никакие манипуляции с ним тоже не работают.
10. Телефон не ронял.
11. Проверил и прочитал все сообщения -

Ничего не помогло.

Когда я закрываю нижний микрофон и динамик, на другой стороне (стороне собеседника) большое эха. Так что я немного говорю с отодвинутым микрофоном, а затем через 30 секунд использую как обычно(держу ровно). Думаю, проблема в программном обеспечении. Потому что оборудование проверено, и все в порядке.

Моя мама использует Pixel 2 XL, и она очень довольна, никаких проблем с этим. Я купил свой (новый) месяц назад, и у меня проблема с коробкой. Мне нравится все в этом Pixel 3XL, но эта штука убивает его как телефон, поэтому он не работает как настоящий телефон. У него проблемы с качеством звонка.

Я живу в Украине потому выслать на ремонт или замену телефона нет возможности. Местные мастера не знаю причин этого бага.

Мне очень нравится этот телефон, и я верю, что Google что-то сделает с новым Android 12. Я думаю, что также может сделать приложение, которое отключит (программно) некоторые динамики или микрофон при звонке. Думаю, это тоже может помочь. Узнать, с каким динамиком или микрофоном возникла проблема, и отключить их в приложении ""Телефон"" с помощью другого приложения. Так что, возможно, создадим что-нибудь это.

Android 10 Time/Date/Notifications always showing on lock screen; Screen won't turn completely off,"I just updated to Android 10 OTA yesterday on my Pixel 2XL 128gb.

There used to be a setting to turn this off and on but I can't find it in the Android 10 settings (don't remember what it was called). I'm afraid that my battery will drain a lot faster with the screen always displaying this information without ever going to sleep. I did notice that if I hold my hand over the top of the phone where the sensors are, the screen will completely turn off/go to sleep but then when I remove my hand it pops right back on again. It seems to have something to do with it sensing light/darkness. Any others having this issue or know what the setting is called in Android 10 to change this?

Pixel 3 with Pixel Stand charging very slowly since December update,"Since the December update, I've noticed the battery on my Pixel 3 is often running low.  Prior to the December update, and certainly prior to Android 10, charging on the Pixel Stand was quite quick, but it's not now.  Right now, it says ""30% - Charging wirelessly (8 hours until full)""

In the past when experiencing problems, others have solved it by unplugging the power from the Pixel Stand, which I've tried, or clearing the cache on the Pixel Stand App.  This app is no longer available, so I'm not sure if it's possible to clear its cache.  It seems since Android 10 the Pixel Stand app has been integrated into the OS.

I did notice a couple of days ago it seemingly randomly asked me to verify the stand, I clicked Verify and seemingly nothing happened... I think that happened twice or three times.

Have tried removing the Pixel Stand from the Connected Device list, which caused it to go through its setup questionnaire again, which interestingly did not include the question about verifying, but seemed OK.  But the problem remaining.

Pixel 2 Rear Camera Autofocus Issues then Stopped Working; Selfie Camera Still Fine,"Hi, I have a Pixel 2 that is almost two years old.

This week the rear camera began having autofocus issues. The focus looked like it was stuck in macro mode. It'd focus on extremely close objects but not close to distant objects. When shooting video, the camera would go in and out of focus. Closing and reopening the app solved the focus issues.

Last night, launching the camera app stopped working altogether. Clicking the camera icon results in the app launching then immediately dying. Sometimes there's an error message, sometimes there's a request for feedback, but most of the time the app just silently dies.

If I hold down the camera app icon and select take a selfie, the camera app usually launches and works. this leads me to believe that whatever is happening is limited to the rear camera.

Sometimes if I force stop the camera app then open it up a bunch of times (four to ten), the rear camera will start working perfectly again. The next time I go to use the rear camera though, the app starts the crashing again.

Camera app version is 6.2.030.244457635. I tried clearing cache, clearing storage, safe mode, everything short of a factory reset with no success.

Setting ringer/notification volume with volume keys,"The only thing that I'm struggling with on my Pixel 5 is the ability to change the ringer/notifications using the volume keys.  I don't like that it defaults to the media settings and adjusts that instead by default.  I was going to set a rule as well as a possible solution, but you can't set it as a schedule, just based on Wifi or location.  Well, with Covid it's better for me to set a schedule to change the setting instead of using those options.

Any idea on how to make it simpler to change the ringer/notifications other than having to open the settings menu twice a day?",Setting up and Personalizing your Device

Why has a OS or phone app now rendered my entire phone useless when calling people?,"Since the March2020 OS update and recent phone app update whenever I make a call - which includes answering a call, or clicking on a contact's number to call - as soon as I hit the answer button or the contact's number the screen goes black and the entire phone is useless.  Fingerprint doesn't wake it.  Power button does nothing.  Tapping the screen doesn't wake the phone either.  I can't end a call, I can't access the keyboard to entire in numbers for call centre menus, I can't swap to speaker, I can't put a call on hold, I can't mute, I can't even turn the volume up or down.

I haven't even put the phone to my ear to set off the proximity sensor so its not that.  I have no case or screen protector and my phone is always clean.  The phone sits face-up on my desk and when I answer it, BLACK. the only time it doesn't do it is when I have the stock pixel headset that comes with the phone plugged in.  When I answer or make a call with a bluetooth speaker or in car, or other type of headset it's the exact same issue.  Only the stock pixel headset will stop the screen from going black.

I have factory reset the phone, I have reinstalled the latest OS, I have ensured everything is update, I removed every non-stock app to see if it was a third party app playing havoc with the sensor.  None of that has fixed the issue.  Something is clearly wrong in the updates or the actual phone app itself.","Contacts, Calls, Voicemail"

"Phone loses data connection, is fixed by toggling airplane mode","    My issue: With increasing frequency I will lose my data connection while I'm using lyft/uber drivers apps(it might happen if I don't use them but that's honestly the only time I'm not at home on wifi so I wouldn't notice) which of course makes these apps not work making it very difficult and annoying to do my job. it's been happening about a week and tonight it started happening very often up to every 30 minutes. When it first started happening it would show the little x on my signal strength indicating I had no signal but now it gives no indications-- apps just stop working until I toggle airplane mode. When I do toggle airplane it fixes the connection instantly but it often takes a while to notice my phone has stopped working which causes many issues in my job.

Good info for others below..

No, there is absolutely no way to unlock the phone without knowing the correct pattern (or, in your case, the pattern that your device randomly changed to). 
 The ONLY way is to perform a Factory Data Reset, but this will result in a loss of the data. You have said that you do not want to lose data, so that is not a solution for you.
 Anyway, even if you did decide you need to Factory Reset without knowing the pattern, you would need to know the password of your Google Account in order to get back into the device (for theft security purposes).",Setting up and Personalizing your Device

Anyone else experiencing Bluetooth issues on Pixel XL after Android 10 update?,"After the Android 10 update my Pixel XL has intermittent Bluetooth issues.

I am not able to set up or use my Google Pixel 3 XL whatsoever.,"I recently purchased a Google Pixel 3 XL phone as I needed a newer version of the Android operating system to use the applications required for my job. I was astonished when I realized that I was not even capable of setting up the device. I feel the need to mention that I am not able to use cellular data on this device as it does not have a SIM card in it (I primarily use WI-FI as a substitute for cellular data). I was able to skip the activation portion of the phone's set-up sequence, however, as I was configuring the phone, a message popped up saying that bluetooth was not functioning properly. I ignore it, and moved on to the next step. It asked me for a WI-FI network because I could not use cellular data, but none of them were appearing. It's telling me that there are no WI-FI hotspots in my location, and that both my IP address as well as my MAC address are unavailable. I hope you see my predicament here. I can't use cellular data because I have no service or SIM card & I can't use WI-FI because no networks are appearing. I was told that this was due to my router being misconfigured, but that's literally impossible considering I have 12 other devices that are running perfectly & are connected to it as we speak. It also doesn't make sense that it wouldn't show any of my neighbors' networks if it was truly just mine that was affected. I have spent hours on the community forums & help guides written by Google to no avail. I have tried going into ""safe mode,"" I have tried wiping all data from the device & factory resetting it, and nothing works. I even had an actual Google customer service employee try to tell me that I needed to update my device's operating system... Let me ask you this, genius, how can you expect me to update my device using WI-FI when the whole reason I contacted you was because I couldn't connect to it on said device in the first place? It seems to me that the combination of narcissistic deception & a general lack of common sense has plagued customer support. To make matters worse, I have found dozens of people complaining about issues very similar to mine, yet they have not received any assistance in over a year.

Pixel 4 - Camera: 30 fps video has more detail than 60 fps,"I have Pixel 2 and Pixel 4. Both devices have similar issue.  I am working with 1080p.

When selecting 30 FPS to shoot a video, the quality is better than selecting 60 FPS.  The 30 fps file has better overall detail(look at texture for example).  I took few sample videos with 30 and 60 fps and they came out with consistent results. The 60 fps does have better frame rate but lacks in quality/details of the content being shot.  I have checked file details and 60 fps file shows better bit rate which is about 6K+ more than 30 fps.  This is not isolated to my devices or the lack of app/system updates.

I am personally forced to select 30 fps because of the above.  The issue is present since owning Pixel 2 and I thought Google did something to make 60 fps as the name implies.
